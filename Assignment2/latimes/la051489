<P>
AMERICA'S EMPIRE IN THE PHILIPPINES BY STANLEY KARNOW (RANDOM HOUSE: $24.95; 
494 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-394-54975-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dean Wylie, Wylie, an assistant editor of The Times' Opinion section, was a 
Peace Corps volunteer in the Philippines. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1899, as American troops fought to conquer the Philippines, President 
William McKinley told a friend: "If old Dewey had just sailed away when he 
smashed that Spanish fleet, what a lot of trouble he would have saved us." 
</P>
<P>
Ninety years later, as Stanley Karnow makes abundantly clear in this compelling 
account, America is still hostage to the place where its imperial adventure 
began. "History is often a series of expedients that grow into dogmas -- 
today's pragmatism becoming tomorrow's doctrines; thus the American presence in 
Asia evolved," from the Philippines to China to Korea to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Karnow, a veteran reporter on Asia (his admirable "Vietnam: A History," was 
companion to a PBS television series, as was "In Our Image," starting May 8 on 
KCET and other stations), traces foreign involvement in the Philippines from 
the time of Ferdinand Magellan's ill-fated 16th-Century journey to the islands 
to Ferdinand Marcos' U.S.-aided escape from them three years ago, and the rise 
of Corazon Aquino. On the whole, it is a well-told but not encouraging tale. 
</P>
<P>
America's efforts to instill its values and institutions in a disparate place 
was "spurred by a belief still ingrained in Americans," Karnow observes. But 
the idea that the United States can remold other lands in its own image "proved 
in later years to be largely an exercise in self-deception." 
</P>
<P>
The first U.S. civilian governor of the Philippines, William Howard Taft (all 
325 pounds of him -- among the book's plates is a classic shot of the massive 
Taft astride a carabao), talked about "little brown brothers" in his hopes of 
Americanizing the natives. This was just after a brutal war in which U.S. 
troops killed more than 20,000 Filipinos while losing 4,234 of their own (more 
than 200,000 civilians may have perished from the war and its effects) as Spain 
was relieved of its colonial possession. 
</P>
<P>
Taft was the first in a string of benevolent American administrators, and the 
United States was indeed an uncommon colonial master, moving quickly to bring 
Filipinos into governing ranks and promising, in 1916, sovereignty and eventual 
independence. U.S. troops spread through the islands, opening the first public 
schools; the soldiers were followed by waves of American civilian teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But while the Filipinos proved adept at learning English and adopting American 
fashions, they retained their cultural roots, with basic loyalties to kith and 
kin, not people and nation. Taft in private railed against Filipinos' "Oriental 
duplicity," failing to see what is true to this day: that authority in America, 
as Karnow observes, reposes on impersonal institutions, while power in the 
Philippines revolves around the complex kinship networks of the compradrazgo 
(from compadre, or ritual relative) system. 
</P>
<P>
Benigno (Ninoy) Aquino Jr. once called the Philippine social structure "an 
entrenched plutocracy." Karnow makes clear that throughout the history of U.S. 
involvement with the Philippines, Americans have reinforced oligarchic rule. In 
the early years, ilustrados, or rich intelligentsia, were vested in power. 
After World War II took a terrible toll on the Philippines, Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur had a chance to do there what he later did in Japan by promoting 
liberal programs, including land reform and dismantling of monopolies. But he 
reinstalled his prewar friends of the old Philippine dynasties, "whose primary 
aim was to protect their vested interests." 
</P>
<P>
As for the war itself, Karnow's view concurs with others who trace the 
country's moral malaise to those desperate days: "The endemic venality and 
corruption that nags the Philippines today is largely a legacy of the ethical 
degradation of that period." 
</P>
<P>
When Karnow gets to the depredations of the Marcos years, his account is less 
full than Raymond Bonner's 1987 book, "Waltzing With a Dictator," but it is 
also more firsthand, drawing on his years of experience as an Asia 
correspondent and his friendship with Ninoy Aquino. Karnow speculates on what a 
Ninoy Aquino presidency might have been like (pointing out that Aquino and 
Marcos shared similar concepts), then addresses Filipino critics of his widow's 
performance in the job as showing "an Asian reverance for authority and a Latin 
penchant for hypercriticism." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line to Karnow's engaging, well-researched and amply documented 
work, however, is a feeling of pessimism about the future of this island 
nation, so appealing in many ways, in others so appalling. 
</P>
<P>
As counterpoint, Amando Doronila, former editor of the Manila Chronicle, wrote 
recently that "the standards of judgment are harsher on the Philippines. . . . 
Corruption is endemic in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and China, and yet the 
governments there are not in danger of being overthrown. . . . What is being 
ignored about the Philippines is that, despite the failure of the Aquino 
government to live up to extravagant expectations for change and reform . . . 
it has survived the elemental tests of political stability."

Public television has arranged to tape the Metropolitan Opera's new production 
of Wagner's complete "Der Ring des Nibelungen." A 1976 production of the "Ring" 
from the Bayreuth Festival was broadcast on PBS in 1983, but Met general 
manager Bruce Crawford says, "This is the first time in the history of U.S. 
television that an opera production of this magnitude -- 17 hours in all, a 
virtual 'opera miniseries' -- will be presented in prime time on four 
consecutive evenings." Air dates: June 18-21, 1990.

After seven successful years, NBC and the cast of "Family Ties" will part 
company as the final episode of the Emmy-winning series airs Sunday at 8 p.m. 
on Channels 4, 36 and 39. The show debuted Sept. 22, 1982; a photo from the 
early days is shown on the cover, along with a picture from later in the run. 
</P>
<P>
In the finale, titled "Alex Doesn't Live Here Anymore," Wall Street-bound Alex 
(Michael J. Fox) accepts a lucrative job with an investment banking firm, a 
decision that packs an emotional wallop for the rest of the Keatons. 
</P>
<P>
Originally scheduled for one hour, the final episode will be extended an extra 
10 minutes by NBC to include seven additional minutes of dialogue and three 
minutes of spontaneous farewells by cast (Meredith Baxter Birney, Michael 
Gross, et al.) and crew.

Please permit me to strongly reinforce David Boatman's comments. Kelly Lange 
would do well to eliminate her cutesy efforts to be sparkling with the Fritzie, 
Dougie, etc. Morrison would do better to wipe those grimaces off his face and 
drop the "doons and oots" to portray a more serious, knowledgeable anchorman.

Regarding David Boatman's complaint about the inane banter between Kelly Lange 
and Fritz Coleman and the others on the 6 p.m. news on KNBC, I have no 
objection to that innocent banter. However, I do object most strenuously to 
having a weatherman who wants to be a comedian and insists on interjecting 
comedy in his weather report. If Coleman wants to be a comedian, he should 
concentrate his efforts on being a comedian. If he wants to be a weather 
reporter, he should concentrate on being a weather reporter. But he should not 
try to be both at the same time. He should not be allowed to force his alleged 
comedic talents on the people who just want to hear the news and weather 
without the comedy.

This is in rebuttal to David Boatman of La Canada (Viewers' Views, April 23), 
who complained about the "inane banter" KNBC anchors Kelly Lange and Keith 
Morrison carry on with other reporters. My husband and I disagree with him. We 
thoroughly enjoy the friendship and rapport among those people, so much so that 
we switched from Channel 7 to Channel 4. We also could not stand to listen to 
Bill Press on Channel 7 any longer.

KEEPING MANSON BEHIND BARS; 
</P>
<P>
PROSECUTOR STEPHEN KAY STILL FIGHTS TO MAKE SURE THE EVIL OF THE TATE-LABIANCA 
MURDERS IS NEVER FORGOTTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN KASINDORF, Martin Kasindorf is Los Angeles correspondent for Newsday. 
A lawyer, he covered the trial of Charles Manson as a correspondent for 
Newsweek. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE MOST superfluous traffic sign in California is the one on the short spur 
road that winds along the bay front to the state penitentiary at San Quentin. 
The sign says "NOT A THROUGH STREET." 
</P>
<P>
On a February morning of record-low 32-degree chill, Stephen Kay, a tall, 
deaconish Los Angeles County deputy district attorney, drives past the sign and 
parks at the road's windswept end. A body search completed, Kay is escorted to 
a prison conference room. He has a few minutes to arrange his papers for the 
latest in nearly 20 years of confrontations with Charles Milles Manson, 
mastermind of the peculiarly unforgettable mass murders that badly rattled 
California in August of 1969. 
</P>
<P>
The morning's legal conflict promises to be one-sided. Manson, led from his 
single cell in San Quentin's Security Housing Unit, has waived his right to an 
attorney. He is long past trying to ingratiate himself with the three-man Board 
of Prison Terms panel that will decide whether to grant him a future parole 
date. Now 54, his flying beard going to gray, the 5-foot-2 life-termer has the 
shrunken, unkempt appearance of a Death Valley hermit, which is precisely what 
he has said he would like to be if ever released. 
</P>
<P>
Manson reaches the door behind which the hearing officers and Kay wait with two 
"pool" reporters and two television cameras. The Tate-LaBianca killings are 
still news. New American Library late this year is publishing an updated 
edition of Ed Sanders' 1972 book, "The Family: The Story of Charles Manson's 
Dune Buggy Attack Battalion." The proceedings are being wired to a guardroom 
where 25 reporters and TV news technicians hover, hoping Charlie will say 
something suitably Mephistophelean. 
</P>
<P>
He often does. At the Vacaville facility in 1981, Manson warned Kay that he 
would be killed in the parking lot after the hearing. At Manson's 1986 
evaluation, Kay asked why Manson spends hours in his cell constructing 
scorpions out of thread from his socks. Manson, the razor-sliced swastika in 
his forehead emphasized in blue-black ink, took the bait. "From the world of 
darkness I did loose demons and devils in the power of scorpions to torment," 
he announced. That unremorseful response was good, Kay triumphantly thought, 
for another three-year parole denial. He was right. 
</P>
<P>
This year, a moment before he is to enter the hearing room, Manson abruptly 
decides that he is having none of this legally mandated but manifestly futile 
ritual. His wrists are being clamped into manacles in the normal procedure when 
he protests, "They'll think I'm dangerous!" He refuses the restraints and 
demands to return to his cell. 
</P>
<P>
With Manson in absentia for the third time in his nine hearings, Stephen Kay, a 
22-year veteran at the D.A.'s office, begins his 38th argument against parole 
for the five people convicted of murdering Sharon Tate and the six other 
victims. Kay has been making these arguments for 11 years, ever since Manson, 
Susan (Sadie Mae Glutz) Atkins, Charles (Tex) Watson, Patricia (Katie) 
Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten first became eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
"The Tate-LaBianca case had all the good things and bad things of the '60s," 
says Ed Sanders, the Woodstock, N.Y., poet and author. "It had sex and murder, 
life styles, counterculture, Hollywood, rock 'n' roll stars like Dennis Wilson 
-- everything that makes for a circus. The trial was a combination of 
fascination and revulsion, like a snake with its tail in its mouth. It just 
kept rolling along, this revulsive snake. It's still rolling along." 
</P>
<P>
SHARON TATE WAS 26, a classically beautiful but not quite top-rank movie 
actress eight and a half months pregnant, when a dark-clad band on a mission 
from Manson invaded the Benedict Canyon estate she and her film-director 
husband, Roman Polanski, were renting. The ensuing predawn horror of Aug. 9 was 
not without its complex of motives -- a fusion of the Beatles, the Bible and 
plain old resentment. A previous tenant there, Terry Melcher, the 
record-producer son of actress Doris Day, had snubbed Manson and his musical 
ambitions a year earlier. Sharon Tate and four visitors to the secluded hilltop 
were slaughtered, as Atkins told a grand jury, "to instill fear into the 
Establishment." 
</P>
<P>
The following night, after the sensational celebrity murders failed to trigger 
the black-white race war Manson had prophesied from his dark reading of 
Revelations and the Beatles' "Helter Skelter" during long group LSD sessions, 
Manson himself entered the Los Feliz home of Leno LaBianca, owner of a small 
supermarket chain. He tied up LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, then left them 
to die at the hands of three demonic disciples, who carved away with knives and 
forks from the LaBianca kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent as some of the victims were, Manson immediately surpassed them in 
public interest. Kay recalls, "With his picture on the cover of Life magazine 
-- that stare -- Manson was like everybody's Freddy." Here was a man, 
prefiguring Jim Jones in the Guyana jungle, with the mysterious power to 
command others to kill for him, even to dispatch themselves to the gas chamber 
by taking all the blame at trial and attempting to exculpate the leader they 
sincerely regarded as both Jesus and the devil. 
</P>
<P>
Many mass- and serial-murder cases since then have involved greater numbers of 
deaths -- 24 in the case of Juan Corona, for example. What set the 
Tate-LaBianca murders apart and made them particularly frightening was that the 
killers included young women, mainly from peaceable middle-class backgrounds 
(Leslie Van Houten had been a Homecoming princess at Monrovia High School). 
"Better lock your doors and watch your own kids," Susan Atkins eerily warned 
the jury that convicted her. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the end of the '60s for a lot of people in L.A.," recalls Joan 
Didion, whose deal to write a book with star prosecution witness Linda Kasabian 
went awry. "It was a period when there seemed to be a lot of possibilities, 
good and bad. People were getting very nervous around that time. There was just 
a lot of stuff going on. Anything could happen. . . . I mean, it was 
everybody's nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
NOTORIOUS CASES may fade from the headlines, but they continue testing the 
legal system and its entanglements with politics for decades. Manson has 
effectively surrendered, but the others are fighting seriously for freedom, 
using skilled lawyers. For these convicts and Kay, all in middle age now, the 
combat over the evil of that distant summer has never really ended. 
</P>
<P>
Kay's side -- the mocked "straight" society perfectly embodied in Kay's 
conservative vested pinstripes and gold collar pin -- has won almost every 
time. The social rebellion of the '60s was carried to a horrible extreme in the 
depredations of Manson and his dropout "family" of acid habituees. The 
Tate-LaBianca carnage was, as Sanders says, "the death of hippie." Outraged 
middle-class values have reasserted themselves, quite literally with a 
vengeance, ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Juries in the nine-month 1970-71 trial of Manson and the three "Manson girls" 
and in Watson's separate trial asked for vengeance in condemning them to death 
for first-degree murder and conspiracy. In 1972, the California Supreme Court 
invalidated the existing capital punishment statute. By operation of law, the 
sentences were commuted to indeterminate terms ranging up to life. This has 
been the defendants' only victory. Since 1978, they have been eligible for 
parole. They remain in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The leading voice for unforgetting retribution has belonged to Stephen Kay, a 
nonsmoking, nondrinking, nonswearing Presbyterian church elder, youth soccer 
coach and father of three sports-minded suburban teen-agers. His role, largely 
self-appointed and not without criticism, has been to demand continuing 
punishment -- with little or no allowance for personal rehabilitation -- for 
those gunshots in the canyon, for the pagan smearing of PIGS and the illiterate 
HEALTER SKELTER on the walls of the wealthy in their own blood. 
</P>
<P>
If Kay continues to have his way, officials in a complex parole system that on 
occasion has been politically insensitive will think very carefully before 
letting any of the Tate-LaBianca murderers, however self-improved, out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
Kay says he handled "even more gruesome" murder cases in 14 years as a trial 
prosecutor, notably the 1980-81 trial of Lawrence Bittaker, who with a 
companion taped the prolonged torture of one of five teen-age girls they 
kidnaped. Kay considers Manson's murders worse, different in kind. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I'm on the tail of all these people and I won't let up on them," 
Kay explains, "is that they wanted to destroy society in a race war and have 
hundreds of thousands of innocent people murdered. Sure, it was unrealistic, 
but they tried to have it happen." 
</P>
<P>
Kay mistrusts the parole machinery and wants to keep a public spotlight on its 
workings. "I can see that the system has not worked perfectly," Kay says, 
"because Sirhan Sirhan was given a parole date." The assassin of Robert F. 
Kennedy was told in 1975 that he would be freed in 1984; a public outcry forced 
a rescission of parole in 1982. Other unpopular parole approvals prompted the 
passage of Proposition 89 last November, allowing the governor to overrule the 
Board of Prison Terms and revoke a parole date. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight Manson "family" members convicted in the nine murders that law 
enforcement was able to establish, only one, Steve (Clem Tufts) Grogan, has 
been paroled. Grogan, convicted in the killing of a cowboy named Donald 
(Shorty) Shea, has been quietly painting houses in the San Fernando Valley 
since 1985 after serving 13 years. He profited from showing the authorities 
where Shea's previously undiscovered remains were buried near the Spahn Ranch, 
Manson's dusty Chatsworth base. Kay had no part in the bartering. At the parole 
hearing, the board was influenced by a letter from Superior Judge Burton Katz, 
who had prosecuted the case and praised Grogan's later cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
AT SAN QUENTIN, a month before Manson is transferred to the new 
maximum-security Corcoran facility in the San Joaquin Valley, Kay's argument 
runs 27 minutes. He re-tells the old crimes in a painstaking detail that 
revives the months of widespread fear before the killers were identified 
through Atkins' euphoric blabbering to two Sybil Brand Institute cellmates. 
Atkins, Manson and 22 others coincidentally had been rounded up in mid-October 
at their Death Valley retreat and booked for unrelated arson and auto thefts. 
Atkins was placed in Sybil Brand as a suspect in the Malibu torture-murder of 
musician Gary Hinman a few days before the Tate-LaBianca slayings. "Wow, what a 
trip!" she blurted out to a fellow prisoner about tasting Sharon Tate's blood. 
After more investigation, Los Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis announced on Dec. 1 
that the case was solved. 
</P>
<P>
Kay's tone is subtly impatient, still unforgiving about the need to go through 
these statutory parole considerations. If, as some of his opponents suggest, 
Kay is simply seeking publicity, he would logically welcome these hearings. 
Instead, he was instrumental in lobbying for 1982 and 1983 legislation allowing 
the Board of Prison Terms to deny parole in multiple-murder cases on as much as 
a three-year basis, rather than hold annual appraisals. Tex Watson is arguing 
in federal appeals court that the loss of his annual evaluations is 
unconstitutionally ex post facto. If he prevails in a decision by Ninth Circuit 
justices expected later this year, all the defendants will get yearly 
consideration again. 
</P>
<P>
Kay tells the board that Manson has "a serious and severe personality 
disorder," although the prison psychologist's latest report maintained that 
Manson "is not psychotic and probably never was and never will be." After 
citing a string of prison disciplinary infractions to demonstrate the inmate's 
unfitness for freedom, Kay reaches his conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Manson remains locked in an Armageddon with society," he tells the somber 
commissioners, as if summing up to a jury hooked on TV courtroom drama. "It's a 
battle to the death. Society has a slim advantage now because we have Manson 
behind bars. Manson is probably the best advertisement that California ever had 
for the death penalty, because, frankly, as long as Mr. Manson is alive, he is 
a great danger." Minutes later, the board votes Manson another three-year 
denial. 
</P>
<P>
As Kay likes to point out in lectures around the state to explain why he keeps 
pushing when it seems implausible that Manson will ever be freed, Charlie does 
remain a role model of sorts to a fringe of satanists, neo-Nazis and skinheads, 
just as Adolf Hitler remains a hero for him. Manson gets a fair number of 
letters and gifts from young people who idolize him as the ultimate outsider. 
Heritage Entertainment, an independent movie production company, is trying to 
produce a not-unsympathetic movie based on his writings. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the prison gate during the hearing, two young San Francisco men in 
black paramilitary uniforms, accompanied by three women, carry signs supporting 
Manson. Afterward, they watch Kay commenting in satisfaction for the news 
microphones. They chant, "Stephen Kay, go back to L.A.!" 
</P>
<P>
KAY WASN'T always professionally identified with the case that Sanders expects 
will continue to horrify California "at least until the turn of the century." 
It was Vincent T. Bugliosi, the lead prosecutor, who got the glory surrounding 
the convictions. Bugliosi's 1974 book, "Helter Skelter," sold 6 million copies 
and spun off a highly rated 1976 CBS miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
Kay was a boyish 27, three years out of Berkeley's Boalt Hall Law School, when 
Bugliosi was keeping him and Donald Musich on short leashes as his muffled 
assistants in the long first trial, its singsong craziness one of the strangest 
courtroom spectacles grown from the '60s. Kay and Bugliosi were officially 
granted equal status at Watson's trial. Bugliosi left in 1972 to run 
unsuccessfully for district attorney and state attorney general, and to write 
more books. Kay chose a long-term career with the D.A.'s office. He is now paid 
$103,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
A conservative Republican, Kay once appeared interested in a judicial 
appointment by Gov. Deukmejian. Now he is unwilling to accept the pay cut, and 
he retains much of his original idealism, as well. Uncomfortable with the 
notion of defending criminals, Kay remained a prosecutor. He recalls telling 
himself early on, "I'm going to be doing something that my kids can look up to 
me for." 
</P>
<P>
Of all the figures in the story, only Kay has stayed with the Manson case -- 
unless, with some irony, one counts his elected boss since 1984, District 
Attorney Ira Reiner. As a private lawyer, Reiner lobbied Manson for a place on 
the high-profile defense team. Reiner represented Van Houten for eight early 
months but proved too independent-minded for Manson, who persuaded Van Houten 
to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
Kay went on to prosecute Bruce Davis, an accomplice of Manson and Grogan, to a 
life sentence for the Shea murder. Then he handled Leslie Van Houten's 1976 
retrial, ordered because her lawyer, Ronald Hughes, had disappeared during the 
first trial. (Hughes' remains were found months later in a mountain wilderness, 
and despite a lack of proof, Bugliosi believes the "family" killed him.) 
</P>
<P>
At the second Van Houten trial, Kay suffered an embarrassing setback: a hung 
jury, teetering toward accepting defense arguments that Van Houten was 
victimized by a mass delusion the psychiatrists called folie a famille (family 
madness). Reinforced by Dino Fulgoni, the office expert on the since-outlawed 
"diminished capacity" defense, Kay recovered with a 1978 third-trial guilty 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
All these years later, there is no love lost between Kay and Bugliosi. Kay's 
testimony bedeviled Bugliosi in inconclusive perjury proceedings against him 
arising from the mysterious leak of Atkins' lurid "celebrity death list" to 
reporter William Farr in some unnamed attorney's apparent violation of a 
judicial gag order; Farr spent 46 days in jail rather than reveal his source, 
which has never been disclosed (Farr died in 1987). Bugliosi misspelled Kay's 
first name "Steven" in "Helter Skelter," a slip Kay is still bitterly convinced 
was purposefully done "just to tweak me." Bugliosi's praise for Kay's 
continuing work is grudging. "He's accomplished something," the ex-prosecutor 
says. "That's his job. It's not an unusual job. It's visible because the case 
is so visible." But Tate-LaBianca fully belongs to Kay now. Always ready to 
make expert comments on the case, he sometimes borders on personalizing it in 
the way Inspector Javert personalized Jean Valjean's theft in "Les Miserables." 
</P>
<P>
When Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme aimed a pistol at President Ford in Sacramento in 
1975, Kay confidently told reporters that Manson had ordered the assault -- a 
theory never established. On Christmas Eve 1987, Fromme escaped from a federal 
prison in West Virginia. Notified within 90 minutes and fearing that Fromme was 
heading west specifically to kill him out of devotion to Manson, Kay got 
himself what he calls "added security" until the prattling little redheaded 
woman was caught near the prison two days later. 
</P>
<P>
SINCE AGREEING to leave his well-publicized "special trials" work in 1981, Kay 
has held a series of increasingly responsible administrative posts. For the 
past seven months he has been one of two assistant directors supervising 
personnel assignments and policy decisions for the department's branch offices 
in Van Nuys, Santa Monica, Torrance, Long Beach, Compton, Beverly Hills and 
Inglewood. He is not formally assigned to the parole hearings. With the tacit 
approval of higher-ups, he does it on his own. "It's nice to go in again," he 
acknowledges. "It reminds me that I miss being in court." 
</P>
<P>
He prepares for the sessions as if there were an imminent prospect of the 
concededly shattered Manson group reuniting for its predawn "creepy-crawl" 
missions. He collects damaging anecdotes about the defendants' conduct from 
prison guards and even other inmates. Lest new official faces be too young to 
remember the crimes, Kay maintains at his fingertips the facts about the deaths 
of Sharon Tate, Wojiciech (Voytek) Frykowski, Abigail Folger, Jay Sebring, 
Steven Parent and the LaBiancas, as well as Shorty Shea and Topanga musician 
Gary Hinman. 
</P>
<P>
Employing his practiced command of the details, Kay delights in contradicting 
the prisoners' sometimes self-serving latter-day accounts. In recent years, for 
example, Susan Atkins has taken to denying that she wielded a weapon. Kay goes 
back over the evidence showing that Atkins inflicted many of the 16 stab wounds 
in Tate's body, and stabbed Frykowski in the legs. The first hearing was 
Krenwinkel's in 1978. Kay says she blamed Watson and Atkins for the August 9 
Cielo Drive massacre, and she took umbrage when Kay testified that she had 
chased and struggled with Abigail Folger until Watson stabbed the victim, who 
was found with 28 wounds. "She swore at me, right in front of the board," he 
says. "Called me the F word and everything." 
</P>
<P>
In off hours, Kay would much rather boast of his 16-year-old son's soccer- team 
winning streak or his two younger daughters' test scores than bring up 
Tate-LaBianca. His reputation is anything but that of an obsessed, 
win-at-any-cost prosecutor. Kay's handling of a teen-age suspect named Michael 
Altenburger in the 25-fatality 1974 Stratford Apartments arson, one of the 
worst in the city's history, is still legend in the D.A.'s office. Three 
positive identifications and an initial confession supported the case against 
Altenburger, but Kay took it upon himself to spring the confused teen-ager from 
jail and drive him around the city on a six-hour reconstruction of his alibi 
that confirmed his innocence. Despite this storied fair-mindedness, Kay loses 
his compassion when asked about the Tate-LaBianca defendants. He cannot resist 
ridiculing them. 
</P>
<P>
"Susan looks the best," Kay says, smiling skeptically. "She comes all dolled up 
in her latest Bullock's fashions." He enjoys relating how the histrionic 
Atkins, who, like Watson, professes born-again Christianity, cried copiously 
before one hearing board, then left the room and snappishly berated a guard for 
not having her lunch ready. Watson, says Kay, is "like a used-car salesman." If 
Kay respects any of these convicts, it is Manson. "Manson's just himself," he 
says. "He has changed so little over the years. He's basically the same old 
Charlie." 
</P>
<P>
Kay is 46, but a squarely earnest moot-court manner and spare, 
distance-runner's physique combine for such a perennially youthful impression 
that some lawyers and supporters of the murderers patronizingly call him 
"Stevie." They mutter about excessive zeal in Kay's implacable volunteer 
crusade, even a desire for advancement in the rococo internal politics of the 
800-lawyer prosecutorial agency. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Kay's critics cite the fact that Kay has changed his mind in 
currently making no exception for Leslie Van Houten. Parole has seemed a real 
possibility only for Van Houten. She remains, for some, the most appealing of 
the defendants. She was 19 at the time of the killings, came from a wholesome, 
church-going background and was present on only the second night; her direct 
involvement consisted of stabbing Rosemary LaBianca after Krenwinkel may 
already have killed the woman. "Why are they keeping the little Van Houten girl 
in jail?" demands Gary Fleischman, Linda Kasabian's former lawyer. "She's more 
than paid her debt to society." 
</P>
<P>
One deputy parole commissioner, Loretta Collier, agrees. "Personally, Leslie 
Van Houten, I believe, should get a parole date," she says. "I think she got 
caught up in being a flower child, allowed herself to be carried along by the 
rest of them." Leslie, to be sure, is burdened by something she said during her 
first trial. Asked if she was sorry for her acts, she replied metallically, 
"Sorry is only a five-letter word." 
</P>
<P>
Now 39 and by most accounts a model prisoner at the California Institution for 
Women at Frontera, where she obtained a college degree in psychology and 
literature, Van Houten has some dedicated advocates. They are the most ardent 
in casting suspicion on Kay's motives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an attempt by him to grab the limelight," says Paul Fitzgerald, who 
represented Krenwinkel at trial and Van Houten at early parole hearings. "He's 
a loose cannon on a political ship in the D.A.'s office, and everybody's afraid 
to rein him in for fear he'll go over their head to the public." Van Houten's 
present lawyer, Dan Mrotek, thinks that Kay has a tendency to remind parole 
panels that there is a TV pool camera in Van Houten's hearing rooms, too. "He 
likes to play to the drama of the thing a little bit. It's the TV camera that 
makes the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Consistently underestimated by the Friends of Leslie support group, Kay has 
been trumping them in a long fight that he has smoothly escalated from the 
administrative arena of pine-paneled hearing rooms to the public forum of mass 
media appearances and nationwide petition drives. He has a sure sense of public 
relations and a willingness to employ it. 
</P>
<P>
Kay was momentarily shaken in 1982 when Friends of Leslie presented parole 
officials with 900 signatures urging Van Houten's release. Kay countered by 
enlisting Doris Tate, Sharon Tate's mother. With her husband, retired Army Col. 
Paul Tate, she lives only blocks down the street from the spotless view house 
Kay and his wife, Diane, a teacher, have owned since 1971 in an 
upper-middle-class neighborhood far from Kay's Criminal Courts Building office. 
Kay galvanized Mrs. Tate into collecting 352,000 signatures opposing parole for 
not only Van Houten but all of the Tate-LaBianca killers. 
</P>
<P>
The experience convinced Mrs. Tate to become active in a national group called 
Parents of Murdered Children. As a relative, taking advantage of the 1982 
"Victims' Bill of Rights," Mrs. Tate since has spoken effectively at parole 
hearings held for Atkins and Watson. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we precipitated Stevie Kay getting together with Mrs. Tate," Jerry 
Gumbleton, a Los Angeles Unified School District psychologist active in aiding 
Van Houten, says sadly. "It's hard to see how we facilitated or helped 
anything." Fitzgerald acknowledges, "It was Doris Tate who killed us." 
</P>
<P>
A release date was denied for Van Houten in 1982, then in 1985 (when one board 
member told her she was "closer than she might realize") and, again for the 
maximum three years, in 1987. "I'm ecstatic," Kay declared on that occasion. 
"If she gets out by the turn of the century, she'll be lucky." 
</P>
<P>
The board can deny a first-degree murderer a parole date simply by following 
Kay's lead and emphasizing the heinousness of the crime, a factor that can 
supersede a fairly rigid regulatory "matrix" of time served, good behavior and 
similar matters. "Based on the regulations as they exist," says Mrotek, 
"Leslie's term should be about 20 years. She has 19 in now. The crucial hearing 
will be the next one, in (July) 1990." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Kay publicly said he could envision parole for Van Houten when she 
turns 40 in August 1990. He now says that the proper time remains years off. 
"She has not shown the maturity that I thought she was going to show," he says. 
He mentions Van Houten's 1982 marriage to an ex-con named Bill Cywin, who soon 
afterward was caught in possession of a stolen uniform for a women's-prison 
guard. Leslie quickly divorced Cywin, but Kay was able to argue that the 
incident demonstrated a continuing tendency to "follow unstable males." 
</P>
<P>
Kay's monitoring has reached deep into the prisoners' daily lives to cause them 
trouble. Learning that Watson, who has married and fathered two children while 
incarcerated, was serving as assistant Protestant pastor at the California 
Men's Colony at San Luis Obispo -- with Bruce Davis as his own assistant -- Kay 
complained to the Department of Corrections that Watson was "building a 
personal power base." Watson is now fixing cars. 
</P>
<P>
In Sanders' opinion, Kay has his retributive rap down all too well. "He's so 
good at his re-creation of the murders," says Sanders, "that if a person became 
Mother Teresa and was in all respects a perfect person, that person would never 
be released from prison. I think it's important to allow for human change." 
</P>
<P>
CHARLES MANSON, born illegitimate in Cincinnati, was placed by an uncaring 
mother with a series of foster parents. By 1967, he had spent 19 of his 32 
years in penal institutions. On parole, Manson gravitated to San Francisco's 
pulsating Haight-Ashbury district. Through ready administration of LSD and a 
messianic message, he attracted a virtual harem of adoring women he called his 
"young loves," using offers of sex with them to draw males handy with guns and 
dune buggies. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Manson and his raggedy gang of 25 hard-core members and 60 
"associates," Stephen Kay has never experienced anything but mainstream 
stability. He came to California from Stamford, Conn., at age 2, the only child 
of Bud Kay, a television production executive, and Frances Kay, the now- 
retired society editor of The Daily News. (Kay wanted to write a book on the 
Bittaker trial with his mother, but unlike Bugliosi he dropped his book idea, 
claiming that publishers demanded too much gore.) 
</P>
<P>
Kay was 15 and attending Hollywood High when his mother and a friend of hers, 
the godmother of a 14-year-old San Diego girl named Sandra Good, squeezed the 
two kids together for a chaperoned lunch date at a Burbank pancake house. After 
30 minutes Stephen excused himself, considering this stockbroker's daughter "a 
stuck-up little snob." Twelve years later Sandy Good was wearing an X on her 
forehead and Kay was cross-examining her at the Manson trial -- during which, 
he says, she and Fromme cruised up on both sides of him and threatened "to do 
to your house what was done to Sharon Tate's house." 
</P>
<P>
Eighth in his class at Claremont Men's College, Kay finished in the top quarter 
at Boalt and signed on with the D.A. in 1967. Not originally assigned to the 
Manson trial, he read the start of Linda Kasabian's hair-raising 17 days of 
turncoat testimony when he was in a Northern California coffee shop on a 
vacation drive to Canada. Turning to Diane, he said, "Honey, I'm really glad I 
don't have anything to do with this can of worms." 
</P>
<P>
Then, District Attorney Evelle Younger kicked chief trial deputy Aaron Stovitz 
off the case for violating an order against news comments. Younger elevated 
Bugliosi to the lead chair and gave him two assistants. "Little did I know when 
I got back from vacation," says Kay, "that in 1989 I'd still be talking about 
this case." 
</P>
<P>
JOAN DIDION was appalled to hear the Beatles' "Piggies" over the p.a. system of 
a luxury New York department store a few months after Manson's arrest. 
Californians' images of the chilling case have been more enduring. "It captured 
everybody's imagination in our generation," says Krenwinkel's trial lawyer Paul 
Fitzgerald, now 51. "It remains vivid in the memories of everybody living in 
L.A. at the time -- people who were getting dogs and guns, terribly 
freakedout." 
</P>
<P>
Kay's old co-prosecutor, Donald Musich, who also remained a deputy D.A., shares 
Kay's worries that younger generations may be readier to parole the aging 
killers. "Average people do not believe there is the type of human being like 
Manson," says Musich. "As the years go by, they're not going to understand what 
went down with the acid rock of the '60s, when people traveled around by bus 
and lived with the dirt and group sex, and left a beautiful home and wealth." 
</P>
<P>
Some find it possible, in fact, to limit the significance of Tate-LaBianca to 
the tumultuous era of Woodstock and Altamont. "It was a type of case that I 
don't think we'll ever see again," says Musich, who thinks the "do your own 
thing" ethic went too far beyond the salutary civil disobedience of the time. 
"It was a culmination of social evils -- of the freedom and the attitude of the 
time of disrespect for society, of the laws, of law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Louis Jolyon West, director of the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute and an 
expert on cults and violence, largely blames a drug that is much less pervasive 
these days. "Of course," he says, "you can't close the book on the Manson 
phenomenon without saying something about LSD. We still don't understand its 
potency and its unpredictability." Manson, says West, "was one of many types of 
predators drawn to the essential defenselessness of these young and often 
idealistic people who were exceptionally vulnerable, anyway, and even more 
vulnerable because of their drug use." 
</P>
<P>
However, interpreting the Tate-LaBianca killings as a relic of their time is 
risky. Acid may have been replaced by crack, but cults go on. "It could happen 
again," West recognizes, defining the Manson group as a "totalist cult." The 
psychiatrist believes that the Symbionese Liberation Army was "perfectly 
capable of wiping out a houseful of people," and that society came close to 
recording another Jonestown at Rajneeshpuram, Oregon when the ashram community 
of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh collapsed in internecine intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
Manson's followers, says West, were enthralled by their leader's race-war 
delusions not only because of impairment by drugs but because of the group's 
twisted internal dynamics. And folie a famille, the clinically documented type 
of delusional thinking cited in Van Houten's trials, hardly disappeared with 
the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Kay shares the view that a Tate-LaBianca atrocity could happen again, but his 
reasoning differs. Still disagreeing that Manson's soldiers were infected with 
a dose of slavish obedience by one dominant man's bizarre philosophizing, Kay 
blames neither society nor the '60s in relying on his old courtroom argument 
for a conspiracy of equally hate-filled renegades. 
</P>
<P>
"The Manson clan," says Kay, "was a group of misfits that just came together 
kind of at the wrong place and the wrong time. I think they were an aberration. 
You had hippie communes and peace marchers, but you never had the violence and 
lust for murder that were demonstrated by Manson and the family." By this 
reading, since bad sorts get together all the time, keeping the Tate-LaBianca 
killers in prison serves as not only retribution for old crimes but deterrence 
to modern sociopathic gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Stern current attitudes notwithstanding, it is possible that more liberal state 
administrations will free some of the killers one day. Bugliosi is convinced 
that 10 to 20 years from now, the three women are reasonably certain to win 
parole "only because they are in the state of California. If you were in 
Arkansas or Texas, the question wouldn't even be asked." 
</P>
<P>
Doris Tate, comforted that parole is less likely if Steve Kay stays active as 
her champion, supports his position that compassion for these no longer 
youthful prisoners is misplaced. "When Sharon was begging for her life," she 
asks, "what compassion did Watson and Susan Atkins give to her? Sharon, with 
her big heart, would probably say, 'Turn them loose.' But a society has to keep 
a stringent hold on the judiciary these days." 
</P>
<P>
Strictly speaking, it's the executive branch that Kay watches. The most 
thoughtful of his adversaries grant him understandable motives and professional 
respect. Allen Jan, Tex Watson's experienced lawyer, says, "Sometimes Mr. Kay 
comes across as if he were a hatchetman because of what he has to say. On the 
other hand, because of the horrible nature of these crimes, what else is there 
to say? Mr. Kay is not willing to let these people's memories die."

SETTLING THE SCORE BY MICHAEL LEVIN (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $17.95; 239 PP.; 
0-671-66761-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark Swed, Swed is classical music critic for 7 Days in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Classical music is a business like no other. To become a performer, 
particularly an instrumentalist, requires first the sacrifice of youth -- a 
virtuoso must begin young, the younger the better, and then submerge childhood 
in dulling, daily hours of practice. 
</P>
<P>
Next comes the cutthroat competition. This happens at all stages of career 
building and career maintaining -- competing to get into the best conservatory, 
competing to get the best teacher, competing to get into the prestigious 
competitions so you can compete some more, competing for management, and then 
auditioning, auditioning and more auditioning. 
</P>
<P>
What are the rewards? Well, you can make a lot of money and become a celebrity, 
so that you can live the life of a Gypsy in airports, faceless hotels, concert 
halls and sterile recording studios. Or if you manage to land a coveted spot in 
a major orchestra, you can spend your life playing what the conductor tells you 
to play, the way he wants you to play it, all the while seething while someone 
else plays the Tchaikovsky concerto. 
</P>
<P>
Singers, conductors, composers, management types don't have to start quite so 
early, but usually they come out of the pool of musicians who do, and each of 
those areas of the classical music business has its hazards as well. Remember, 
there was a time when young boys underwent castration for their careers' sake. 
</P>
<P>
So, it is hardly surprising that musicians are sometimes eccentric, petty, 
immature or just plain nutty. And a very funny behind-the-classical-music-scene 
roman a clef could be written about the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Settling the Score," unfortunately, is not that book, as hard as it tries to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Levin's targets are conductors, orchestra members, singers, composers 
(Levin's sniveling descriptions of new music are appallingly foul-mouthed), 
managers, despicable music teachers, wives and lovers and mistresses of all of 
the above, stage-door guards. Have I left anyone out? Oh, yes, and Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
The premise of the novel is that the director of a New York chorus discovers a 
lost Mass by Mozart, which is about to have its premiere in Carnegie Hall. 
Mozart had supposedly written the Mass as a display piece for a lady oboist 
after whom he lusted. When she rejected his advances, the composer evidently 
withdrew his music. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows that Donald, our chorus director, is a great conductor because he 
suffers from stage fright, so the world premiere of the Mass is offered to a 
dashing conductor of something called the Royal Symphonic, a former college 
wrestler who happens to be a barely literate nincompoop married to the daughter 
of the Royal Symphonic's principal donor. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew, the conductor, seems principally interested in pretty women in the 
orchestra -- his wife is a frigid, ambitious dragon lady. He also is a 
political naif, as well as a musical one, and he has managed to enrage both the 
Palestinians and the Jews. And so the stage is set for the gala Mozart premiere 
and his American debut, a media event during which everything that can go wrong 
does. You can find out for yourself how he winds up on the podium and on 
national television wearing a torn mint-green tuxedo and sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
To parody the classical music world, however, one has to know it better than 
Levin appears to. From the first page, the novel demonstrates a very shaky 
grasp of music, of how it is made. For instance, Donald, the chorus master, 
asks, at the opening of the book, for his singers to begin two measures before 
the "Gloria" and then calls out, "Three and four and Gloria!" -- Levin thus 
confusing those two beats with two bars. A small detail, perhaps, not one that 
inspires confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Levin seems to have only the vaguest notions how an orchestra 
administration works -- the music director of the New York Philharmonic, or its 
"Settling the Score" equivalent, does not hire a chorus master; the general 
manager does not leave it up to his assistant to negotiate the fees of 
celebrated guest conductors, and on and on.

<P>
Certainly in a work of fiction and especially a parody, the author is free to 
invent however he likes for the sake of a laugh or to help the plot along. But 
Levin banks heavily on the intrigue of insider information -- the appeal of his 
previous novel, "The Socratic Method," was its behind-the-scenes look at Ivy 
League law school, something Levin, a law graduate, knows something about. 
</P>
<P>
Not so here. "Settling the Score," besides being inelegantly written, seems to 
want to settle some score against music; all about music and its business come 
out looking foolish. It is not a nice or a fair book or an amusing book, but 
rather a sour one.

A SEPARATE WAR; 
</P>
<P>
V FOR VICTOR BY MARK CHILDRESS (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $18.95; 289 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Douglas Unger, Unger's most recent novel is The Turkey War. He is an 
associate professor with the Creative Writing Program at Syracuse University.

<P>
It seems there are two kinds of novels about World War II. There are those 
books that attempt in fiction seriously to depict the war, its characters, its 
era, and to contribute to both literature and history. And there are other 
novels that merely use the war as a backdrop for a plotted story of intrigue 
and romance, exploiting what have too often become the "good" war's 
melodramatic ideologies of good and evil. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Childress' new book, "V for Victor," is just such a melodramatic story. 
World War II is used as a setting for an unlikely plot, the intent of which 
seems to be to spin an intricate mystery combined with a young man's struggles 
to come of age. 
</P>
<P>
The main character, Victor, is a boy of 16, living temporarily on a remote 
island in the mouth of the Magnolia River that spills into Alabama's Mobile 
Bay. He is there to accompany his grandmother, who has returned to the family's 
impoverished, backwater home to spend her last days. Victor's older brother, 
Joseph, is off at the front and considered by all to be a hero, overshadowing 
Victor's sense of himself. Perhaps because of this, and the isolation of the 
island and his grandmother's illness, Victor is filled with a strange 
combination of longing for the action of the war and a wish for his own death. 
"I wish we were both dead . . . ," he says to his grandmother as they listen to 
a heartbreaking, war-era song on the radio. "Who would care? Nobody." 
</P>
<P>
It is in this state of mind that Victor's improbable trajectory begins. He 
discovers a body washed ashore, and in so doing is bushwacked by another young 
boy, Butch, who guards illegal stills in the swamp. After an escape, Victor 
sets out across the bay in a small boat, looking to report the dead body to the 
law. He just happens to crash into a German submarine, sinks, and is 
miraculously saved by the local coast watcher, Roy Glass, who, as it turns out, 
is really an enemy agent disguised and passing himself off to everyone in this 
small-town Southern community as the coastal lawman. 
</P>
<P>
As though this weren't unbelievable enough, Victor is taken into the employ of 
a wealthy couple, Edgar Gilliam and his sinister, star actress wife, Constance 
Belair, as guide and boatboy on their luxurious yacht. There is a beautiful 
daughter involved, who provides this contrived story with a sexual interest. 
The backwoods still guard, Butch, somehow becomes Victor's friend and helper in 
unraveling the U-boat mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"V for Victor" is a story full of red herrings, double-agents, murder, unlikely 
confrontations and escapes. In one incident that not only asks of the reader a 
tough suspension of disbelief but an irritating battle against sheer 
incredulity, while pursuing the German U-boat in the luxury yacht, Victor and 
company watch a tanker sunk by torpedoes in Mobile Bay and, coincidentally, 
brother Joseph just happens to be pulled out of the burning wreckage. It turns 
out that he has deserted the Army overseas and has been working his way home on 
merchant ships. The crisis of youthful hero worship that Victor then must face 
is resolved in cliched B-movie fashion, with chase scenes, chance meetings, and 
a climactic fiery explosion. 
</P>
<P>
H. G. Wells once wrote a simple maxim about fiction -- "If nothing is 
believable, then nothing will be believed." That is almost the case with 
Childress' second novel. Anachronisms of language and historical 
impossibilities about the war abound through this story; so, too, does the plot 
resemble a very messily accomplished mystery about the Hardy Boys. 
</P>
<P>
But what is believable about "V for Victor," and a confirmation of the writing 
talent of young author Childress, is the occasional landscape or character 
description that does ring true: "The Magnolia River meanders for five miles 
down from its spring, widening, opening, mixing with the salty tide as it 
approaches Weeks Bay. This wide, shallow lake narrows down to a mouth. The 
lower jaw of this mouth was Willie's island -- a half mile of marsh grass, a 
long stretch of thickety woods, a high place of two or three acres well-shaded 
by live oaks, with Weeks Bay on one side and the big bay, Mobile, on the other. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
One senses that Childress, at least, knows his river vividly: "The boat stirred 
sideways from the dock. Imperceptibly it began gaining speed. The trees 
reflected the throb of its engines. Here the Magnolia was so narrow that Daniel 
could bush-hog both banks if he lowered his outriggers. His wake spread in a V, 
washing a flock of blackheaded ducks from their fallen log. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
This authenticity of landscape is the novel's strongest element. Also, the 
grandmother, Willie, who dies early in the story but lingers as a voice in 
Victor's mind, is a thoroughly interesting and credible character. It's 
unfortunate that Childress, in trying to exploit World War II for so much 
unbelievable action and melodrama, didn't concentrate more on what is truthful, 
penetrating, and honest about his landscape and people. But that would have 
meant a different kind of story set during the war era, and a book that would 
have made much more worthwhile reading.

BLOODY SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simon Brett, whose hard-drinking actor-sleuth Charles Paris is one of the joys 
of the mystery form, has begun a new series starring Melita Pargeter, a 
handsome widow whose late husband, a member of the criminal class, has left her 
plenty of money and a host of seedy but invaluable friends. 
</P>
<P>
In Mrs, Presumed Dead, Simon Brett (unequaled as an inventor of titles) has 
Mrs. Pargeter leasing a house in a spiffy suburban tract for the 
nouveau-mortgaged. The previous owner has left a false forwarding address and 
Pargeter correctly senses foul deeds. Her researches -- and Brett's dissection 
of the neighborhood and its upwardly striving residents -- make for very 
enjoyable reading. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara's Sue Grafton has worked her way through Alibi, Burglar, Corpse, 
Deadbeat and Evidence and, with 'F' Is for Fugitive, shows no sign of faltering 
or flagging. Her Kinsey Millhone, one of the principal ladies in the private 
investigator line, is this time holed up in a California coast town that could 
be, let's say, Pismo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A man, then a teen-ager, convicted of strangling his pregnant girlfriend, 
escaped from prison and now has been recaptured after 17 years of a blameless 
life under another name. Millhone has to rake through the dead past to see if 
he was, in fact, guilty as charged. 
</P>
<P>
After all those years there are enough lively suspects to fill a jail and 
enough evil to make "Peyton Place" seem like a retirement home for the serenely 
virtuous. Millhone's own life is finally at high risk. She is a wonderful 
character, tough but not brutish, resourceful and sensitive, a fit knight to 
walk those mean streets with her male predecessors, and high time. 
</P>
<P>
Robert B. Parker's Spenser books have seemed slighter right along, the paddings 
of sex and food ever more evident. But his new one, Playmates, while the 
pausings for play and nourishment are still overabundant, has an unusually 
interesting and affecting main thrust. 
</P>
<P>
A star college basketballer, who is black, has been shaving points and the 
scandal could imperil the team's shot at an NCAA title. Parker is here having 
his say about college athletics as the tail that wags the academic dog. He is 
also showing his wrath at the corrupting of the athletes themselves. There are 
corrosive portraits of a faculty choosing to ignore (and conceal) the fact that 
the star is functionally illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
The gamblers are of course murderously resentful of Spenser's interference, 
although murder when it happens is almost a side issue. Spenser, as is his 
admirable custom, is risking his own image in hope of reclaiming a single, 
sullen life, redirecting an athlete whose physical skills, seemingly a way out 
of poverty, have only made him a pawn in other people's nasty games. 
"Playmates" is one of Parker's best in some time. 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising to learn that Bernard Schopen has completed a critical 
study of Ross Macdonald's work. Schopen's own first mystery, The Big Silence, 
is very strongly in the Macdonald tradition. 
</P>
<P>
There is, to begin with, a knowing and affectionate celebration of a particular 
turf. In Schopen's case it is the Nevada desert (he studied in Reno but now 
lives in New Hampshire). More important, there are the roots of present murder 
which go deep into an incredibly entangled past of hidden and concealed 
identities and undisclosed crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Schopen's hero is a lawyer-investigator named Jack Ross, who has about had it 
with death and betrayal, and is teetering at the brink of total emotional 
collapse. But when a young hooker asks him to find her grandfather, missing 
these 40 years, and Ross' old friend, an Indian, asks him to help her, what can 
he do? The writing occasionally strains too hard for poetic and rhetorical 
effects, trying for but missing Macdonald's heightened feeling for but careful 
control of language. The impersonations, the cross-breedings, the blood and 
marital ties, are almost too confusing, even compared with the messes Lew 
Archer ran into. But the action is vigorous and well-described, the Reno 
environs (even including the Mustang Ranch) excellently evoked, and Schopen and 
Ross are names to watch for henceforth. 
</P>
<P>
The prolific Lawrence Sanders ("The Anderson Tapes" and "Timothy's Game" most 
recently) has built Capital Crimes around a fascinating central figure. He is a 
vodka-swilling, womanizing faith healer who calls himself Brother Kristos and 
operates out of a decrepit tobacco barn in Virginia, with a pair of sluttish 
women as his handmaidens. 
</P>
<P>
The fascination is that he is not a fake; the cures appear to work, 
inexplicably, and word of him gets to the White House, where the President -- 
Abner Hawkins by name -- has a hemophiliac son, whom Kristos helps. 
</P>
<P>
Kristos quickly becomes a political issue, living in Washington, frequenting 
the White House, advising on social policy, becoming the inadvertent catalyst 
in a conspiracy. Sanders, infusing his thriller with an unusual amount of 
ambiguity, has written a suspenseful story that doubles as an essay on the 
corruptions of power, including power that may be unearthly. 
</P>
<P>
In the way of most softcover originals, Gerald Laurence's One Bang-Up Job, is a 
rocketingly fast, sleek-surfaced, larger-than-anything thriller. It confirms 
that the lessons of eventful pacing that made the pulp magazines as good as 
they were in their heyday have been noted and retained. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence's caper is a master-planned robbery of everything in San Francisco 
simultaneously, with a resulting haul of $30 million in cash, which seems 
modest enough, every till in the city having been raked clear, although 
naturally mastermind Daniel Langer had expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The author enlivens his fable with alternating first-person narratives, the 
pursuer reciting one chapter, the pursued the next. The chase leads to the 
jungles of South America, and Things Happen. Do they ever. In the end, of 
course, crime does not pay, but getting to this ancient wisdom is all the fun. 
</P>
<P>
While My Pretty One Sleeps is the seventh and latest by Mary Higgins Clark (15 
million copies in print, her publisher says). This one begins with the macabre 
disposal of the body of a murdered gossip columnist who had a flair for 
exposes. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the book charts the slow realization by the columnist's friends 
(few) and acquaintances (many) that she is not simply unaccountably away, but 
dead. The central worrier is a boutique owner whose father, conveniently, is a 
former police commissioner. The suspects include a weak and sponging nephew, an 
ex-husband and his shrewish wife and some garment trade executives about whom 
she knew too much. 
</P>
<P>
The denouement is exciting if not overly surprising, and the book, for which a 
high competence is the accurate accolade, is hammock fare, if anyone still has 
hammocks.

MILKING COWS, HIRING FACULTY, DEBATING DE TOCQUEVILLE -- A DAY'S WORK AT THE 
STRANGEST LITTLE COLLEGE IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS J. MEYER, Thomas J. Meyer is a Los Angeles writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
THERE IS NO EASY way to get to Deep Springs Valley. From any direction, the 
terrain is the same: bustling interstates turning into smaller roads that 
narrow as they creep upward through the high desert of eastern California. 
Finally, a thin, serpentine road crawls through a craggy mountain pass, then 
dips into an expanse of desolate flatland. 
</P>
<P>
The valley lies silent, nearly empty. A saltwater lake marks one end. A 
two-lane highway runs down the center. But in one corner, a stand of cottonwood 
trees conceals a well-kept secret: Deep Springs College, perhaps the finest 
small college in America -- and probably the strangest. 
</P>
<P>
Cut off from civilization by a series of mountain ranges, Deep Springs is 
similarly separated from the academic world. Its tiny, all-male enrollment 
comes from the top of the college applicant pool; the 21 students all scored in 
the highest 2% on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
They pay no tuition, room or board and share one of the nation's largest 
campuses, 2,500 acres of sprawling desert. In exchange for the free ride, 
students are required to work on the college's ranch, doing everything from 
tending the 280 head of cattle to farming alfalfa. 
</P>
<P>
John (Buzz) Anderson, president of the college, explains his school's 
attraction by gesturing as if he's performing rigorous manual labor. "The 
students we get are those interested in growing this way as well as" -- he 
points to his head -- "this way." 
</P>
<P>
Deep Springs students also may not leave the valley without permission but 
otherwise have almost total control over their lives there. They help admit new 
students, hire professors and set the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't just going to college and getting smart and going home and getting 
on with your life," says Scott Edelson, a first-year student from Edina, Minn. 
"For two years, this is life." 
</P>
<P>
IT IS BEFORE DAWN. Under a clear, starlit sky, a blues tune crackles from 
speakers in a dairy barn. First-year student Hugh Seid stumbles through a muddy 
field, trying to wake a cow named Malice. "Come on, girl," the 19-year-old 
says, landing a kick on the side of the Brown Swiss. "You know the game." 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, Seid struggles to lead Malice and three other cows through the 
darkness to the barn. "At some point, they tell me, they start to respond to 
your voice," he says. "That hasn't happened yet." 
</P>
<P>
Deep Springs' labor program -- combined with its demanding academic plan and 
the peculiarities that naturally arise at an institution in the middle of 
nowhere -- makes the all-male college different from any other. Throughout the 
day, students can be found driving tractors or feed trucks along campus roads. 
Occasionally, one hurries from class to rope calves. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of his classmates, Seid first heard of Deep Springs from the annual 
nationwide mailing the college sends to students with the top scores on the 
SAT. A San Diego resident, he had been considering attending UC Berkeley, UCLA 
or Yale but had little enthusiasm for college until he learned about Deep 
Springs and its work requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"I read the brochure and sort of instinctively knew I was going to come here," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Seid is the typical Deep Springs student: He was far brighter 
than average in high school, he sought something out of the ordinary from 
college and he had little exposure to manual labor. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he has worked four to seven hours a day in a variety of positions -- as 
campus office assistant; as driver, traveling out of the valley on college 
errands; as general laborer, performing maintenance jobs and ranch tasks, and 
as "boardinghouse" person, washing dishes and cleaning the dining hall kitchen. 
This is Seid's second week as dairy boy, and he's learning the ropes with the 
help of his predecessor. He's still getting used to the hours -- waking before 
5 a.m. every day -- and the duties -- milking the cows twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
Since life at Deep Springs revolves around the ranch, the school operates 
year-round, with six seven-week terms separated by one-week breaks (and more 
for Christmas). To accommodate the outdoor labor, the college stays permanently 
on daylight-saving time. Classes are scheduled around students' work 
assignments. During breaks, a handful of students stay to look after the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
What the students say they gain from their labor assignments is a feel for 
working with their hands and a sense of being a vital part of their community. 
</P>
<P>
Edelson, 20, describes Deep Springs as a hands-on lesson in collective effort 
-- the kind of experience that is idealized and intellectualized elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn here that community is not some touchy-feely liberal idea," he says. 
"There's a certain sense of responsibility. It's about doing your job." 
</P>
<P>
DEEP SPRINGS COLLEGE was founded in 1917 bL. Nunn -- a lawyer, inventor and 
educational innovator -- as an experiment in higher educa tion. 
</P>
<P>
Reared in Ohio and educated at German universities, Nunn made his fortune in 
mining and developing hydroelectric facilities throughout the West. In his 40s, 
he turned his attention to education, envisioning a college that would be a 
training ground for the nation's leaders. He died in Los Angeles in 1925, just 
as his experiment was taking hold. 
</P>
<P>
A professed elitist, Nunn wanted to isolate the brightest young men in America, 
encourage them to serve society and send them to the country's most prestigious 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of Deep Springs," Nunn wrote, "is to help in the training of the 
few." 
</P>
<P>
To this day, the college's applications committee -- eight students, a 
professor and the president -- maintains a stringent screening process to 
ensure that Deep Springs winds up with only the most qualified young men. Of 
the thousands of students recruited every year, about 50 candidates get as far 
as the two-hour interview with the committee or an alumnus. And then, only 10 
to 15 are accepted -- depending on how many first-year students are invited to 
return. The college's maximum enrollment is 26 students. 
</P>
<P>
One late-winter evening, the committee is gathered in a classroom, waiting for 
a high school senior who has come by bus from Spokane, Wash. "The guy looks 
pretty nervous," one student says. "He's sitting straight up in a couch in the 
lounge reading a comic book." 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old has every reason to be nervous. Each of the committee members 
has pored over his nine application essays and seen his SAT scores and grades, 
which started strong but plunged in his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the applicant takes his seat, the committee fires away. One student 
inquires about the Greyhound ride. Another wants him to explain the drop in his 
grades. Yet another challenges him to justify his belief in God. At one point, 
amid a run-on sentence, he falls silent. "Could you remind me what the question 
was?" he asks. (Last month, the candidate received word that he didn't make the 
cut.) 
</P>
<P>
Nunn also intended Deep Springs to be a place in constant flux. "The only 
consistent residents of this place," one student says, "are the dogs." Students 
stay only for the two years of the program. Faculty members may remain no 
longer than five years. Even the presidency, customarily held by men either 
retired or on leave from their primary occupations, rotates about every three 
or four years. 
</P>
<P>
Amid this change, it is up to the students to reinvent the place each year. For 
more than seven decades, they have remained loyal to Nunn's founding principles 
and used his ideas as an anchor of continuity. Today's students are no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel they're part of a tradition," says Tim Hunt, academic dean. "They 
read Nunn's writing, and they feel they have some obligation to maintain the 
spirit of that." 
</P>
<P>
Students view Nunn with reverence and irony. They study and discuss his 
writings, which are published in a gray book visible on most dormitory shelves; 
some display his portrait prominently in their rooms. In conversation, they 
refer to him as "L. L." This year, they even baked him a birthday cake. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his legacy of ideas, Nunn left the seed of the endowment that 
still provides nearly half of the college's financing. Because no tuition is 
collected, the $600,000 annual operating budget comes from the endowment -- now 
about $5 million -- as well as ranch income, gifts from alumni and occasional 
grants. The Telluride Assn., a sister organization also founded by Nunn, 
provides financial support and runs summer co-ed programs for high school 
students at Deep Springs, Cornell University in New York and Williams College 
in Massachusetts. Some summer participants eventually attend Deep Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn is also responsible for the campus's isolated location midway between 
Death Valley and Yosemite National Park. There, he purchased a cattle ranch and 
built a cluster of sturdy masonry buildings. Those same structures still stand 
in the circle of a dozen dormitories, classroom buildings and faculty homes 
corralled around the campus green. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the students in 1923, he explained why he selected this site: 
"Great leaders from Moses to Roosevelt have sought the desert and heard its 
voice. You can hear it if you listen, but you cannot hear it while in the midst 
of the search for material things." 
</P>
<P>
IN A DORMITORY ROOM nicknamed the Black Hole -- for its black walls -- four 
students are doing their best to sort out Alexis de Tocqueville's "Democracy in 
America." A family matter has forced their professor to be away for several 
days, but the history class proceeds as usual. The only difference is the move 
from the classroom to a dorm room. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else attracts students to the college, the institution's primary 
function is education. Every class meeting, this one in particular, is a 
reminder of the students' devotion to that cause. 
</P>
<P>
As two students roll cigarettes of Drum tobacco, the group grapples with the 
text. Everyone has completed the reading assignment, and everyone seems 
genuinely excited about it. In the hourlong class, there are no lulls in the 
discussion, no awkward silences. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not all geniuses," Michael Allen, the absent professor, says later. 
"We don't have 25 Einsteins out here. But they're very bright and motivated, 
and motivation is the big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Because Deep Springs students are not willing to merely sit and be lectured, 
instructors say, nearly all classes work as a discussion among the students, 
gently prodded by the professor. Tim Hunt's literature course on the poets 
Robinson Jeffers and Wallace Stevens is a good example. 
</P>
<P>
Nine students sit around a table pondering a Jeffers poem. Seid, wearing the 
same jeans and T-shirt he wore to milk cows earlier, opens the class with an 
overview of the poem's structure. Other students challenge him before he can 
finish. Hunt listens for 30 minutes before he breaks in. He gives a bit of 
background on the poem and the poet and asks a few questions of his own, and 
then the discussion continues. 
</P>

Afterward, in his study, Hunt says that classes at the college aren't the 
formless sessions one might expect at such an offbeat college. "Sometimes, 
people have the impression that this is an experimental college," he says. "In 
an academic sense, it is not." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, students turn in papers, take exams and receive letter grades. But the 
institution has only two required academic subjects -- composition and public 
speaking -- among the eclectic mix of courses determined each term by the eight 
students who serve with Hunt on the curriculum committee. One term this spring, 
the 10 offerings included courses on world revolutions, linguistics, geology, 
calculus, radical ecology, chemistry and German. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hudgens, 20, a first-year student from Eugene, Ore., says the limited 
curriculum means that many students must put off some studies until after they 
leave Deep Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"But then you hit on these whole other bodies of knowledge that you wouldn't 
have otherwise heard of," he says. "It's a trade-off, but it's a worthwhile 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 students who left the college last year, two went to Yale, one to 
Harvard, one to Swarthmore, one to the University of Wisconsin, one to the 
University of Chicago and two to UC Berkeley. The others are taking time off 
from college. 
</P>
<P>
Many alumni stay in education throughout their lives. A 1980 study conducted by 
an alumnus found that 54% had earned doctoral degrees and nearly 28% had chosen 
careers in academia. Others enter law, communications and government. Prominent 
alumni include Rep. Jim Olin (D-Va.); the late CBS News reporter Charles 
Collingwood; former U.N. Ambassador William J. vanden Heuvel; former U.S. 
Ambassador to Singapore Edwin Cronk; and former University of Rochester 
president Robert L. Sproull. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their ultimate paths, many students recall Deep Springs as the first 
place where their classmates and instructors measured up to their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, the whole way students approached their education didn't 
interest me," says Michael McGuire, 18, a first-year student from Houston. "Now 
I'm interested in education because I think it's valuable in and of itself." 
</P>
<P>
FOR THE ADULTS who work at Deep Springs College, living in a world run by 
teen-agers takes some getting used to. Erik M. Pell, chairman of the college's 
board of trustees, says that's why the college presidents are usually alumni. 
It would be difficult to persuade anyone else to oversee a college without 
giving him the authority to run it, says Pell, himself an alumnus and a Xerox 
Corp. executive in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The president must balance student autonomy and the stability of the 
institution, Pell says. So the president is encouraged not to rule with an iron 
hand. Instead, he gently guides students toward decisions that are in the 
school's best interests. 
</P>
<P>
Buzz Anderson, who attended the college from 1939 to 1941, accepted the post 
for three years in 1987. A retired attorney from Pittsburgh, the 67-year-old 
says he has become accustomed to his job. "One reason I'm able to live with 
this sort of thing," he says, "is that, by profession, I'm a lawyer, so I'm 
used to situations where you have to give a little ground here to take a little 
ground there." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to overseeing the college finances and serving on the applications 
committee, he supervises the 12-member paid staff, including the ranch manager, 
a mechanic and a couple who supervise farming. 
</P>
<P>
The six-member faculty, however, falls under the jurisdiction of the college's 
student-dominated curriculum committee. With Anderson, the group has the 
challenge of attracting high-quality professors to an institution unknown to 
many academics. 
</P>
<P>
The committee draws candidates by advertising in education journals and 
attending academic conferences. Like student applicants, prospective 
instructors are required to visit the campus and meet with students. "We 
wouldn't want someone who fits in here but doesn't challenge the students," 
says McGuire, a member of the curriculum committee. "But we wouldn't want 
someone who challenges the students but doesn't want to be all the way out 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt says that professors who interview are always surprised to learn about the 
college. "They look at this place, and they find it either very appealing or 
appalling as far as the living situation goes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But as for the academics, he says, the main attractions are the small class 
size, the quality and motivation of students and the intimate contact between 
teachers and students. "You are teaching students who actually want to be in 
your classroom." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, faculty members must make significant sacrifices. The 
institution offers no tenured positions, forcing instructors to fend for 
themselves once they leave Deep Springs. Faculty contracts are up for renewal 
annually. Professors are far from major libraries and research facilities. Pay 
is low -- between $15,000 and $24,000 a year, plus room and board for the 
professor's family. 
</P>
<P>
Allen received his doctorate in history from the University of Washington. Like 
many liberal arts Ph.D.s, he took the first job he could get -- a tenure-track 
position at a technical college in Tennessee, while his wife, Mary Hanneman, an 
East Asia history specialist, taught part time at Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
"Teaching at a state college can become very pedestrian," he says. "A lot of 
people don't want to be in there and consider you to be an obstacle on their 
way to getting a degree in business administration." Frustrated by that 
attitude, the couple came to Deep Springs last fall. This spring, they joined 
forces to teach "Comparative Revolutions," a history class. 
</P>
<P>
Since the curriculum committee screens applicants so carefully to make sure 
professors fit in, only rarely have students recommended against renewing a 
faculty member's contract. Still, the relationship can be awkward. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an interesting situation," Allen says. "I suppose you worry about (the 
students) in the same way you would worry about your dean or your department 
chair in another situation." 
</P>
<P>
Professors say they are conscious of the potential conflict of interest but 
insist that it does not interfere with the way they deal with students, the way 
they grade or how they run their classes. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, students say serving on the curriculum committee can be 
rewarding. "We shape the academic program," McGuire says, "and that's 
fulfilling." 
</P>
<P>
But when the committee recently recommended against renewing a professor's 
contract, McGuire discovered how touchy hiring and firing one's instructors can 
be. "I take that professor's class, and I like him, and I sit down with him for 
meals," he says. "And then I was part of the decision not to rehire him. That's 
a delicate thing. It's uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
ON WARM summer nights, Scott Fybush likes to wander out to California 168 -- 
the route that bisects Deep Springs Valley -- and lie down in the middle of the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been there for hours without a single car coming," the 17-year-old 
first-year student says. 
</P>
<P>
While Deep Springs' demanding labor and academic programs can be heady new 
experiences, more sobering are the college's remote location and the men-only 
campus. Those two factors are part of what draw people to the college and, 
occasionally, make them wonder why they came. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been particularly happy here," Edelson says one night, leaning back 
in a chair and staring out his window into desert darkness. "There have been 
times when I've been very unhappy. But I don't regret coming." 
</P>
<P>
The nearest town, Bishop, lies 42 miles down the road, and State 168 is among 
the least-traveled highways in California. The sense of separateness from 
civilization is reinforced by a rule known as the "isolation policy." No 
student is allowed to leave the valley during the term without permission. 
</P>
<P>
The location inspires Fybush's antics and another student's fondness for 
sprinting down the highway when cars pass -- just to make the drivers wonder 
why anyone would be sprinting in the middle of nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
There are no televisions on campus, and radio reception -- except for a small 
station in Bishop -- is full of static. The entire college shares one telephone 
line. At a college aspiring to train people to serve society, discussion of 
world events is oddly absent. No one mentions the Palestine Liberation 
Organization or "The Cosby Show" or the NCAA Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
The seclusion frequently can become oppressive, making the small community 
especially insular and myopic. It may also account for the tendency of Deep 
Springs students to look and sound alike. "After a while, we start to pick up 
each other's speech and idiosyncrasies," Hudgens says. "It kind of can't be 
helped." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every student has long hair -- the second-year students' longer than the 
first-year students' -- and most have grown beards. A surprisingly large 
proportion smoke hand-rolled cigarettes (alcohol and drugs are against the 
rules), and there is a conspicuous consistency in the type of music (Bob Dylan, 
Grateful Dead and reggae) that can be heard wafting from dorm rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the isolation, some second-year students say they gradually become 
bored with the monotony of valley life. "Every day's the same," says Michael 
Armstrong, 19, a former Deep Springs student-body president. "If a feed trough 
overflows, it's an exciting day." And then there's the no-women policy. Nunn 
specified in the college's trust that the institution was to educate "promising 
young men." The college's trustees have continued to exclude women, partly to 
maintain tradition and partly because they believe Deep Springs is so small 
that there is no room for what they think would be inevitable if women were on 
campus: romance. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have 25 kids who can't escape from each other and two get involved, 
those two involve 8% of the student body," Anderson says. 
</P>
<P>
In a straw poll, students have voted 18 years in a row to admit women, some 
students arguing that it is morally wrong to deny women the Deep Springs 
experience. The current students seem to accept the status quo without much 
argument, though, perhaps because the masculine atmosphere is part of the 
mystique that brought them here in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The all-male environment sometimes makes the dorms feel like locker rooms or 
Army barracks. Anderson refers to the students as "the guys." And when a 
student plans to have a female friend visit -- only with the permission of the 
student government -- word gets around quickly. But the isolation from women 
seems to be more a fact of life than a source of aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, being so far from women and the rest of the world seems to have had 
the effect Nunn intended. What most alumni wind up retaining from their 
experience at Deep Springs is a feeling of inspiration from the remoteness and 
uniqueness of the place. The men who look back at their years in the shadows of 
the Inyo Mountains don't reminisce about a big game or a big party; they talk 
about "the valley" -- as if those two words encompass the entirety of the 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"When you leave, not being in that place is a big change. It's something that 
when you get away from it, it's hard to have any perspective on it," says David 
Schisgall, 21, now a junior at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when I'm with Deep Springers in the outside world, I'm feeling very 
much like, 'Yeah, we've got something that no one else does, and there's no way 
outsiders are going to understand it.' "

LOOKS: INSTEAD OF A FACE LIFT; 
</P>
<P>
PEELS CAN STRIP YEARS FROM YOUR FACE -- BUT YOU MAY GET BURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PADDY CALISTRO

<TEXT>
<P>
SEDUCTIVE ads describe the chemical peel, a scalpel-free form of cosmetic 
surgery, as a quick fix for aging faces. In fact, the promise of unwrinkled 
skin lured more than 50,000 Americans into having the surface layers of their 
skin stripped last year. For most, the results were dramatic; the "new" skin 
looks years younger. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, others learned that peels can be painful, unpredictable and 
disappointing. Most effective on crow's-feet, vertical lines around the mouth 
and crosshatches on the cheeks, a peel is no substitute for a face lift, which 
removes deep wrinkles and sags. 
</P>
<P>
The peel is a medical procedure, usually performed under general anesthesia, 
using the chemical phenol to strip away the outer layers of skin. As with a 
severe burn, the skin blisters and forms a crust. A few days later, when the 
crust falls off, smoother, ultra-sensitive skin is exposed. In more aggressive 
peels, the face is taped, forcing the phenol to work deeper. An alternative is 
a lighter peel, using trichloroacetic acid. Usually an office procedure, this 
peel requires a painkiller rather than anesthesia and is typically effective 
only on fine wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
After a peel, the skin may remain red for months. It is camouflaged with 
opaque, sun-block makeup. Because most men won't wear makeup, they generally 
are discouraged from undergoing the procedure altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Melvin Spira, professor and head of the Division of Plastic Surgery at 
Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, says that many people are not aware that 
chemical peels result in enlarged pores and that skin is permanently lightened. 
Thus, peels are most successful on pale complexions. Individuals with olive to 
black skin often are left with permanent lines of demarcation between face and 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
Peels are commonly performed around the lips successfully. But Spira cautions 
that sometimes the result is "excessive scarring, particularly around the 
mouth, an increase in fine broken blood vessels on the face and problems of 
extreme sensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
Many surgeons combine a peel with a face lift to improve skin texture while 
eliminating sags. But Spira advises against simultaneous procedures. "The peel 
should not be performed where the skin is lifted away from its underlying 
structure: the cheeks, the forehead, the jowls. The results are not consistent. 
A peel around the mouth is fine with a lift because that skin isn't being 
lifted." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the absorption of phenol can cause heart irregularities. Dr. 
Robert Kotler, an instructor at the UCLA School of Medicine, says that because 
the bloodstream absorbs phenol, the procedure is not recommended for pregnant 
women or those with kidney problems (healthy kidneys help clear phenol from the 
system). 
</P>
<P>
Is a chemical peel worth the risks? "Every surgery has inherent dangers," Spira 
says. "So does a peel. But so far, it is the most effective method for reducing 
fine lines on the face."

candidate. Charles Belongie

WINE: LIQUID HARMONY; 
</P>
<P>
CHATEAU DEBAUN'S SYMPHONY WINES ARE OF NOTEWORTHY COMPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LAWRENCE BALZER

<TEXT>
<P>
WINES MADE FROM the Symphony grape strike no discordant notes. A wine grape 
named Symphony? Yes, it is an American wine varietal that was developed over a 
42-year period at UC Davis' department of viticulture and enology. 
</P>
<P>
A hybrid of European vinifera, Grenache Gris and Muscat of Alexandria, the 
grape was developed under the guidance of Harold P. Olmo at UC Davis and was 
known as J5-58. It was named when a wine maker at a Wine Institute tasting for 
this varietal expressed amazement at the complexity of flavors and aromas, 
which he likened to the orchestration of a symphony. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the hybrid Symphony Winegrape Cultivar was patented. The grape has two 
distinctive characteristics: It's not bitter when it's fermented to total 
dryness, and after bottling, it maintains its fresh-fruit taste and floral 
bouquet for years. 
</P>
<P>
Rapturously delectable wines made from these grapes are commercially available 
from the Chateau DeBaun Vineyards and Winery of Santa Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
When winery owner Ken DeBaun first planted 20 acres of Symphony grapes in 1982, 
he took on the project as a marketing challenge. He had started the year before 
with 116 acres of premium vineyard land, 60 of which were planted with 
Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Gewurztraminer grapes. Then he learned about the 
Symphony varietal and sampled some of the wines from the UC Davis Library of 
Wines. He was so impressed that he planted the world's first commercial 
vineyard of Symphony grapes and hired Roland Shackelford from Piper-Sonoma. 
Today, there are 96 acres of Symphony grapes. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first release of Chateau DeBaun wines in 1986, 82 medals have been 
awarded to its Symphony wines and champagnes. Yet they remain eclipsed by the 
popular Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon wines. I hope that this report on 
Symphony will bring these wines a broad, new audience. In its range of styles, 
each performance has masterly virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Some Chateau DeBaun Symphony wines in current release: 
</P>
<P>
ROMANCE 1986 Symphony Brut Champagne ($10.99): Here is a methode champenoise 
sparkler, of 100% Symphony grapes, with an intriguing Muscat, melonlike 
fragrance, like a fine Asti Spumante. In Brut style, the wine is dry, crisp, 
appetizing. 
</P>
<P>
OVERTURE 1986 Dry Symphony ($8). Here, the titillating hint of Muscat aromas in 
the bouquet draws you in, but to a silky dry finish. The wine is as smooth as 
satin. 
</P>
<P>
CLASSICAL JAZZ ($5.49). The label reads: "A lively blend of Symphony (38%) 
Chardonnay (15%) and Pinot Noir (47%) wines." Like good jazz, it is full of 
happy surprise turns, ideal for picnics of festive fun. Off-dry, it has 1.0% 
residual sweetness; one swallow leads to another and another. 
</P>
<P>
FINALE 1987 Late Harvest Symphony (Tenths $14). Scents and tastes of golden 
apricots. Made from the first year the Symphony grapes developed the "noble 
rot" of Botrytis mold; the wine has an extra-luscious richness. It won a gold 
medal at the San Francisco Exposition in 1988.

OUTTAKES: "RAIN BOY"? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leonard Klady 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young man springs his emotionally disturbed brother from an institution and 
heads out on the road. In the course of their travels, he discovers and 
exploits his brother's unique gift. Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
No, it's not "Rain Man II," but Universal's "The Wizard," starring Fred Savage 
of TV's "The Wonder Years." In David Chisholm's screenplay, Savage kidnaps his 
younger brother, who's traumatized while witnessing their sister's drowning. 
Though virtually speechless, kid brother turns out to be a video game wiz. They 
head for L.A., via Las Vegas, and an international tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to film locally and in Utah in June, "The Wizard" is directed by Todd 
Holland and produced by Chisholm and Ken Topolsky. 
</P>
<P>
Chisholm was out of the country and unavailable for comment. A studio exec 
insisted similarity between "The Wizard" and "Rain Man" was only "superficial" 
-- and mentioned "Tommy," with its pinball story, as just as likely a 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the project's been around for some time," said the source, "and it's 
geared to a different kind of audience in its tone and style." Leonard Klady

It's strictly at the formative stage, but Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight and 
Patti LaBelle may join as Sisters in the Name of Love next year for what 
Warwick terms "a major world tour." Recording as a trio is also a possibility, 
Warwick told Outtakes. 
</P>
<P>
They'll make their first concert appearance as Sisters in the Name of Love on 
June 10 at Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall, part of NYC's "That's What 
Friends Are For" AIDS fund-raising weekend, which Warwick is spearheading. 
</P>
<P>
The three famed singers, who first teamed for a 1986 HBO special, have been 
talking about regrouping ever since, Warwick explained. Now, "We're going to 
plan a second HBO special, which will form part of the foundation for the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really Gladys Knight's baby, her dream child, and it's coming to 
fruition with the help of her two gal friends. We're all very excited about 
it." Stacy Jenel Smith

No sooner did we report -- two weeks back -- on the many family ties found 
among cast and crew of the movie, "Say Anything" than we were tipped to a 
frenzy of familial connections on CBS' new series, "Jesse Hawkes." 
</P>
<P>
Starring Robert Conrad and his sons Christian and Shane, it's exec-produced by 
Conrad's daughter, Joan Conrad. Her hubby, Tim Irwin, is transportation 
coordinator. His sister, Lindsay Thomas -- who's married to associate producer 
Scott Thomas -- is the set decorator. 
</P>
<P>
Stunt coordinator Justin Lundin and driver Rick Lundin are brothers. Animal 
handler Robin Keyser is married to set dresser Chris Keyser. Caterer Norton 
Flynn is married to Conrad's daughter, Nancy Conrad -- who assists him with the 
catering, "and sometimes does bit roles" in Conrad shows, according to a series 
source. 
</P>
<P>
Production coordinator Paula Dupree isn't related to anyone -- but she used to 
be the Conrad family's baby-sitter.

Patrick Swayze plays the title role in Paramount's "Ghost," to film locally and 
in NYC in July for director Jerry Zucker. Writer Bruce Joel Rubin's 
fantasy-comedy casts Swayze as a bank exec whose accidental death was the work 
of a supposed friend now eyeing his job and gal. But the late exec hopes to 
foil those plans through a charlatan medium. Producers Lisa Weinstein and Steve 
Jaffe are negotiating with Whoopi Goldberg for the latter role. . . . John Lone 
goes "Stalking Tigers" in Hong Kong with his "Last Emperor" wife Vivian Wu and 
Brit actress Sammi Davis later this month. The Elliott Lewitt production is the 
saga of Chinese refugees who become power brokers in the current gold rush 
climate of the Far East. Acclaimed Japanese film maker Mitsuo Yanagimachi 
("Himatsuri") directs and co-wrote the script with Richard Maxwell for 
producers Lewitt and Don Guest. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Roger Corman, who last directed in 1971, casts Bridgit Fonda as Mary Shelley in 
his "Frankenstein Unbound," filming next month in Italy. The new twist is that 
Jeremy Irons, a 21st-Century scientist, goes back in time to discover her Dr. 
Frankenstein was real. Raul Julia is the mad scientist. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Liv Ullmann's French island vacation with her teen-age daughter produces 
tension and humor in "Mindwalk." A.J. Cohen produces and Bernt Capra directs 
next September. . . . C. Thomas Howell is out to avenge the 10-year-old murder 
of his parents in 21st Century Film Co.'s "Kid." Mark Robinson directs the 
Leslie Boehm screenplay in August for producer Natan Sahavi. . . . Gary Busey 
joins Charlie Sheen as a sadistic sergeant in charge of a stockade of prisoners 
in "Cadence." Martin Sheen directs on Vancouver locations for producer Richard 
Davis in July. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In SC Entertainment's "Still Life" -- filming next month in Toronto -- Jason 
Gedrick plays a serial killer who turns his victims into art pieces. Jessica 
Steen gets romantically hung up and possibly worse in the script by Michael 
Taav, Dean Parisot and Graham Campbell. Campbell also directs for producer Nick 
Stiliadis. . . .

Apropos the furor surrounding Susan Littwin's humorous criticism of men in 
aerobics classes, "Walk Like a Man" (Feb. 5): Erik Fair's rebuttal "Sex and 
Exercise" (April 2) was a cute attempt, but his caustic remarks merely prove 
Littwin's point that men think they set all the standards.

ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patricia Loverock's article about science and sport ("The Athlete of the 
Future," March 19) provided an incisive overview of the exciting strides taking 
place in the world of athletic performance. As the director of physical therapy 
and training for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Committee and a professional 
trainer, I know that visionaries such as Harmon Brown, Gideon Ariel and Bob 
Gregory are literally expanding athletic horizons. 
</P>
<P>
The advantages of scientific study of sport reach beyond the world-class 
athlete. Average 10K runners, C-League softball players and senior citizens who 
work to keep fit -- even weekend athletes -- can take advantage of 
sophisticated techniques, including strength measurement, flexibility analysis 
and computerized performance evaluations. In that sense, the athlete of the 
future is really today's jogger on the sidewalk.

STAGE WEEK: THE RETARDED LIFE OF 'BOYS NEXT DOOR' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Griffin takes a look inside the world of mentally retarded adults in "The 
Boys Next Door," opening tonight at the Pasadena Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a friend who worked in a group home with retarded adults," explained the 
Rhode Island-based playwright. "He used to tell me stories -- some of them 
devastating, many of them hilarious. Also, I grew up with retarded people in my 
neighborhood. Of course, a lot of this play is invented. I did what all writers 
do: Start with a story someone tells you -- and when you finish, it's 
unrecognizable." 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the story are four residents of the home and their counselor. 
"One of the men is quite retarded," said Griffin, who is adapting the play into 
a film script for director Norman Jewison. "One is marginally retarded. One is 
a schizophrenic who doesn't belong there. And one is retarded, overweight and 
in love." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin, who has dealt with the subject of mental retardation before (in his 
"The Taking Away of Little Willie," Taper Playworks series, 1979), stressed 
that the condition takes a back seat to the relationships and problems of the 
characters. "My father used to say (of the retarded), 'You can play with them, 
get mad at them -- but you cannot exclude them.' That's the most damaging thing 
you can do to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Although he originally thought he was writing a small play, Griffin has found 
"Boys" effective on a grand scale: After its debut at Princeton in 1986, the 
play moved to the Berkshire Theatre Festival -- and now, he says, it has 
received "around 35 productions" across the country. (This staging, directed by 
Josephine Abady, has just moved intact from Cleveland.) 
</P>
<P>
"I think the reason for its appeal is that it's propelled by humor, not maudlin 
stuff," Griffin noted. "Also, a lot of plays and TV and movies aren't about 
something. This is." 
</P>
<P>
PAY WHAT YOU CAN: Customers can select their own ticket prices at today's 3 
p.m. performance of "Bocon!" at the Mark Taper Forum. Information: (213)

<P>
BRECHT'S BACK: Bertolt Brecht's "Baal" (1919) gets a new revival from New 
York's Project III Ensemble, opening this weekend at the Callboard Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not Brecht's most well-known work," noted director Charles Otte. "It's 
his first play; as such the seeds of his future work can be found here: 
anti-Expressionism, but using Expressionism as a means to accomplish that end. 
It deals with a poet named Baal: one of the first anti-heroes, a negative 
Everyman who goes through life taking advantage of everyone. He ends up killing 
a couple of women, his best friend, and drinking his way into oblivion -- in a 
funny kind of way. It's quite black humor." 
</P>
<P>
Otte, whose collaborators have included Philip Glass, Andrei Serban and Peter 
Sellars, counts himself as a longtime Brecht fan. 
</P>
<P>
"His work encompasses so many aspects of theater," Otte said. "Brecht believed 
in theater that communicated with an audience on more than a story (telling) 
level -- but at the same time, he hated the idea of an intellectual exercise 
with people sitting around discussing the meaning of life. So he made use of it 
as theater: wrote pieces that not only present a story or event but commented 
on it -- perhaps in song or poetry. You never lose that sense of theatricality, 
of being live. It says, 'This is performance.' " 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Reza Abdoh and Mira-Lani Oglesby's "Minamata," a multimedia 
piece about environmental pollution, has opened at the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center. Abdoh directs. (See related article, Page 4.) 
</P>
<P>
The Times' Don Shirley found that "images and sounds sometimes coalesce into 
arresting patterns that begin to make a giant statement about the cultural 
imperatives that plunder our planet. Just as often, though, the primary purpose 
appears to be to show off the fecundity of Abdoh's imagination and the 
extraordinary versatility of his cast. . . . Even at its worst, however, this 
is a remarkable production." 
</P>
<P>
From Tom Jacobs in The Daily News: "This latest work by the imaginative young 
director is 30-40 minutes too long. Like a lot of non-linear theater, it is at 
times self-indulgent and unfocused. And yet, unlike a lot of non-linear 
theater, it is unquestionably about something. This is an intellectually 
probing work, as well as a genuinely angry one." 
</P>
<P>
Said the Herald Examiner's Richard Stayton: "(It) is remarkable, courageous, an 
invaluable artistic reaction to our perilously self-indulgent age. Everyone who 
is interested in the survival of humankind and of theater must witness it. But 
there is a delicate line between outrage and the outrageous. So 'Minamata' is 
also repetitive, ridiculous, a maddeningly opaque defiance of audience 
identification. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Grumped Steve Mikulan in the L.A. Weekly: "Abdoh has in the past succeeded in 
wedding the most striking imagery with tauntingly enigmatic texts. In 
'Minamata' he has failed to join the two, producing instead a series of 
startling pictures that vainly chase an elusive story. The result is a 
catastrophic bore." 
</P>
<P>
Said the Orange County Register's Jeff Rubio: "The hurricane rush of images and 
ideas can be very confusing, even desensitizing. And after one viewing it's 
impossible to say how much is simply the result of confusion on the author's 
part. No matter. Even if one becomes a bit numbed by the torrent, 'Minamata' is 
a full-scale assault on theatrical conventions that reverberates in the 
memory." 
</P>
<P>
John Mahoney of the Downtown News found "a very polished production of a 
self-indulgent conception. One is reminded that Laurence Olivier might well 
give a dazzling, varied and disciplined performance of the telephone Yellow 
Pages, but we wouldn't be likely to shout 'Author! Author!' " 
</P>
<P>
And from the Outlook's Sandra Kreiswirth: "(Abdoh) has pushed his own envelope 
with two hours of exciting, confusing, self-important, lyrical, moralistic 
theater in a startling production not soon to be forgotten. You'll either be 
fascinated by what you see -- although there's too much of it -- or you'll 
sneak out early. There's not a lot of middle ground here."

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: MORRIS AND COMPANY SHOW TOUGH SKIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK A. FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Morris expected to receive a few negative reviews after he shocked a 
Brussels audience last month by stripping naked with his Monnaie Dance Group, 
but the bitterness of the criticism in the press still surprised the company's 
management. 
</P>
<P>
General manager Barry Alterman, referring to the deluge of scathing articles 
that appeared after the April 23 closing performance of "Mythologies," said: "I 
was expecting bad reviews on this show because it's a challenging show for many 
people. What I didn't expect was this xenophobia. We didn't expect that, with 
newspaper headlines saying, "Go Home!" 
</P>
<P>
Morris, the American choreographer who concluded his first season as director 
of the Brussels-based ballet company, told Belgian reporters he also thought 
their reaction was "slightly xenophobic," especially since "Mythologies," which 
had its premiere in Boston in 1986, recently got rave reviews in London. 
</P>
<P>
But several critics were not so taken with Morris' latest work, which had as 
its finale a striptease, with the entire cast standing naked. The French 
newspapers Le Figaro and Le Soir both attacked the performance -- one labeling 
"Mythologies" "American Burlesque," while the other, with a headline that read 
"Mark Morris, Go Home!," speculated whether Morris had staged a "suicidal 
counter-performance or a provocation." 
</P>
<P>
"The press just took exception to one of the shows we presented. Real vehement 
exception," said Alterman. "But we're still here. They didn't run us out on a 
rail." 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who has a three-year contract with the Monnaie, said in a recent 
published interview that he thought his publicly admitted homosexuality might 
also have had something to do with the poor reviews he received. 
</P>
<P>
Alterman said the flurry of bad press won't keep the dance group from 
fulfilling its upcoming tour schedule, which begins with benefit performances 
at the Dance Theater Workshop in New York this month. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a life-threatening situation," Alterman said. 
</P>
<P>
ARMENIAN OPERAS: The Alexander Spendarian State Opera and Ballet Theatre of 
Armenia will present two Armenian operas, "Anoush" and "Arshak II," at the 
Wiltern Theatre May 24-28. 
</P>
<P>
"Anoush" will be performed May 24 and May 26-27. "Arshak II" will be on May 25 
and May 28. All performances are at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The company singers will also offer a recital program June 2. 
</P>
<P>
Tigran Levonian will direct the company of 155 singers, dancers and musicians 
in the U.S. premiere of the two operas. This tour is cited as the first time a 
state opera theater company from a Soviet republic has been allowed to travel 
outside the U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
"Arshak II," translated into Armenian from Italian by Thomas Terzian in 1868 
but called the first truly Armenian opera, is based on the life of a 
4th-Century king who fought to unify Armenia. Bass Barsegh Toumanian will sing 
the lead role, with soprano Hasmik Papian singing the role of Olympia, the 
queen. 
</P>
<P>
"For these performers, coming to America is a dream come true," said producer 
Varter Karagoz. "They are very satisfied they're coming, because there were 
more who wanted to come than we could invite." 
</P>
<P>
According to Karagoz, close to 300 members of the company vied for a place on 
this tour. Of the 100 soloists in the company, only 26 were chosen. 
</P>
<P>
On June 2, the company's orchestra and soloists will present a concert at the 
Wiltern featuring tenor Gegham Grigorian singing Armenian folk songs and works 
by Rossini, Verdi and others. 
</P>
<P>
The elaborate sets for "Arshak II" are designed by Yevgeni Safranov. Yuri 
Davtian will conduct the orchestra with Ashot Asatrian as ballet master. 
</P>
<P>
After Los Angeles, the company will perform in New York's Carnegie Hall, Boston 
and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 480-3232. 
</P>
<P>
WATTS CANCELS: Pianist Andre Watts, who postponed his April 26 recital at 
Pasadena's Ambassador Auditorium because of illness, will not reschedule his 
performance. Ticket refunds will be available at points of purchase on or 
before June 16. Information: (818) 304-6161. 
</P>
<P>
ANOTHER INSTITUTE: For a second summer, cellist Lynn Harrell will again serve 
as artistic director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute, one of the more 
visible educational arms of the orchestra. On the faculty for 1989 will be 
conductors Yuri Temirkanov, David Zinman, the Swiss musician Mario Venzago, 
Neeme Jarvi, Polish composer Witold Lutoslawski (who will conduct a program of 
his own music at UCLA) and the Emerson Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Fleischmann, managing director of the Philharmonic and founder of the 
Institute, told The Times that chamber ensembles made up of Institute orchestra 
players will again give public concerts at a number of venues around the city. 
And, besides its three scheduled Hollywood Bowl appearances (July 16 and 30, 
and Aug. 13), the 100-member LAPO Institute Orchestra will perform four 
concerts in Royce Hall at UCLA.

ALBUM REVIEW: '9';

PUBLIC IMAGE LTD. "9." VIRGIN. **

<P>
Relentlessly witty, acerbic and outspoken, Johnny Lydon is a great personality. 
He should have his own counterculture talk show -- then he wouldn't feel 
compelled to make records as mundane as "9." Were it any other musician, "9" 
might coast by on its big, bombastic, made-for-KROQ propulsion, its expert 
musicianship, its incorporation of Arabic tonalities and Brit-funk rhythms into 
a wall of murk. 
</P>
<P>
But we're dealing with the formative figurehead of punk-rock (Sex Pistols) and 
what came after (PiL's original spacey, free-form meanderings). Lydon's 
sneering wail is intact (if buried in the mix), but considering that his past 
work included searing, scabrous views of abortion (the Pistols' "Bodies") and 
hallucinogenic jabs against capitalism (PiL's "Careering"), things like "9's" 
banal warnings about a "Brave New World" seem pretty vacant. Only a facsimile 
of his former rotten self, Lydon proclaims at one point, "I am a warrior! I 
take no prisoners!" Adam Ant couldn't have expressed it better. CRAIG LEE 
Ratings are based on a scale from one (poor) to five (excellent) stars.

LISA LISA &amp; CULT JAM "Straight to the Sky." Columbia ** 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Lisa, the high priestess of hip-hop, flounders this time. Each of her 
first two albums was loaded with excellent cuts, but after two top-notch 
tracks, "Little Jackie Wants to Be a Star" and "Just Git It Together," "Sky" 
suffers a huge drop in quality. The Full Force production team dresses up the 
so-so songs with high-tech razzle-dazzle, but can't camouflage all the 
structural flaws. The 
</P>
<P>
grooves on the dance tunes -- which make up the bulk of the album -- are 
sizzling, even when the vocals and lyrics are sub-par. "Dance Forever" is an 
example of a song with a superb rhythm track and not much else. And instead of 
her usual emotional and conviction-filled singing, Lisa Lisa sounds shrill and 
aloof most of the time, resembling a bargain-basement Diana Ross. DENNIS HUNT

CYNDI LAUPER "A Night to Remember." Epic ** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
The girl doesn't just want to have fun. She wants to sell records. For Lauper, 
who slipped commercially after her smash 1983 debut, that means playing it 
straight with her third album. Lauper's old goofiness is gone, replaced now by 
sober professionalism. "A Night to Remember" is a polished work that is catchy 
and well-crafted, consistently well-sung and disappointingly conventional. 
</P>
<P>
Lauper covers all stylistic bases in a something-for-everyone fashion that 
belies 
</P>
<P>
an eye toward mega-sales. The assortment includes fervent ballads, snappy 
dance-rock tunes, a solidly straightforward rocker after the style of "Money 
Changes Everything," and incongruous opening and closing snippets of old-timey 
Appalachian folk. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the songs are one-dimensional affairs. Lauper and her cadre of 
established hitmaking songsmiths go for a bland simplicity that has little room 
for the well-turned phrase or the specific imagery and hint of emotional 
ambiguity that can give pure pop some staying power. The best songs cast Lauper 
in the role of a woman emerging from bad relationships: "Like a Cat," with its 
taunting put-down of a domineering lover, and the more aching "Heading West" 
and "I Don't Want To Be Your Friend," which resembles a Joan Armatrading song 
in its dusky emotionalism. 
</P>
<P>
Lauper, an inventive, versatile singer, proves here that she doesn't need her 
old dizzy image to get by. But it would be nice to hear her push her talent 
with songs that don't just skim the surface. MIKE BOEHM

RECORD RACKHEAD MANIACS: BIG ISSUES: POP STARS ***** GREAT BALLS OF FIRE ****

10,000 MANIACS "Blind Man's Zoo." Elektra **** 
</P>
<P>
The soothing, distinctly unmaniacal single "Trouble Me" is a real salve for 
damaged ears and emotions, as Natalie Merchant sweetly coos, "Trouble me, 
disturb me with all your cares and your worries . . . Why let your shoulders 
bend underneath this burden when my back is sturdy and strong?" 
</P>
<P>
It's a wonderful invitation to gentle, unburdened intimacy -- and a misleading 
</P>
<P>
one. For Merchant spends the rest of 10,000 Maniacs' third album troubling us 
with a litany of societal evils. And her lilting voice is such a captivating 
instrument -- and the pop setting so deceptively pretty, yet structurally 
unusual -- that even the socially unconscious may be a captive audience for her 
horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
The album begins bittersweetly with an accidental pregnancy (the bouncy "Eat 
for Two") and ends in an inferno with a demented church janitor torching an 
interracial nightclub (the string-laden "Jubilee"). In between these short 
stories come big issues: covert "freedom-fighter" missions, Vietnam, the 
American slave trade, the environment. Set in prose form on the lyric sheet, 
the almost impossibly unwieldy verses read as fine as they sound. 
</P>
<P>
Warning to hepsters: This is a pop album, elegantly produced by Peter Asher, 
who has carefully loosed the "alternative" shackle and made the group suitable 
for VH-1, to much elitist consternation.

CAROLE KING "City Streets." Capitol *** 
</P>
<P>
This is an encouraging step for King, whose albums in the past dozen years have 
had little of the melodic sense and conversational tone that made "Tapestry" 
and its successors so appealing. The album contains too much filler to be 
considered a complete return to form, but its best moments suggest that King is 
finally back on track. The title song, a taut, mid-tempo rocker with a tasty 
Eric Clapton guitar solo, is King's best single since "Jazzman" 15 years ago. 
"Someone Who Believes in You," one of two songs King wrote with longtime 
partner Gerry Goffin, would have been right at home on "Tapestry": It's warm 
and sentimental without being syrupy. Those waiting for King's "Private Dancer" 
or "Graceland" -- a consistent, convincing comeback statement -- will have to 
keep waiting, but at least there are few new King classics to enjoy in the 
meantime. PAUL GREIN

PICTORIALIST'S ART OF '20S-'30S AT JAPANESE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An exhibit that evokes a long-gone era of Japanese culture opens May 21 at the 
Japanese American Cultural and Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
"The Photography of Teikoh Shiotani," through July 12, features 53 images from 
the '20s and '30s by the Japanese pictorialist whose images have been compared 
to those of Jacques Henri-Lartigue. 
</P>
<P>
"The show contains mostly landscapes and genre scenes," said Robert Hori, 
director of the center's Doizaki Gallery. "Shiotani was from Tottori 
Prefecture, a province on the coast, so there are a lot of scenes of fishing 
and the sea. The area also featured large sand dunes, which he photographed." 
</P>
<P>
Shot in soft focus, many of the sepia-toned pictures look like etchings, Hori 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very nostalgic and I think the many older Japanese-Americans living 
here will appreciate that feeling. There's a sense of a Japan that doesn't 
exist anymore, an agrarian and pre-industrial Japan. There's a serenity that 
you don't see nowadays." 
</P>
<P>
Shiotani's works fell into obscurity until the early 1980s when interest in 
Pictorialism was renewed. However, toward the end of his career, he received 
highest honors at Photokina, a major international photographic exhibition, 
which won the artist recognition as a world-class photographer, Hori said. 
</P>
<P>
REBUILDING: Pauli DeWitt has been named executive director of the Woman's 
Building. She succeeds Terry Wolverton, who recently resigned to write a book. 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt, who assumed the post this week, was executive director of the Napa 
County Arts Council and previously associated with the Oklahoma Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
"DeWitt had all the different kinds of expertise we were looking for, a long 
history in arts management and a real effervescence and enthusiasm for the 
position," said Wolverton. 
</P>
<P>
JUST LIKE NEW: Eight artists have been awarded $500 each to restore their 
murals in the Emergency Relief Fund for Mural Restoration sponsored by the 
Social and Public Art Resource Center. The artists are Wallace (Rip) Cronk, 
Larry Gruda, Arthur Mortimer, Frank Romero, Ann Thierman, Richard Wyatt, Emily 
Cordova and Henry Brown III. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE AIR: The Museum of Contemporary Art is broadcasting its experimental 
radio series, "The Territory of Art," over station KCRW-FM (89.9) through the 
summer on Tuesdays at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The radio programs, most of which have been previously aired, are half-hour 
performances of contemporary music, poetry, comedy, drama and various forms of 
"audio art" such as poetic collages of language, music and sound. They are 
created by painters, poets, playwrights, actors, dancers, composers, musicians 
and other artists. 
</P>
<P>
Some upcoming programs include "Border-X-Frontera," on Tuesday, by Gomez-Pena 
and David Schein; "Catalyst to an Image," on May 23, by four photographers; and 
"Song of Lawino," on May 30, based on the poetry of Okot p'Bitek. 
</P>
<P>
A series of new radio works will be broadcast on KCRW beginning in October. 
</P>
<P>
STUDY HARD: The J. Paul Getty Trust has awarded another round of research 
grants and fellowships to 22 art history and humanities scholars from around 
the world. Fifteen scholars who received their doctorates within the past six 
years were each awarded $23,000 fellowships for a year of research and writing. 
Seven scholars who are beyond the postdoctoral level received 1989 grants of 
varying amounts to pursue advanced research projects. 
</P>
<P>
In the former category, the America-based winners are Hilary Ballon, S. Shelby 
Brown, Renee K. George Burnam, Elizabeth Childs-Johnson, Maribeth Graybill, 
Susanne Kuechler, Mary Linda, David Lubin, Jann Matlock, Mary Pardo, Nancy 
Stieber, Joan Weinstein and Jean Wilson. Foreign winners in this category are 
Helene Eristov of France and Jill Lloyd of London. 
</P>
<P>
In the latter category, the American-based winners are Mieke Bal, Thomas 
Mathews, Jeffrey Meikle, Anthony Molho, Barbara Stafford and Nancy Shatzman 
Steinhardt. The foreign winner is Eve Blau of Canada.

TAPAS: INSTANT GRATIFICATION; 
</P>
<P>
TWO NEW RESTAURANTS WHERE A TOSTADA IS A PIECE OF TOAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tasca, 6266 1/2 Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood. (213) 465-7747. Open 
Monday-Saturday for lunch and dinner; for dinner only on Sunday. Full bar. 
Street parking. American Express, Visa and MasterCard accepted. Dinner for two 
(food only): $25-$50. 
</P>
<P>
 From Spain, 11510 West Pico Boulevard, W. Los Angeles. (213) 479-6740. Open 
Monday-Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday for dinner only. This week only: 
open Sunday, closed Monday. Beer and wine. Street parking (difficult). All 
major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two (food only): $25-$45. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three important things to remember about tapas, the so-called 
"little bites" of Spain: 
</P>
<P>
(1) They aren't dinner. The word tapa itself derives from the verb tapar, to 
cover or stop up, and the original tapas were light snacks served on little 
plates set on top of glasses of sherry, wine or beer -- to keep the flies out, 
it is said. Though the definition of tapas has widened considerably over the 
years, tapas are still basically bar food -- the Spanish version of peanuts and 
hard-boiled eggs, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
(2) With the exception of certain specialty items (mountain ham, fresh prawns 
and the like) tapas don't cost very much. If it sets you back as much as $5 or 
$6 a serving, chances are it ain't no tapa. 
</P>
<P>
 (3) To paraphrase Lawrence Durrell, instantaneousness is implicit in tapas as 
gravitation is inherent in mass. In other words, tapas are not cooked to order. 
They're already there -- on or behind the bar -- at room temperature. You see 
something you want, you point to it and it appears magically on a plate in 
front of you. Tapas are instant gratification. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of these criteria, the new Spanish restaurant in Hollywood called 
Tasca (a tasca is a tapas bar) doesn't fare very well. It cooks most of its 
tapas to order, charges as much as $5 or $6 for at least some of them and 
encourages patrons to make a whole dinner of them. But owner Rafael Gordon and 
chef Eduardo Apitz do serve Spanish and nearly-Spanish food that is as good as 
any I've had in Los Angeles -- and if it isn't absolutely authentic, well, who 
cares? 
</P>
<P>
The best way to approach Tasca (not to be confused with La Tasca, farther east 
on Sunset) is to go with a party of four or more. Order six or eight dishes 
that sound appealing (the menu descriptions are detailed and reasonably 
accurate); reorder the ones you like and add a few new choices. Keep on going 
until you've had enough, and then stop. 
</P>
<P>
There's no real structure to a meal like this, no beginning/middle/end. It's 
just one delicious, vividly flavored "little bite" of something after another. 
For instance (and I list them in run-on order because that's exactly how the 
diner at Tasca will encounter them): calamares a la romana, fried squid that's 
tender, light, crisp, not greasy in the least . . . sweet red peppers, either 
roasted in an olive-oil dressing or sauteed with oil and garlic . . . mild, 
creamy salt cod and potato fritters (croquetas de bacalao) with an unusual 
sauce of champagne, butter and assorted fresh herbs that seems to have almost 
the flavor of fresh peas . . . pulpo, or octopus, in two forms, marinated in 
vinaigrette and braised a la gallega in a nicely-rounded but not very spicy 
paprika sauce . . . unusual empanadas, stuffed either with shredded chicken or 
ground lamb, the latter mixed with pine nuts and raisins and both tasting 
almost (East) Indian in their attractive, sweetish pungency . . . extraordinary 
boquerones, small white-fleshed anchovies pickled with plenty of garlic and the 
quick bite of hot red pepper . . . a credible if not exceptional wedge of 
tortilla Espanola, the firm potato omelette that is practically the national 
dish of Spain . . . the popular Venezuelan hors d'oeuvre known as tequenos, 
sticks of cotija cheese dipped in batter and deep-fried . . . an agreeable 
mushlike salad of eggplant, garlic and tomato . . . and, finally, a 
surprisingly delicious potato salad, patatas con alcaparras y aneldo, flavored 
with capers, dill and orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more substantial non-tapas offered are pescado a la andaluza made 
with sea bass of passable quality and perfectly deep-fried (on the basis of 
this dish and the aforementioned calamares, it seems safe to say that chef 
Apitz understands the craft of deep-frying unusually well), and an item rather 
portentiously named "El Cordero," or "The Lamb," which is lamb loin stuffed 
with ham, spinach and Manchego cheese cut into rounds and arranged atop a 
large, thin lengthwise slice of eggplant sauteed in a cilantro and basil 
batter. The whole thing is moistened with a serious red wine sauce. When a 
group of us ordered two portions of The Lamb one evening, the meat in one case 
came out with a musty left-over-in-the-refrigerator taste; in the other case, 
the dish was fresh and wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
The wine list is perfunctory but fairly priced (1986 Sonoma-Cutrer Russian 
River Ranches Chardonnay at $20 and 1984 Joseph Phelps Napa Valley Cabernet 
Sauvignon at $22 are the most expensive table wines). Unfortunately, it offers 
only four Spanish wines (not counting sherry), none particularly distinguished 
-- plus a drinkable Chardonnay and Cabernet from Chile (at $13 and $15, 
respectively). 
</P>
<P>
The dining room is blessedly free from the usual Spanish-restaurant cliches 
(bullfight posters, wrought-iron gratings, etc.). Instead it has a clean, 
pleasantly rustic look, with whitewashed walls, red tile floors, and beam 
ceilings -- a nice place to relax as the tapas issue forth. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: patatas con alcaparras y aneldo ($2.95), pulpo a la gallega 
($3.95), boquerones en vinagre ($3.95), croquetas de bacalao ($4.55), calamares 
a la romana ($4.95), empanadas ($5.95), El Cordero ($8.95). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another new addition to the city's small Spanish restaurant population is a 
simple storefront 
</P>
<P>
in West Los Angeles called From Spain. Here, there are bullfight posters (and 
photos) on the wall as part of a functional decor that includes pistachio-green 
polyester tableclothes and auditorium-style folding chairs. The chef and owner 
of the place is Juan Rodriguez, who hails from Badalona, a seaside town a few 
miles from Barcelona. For a time, he cooked at the now-closed Barcelona 
restaurant in Santa Monica and then at Miami Spice, a flashy Cuban place in 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez marks a portion of his menu tapas, but From Spain is more a 
conventional restaurant than a tapas bar, and the dishes so identified serve 
very well as just plain appetizers. Some of them are very good -- for instance, 
delicious medium-sized mussels, well-cleaned and glazed with cream and white 
wine; a dish identified as boquerones a la plancha, not the tiny anchovylike 
fish mentioned above but fresh sardines -- truly a delicious variety of fish -- 
grilled perfectly and scattered with bits of well-browned garlic; and some 
excellent Spanish-style chorizo sausage (from a producer in San Jose, Calif.), 
thinly sliced and sauteed in olive oil. The roasted red peppers are just fine, 
too, but the anchovies that supposedly accompany them have been applied with a 
very light hand. Pan con jamon, literally "bread with ham," which is, in fact, 
the ubiquitous Catalan snack of bread rubbed with the cut side of a fresh 
half-tomato, seasoned with olive oil and salt and served with ham or anchovies, 
is made with very good bread and very good ham (also from San Jose) -- but the 
bread, on at least one occasion, was dry, as if the tomatoes weren't juicy 
enough and the oil had perhaps been added by the same person responsible for 
putting anchovies on the roasted pepper. 
</P>
<P>
From Spain offers a number of fish and seafood dishes as main courses (i.e., 
grilled baby salmon with spicy tomato sauce and a version of the Catalan 
seafood stew called sarsuela), but the kitchen seems more confident with such 
straightforward, hearty meat dishes as chuletas de puerco, chewy but flavorful 
grilled pork chops with a sweet red pepper sauce; chuletas de cordero, grilled 
thin lamb chops with a wonderfully intense alioli (a sort of garlic mayonnaise) 
on the side, or an occasional special of cochinillo, crisp roasted suckling 
pig, served in ample quantity to the accompaniment of a plate of roasted 
peppers. Crema Catalana, the Catalan version of creme brulee, is appropriately 
crisp on top and creamy underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Torres house wines -- red, white, and rose -- at $12 a bottle accompany the 
food here more than adequately, but a small selection of other good Spanish 
vintages is offered -- including 1983 C.U.N.E. Rioja at $16, 1971 Marques de 
Carceres Rioja Riserva at $29, and 1971 Torres Gran Coronas Black Label at $40. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: chorizo frito ($4.50), boquerones a la plancha ($4.95), 
chuletas de puerco ($9.95), chuletas de cordero ($13.95), cochinillo ($15.95), 
crema Catalana ($2.95).

While I agree with Boyd that "it's high time someone set the record straight on 
when the first TV movie was made," his assignation of that honor to NBC's "The 
Pied Piper of Hamelin" is seriously misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
During the first season of "Playhouse 90" on CBS (1956-57), no fewer than 10 of 
this renowned live drama show's 39 presentations were feature-length films 
produced especially for television. (The first was "The Country Husband," based 
on a John Cheever story, which aired on Nov. 1, 1956.) It seems to me that 
these qualify as "made-for-TV movies" by any but the most hair-splitting 
definition. 
</P>
<P>
Even these had at least one antecedent, however: a 72-minute film called "Black 
Forest," starring Peggy Ann Garner and Akim Tamiroff, made in Germany by an 
American company, for distribution to independent stations. Variety reviewed 
this production on Feb. 3, 1954, noting that "the 'expressly-for-TV' angle 
lends itself strongly to prestige-type ballyhoo on the part of station and 
sponsor, and its effect on the public is not to be minimized."

ARGUING THE RACE OF 'THE MOST FASCINATING FIGURE IN HISTORY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kiela Jamal (Letters, May 7) is incorrect in describing Cleopatra as black. 
</P>
<P>
No ancient writer indicates that she was black. Had she been so, the 
propagandists of her arch enemy, Octavian (later Emperor Augustus), would have 
publicized this in the most scathing terms. 
</P>
<P>
Writing less than 100 years after Cleopatra's death, the Roman poet Lucan 
described her "white breasts" revealed by the Sidonian fabric of her garment. 
</P>
<P>
Three portrait heads of Cleopatra have come down to us. I am happy to own a 
cast of the finest of these, which resides in the Antikenmuseum in West Berlin 
(see photos). The countenance is emphatically Greek. There is also an ancient 
wall painting of her in the National Museum of Archeology in Naples. It depicts 
her with fair skin and reddish-brown hair. 
</P>
<P>
In closing, I would like to remind everyone that the color of a person's skin 
ought to be an insignificant matter. Whether black, white, red or yellow, 
Cleopatra would remain quite the most fascinating figure in history.

 (Jamal's letter was a reply to Bob Stanford's April 30 letter, in which 
Stanford reacted to a quote from film maker Spike Lee. Patrick Goldstein's 
April 17 article, part of a series on the black experience in Hollywood, quoted 
Lee as saying, "Listen, lots of people -- even black people -- think Cleopatra 
was a white woman just 'cause Elizabeth Taylor played her in the movie.")

RUNAWAY PRODUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I never cease to be astonished by the cavalier and indifferent attitude that 
Hollywood and Los Angeles project toward the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all the publicity and self-congratulatory hoopla over Disney's new theme 
park and production facility in Orlando, Fla., did no one realize that what we 
have here is the most aggressive display of runaway production yet? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Hollywood studios have always been notorious for their lack of 
community involvement, but to see the unions, craft people and guilds yawn 
blithely while the industry drifts out of the city and the state is shocking. 
</P>
<P>
These production facilities do not mean more production: They mean that 
production that was done here will not be in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Disney/MGM and Universal, which also will soon open a theme park/production 
center in Florida, have not spent a billion dollars just to let facilities lie 
empty. They will be forced to use the facilities to justify the enormous 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you, Disney, MCA and MGM for having such a sense of loyalty to this great 
city. Thank you for keeping the faith with the people who have made the 
industry great. 
</P>
<P>
And when the dusts of unemployment blow down the streets of Hollywood, what 
difference could it make? Disney has created Hollywood in a theme park. A park 
without people, tradition or history. A park without a soul. A park without 
weeds, dreams or problems. A hollow replica of the great Dream Factory. 
</P>
<P>
What else could we expect from the masters of the automaton? Certainly nothing 
so human as gratitude.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1969, when I was 17, I saw "Once Upon a Time in the West" during a vacation 
in Las Vegas. Sergio Leone was my favorite director, and I was pleased to have 
an opportunity to see his latest film before it opened in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, 165 minutes long, was a masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Later I saw the motion picture in Los Angeles. I was shocked to find that it 
had been cut to 140 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Lionel Stander's role was gone even though he still appeared in the credits, 
and Jason Robards' death scene was removed even though Charles Bronson was 
shown carrying someone's body on the horse behind him in the end credits. 
</P>
<P>
When the film arrived on television the edited scenes were restored. Only 
recently has the film played uncut theatrically. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Sergio Leone recently brought back this memory. I am pleased that 
this film and "Once Upon a Time in America," which had suffered a similar fate, 
were restored and fully appreciated during his lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
As the years go by I have no doubt that Leone will be listed among the great 
directors, even though he made only six films in 20 years. Art and appreciation 
both take time.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / PAUL R. KRUGMAN: WARNING FROM THE MONETARY FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL R. KRUGMAN, PAUL R. KRUGMAN is professor of economics at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every April, the International Monetary Fund issues its World Economic Outlook 
-- a book-length compendium of analysis, data, and forecasts. Despite the 
leaden prose that is unavoidable in such a bureaucratic production, 
international economists prize these volumes. They are extremely useful sources 
of data. The topical analysis is usually sharp and even provocative, reflecting 
the high quality of the IMF's staff, and there is a kind of pleasure in reading 
between the discreetly euphemistic lines to figure out what the IMF really 
thinks. 
</P>
<P>
This year's report is a particularly interesting specimen. It comes at a time 
when the markets appear to be fairly optimistic about the international 
monetary system: The dollar is rising, bank stocks and the secondary prices of 
Latin American debt have risen on hopes that the plan by Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady will offer a solution, fears of inflation are subsiding. It 
is therefore a bit of a shock to read the IMF's outlook and discover a 
cautiously worded but nonetheless ominous warning. In effect, the theme of this 
year's report is that things are not under control -- that the current 
stability in the world economy is the calm before the storm. 
</P>
<P>
Now of course the IMF never says this in any such forthright terms. The warning 
must be extracted from mind-numbing references to "the 'tensions' in the 
'reference scenario'." Nonetheless, the gloominess of the IMF staff is apparent 
to anyone accustomed to reading this kind of document. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the IMF's concern is its conclusion that the balance of 
payments deficit of the United States and the corresponding balance of payments 
surpluses of Japan and West Germany are all going to get wider, not narrower, 
from now on. This may come as a surprise to many people -- weren't we talking 
about a U.S. export boom just a few months ago? But the IMF thinks that the 
export boom, sparked by the fall in the dollar in 1985 and 1986, has now run 
its course. With the boom played out, longer-term forces will cause our 
deficit, and the West German and Japanese surpluses, to start growing again. 
</P>
<P>
Why this pessimism? The basic point is that unless something -- such as the 
exchange rate -- changes, a position of massive U.S. deficit and equally 
massive West German and Japanese surplus is virtually bound to get worse over 
time. For one thing, there is what some people call the "gap factor": Inflation 
and economic growth tend to raise the dollar value of everything, including 
deficits and surpluses. So if you start with a big deficit or surplus, you can 
expect to see it get even bigger. 
</P>
<P>
For example, over the next five years it is a good guess that Japan will 
increase the dollar value of both its exports and its imports by something like 
60% -- and therefore increase its trade surplus by around 60%, too. The 
converse is true for the United States. Since this country is so deep in the 
red to start with, and West Germany and Japan so far in the black, the "gap 
factor" implies a persistent trend toward worsening imbalances unless there are 
strong countervailing forces. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being offset, however, the gap factor will be reinforced by a second 
factor: the growing foreign debt of the United States and the growing foreign 
assets of West Germany and Japan. Increasingly, the U.S. deficit will be 
swollen by the interest we pay to foreign creditors and the dividends that U.S. 
subsidiaries of foreign firms pay to their owners. West Germany and Japan, as 
the world's main creditor nations, will correspondingly find their surpluses 
magnified. 
</P>
<P>
As the IMF sees it, then, the period of international optimism in 1987 and 
1988, when the U.S. trade deficit finally seemed to be coming down, is going to 
turn out to have been a false dawn. From now on, we will be back in a world of 
seemingly inexorable growth in the U.S. deficit. The economic dangers inherent 
in such a world are obvious enough. The IMF's guardedly described "market 
reaction scenario" is one in which the dollar crashes, leading to inflation in 
the United States and recession in the rest of the world, and precipitating a 
debt service crisis in the already troubled Third World. In the report, this 
scenario is presented only vaguely so that we have no idea quite what the 
potential fall in the dollar is likely to be. 
</P>
<P>
But we can look at other estimates. A new book by William Cline of the 
Institute for International Economics carries out an analysis that looks very 
similar to that of the IMF and arrives at the conclusion that even in a 
favorable adjustment scenario the mark and the yen will need to rise 23% and 
28% respectively against the dollar. In the disorderly run on the dollar that 
the IMF evidently regards as a serious possibility the numbers would be larger: 
A dollar-yen rate of 100 or even 90, compared to the current rate of about 135, 
is far from impossible. 
</P>
<P>
The political dangers of a world where deficits start growing again are also 
obvious. What will even the most internationally minded members of Congress say 
to constituents demanding protectionist measures? What will the political 
reaction be as the pace of foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms accelerates, with 
accusations that the weak dollar is leading to a "fire sale" of our assets? 
What will be the consequences of worsening imbalances for our relations with 
West Germany and Japan, which are already strained for other reasons? Warnings 
about "hard landings" are nothing new in international economics. What makes 
this warning interesting is the source and the timing. The IMF, a supremely 
cautious institution, is interrupting us in a moment of apparent calm to tell 
us that things cannot go on as they have, that something fairly drastic has to 
be done. 
</P>
<P>
But a call for effective action from the Big Three economies seems almost pure 
fantasy. In the United States, the Bush Administration evidently feels no 
urgency about economic policy (or much else). Meanwhile, both West Germany and 
Japan are ruled by weak governments whose popularity has been undermined by 
non-economic issues. No matter how certain the prospect that a crisis is 
developing, nothing is going to be done until it actually hits. When the IMF 
talks, nobody listens.

THE FOCUS OF ANTI-TOBACCO CAMPAIGNS SHOULD SHIFT TO PUBLICATIONS THAT CARRY 
CIGARETTE ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article describing the moral issues faced by the advertising companies that 
create ads for tobacco products was interesting, but I felt that it was a bit 
off the mark. ("A Matter of Conscience: Doonesbury Strip Draws Ad Agency 
Creative Types Into Moral Fray Over Assignments," May 2.) 
</P>
<P>
The real focus of the article should have been on the thousands of magazines 
and newspapers that publish the slick ads created by the advertising companies. 
After all, it is these newspapers and magazines that really do the work of 
spreading the messages of the tobacco companies and thus help perpetuate the 
use and addiction to the most deadly drug in our country. 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry knows that the $2.4 billion it spends each year on 
promotion and advertising can buy the conscience and loyalty of almost any 
publication or group. An advertising manager who would be aghast and outraged 
if a major cocaine dealer tried to run an ad for cocaine thinks nothing of 
taking huge sums of money from the tobacco industry, whose products kill and 
injure thousands of times more people than illicit drugs ever will. 
</P>
<P>
A related, and highly disturbing issue, is the way tobacco companies have 
branched out into hundreds of non-tobacco industries. This now allows them to 
subtly blackmail magazine and newspaper editors with the implied loss of 
non-tobacco advertising if any articles are published that are overly critical 
of the tobacco industry or if the publications refuse to carry tobacco ads. 
</P>
<P>
Your article also quoted a tobacco industry spokesman giving the standard line 
that the tobacco industry does not want kids to begin smoking. What hogwash! 
With the tobacco industry losing more than 300,000 of its best customers every 
single year to tobacco-caused illnesses, it must recruit young replacement 
smokers to stay in business. Many tobacco ads are so obviously aimed at the 
youth market that only the hopelessly naive or tobacco company executives 
themselves could really believe that the industry doesn't want to seduce young, 
impressionable kids into becoming tobacco addicts. 
</P>
<P>
I think that all magazine and newspaper editors should take a hard look at 
themselves and ask themselves if they have sold out their morals and 
consciences to the tobacco industry, and thus become accomplices in thee deaths 
of over 300,000 people each year in this country.

IS CONSUMERISM A REBEL CAUSE?; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC OPINION WATCHERS SEE A MOVEMENT BUT AREN'T SURE IT CAN BE CALLED A 
REVOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On several fronts, consumerism appears to be on the rise. Consumers have 
protested everything from the handling of the Exxon Valdez oil spill to the 
rise of "reality-based" television to the use of pesticides. Earlier this 
month, another blow was struck for consumerism when the U.S. Supreme Court 
upheld most of California's Proposition 103 initiative to tighten regulation of 
the insurance industry. Does all of this signal the start of a powerful and 
widespread consumer revolt? What's influencing the changing mood of consumers, 
and what are its implications? Times researcher Melanie Pickett raised these 
questions with various people who keep a close eye on public opinion, and 
excerpts of their comments follow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization: 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing to recognize is that a Populist attitude toward 
American business is a fundamental American value. Americans consistently 
believe that companies have profits that are way too large, and feel that large 
companies have too much power. And when they see incidents such as Valdez, or 
they read about pesticide pollution or what have you, it strikes a chord that 
resonates with the public. They are situations that tap into people's general 
distrust of business. Whether consumerism will become once again a very 
focused, crystallized movement in the way it was in the early '70s, I don't 
know. I don't have any evidence of that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"One of the important values that animates public opinion is the suspicion of 
business. . . . What our studies show is that the feeling is greater among 
women than it is among men, that women tend to be consumerist to a far greater 
degree than men, and that older people are much more suspicious of the motives 
and power of American business than younger people. So if you're going to find 
a rebirth of consumerism, it is probably not going to be among young people. 
It's going to be among middle-aged and older people, and it's probably going to 
be among women." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ambrosino, a San Francisco political consultant: 
</P>
<P>
"Just watching debate, listening to candidates and looking at referendums, I 
think it would be an overstatement to suggest that a consumer revolt is out 
there in the making. You may get some initial reactions, such as an AK-47 ban, 
that will dominate public policy as a dramatic event takes place as in 
Stockton. And who knows if you'll see some sort of similar type initiative as a 
result of the (Exxon Valdez oil spill) or an incident like that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what's going on in places like California is that some of the 
traditional (consumer issues) that have been debated for a long, long time 
without being resolved are going to end up more and more on the ballot. (People 
are) figuring out that what they can't get in the legislature, they can put 
before consumers and voters through initiatives. The successful passage of the 
insurance proposition is likely to whet the appetite of activists to go after 
other items they have not been able to achieve in the legislative process. I'm 
not sure I think that's a consumer revolt, I think it's the interests taking 
the battleground to a different arena. 
</P>
<P>
"What I think you see in the citizens out there is that they are receptive to 
voting in favor of those types of measures. . . . Until consumers sense they 
lose by passing one of these, you can always find people interested in giving 
themselves a break at the expense of a large institution or company." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Gordon, director of Grassroots Research, which tracks new products and 
trends: 
</P>
<P>
"The consumer is getting more active. I don't know if it's a revolt yet. . . . 
Manufacturers have become real sensitive to it. Almost every consumer product 
now has an "800" complaint line. A lot of manufacturers have discovered they'd 
rather have the person vent the frustration at them instead of going to other 
avenues, whether it's government or boycotting the product or whatever. There's 
a lot more choices and a lot less brand loyalty than there was before. . . . I 
think businesses are becoming more aware of how important it is to get the 
consumer in the decision-making process." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart, marketing professor at the USC Graduate School of Business: 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the whole history of the consumer movement in the U.S., it has 
tended to go in cycles. And I think we've come through a cycle where there has 
been a de-emphasis on regulation, a de-emphasis on protecting the consumer. 
Consumers have been more dormant. 
</P>
<P>
"We are probably now moving into another up cycle because of a host of things 
that have come to the fore: concerns about the oil spill, concerns about 
general increases in the price of oil, concerns about pesticides, we could go 
on and on. These things are now beginning to receive more play in the press, 
they receive a receptive ear. In addition, the Bush Administration seems to be 
more open to regulation so that the Federal Trade Commission, among others, has 
shown evidence of beginning to become more active. They've been pushed somewhat 
as well by more activist groups of state attorneys general. I think it's fair 
to say we're seeing an upsurge. How far it will go I think remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"What you'll begin to see -- (and) already are beginning to see -- are efforts 
on the part of industry to tell its story so that the people have more 
information, more correct information. You'll see companies running more 
campaigns that document what they're doing to clean up the environment. And 
there are a number of companies which are well known already for that kind of 
campaign -- Weyerhaeuser has for years talked about the number of trees it 
plants as opposed to the number they chop down. You'll hear more of that so 
that business gets across the idea that there is another side to the story, 
that they do try to behave responsibly." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cunningham, associate professor of psychology at the University of 
Louisville: 
</P>
<P>
"Look at demographics -- that's the first issue. One of the facts of political 
life is that the baby boom generation that was always somewhat cynical toward 
institutions is becoming more politically potent. The second aspect is that the 
education level in America, although incredibly uneven in its distribution, is 
gradually creeping upward. There are more college-educated people who tend to 
be skeptical of what is offered to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two highly correlated demographic facts mean there are opportunities for 
people to be engaged in political activities on those things that touch their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, regulation gets to be a very tricky issue. One of the interesting facts 
is those people who are cynical about business are also cynical about 
government. One fragment goes for greater regulation and that will be 
continuing to increase. But another group probably has two types in its numbers 
-- one are the Reagan 'true believers' who believe in deregulation and don't 
believe in government intrusion, and a second group that is cynical about 
government and prefers to handle things on the local level. Some people will 
say, for example, 'Let's regulate apples. Make sure there's no Alar.' The other 
group will say, 'Well, let's just buy organic and let's not waste our time 
trying to move through Congress a series of regulations.' 
</P>
<P>
"A consumer movement is going to, I suspect, be a very fragmented thing. 
Different types of industries will encounter different types of pressure groups 
because behind the consumer movement are a series of very different kinds of 
people with very different kinds of agendas." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Flint, director of Consumer Protection Agency, a nonprofit foundation: 
</P>
<P>
"California has probably the best consumer protection laws in the country. What 
concerns a lot of consumers is not that we have inadequate laws, it's just that 
it's not possible to enforce every law in every case. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, if you have more regulation than we have now, it could hurt the 
consumer. . . . We have to retrain our thought to be more goal oriented than 
legislation oriented. The government became too big, in many ways, in the '60s, 
which actually hurt the consumers. It raised taxes and increased the size of 
government. . . . If you were to ask people across the country what they think 
about consumerism today as opposed to the way it was several years ago, I think 
they'd say there is somewhat of a voter revolt afoot." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Zwick, co-producer of the television show "thirtysomething": 
</P>
<P>
"Deregulation in a lot of areas isn't immediately perceived but I think it 
clearly is now beginning to be, and its implications for consumer issues are 
pretty obvious. The real interesting question over the next number of years 
will be whether what now seems to be a grass-roots sense of indignation will 
translate into any real shift in policy politically. Has consumerism been 
enough of an issue to sway electoral politics and legislation? Not in recent 
memory. . . . Will it become more important? I feel certain candidates (are) 
beginning to position themselves as the beneficiaries of what they perceive to 
be a movement."

THE GROWING COSTS OF THATCHER'S 'MIRACLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By George Black, George Black is an associate editor of the Nation. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is technically accurate this month to speak of the Thatcher decade in 
Britain. But is it also accurate to speak, as the prime minister herself would 
wish, of the Thatcher revolution? On that, the jury is still out. 
</P>
<P>
There are several ways to characterize Thatcherism. At the most obvious level, 
it has transformed the physical landscape of Britain. In part, this means the 
much-described cleavage of the "two nations" -- a prosperous south of 
Perrier-drinkers and Porsche-drivers, a blighted north of silent smokestacks 
and idle shipyards and collieries. But even there, nothing is static: In the 
last two or three years, new money has begun to leave its mark on these areas, 
too, with new gourmet restaurants and multiplex cinemas opening in grim 
northern cities like Bradford and Sheffield and derelict industrial plants 
spruced up as tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
More strikingly -- and much of this would have happened under any leader, given 
the sweeping scale of economic change in the 1980s -- the Thatcher decade has 
loosened many of the ancient fixed definitions of social status in this most 
class-ridden of societies. The old industrial working-class that formed the 
backbone of the opposition Labor Party is a shadow of its former self; at some 
point in the 1990s non-unionized part-time women workers in the service sector 
will become the largest single element in the work force. Those old class 
rigidities made British life comprehensible, if not always pleasant. The new 
fragmentation of British society, rooted in increased consumer power, the 
two-income family, mass immigration and dramatic deindustrialization, replaces 
these old rigidities with a pervasive sense of rootless individualism. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, is a key to the essence of Thatcherism: its moral or ethical 
dimension. In the late 1970s, the old Keynesian vision of society -- largely 
embraced by both Labor and Conservative parties -- crumbled. Into the vacuum 
came the aggressive values of a new prime minister who championed a fresh ethos 
of self-sufficiency and social atomization. When the maxims of Margaret 
Thatcher are compiled, they are sure to include her assertion that "there is no 
such thing as society, only individuals." This new creed was relentlessly 
hostile to those who sponged on the welfare culture, and equally indulgent of 
the crude, clawing greed of those who took the prime minister at her word when 
she told them to make it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
In its single-mindedness, Thatcher's social philosophy has a distinctly 
authoritarian tinge. It is not content with the traditional Tory goal of 
beating Labor at the next election; instead it proposes to expunge socialism 
from the political map, to portray European social democracy, like Soviet and 
Chinese communism, as a bizarre historical aberration that flowered briefly in 
the mid-20th Century and then collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
How far has Thatcher succeeded? Almost totally, one would have been tempted to 
reply, when she swept back into 10 Downing St. for the third time in June, 
1987. But today, quite abruptly, there are signs of slippage that may be more 
serious than the midterm doldrums British governments traditionally experience. 
</P>
<P>
The third term always promised to be Thatcher's most difficult. It was one 
thing to persuade voters to turn their backs on the moribund state bureaucracy 
of the 1970s, with its dole queues and hospital waiting lists and abusive 
public-sector labor unions. But it is quite another to cut into the sinews of 
public services that still enjoy broad support. Plans to reform the National 
Health Service are widely mistrusted; so is the continued drive for 
privatization, where the latest targets are government job-training agencies 
and the provision of drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
There is growing apprehension, too, about the social costs of Thatcher's 
economic "miracle." In a metaphor that might have been designed by her 
political enemies, the passenger ferry that went down in the English Channel in 
1987, killing 188 people, was named the Herald of Free Enterprise. Since then, 
the catastrophes have come thick and fast: 167 workers killed when the Piper 
Alpha oil platform in the North Sea exploded; another 31 fatalities in the 
horrifying subway fire at Kings Cross station; three fatal train crashes in 
swift succession, and, most recently, the Sheffield soccer stadium disaster. In 
each case, the roots of tragedy could be found in private avarice, 
underinvestment or a cavalier disregard for safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
Anxieties about the consequences of the Thatcher program have begun to show up 
in surveys of public opinion. A series of polls in February and March showed 
Labor and the Tories in a virtual dead heat. But does the opposition have 
anything better to offer? Or is it true, as the favorite slogan of the Thatcher 
era proclaims, that "There Is No Alternative"? 
</P>
<P>
Here is where Thatcherism can claim its greatest victory -- in redefining the 
terrain of political debate. No opponent will argue any longer for a return to 
large-scale state interventionism. David Blunkett, the Labor Party's spokesman 
on local government affairs and a figure considerably to the left of party 
leader Neil Kinnock, speaks regretfully of the self-inflicted damage that the 
party sustained because of slowness in distancing itself from the giant, 
impersonal state corporations of classic Laborism: "When people weren't allowed 
to paint their own council (publicly owned) houses the color they wanted, that 
was just appalling," he said. "People have to be protected as much from the 
state as they are from big business." 
</P>
<P>
The left-wing insurgency that tried to remodel the party earlier in this decade 
now seems adrift, its leaders recast as prophets in the wilderness. Tony Benn, 
whose unsuccessful drive to capture the party's deputy leadership came to 
embody the campaign of the radical left, now complains that he can no longer 
even gain access to television -- except via the religious shows. The debate 
about alternatives to Thatcherism is, in all but name, a debate about the 
marketplace, and the degree to which the market's undisputed ability to 
generate wealth and service the consumer can be harmonized with a sense of 
social fairness. 
</P>
<P>
Socialist politics here have long tended toward an almost snobbish disdain for 
wealth creation. That was something for the enemy to worry about; the task of 
socialists was to ensure that the goodies were distributed equitably. "Terms 
like 'enterprise' and 'incentive' have always been dirty words to the left," 
said Mary Rogers, joint chief executive of Greater London Enterprise, a body 
that directs private venture capital into small businesses, with a preference 
for those run by minorities and women. "But we have to provide a positive 
example, that the left can be about efficiency, production and competence." 
</P>
<P>
As Margaret Thatcher celebrates this 10th anniversary in power, the Labor Party 
this month is due to unveil the results of its long, introspective "policy 
review." If and when the party is returned to power, it promises to deliver a 
program of "supply-side socialism" that will invest heavily in high-tech 
industry and retraining, a bid to make British exports more competitive in the 
unified European market after 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The party's retreat from the old language of social solidarity is part of a 
general European trend. The reshaping of the European left is likely to 
sideline both the giant industrial unionism of the past and the Rainbow 
Coalition radicals who hoped they might provide an alternative. Instead, the 
contest will be between centrist market economics, as practiced by nominally 
socialist governments in Spain and France, and the "new revisionism" of figures 
like Oskar Lafontaine of the West German Social Democratic Party, who reject 
old left models in favor of a new cocktail of free-market policies and social 
responsibility, with a nod in the direction of feminist and Green concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Whether, in the narrow British context, this means the triumph of the Thatcher 
revolution -- or simply an accommodation to the harsh realities of the new 
global economy -- remains an open question.

A CRISIS IN CARE: SO MUCH NEED, SO FEW NURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary Ann Lewis, Mary Ann Lewis teaches nursing at UCLA and is president of 
Region 6 of the California Nurses Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American public has grown accustomed to living with a health-care system 
that suffers one acute crisis after another. During the 1960s there were not 
enough doctors. Now we have too many doctors. Growing health care costs 
continue to escalate and there is inadequate financing of care for the poor. In 
the midst of this, trauma centers and hospitals are closing and prepaid 
health-care programs have gone bankrupt. It may be difficult, therefore, to 
convince anyone that one of the best-kept secrets in the industry is a critical 
shortage of nurses that threatens to make the situation worse. The result will 
be the closure of patient care units in hospitals and the reduction or 
elimination of visiting and community nursing services. 
</P>
<P>
Several national commissions have located the nursing crisis at the educational 
level, at the time young people think about choosing a career. The current 
shortage will only become worse unless we can reverse the declining interest 
among young people in nursing. The solution requires, in addition to money, 
improving the work environment. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, more than 80% of the nation's 2 million nurses are already working, 
although some are part-time employees. In 1972 there were 50 nurses per 100 
patients, whereas in 1986 there were 91 nurses per 100 patients. In today's 
hospitals, patients are sicker and the treatments more sophisticated. The 
nearly 1-1 nurse-patient relationship is not a factor of more bed-baths or 
taking more vital signs. Providing care has become a far more complex service; 
there is increased demand for nurses with advanced educational preparation, to 
monitor and respond to the life-support technology critically ill patients 
require. Modern medical care requires a nurse well-grounded in both the 
biological and social sciences, a professional able to attend the needs of 
patients and their families. 
</P>
<P>
With the expanded nature of the work-load and the limitations faced by nurses 
in the workplace, it is no surprise that bright, caring young women so often 
look elsewhere. Their career-options are now much broader than nursing or 
teaching; they are encouraged to become doctors, lawyers or business 
executives. These choices offer larger opportunities for more income, prestige 
and control over their work environments. 
</P>
<P>
Today, hospitals are spending enormous sums to recruit nurses -- from abroad or 
from each other. Wages have increased as a function of demand, but clinical 
nurses reach the top of their salary range in five to seven years. To gain more 
income and prestige -- or to feel more responsible for the care provided -- 
they are likely to move into management and away from the bedside. 
</P>
<P>
Some health-care practitioners -- the American Medical Assn. in particular -- 
would relieve the nursing shortage by adding a new person with a limited job 
description: "registered care technologist" -- a high school graduate trained 
to perform non-nursing tasks. Yet in the process of routine bedside nursing 
tasks, professional nurses are able to make some of their most critical 
clinical observations, the early warning signs of physiological deterioration. 
Let those who would solve the problem with new job titles work exclusively with 
barely trained people -- at least for a while. Such people might be more easy 
to "control," but God help the patients. 
</P>
<P>
The nursing shortage will not be solved -- or susceptible to solution -- until 
hospital administrators and physicians accept this contemporary fact: The 
environment they helped to create for nurses, one that may have worked for them 
30 years ago, does not provide the quality of working life that young women and 
men want and that able young adults deserve. 
</P>
<P>
After 32 years in nursing, I begin to ask myself, "What if we 'owned' the 
nursing units? What if we were involved in decision-making about the care of 
patients and the organization of our work? What if we set the standards for 
care and decided which institutions provide the quality of care that met our 
professional expectations?" In some instances, we make those decisions out of 
necessity right now, because there are not enough of us. But few of us are 
involved as professional partners in the day-to-day decisions about our 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
The California Nurses Assn. has worked diligently with nursing-related 
organizations throughout the state to improve our stature and implement 
strategies to deal with the shortage. Our efforts include setting more rigorous 
standards for professional practice, but we cannot solve the crisis by 
ourselves. We also need support from the public, hospitals and physicians to 
improve the structure of the workplace so that nursing practice meets our 
needs, as well as those of patients, attending physicians and hospital 
management. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the media-portrayed image of "handmaidens" or "bimbos" persists, 
being a nurse has a limited future, with limited opportunities to participate 
in thedecisions affecting one's sense of self-worth. 
</P>
<P>
Stop and ask yourself: Would you want your daughter or son to become a nurse? 
On the other hand, the next time you are unfortunate enough to be in a hospital 
bed, who would you like to answer your call light? After your discharge from 
the hospital, who would you like to help you, your family and friends deal with 
the self-care activities related to recovery? In a concerned, good world, there 
will be a competent nurse available, with the appropriate educational 
preparation to provide a quality of care that will make a difference.

CAMPAIGN CASH NOW SLUICING TO STATE PARTIES

<P>
The 1988 presidential election was distinguished by name calling, 
misrepresentation and a new low in personal vilification. But that's not all 
the bad news. The worst is that the system of electoral finance reform, which 
took from 1971 to 1979 to work out, has effectively been overthrown. This is 
not to say that anyone acted illegally. If anything, we might point to the 
success of the 1970s by noting that it took political money men another decade 
-- 1979 through 1988 -- to figure out ways to get around the law. 
</P>
<P>
Federal campaign finance laws were intended to ensure open and fair elections. 
They focused on money because we have come to equate it with communication, and 
because it is the easiest thing to measure. The backbone of the federal law is 
built on limitations and disclosure. Individuals can contribute up to $1,000, 
organizations $5,000, to candidates in congressional and presidential 
primaries. Individuals can also give up to $20,000 to the parties, but not more 
than an aggregate maximum of $25,000 a year to candidates and parties. The 
security of the law lies in its disclosure provisions -- who gave what to whom 
-- and how the money was spent. The laws were aimed at eliminating fat-cat 
contributors and undue influence of big business. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 the fat cats came back in force, which is about all we know, except 
that more money probably went to state parties than elsewhere. We don't know 
specifically how much they gave, where it went nor how it was spent, because 
the information is too diffuse. We know that reports to the Federal Election 
Commission indicate a greater than 50% increase in state and local party 
spending that was coordinated with presidential campaigns between the last two 
elections; between 1984 and 1988, California state parties reported an increase 
in contributions from $5 million to $10 million for Republicans, from $2 
million to $8 million for Democrats. Both parties' national committees -- after 
a bit of pressure from such groups as Common Cause -- published lists of donors 
who contributed $100,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most controversial loopholes in the law is its allowance of 
independent spending -- defined as money spent by an individual or a group in 
advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, without contact between the 
spender and the candidate or his election committee. More than $9 million was 
so spent in the 1980 election; in 1984 that had more than doubled to $20 
million. Most of it was spent by New Right groups, such as the National 
Conservative Political Action Committee and the Fund for a Conservative 
Majority. 
</P>
<P>
Although the impact of independent spending on the election was never clear, 
the groups themselves were controversial because they could not be held 
accountable for their behavior or the nature of their message. Campaign 
managers considered them wild cards, even when they supported their candidate. 
Most campaigns and both parties tried to direct funds away from such spending 
into the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Although independent spending was down in 1988, the principal reasons are 
probably the nature of the campaign and the decline of big spending groups 
because of death and squabbling among their leaders. The largest spender in 
this election was a new group, the National Security Political Action 
Committee, which produced the controversial Willie Horton ad used against 
Michael S. Dukakis; the committee accounted for more than $10 million of the 
$17 million in 1988 independent spending. 
</P>
<P>
Because presidential campaigns are publicly funded during general elections, 
with private contributions prohibited, the parties are the last mainstream 
vehicle for donors. 
</P>
<P>
State parties were "discovered" in the 1980 election when the Republican 
National Committee targeted 12 critical states and coordinated $9 million in 
contributions from big givers, telling them how much to give and where to give 
it. A donation from California to the Florida state party would be reported in 
Tallahassee, but no one in California or Washington outside the campaign would 
know about it. The Democrats made a similar but smaller effort, and both 
parties have been developing such programs ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that the money is going to the parties where it has the 
potential for doing far more for party-building than any reform since the 
Progressive era. That fact makes Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr.'s decision to take 
over the California Democratic Party an astute move; if the state parties are 
the last remaining conduit for big contributors beyond presidential election 
years, the state parties will be the place to be in the 1990s. With better 
resources to recruit candidates and run campaigns, the parties would not be as 
dependent on self-selected candidates, and be more likely to promote those best 
able and qualified to win office and govern. 
</P>
<P>
When we wonder why we fail to attract the best men and women to public office, 
we cannot ignore the terrible burdens we put upon them -- not the least of 
which is the ordeal of raising money (a Senate campaign, for instance, now 
takes an average of $4 million). If the parties can supply most of what it 
takes to win, without requiring candidates to mortgage homes and empty bank 
accounts, we would all be better served. 
</P>
<P>
Popular prejudice notwithstanding, political parties serve a critical function 
in American democracy. They are principally in the business of winning 
elections, and they cannot win if they put up candidates who fail to represent 
the interests of the majority of voters because they are too ideological or too 
corrupt. Increased funding is both to their benefit and ours. 
</P>
<P>
On the negative side, the most important consequence of this boom for the state 
parties is that it comes at the expense of a belief that campaign reform laws 
eliminated fat-cat contributors. 
</P>
<P>
While it is no surprise that the GOP is indebted to the business community, the 
Democrats are just as dependent on large donors -- and have been, since the 
days of John F. Kennedy. They have made substantial strides in the past 10 
years, developing a small-contributor base through direct-mail solicitations. 
While Democrats trail Republicans by 2-1 in fund-raising, the gap narrows every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
There will be some discussion in Congress this term about the growing 
proportion of money given by political action committees (PACs) in 
congressional elections -- an issue long-overdue for attention. But the 
perception of abuse because of fat-cat contributors may be a greater threat to 
campaign law integrity. This goes to the very heart of reform intention. 
Whether "soft" money (from individuals and corporations, giving at the national 
level for state parties) subverts the process, or whether there is only such an 
appearance, the need for reform seems clear. 
</P>
<P>
The best proposals would not eliminate the money but would make clear the 
source and amount, so that anyone interested in the flow of influence could 
tell who did, in fact, give what to whom. All the soft money that goes to the 
national parties can easily be reported to the Federal Election Commission; so 
should be all large in-state (more than $1,000) and all out-of-state 
contributions to the state parties. 
</P>
<P>
Much soft money is already reported one way or another. What is missing is a 
central reporting location for state parties and any reports at all from 
congressional campaign committees. It may just be a problem in perception, as 
the attorneys for the parties contend, but it is a perception related to basic 
beliefs about what elections are and should be in a democracy.

There's no way to live with what John Mack did to Pamela Small in 1973. Mack -- 
who resigned Thursday as House Speaker Jim Wright's main aide and executive 
director of the congressional Democratic Steering and Policy Committee -- said 
his crime had been part of the public record for 16 years. Mack had been 
protected by Wright, powerful Democrats in Congress and a quiescent press 
willing to live with his crime against Small -- protecting him, fraternizing 
with him, rewarding him. How could they? 
</P>
<P>
John Paul Mack, then 19, managed a discount import store. Pamela Small, then 
20, bought some Venetian blinds there. There was something wrong with them, so 
Mack asked Small to come into the storeroom to pick new blinds. Then, he 
blocked the door and told her to lie down. She refused. He took a hammer and 
repeatedly smashed her skull. Then, he stabbed her five times with a steak 
knife in her left breast and shoulder and slashed her throat many times. Then, 
he put her body in a car and drove around. Then, he parked the car and went to 
a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Small survived, escaped, pressed charges. Mack pleaded guilty to malicious 
wounding: specifically "that he did . . . stab, cut and wound one Pamela Small 
with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable and kill." He was sentenced to 15 
years, seven suspended, in the Virginia State Penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
He never did hard time or much time. He served less than 27 months in a county 
jail where he worked as a cook. Then, he was paroled -- to a job on Wright's 
congressional staff. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's daughter was then married to Mack's brother. Presumably not a consumer 
of discount Venetian blinds, she was not in any immediate danger; or if she 
was, the Speaker didn't seem to care. The Washington Post said that since 
Wright became Speaker, Mack was "arguably the most powerful staff member on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Wright offered Mack a job before he was sentenced and wrote letters in Mack's 
behalf to the probation officer and sentencing judge. Only Wright's influence 
can account for the extreme leniency shown Mack for a crime of heinous 
brutality. Only complete indifference to the worth of a woman's life -- a 
stunning callousness -- can account for Wright's manipulation of the legal 
system so that, in fact, the perpetrator has been rewarded with political power 
for his carnage. 
</P>
<P>
Mack said he "just blew my cool for a second." Examined by a psychiatrist 
nearly a year later, Mack said he had "reacted in a way in which any man would 
perhaps react under similar circumstances." The "circumstances" he was 
referring to were long work days and a failing marriage. Happily, he wasn't 
saying he had had an appropriate response to a woman choosing Venetian blinds. 
Unhappily, he was saying that bludgeoning the skull of a woman with a hammer, 
slashing her throat repeatedly with a steak knife, stabbing her in the breast 
and shoulder repeatedly, then going to a movie with the body left in the car, 
was something "any man" would do if he were under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
It's an interesting and eloquent assertion of gender, implying as it does that 
it is natural for a man to use massive, grotesque violence against a woman, any 
woman, when he is upset. Court psychiatrists said that Mack was sane when he 
committed the crime, that he knew right from wrong. In fact, he knew Wright 
from wrong. The Speaker sprung him and he was protected by a network of male 
power. House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced) told the Washington Post two 
weeks ago that if Wright were to fire Mack, "members would be lined up to hire 
him." Because of the public outrage, that might no longer be the case. 
</P>
<P>
Mack's sane, Wright's sane, Coelho's sane: What is a sane man? When men know 
right from wrong, what is it that they know? And why are these men running the 
country? How many sane men are there in government? How many use hammers; how 
many use fists? 
</P>
<P>
In the city where I live, a major politician has a history of beating women. In 
each election for the past decade in which he has been a candidate, women's 
groups have taken documentation to the press -- affidavits and testimony from 
women he has hurt. The press never thought it was worth a line of newsprint. 
The press, too, is composed of sane men. Between the male journalists who know 
right from wrong and the male politicians who know right from wrong, women are 
in a vise: information and public policy controlled by Mack's "any man" -- men 
protecting men who hurt women because "any man" will or might or can. 
</P>
<P>
If Wright's time had not come, if he were not under indictment by the House 
Ethics Committee, the public would not have been told about Mack. The sane men 
in the press who know right from wrong wouldn't have thought it was important. 
Congressional insiders knew Mack had committed a felony, some even knew about 
Mack's crime; they just didn't tell the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
The issue for the press was Wright's weakened political position. It wasn't 
that Mack committed an unspeakable crime of violence; or the meaning of the 
Speaker's complicity in protecting him; or the meaning of the congressional 
support for him -- legislators protecting a slasher when, not coincidentally, 
rape is epidemic, abortion rights threatened and pornography legally protected. 
</P>
<P>
Male dominance means that men who are sane the way Mack was sane run the 
country and control information; they are the government and the press; they 
shape reality through laws and perception. They protect "any man's" violence 
against any woman. Not by accident is the United States a nightmare of violence 
against women. Men in power make choices for violence. They protect violence in 
men because any man, under similar circumstances, would perhaps react the same 
way: the way Mack did; the way Wright did; the way Coelho and other powerful 
Democrats did. It's the boys-will-be-boys theory of good government, a 
government of men, not laws, not women. 
</P>
<P>
Coehlo says he is "very close" to Mack. "Rightly or wrongly," he said, "under 
our system of law John Mack owed his debt to society, not to this young woman." 
The woman is chopped liver to him. The question is: What is any woman going to 
do about it?

COURT RULING ON PROPOSITION 103 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' editorial "Half-Won Insurance Victory" (May 7) states that 
Proposition 103 does not deal with the insurance problem but only with the 
symptoms; I disagree. There is abundant evidence that the insurance industry, 
which Proposition 103 will restructure, is the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Once it is fully implemented, with the insurance industry under the control of 
an elected insurance commissioner who has rate-setting authority and complete 
information on the financial status of each company, Proposition 103 may 
provide the affordable liability and casualty insurance that we need. 
</P>
<P>
Without first finding out whether Proposition 103 has fixed the insurance 
problem, there is no justification for urging the Legislature to adopt no-fault 
insurance which the voters soundly rejected last November.

FOR THE COMMON GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A well-thought-out, achievable, and, yes, urgent blueprint for social-welfare 
reform in the United States has been put together by a study group sponsored by 
the Ford Foundation. Their report bears the appropriate title of "The Common 
Good: Social Welfare and the American Future." It is worthy of your attention. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the report lies in its proposals for modifying and 
strengthening existing programs rather than creating an experimental structure 
to address shortcomings that are so evident. Its principal novelty may well be 
its most controversial element, a plan to fund about half of the reforms by 
taxing Social Security benefits that are in excess of what individuals have 
themselves contributed to the program. 
</P>
<P>
The increased cost of the government share of the reform plan amounts to $29 
billion a year, a figure that almost certainly will rise even higher in the 
future. A tax on Social Security would raise, over the next five years, some 
$97 billion. Both figures are subject to adjustment, the report acknowledges, 
taking account of the harsh political climate "in a time of budget deficits and 
general skepticism about public spending." Savings would best come through 
decisions to phase in both the new tax and programs, the report suggests. 
</P>
<P>
But the report stands as a strong argument against delay and postponement. The 
proposed reforms are, in many instances, highly cost effective, as in the case 
of prenatal care, expansion of Head Start preschool education, and improved 
teen-age pregnancy prevention and school retention programs. Furthermore, the 
reforms address fundamental issues of inequity that pose extraordinary problems 
for the nation, including the whole sphere of health care and long-term care of 
the aged, and the need to help people escape the welfare ranks through 
education and job training programs. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of years of neglecting our social infrastructure, the divisions in 
American society have increased in ways that threaten quality of life, peace of 
mind, and the economic future," the report concludes. We agree. And it is that 
argument that lends urgency to reform. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford Foundation panel that drew up the final report was led by Irving S. 
Shapiro, former du Pont chief executive officer, and included persons 
distinguished in business, labor, education and law, among them the chairman 
and chief executive officer of Times Mirror, the parent of this newspaper. The 
character of those making the recommendations seems part of a remarkable 
development of recent months as more and more groups of leading private 
citizens have taken initiatives on public policy in the absence of leadership 
either at the federal or state governmental level. In fact, this report 
overlaps some of the other recent studies by distinguished panels of citizens 
such as the proposals for reform of the health-care system from the National 
Leadership Commission on Health Care, and proposals for expansion of Medicaid 
from the Health Policy Agenda for the American People. 
</P>
<P>
None of these initiatives will be easy to implement because of the hostile 
climate that has been encouraged by political leaders in recent years. It has 
become clear that program cuts alone cannot balance the budget. Because of the 
resistance to increased taxes, successful programs have been left under-funded, 
thus postponing remedies to increasing problems that will only grow more costly 
to cure as action is delayed. The perilously high cost of inaction is already 
visible in the crushing burden on prisons, rising gang warfare, high infant 
mortality, enormous perinatal costs for babies born prematurely or drug 
addicted, declining educational performance, expanding homeless populations, 
increasing poverty and the absence of health insurance for 37 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Ford Foundation report, with its solid base of careful research, 
will facilitate an appropriate response before further delay further escalates 
the cost, both the social and the monetary.

Thanks for your articles and separate section ("The Special Years, 50 and 
Beyond: The Time of Your Life," May 4) that highlighted the 50-plus age group 
-- I'm one of them. 
</P>
<P>
I really feel it is a neglected group of people, and the marketing people, if 
no one else, are missing a lot by not noticing us or mentioning our existence. 
I also felt your statistics about growing older were heartening and less 
negative and frightening than many I've seen. We can all use that good 
information.

RECESSION BLUES WON'T PLAY ABROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY E. GARTEN, Jeffrey E. Garten is president of the Eliot Group Inc., 
an investment banking firm in New York. He worked in the Nixon, Ford and Carter 
Administrations. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Virturally all indicators show the American economy slowing down, and worries 
about a recession are mounting. In this unprecedented sixth year of a business 
expansion, even optimists are holding their breath. 
</P>
<P>
A deep slump would be a deadly blow to many debt-strapped Americans and 
companies, but it could also lead to a major foreign-policy confrontation with 
the two countries on which America most depends -- Germany and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1970s, whenever American growth has stalled, Washington has 
pressed Bonn and Tokyo to rev up the growth engines in order to stimulate 
American exports. Although the strategy never really worked -- governments 
aren't altruistic -- it continues to be the conventional prescription in 
Washington and Wall Street whenever America is in economic trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with U.S. trade deficits stuck at $120-billion levels and the surpluses of 
West Germany and Japan showing no sign of shrinking, Washington's arm-twisting 
could start again. If on top of the trade imbalance there is a recession in 
America, the United States is likely to turn up the heat full blast. 
</P>
<P>
And we can expect West Germany and Japan to say, simply, "Get lost." 
</P>
<P>
For Bonn, the idea of abandoning its tight-fisted anti-inflationary policies to 
accommodate Washington is a non-starter. Under American urging, Germany tried 
reflating its economy in 1978. It saw its own price levels jump as a result, 
and vowed never again to be a "locomotive" for the United States 
</P>
<P>
Japan, too, will say "no." Its economy grew by almost 6% last year. In 1989 it 
is projected to outpace the growth of any other industrial country. The message 
from across the Pacific is apt to be clear: Enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
In both countries, companies are producing flat-out, wages are moving up and 
inflation is rising. Their inclination is to raise their interest rates and 
contain growth, not accelerate it. Last month the Bundesbank, West Germany's 
central bank, stunned everyone by doing just that. Speculation is rife that the 
Bank of Japan will follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Each government is in a weak position to take any measures that are not 
immediate vote-getters. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's popularity is at an all-time 
low, and Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, mired in a bribery scandal, has 
already announced his resignation. His Liberal Democratic Party will be 
scrambling for years to regain popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Both countries have increasingly less reason to kowtow to America. Not only has 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made them feel less in need of American 
protection, but their economic dependence on Washington is weakening. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany sees its economic future not in trade with North America, but in 
the markets of a more integrated Western Europe. Japan, in contrast to the days 
when the American market was its only real option, today is building a trade 
and industrial empire from Seoul to Sydney and rapidly expanding its financial 
and industrial links to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In the event of an American recession, both Bonn and Tokyo would probably 
believe, genuinely, that nothing they do could really help us. They would say 
to themselves that the answers to U.S. overconsumption, poor savings and 
investment and lagging productivity lies in Washington, Wall Street and Peoria 
-- not abroad. 
</P>
<P>
By their inaction, America's two key allies would in effect be demanding that 
the United States put itself through a painful and protracted wringer. But they 
are, after all, our creditors and such hard-nosed behavior is typical. 
</P>
<P>
A confrontation between America and its allies ought not to surprise the 
industrial nations' finance ministers and central bankers. Since 1985, when 
they started to manage the dollar, they knew they were dealing with the symptom 
and not the root problem -- which was that America was living beyond its means 
and doing nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>
With Bonn and Tokyo staying on the sidelines, it is not hard to envision 
red-faced, frustrated congressmen screaming for retaliation. Because of our 
$175-billion budget deficits, there will be no way to use government spending 
to boost the economy out of recession. And because of a precarious dollar -- 
now held up by high interest rates -- the Fed would be scared to ease up on 
rates to stimulate growth, lest foreigners with dollar investments dump our 
currency and cause it to collapse. Without these fiscal and monetary tools that 
Washington has historically used to overcome serious downturns, the only thing 
to hope for would be a foreign bailout -- and it will be a vain hope. 
</P>
<P>
Given today's hair-trigger markets, even a shouting match between Washington 
and its allies could send the stock and currency markets into a tailspin. But 
it could also aggravate a host of security-related problems with Bonn and 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
There are no easy answers for the Bush Administration, especially as long as 
lip-reading is in vogue and shameful gimmickry substitutes for a farsighted 
fiscal policy. But there should be no illusions about where our most explosive 
foreign policy problems could be.

IF EVERYBODY IS A WINNER, EVERYBODY IS SECOND-BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICOLS FOX, Nicols Fox is a writer in Maine.

<TEXT>
<P>
You heard them yourself if you were watching, and many million Americans were. 
As the Academy Awards were presented this year, each was announced not with 
"The winner is . . . ," but with "The Oscar goes to. . . . " It was, the Motion 
Picture Academy said, an attempt to make the losers feel better, as if it 
would. "No matter how you slice it," the old saw goes, "it's still bologna." 
You don't have to call the winner a winner to know that the fact you're not 
carrying home an Oscar must mean something. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the academy is really a latecomer to the game of "let's pretend we're 
all winners." It's a pleasant little game, totally divorced from reality, of 
course, but all in the spirit of feel-good, and seemingly harmless. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it's anything but. It's part of a continuing trend -- "the great 
leveling" -- that is playing a significant role in ensuring a second-class 
future for this country. 
</P>
<P>
It's an idea that has grown out of compassion and good intentions, and we've 
been playing it for years in America. Its practical application may have begun 
in the schools at least 20 years ago, but its origins are clearly with Freud, 
who frightened people into thinking that any negative event could damage a 
child's ego, probably irreparably. That was a misinterpretation, of course, but 
much of what we do is firmly based on misinterpretation. So, if the healthy 
child is the praised child, everything a child did must be called wonderful, 
whether it was or not. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, children weren't fooled. They learned that a quickly scribbled 
but colorful crayoned mess would elicit the same enthusiastic oohs and ahs from 
mom and teacher and wind up taped to the fridge door as easily as something 
they'd worked on all afternoon. Unfortunately, instead of fortifying their 
little egos, all it did was convince them that adults were either lying or 
stupid. And it actively discouraged them from doing their best -- ever. 
</P>
<P>
Reality, of course, isn't quite as user-friendly. Badly produced goods and 
services get no oohs and ahs from people who just paid hard cash for them. The 
lessons come quickly and brutally to children who have grown up in the warmth 
of this kind of fake sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
But that's only the more obvious result of this kind of fuzzy thinking. Far 
worse is the way our society is being deprived of the benefits of the really 
meaningful. When misguided compassion marries anti-elitism the union produces a 
mutation in which the bad not only becomes good, but the good is brought down 
to the level of the bad until they meet half-way in a kind of warm-milk 
mediocrity. Life is an equation. You can't elevate the inferior without 
devaluing the superior. 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't expect Ann Landers to be guilty of this sort of silly thinking, 
but she is. Consider her advice to someone who remembered the horror of 
receiving no valentines in a class where receiving cards had become a kind of 
love competition, in which each recipient's were counted and the totals 
announced. Landers' advice: The teacher should have insisted that no valentines 
would be sent unless they were sent to everyone. What a nice, dumb idea. 
</P>
<P>
Forget that sending valentines in class is hardly an educational activity, and 
the practice is probably a good clue to why our kids are lagging in the 
learning department. Forget that not everyone can afford the luxury of buying 
30 valentines. Forget that the U.S. Postal Service still delivers door-to-door 
for a quarter and makes getting valentines really fun. 
</P>
<P>
The point is, an ordained and regulated gesture becomes an empty gesture. What 
child cares if she gets a piece of colored heart-shaped paper when 29 other 
people have received exactly the same thing? When nothing is special, 
everything is pointless, and children get that message as quickly as anyone 
else. Only the card manufacturers benefit from this sort of mindless 
share-caring. 
</P>
<P>
But those competing for Academy Awards aren't children. They know about reality 
already. They know what benefits will accrue to those who take home the Oscar. 
Call the winners whatever you will, the losers are going to know they've lost. 
Silly parents and educators have now been joined by a silly academy. What's 
next?

ALICE KAHN: HIGH ANXIETY LANDS IN THE SCHOOLYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was just another anxious night toward the end of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that day, I'd had lunch with a friend. We talked about what was going 
to happen when the crack babies hit the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll put them in special ed classes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Using what for money?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
As we paused, I overheard a woman at the next table saying, ". . . so we're 
going to support all these old people, and then when we get old there won't be 
enough young people to support us and Social Security will collapse." 
</P>
<P>
To my left, a man was saying, "In 20 years, the greenhouse effect will hit, the 
ocean will rise, and -- poof! -- there goes your high-priced California real 
estate." 
</P>
<P>
I fully expected the waiter to prance up, click his heels and announce the 
catastrophe du jour. 
</P>
<P>
But last night was different. I wasn't worrying about what was going to happen 
in five years or in 20 years or when I'm old and really gray. I was worrying 
about what I was going to do this morning. I was worrying about what to do 
about the bomb threat at my daughter's elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Bomb threat. We needed that. Parents trying to raise children of an uncertain 
future. Teachers valiantly practicing their art on the front lines. A principal 
trying to run a school while governments withdraw money, parents retreat to 
private schools and everyone says: We've got enough to worry about -- let the 
kids fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The unreassuring note came home from the school a few days ago. It explained 
that a crazy lady had appeared on the playground and begun distributing 
literature urging the "workers" to arise and revolt. The 10-year-olds teased 
her. She, according to the children, said she'd come back today "with the Ku 
Klux Klan, a bomb and an Uzi and shoot all of you." 
</P>
<P>
None of it made sense. Communist propaganda and threats of the Klan. Workers in 
a grade school. The lady was crazy. But what's a sensible death threat? 
</P>
<P>
The police, we were told, would protect the school. Furthermore, psychologists 
would be there to reassure the children. And fear not: There would be bilingual 
psychologists for the non-English- 
</P>
<P>
speaking children. 
</P>
<P>
There's good news and there's bad. Society may be spinning out of control, and 
we can't stop it. But we can handle it in a politically correct manner. 
</P>
<P>
For the past few days, I've been talking to other parents about what we would 
do. I've been going about my business, buying groceries, doing laundry, and 
always on the horizon of my mind is this nagging fact: bomb threat at my 
daughter's school. 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, I went out for a hike and ran into a member of the City Council on 
the trail. She's an elected official. A symbol of order. The person who was 
picked to do something. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a bomb threat at my daughter's school!" I blurted out at her as she 
attempted to find some solace among the ferns and lupine. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she said. "We had one at City Hall last week." 
</P>
<P>
There is no right way to handle this. That's what all the parents said. Most 
said they'd send their kids to school today, that the authorities are doing 
their best, that this was not a "serious" bomb threat and that "even if you 
keep the kid home today, there's tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there's always been danger. I think back to my class in 1954, 
crouched in the cloak room, our heads between our legs, in "air raid position." 
I remember our 30 little bodies breathing heavily in the dark as the roar of a 
jet arose in the distance. And we wondered: Would this be it? 
</P>
<P>
No Russians to worry about today. Just one deranged American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
My daughter is in the other room now. I kept her home from school. Maybe she's 
as much a victim of my anxiety as the crazy woman's ugly threat. But we'll take 
it one day at a time, challenge by challenge, threat by threat. 
</P>
<P>
At the back of my mind is the hope that it's all numerology -- fin de 
millennium behavior. We'll go crazy for 10 more years, but once we see that big 
two followed by all those zeroes, everything will go back to normal. Then, my 
daughter and your daughter and all our children's children will come skipping 
up the street to the eternally safe house.

SHORT TAKES: A MOTHERS' DAY FOR PEACE FOR ENTIRE FAMILY OF MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Arise, then, women of this day! Arise, all women who have hearts. . . . Say 
firmly, 'We will not have great questions decided by irrelevant agencies.' " So 
said Julia Ward Howe in 1870. So says Susan Clark today. 
</P>
<P>
The day has been designated as Mothers' Day for Peace by Clark and her 
flourishing cohort: 6 million in 1986, 9 million in '87, 13 million last year, 
and counting. And as in Howe's case, "irrelevant agencies" were the goad. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in 'Webster,' " actress Clark says, "we had a lot of interviews 
with the press, and I was constantly asked the same two questions: 'What is it 
like to work with your husband (Alex Karras, also her spouse in the show)?' and 
'How tall is Emmanuel Lewis (elfin protagonist)?' I asked my publicist, 'Why 
can't we talk about something important, something like: What are we doing 
building more and more weapons? I'm scared to death, and there are millions 
just as frightened as I am.' " 
</P>
<P>
A friend advised Clark, "Don't come on like gangbusters. Stay away from 
politics. Make a personal appeal, maybe something that would work with Mother's 
Day." Clark agreed, wondering, "What could everyone who celebrates the day do, 
regardless of gender or income? Well, we could all wear a flower. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A "simple, grass-roots idea that started from zip" in 1985 has spawned 
observances in 40 U.S. cities, five countries, 70 organizations, all abetted by 
Clark's unique TV "Satellite Tour" in which she is "present" to advise local 
groups, to cajole, to inspire. 
</P>
<P>
With a disarming blend of wit, charm, pluck and perseverance, Clark spins off 
Howe's "great questions" ("Why do we give birth to boys only for them to go off 
and kill each other?") with her own updates: 
</P>
<P>
"What are we (humans) doing?" she asks. "Why are we poisoning Mother Earth? Why 
are 25% of our children living below the poverty line? What do we do with toxic 
waste; where the hell do we put the plutonium? Why are 80% of the homeless 
women and children?" 
</P>
<P>
Let mothers, not "irrelevant agencies," take the lead, Clark suggests. Let the 
tough questions be addressed. "There are days when I get down," she confesses, 
"but then Holland wants to come aboard (the movement), and Britain; some of the 
Asian nations express interest. And I think, 'Yes, we can turn this world 
around.' " 
</P>
<P>
Arise, then, women of this day! 
</P>
<P>
All Shook Up Over a Quake Detector 
</P>
<P>
Necessity is not the only mother of invention. Would you believe panic? 
</P>
<P>
"I was born in L.A.," Kimberly Everett of Park La Brea says, "so I've been 
terrified of earthquakes all my life. Call me 'Jell-O Legs.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a single mother of a 3-year-old boy, and when the October quake hit I was 
at work. I was worried about him, wondering whether it shook as much at home as 
it did here (CBS, where Everett is a videotape technician/editor). No way to 
tell, really, so I invented the 'Ligneous Indicant.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now on sale everywhere from Euphoria Records in Malibu to the Griffith Park 
Observatory, Everett's low-tech, high-risibilty "Earthquake Detector" is the 
very pith of simplicity. Ligneous derives from the Latin for wood, and the 
nitty of the indicant is a toothpick. "You get some soil or sand from under -- 
or at least near -- the structure where you're going to set up," Everett says. 
"Put it in the clear plastic container I provide and make sure the ligneous 
indicant is standing straight up. 
</P>
<P>
"In a temblor, it'll move left or right, north or south, or even sink, and you 
can tell how violent the quake was. If the whole thing tips over, you've kind 
of had it." 
</P>
<P>
It's not Everett's first invention, nor, one hopes, the last. "My son has a 
calcium deficiency but hates to brush his teeth," she says, "so I've invented a 
toothbrush that actually makes kids want to brush -- a great idea that I don't 
want to leak. It would take capital, though, so I invent stuff easier to 
market. A fur bikini didn't work -- don't ask -- but the indicant is doing 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
Antic instructions are included, in three languages including Japanese. "I'm 
really into balancing the trade deficit," Everett says. "I eat sushi and I 
drive a Honda and I feel bad about it, so I want to repatriate some dollars. 
Besides, where can they get something that'll last a lifetime without 
batteries? Actually, it's not low-tech. It's no-tech." DICK RORABACK

ROGER SIMON: THE DEAFENING SILENCE ON CAPITOL HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Simon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When young hoodlums beat and raped a woman in Central Park last month, there 
was a call for black and other minority leaders to denounce them. 
</P>
<P>
The accused youths are all members of minority groups. And some felt if 
minority leaders did not denounce them, the silence could be seen as an 
"endorsement" of hooliganism. 
</P>
<P>
Now, we have a case of the shoe being on the other foot. Now, we have a perfect 
time for white leaders, white elected leaders, to denounce a white crime. 
</P>
<P>
But even though the crime has been national news for more than a week, I have 
heard no denunciations. I have heard nothing but silence. 
</P>
<P>
The story was broken by Ken Ringle of the Washington Post on May 4. It has 
since been picked up by numerous national publications (View, May 5). These are 
the facts: 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, a 20-year-old college student named Pamela Small went into a discount 
store in suburban Virginia to buy some things for her first apartment. 
</P>
<P>
When she took her purchases to the counter, she noticed a flaw in some window 
blinds. The manager said he had more in the storeroom and asked Small to come 
with him to pick out the ones she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"Once inside, however, he blocked the door and ordered her to lie face down on 
the floor. When she refused -- when, with growing panic, she tried to talk her 
way to freedom -- he grabbed a hammer and slammed it into her skull. 
</P>
<P>
"She immediately lost consciousness but he continued pounding, exposing the 
skull in five places. Then he grabbed a steak knife, stabbed her five times in 
the left breast and shoulder near her heart, and slashed her repeatedly across 
the throat." 
</P>
<P>
He then took her limp body out to her car, drove around for a while, and 
finally parked in an alley behind the store. Then he went to the movies. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, Small regained consciousness about eight hours later and managed to 
drive for help. A general surgeon, a plastic surgeon, a neurosurgeon and a 
thoracic surgeon spent seven hours trying to repair the damage. Small then 
spent a year undergoing plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Her attacker, John Mack, was arrested. He pleaded guilty to malicious wounding 
and was sentenced to 15 years, with seven suspended, in the Virginia State 
Penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
But he never spent a day in the penitentiary. He spent 27 months "in the more 
civilized confines of the Fairfax County Jail" instead. And then he was 
paroled. He was paroled to become staff assistant to U.S. Rep. James Wright 
(D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
Wright offered Mack the job before he was sentenced, which certainly made an 
impression on the judge. Wright also wrote letters for Mack. Wright did 
everything he could for Mack. 
</P>
<P>
And why did the case of a hammer-wielding, knife-slashing felon interest Jim 
Wright? Well, because Wright's daughter was married to Mack's brother. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Mack is 35 and Wright's right-hand man, perhaps the most powerful staff 
member on Capitol Hill. He is executive director of the congressional 
Democratic Steering and Policy Committee and makes about $89,500 a year. As 
Post reporter Ringle pointed out: "As a convicted felon, Mack is barred by law 
from voting or obtaining a security clearance. But as the Speaker's closest 
aide, he helps enact the nation's laws." 
</P>
<P>
And though the victim, Pamela Small, incurred thousands of dollars in medical 
bills, her attacker, John Mack, has never paid a cent. He has never even told 
her he is sorry. 
</P>
<P>
"I served 2 1/2 years in prison," Mack said. "That's all they asked me to do." 
</P>
<P>
If you think people are outraged by all this, you are correct. But what about 
the anger on Capitol Hill? What about the outrage from Mack's colleagues? 
</P>
<P>
Well, a TV crew went out recently to Capitol Hill to interview staff members. 
And nobody would talk. Nobody. Off camera, they said the same thing: They were 
afraid. Speaker of the House Wright and John Mack were too powerful to cross. 
</P>
<P>
But how about those people whose careers don't depend on Wright and Mack? How 
about the elected representatives of the people? 
</P>
<P>
How about U.S. Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Calif.), for instance, the majority whip of 
the House? Isn't he outraged by the attack, the blatant favoritism, the lack of 
any decency toward the victim? 
</P>
<P>
No, he is not. "Rightly or wrongly," Coelho said, "under our system of law John 
Mack owed his debt to society, not to this woman." 
</P>
<P>
Well, thank you, Tony. And I'm sure you would feel the same way if someone 
close to you were bludgeoned and slashed in a storeroom and left for dead. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho has special insights into Mack, you see. He golfs with John Mack. John 
Mack, Coelho says, is "very close" to him. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho does not golf with Pamela Small. She is not "very close" to him. She is 
not a shaker and mover. She is not a power broker on Capitol Hill. She is just 
a nobody. A zero. A citizen. 
</P>
<P>
So why should she count? 
</P>
<P>
Those vicious thugs who went "wilding" in Central Park should be denounced. But 
so should John Mack. 
</P>
<P>
Favored treatment is not the same as rehabilitation. No debt has been paid to 
Small or society. And somebody, some of our elected leadership, should say so. 
</P>
<P>
Instead there is silence. Our leaders are afraid. Gutless. Cowering. 
</P>
<P>
Or else they are off playing golf.

DISASTER IN CARIBBEAN EDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The environmental disaster "Waiting to Happen in Haiti" (by Jean-Michel 
Cousteau, May 7) is not waiting -- it has happened. 
</P>
<P>
Once the "garden of Eden" of the Caribbean with lush forests and rich farms, 
Haiti has been ravaged by a population explosion, exploitation, civil tyranny 
and now deforestation and environmental degradation. Ninety-five percent of the 
forests are gone. That trend all over the world is sending millions of people 
across borders to escape from poverty, starvation and oppression. The United 
Nations' World Commission on Environment and Development has warned that 
population growth is outstripping food, agricultural and forest resources, 
water and health and energy supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Our giant population centers -- Los Angeles included -- are becoming wastelands 
of pollution, traffic, people, crime and poverty. The Bush Administration and 
Congress act as though none of this is happening here or anywhere else. Haiti, 
one of our neighbors, is sending us a message for herself and others: "Help!"

HAVEN FROM CATASTROPHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your accurate and informative article by Gary Libman entitled 
"High Cost of Victory" on April 25. Cancer is definitely the greatest challenge 
I have met since my original diagnosis in 1982 at the age of 27. 
</P>
<P>
I enjoy full remission now, but have been heavily penalized for using my health 
insurance. My premiums are prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
In the article Libman made reference to SB-6, which was introduced this year by 
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys). SB-6 would provide catastrophic health benefits 
for Californians. SB-6 will sell -- not give -- basic coverage at actual 
premium rates without subsidy. There is optional catastrophic health coverage 
with premium rates that are capped with three sources of subsidy: Proposition 
99 money (cigarette and tobacco tax); Medi-Cal savings (for those people who 
can buy SB-6 coverage rather than apply for Medi-Cal) and investment money from 
premiums paid. 
</P>
<P>
SB-6 will benefit all Californians. Those who are healthy now and have rarely 
used their health insurance pay hefty premiums to help defray the cost of the 
seriously ill. With passage of SB-6, the insurance companies will have no 
excuse to raise the rates so drastically. The taxpayer will not foot the bill 
for SB-6.

ADDING INSULT TO INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found a few interesting points in the story on John Mack. During his 
sentencing, Mack was described as being under "intense psychological pressure 
from 72-hour workweeks and a failing 3-week-old marriage." I also noticed that 
currently Mack is "handling major responsibilities under considerable 
pressure."

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: AIR PASSENGERS SHOULD KNOW THEIR BILL OF RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What rights do you have if your plane is canceled or delayed, or is overbooked 
and you are bumped? 
</P>
<P>
Most passengers either don't know their rights or, in many cases, don't know 
how to insist on protecting those rights. 
</P>
<P>
Start with a canceled flight. If it is because of weather, air traffic delays 
or a mechanical problem, are you entitled to: (a) free hotel room; (b) free 
hotel room, meal and free phone call; (c) an immediate booking on the next 
available flight; (d) none of the above? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, unfortunately, is (d). Airline schedules are not considered 
guarantees, and the cancellation and delay policies differ wildly between 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, you are at the mercy of the gate agent and/or supervisor at the 
airport where the cancellation or delay occurs. I've been on some flights that 
have been delayed for two days, and the airline did nothing but make vague 
apologies. 
</P>
<P>
Recently I was on a late-night United flight between Los Angeles and Chicago 
that was delayed an hour. After transferring us to another aircraft, flight 
attendants walked down the aisles distributing vouchers to mildly surprised 
passengers. The vouchers were each good for a $25 discount on any future United 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
If your flight is delayed or canceled, you really have no choice but to become 
your own best negotiator with airline personnel. But always remember that the 
airline does not really owe you anything except a refund if you later decide 
not to take the flight. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas, cancellations and delays can be even more horrendous for travelers. 
Scenes of hundreds of people sleeping on the floor at London's Gatwick Airport 
during weather or labor problems are not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you did an impromptu survey and asked those poor souls how many 
were flying first-class, you'd come up empty. When a schedule or operational 
snafu develops overseas, an immediate caste system seems to be employed by 
foreign carriers. 
</P>
<P>
If you're flying first- or business-class, many foreign airlines will bend over 
backward to get you a hotel, a decent meal and calls home to loved ones or 
business associates -- all at their expense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Good Business' 
</P>
<P>
"For us," says one senior foreign airline executive, "it's just good business. 
But if you fly on a discount ticket, well, you will probably just get what you 
paid for." 
</P>
<P>
What happens if you show up for a flight for which you have no reservation and 
are told by the counter agent that you have to go on standby for the flight? 
</P>
<P>
If seats become available, is it really first-come, first-served for standby 
passengers? 
</P>
<P>
Many travelers assume that if they check in early for standby seats on a flight 
that is sold out, they'll get first shot at any open seat at departure time. 
Not always true. Again, there's often a strict pecking order at many airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Full-fare first-class passengers flying standby are boarded first, followed by 
full-fare coach passengers, followed by the next-highest fare-paying discount 
passenger. 
</P>
<P>
Some airlines even add an additional criteria for determining who gets any 
available seats. United, for example, often looks at whether or not the standby 
passenger is a member of its Mileage Plus program, and, if so, how many miles 
he or she has accrued. 
</P>
<P>
But what about bumping? What rights do you have in that situation? 
</P>
<P>
Lots. First, look at the numbers. The number of passengers bumped by airlines 
has been slowly declining. Last year American bumped just .05 passengers per 
10,000; Pan Am bumped 9.75 per 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Matter of Habit 
</P>
<P>
But there isn't an airline I know that doesn't overbook its flights as a matter 
of habit. 
</P>
<P>
"The conundrum that we find ourselves in," said David Hinson, chairman and 
chief executive of Midway Airlines, "is that there's not a flight in our 
schedule, except maybe on Christmas Eve, when we don't have significant 
no-shows. 
</P>
<P>
"We also know, for example, that our MD-87 aircraft holds 133 people. We will 
often book it to 180 people, but it will push out of the gate with 110 people. 
Why? Duplicate reservations made on other carriers and a computer model we 
build for each flight history that indicates the probable no-show factor. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," Hinson said, "every once in a while we guess wrong, or one of our 
competitors cancels. Then we have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
When a flight is overbooked the U.S. Department of Transportation requires the 
offending airline, under a strictly enforced federal mandate, to ask for 
volunteers who might be willing to take another, later flight. In return for 
their efforts, the volunteers are then given a substantial reward -- cash or a 
free ticket. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years fewer and fewer airlines part with cash. Instead, they seem 
happier to part with vouchers for free flights at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
But what if no volunteers can be found? What happens then, short of a riot? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Let's Make a Deal' 
</P>
<P>
It's the airline version of "Let's Make a Deal." The gate agent will board the 
plane, announce that no volunteers -- or not enough volunteers -- have been 
found, and start the bidding to buy your seat from you. The bidding can be as 
low as $150 and as high as $2,000, depending upon the flight and its distance. 
</P>
<P>
If you have been denied boarding (and you checked in for your flight within the 
airline's rules, usually within 20 minutes before scheduled departure time), 
the airline is responsible for getting you to your destination within one hour 
of your originally scheduled arrival time. If they can accomplish this (and 
almost always, they can't), then they are not responsible for providing any 
additional compensation. 
</P>
<P>
But if your arrival time is between one and two hours late, the airline is 
obligated to pay you an amount equal to the one-way price of your ticket (with 
a minimum of $200). If your arrival will be more than two hours late, the 
required compensation is twice the price of the one-way ticket (maximum $400). 
More often than not, you get to keep your original ticket, which can either be 
used later or refunded. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, one logical piece of advice, if you want to avoid getting bumped, is 
to check in early for your flight. 
</P>
<P>
But then there are some folks who look forward to getting bumped. These people 
have no intention of taking the flight for which they are booked. They are at 
the airport with one purpose: to get "denied boarding compensation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Odds on Overbooking 
</P>
<P>
"These people know that the odds of overbooking on certain high-density flights 
is great," Hinson said. "We had one flight on Friday afternoon to La Guardia in 
New York City and every week the same four guys would walk up to the gate, 
tickets and seat assignments in hand, just before the final boarding call was 
made. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, by that time all the seats had been given away, and we had to 
provide compensation. But after about the fifth week we figured it out and 
broke up the scam." 
</P>
<P>
The same denied-boarding scam was tried -- successfully -- for quite some time 
on Detroit-New York City and New York City-Cleveland flights on American and 
United. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best part of that deal is that with many airlines your 
denied-boarding compensation is often given in the form of a free ticket, and 
that ticket is transferable.

JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HULSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I flew to Tahiti the other night with Ted Cook of Islands In the Sun. He was 
dressed in his usual aloha shirt and jeans, and he was returning to Tahiti 
because that's where his heart is. Twenty-five years ago Cook left his job as 
an aerospace engineer in Los Angeles to vacation in the South Seas. It was, he 
says, the beginning of a beautiful love affair. 
</P>
<P>
The day he got back to Los Angeles the freeways were clogged. A brownish haze 
hung over the city. Suddenly, everything that had seemed so terribly important 
made no sense. Inching his way in the bumper-to-bumper traffic, he vowed to 
return to the South Seas. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later Cook flew back to Tahiti and made a home movie that was 
shown to clubs and on television when he returned to Los Angeles. By now he had 
quit his job and moved aboard a sailboat in Long Beach, using the public phone 
on the dock as his office. Each time it rang, he ran to the booth, announcing 
breathlessly: "Islands In the Sun." 
</P>
<P>
Quitting his job was easy. Paying the bills was something else. His accountant 
told him flatly, "There is no way in the world you can make money." 
</P>
<P>
Cook told the bean counter to take a stroll. "He almost ruined my dream." 
</P>
<P>
Cook was obsessed with the idea of returning to Tahiti as frequently as 
possible. It took nearly 10 years to begin making a profit with his tours, but 
he kept his vow. Since that fateful journey when he was 28 years old, he's 
returned to Tahiti more than 200 times. 
</P>
<P>
In the bar of the Beachcomber Hotel in Papeete a plaque reads: "Here sits a 
legend," referring to Ted Cook. There's another at the Maeva Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
During a quarter of a century, Cook has shepherded more than 100,000 travelers 
to Tahiti from all 50 states, Canada, Mexico and dozens of other countries. 
Over the years he's moved deeper into the South Seas: to Fiji, the Cook 
Islands, Australia and New Zealand. He describes himself as "the guy with the 
bare feet and the briefcase," and the only time you'll see him in a tie is at a 
wedding or a funeral. And maybe not even then. 
</P>
<P>
Cook recalls the day years ago in Los Angeles' bumper-to-bumper traffic: "I 
felt if I didn't give it a chance, I'd always wonder what might have happened." 
</P>
<P>
What happened, of course, is that he became a legend. 
</P>
<P>
For a free copy of a 48-page magazine produced by Cook that features Tahiti and 
tours of the South Seas, write to Islands In the Sun, P.O. Box 1398, Newport 
Beach 92663 or telephone toll-free (800) 854-3413. 
</P>
<P>
Island Dreams 
</P>
<P>
For other background on French Polynesia, write to Tahiti Nui Travel, 1750 
Bridgeway, B-101, Sausalito, Calif. 94965, or call toll-free (800) 922-6851. 
Other information about French Polynesia is available from the Tahiti Tourist 
Promotion Board, 12233 W. Olympic Blvd., Suite 110, Los Angeles 90064. 
Telephone (213) 207-1919. It can supply you with brochures on the various 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
In Tahiti, look up John Hardie of Paradise Tour (he's the guy with the big 
smile who greets arriving passengers at Faaa Airport). Hardie provides 
limousine service, operates buses, rents cars. His cheapest auto rental is $22 
a day plus mileage. Write to Hardie c/o Paradise Tour, Vallee de Tipaerui, B.P. 
2430, Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia. (His tours around the island are 
legend). 
</P>
<P>
Unspoiled 
</P>
<P>
It's the impossible dream. Since the first jet set down on Tahiti more than a 
quarter of a century ago, not a single high-rise has risen on any of the 
islands of French Polynesia. Not on Tahiti or Moorea. Not on Raiatea or 
Huahine. No, not even on Bora Bora, the legendary island that was an 
inspiration for author James Michener. While the beaches of Hawaii and the 
Caribbean have been sacrificed to developers, French Polynesia has been spared. 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in the Tahiti Sun Press, editor Al Prince reported that "Japanese 
investors have finally discovered French Polynesia," with blueprints for a 
300-room hotel on Moorea and the expansion of the Hyatt Regency Tahiti and the 
Tahiti Beachcomber, both on Tahiti. A couple of 18-hole golf courses are 
planned, and new jet service already has begun from Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Hawaii's Sheraton Waikiki contains nearly as many rooms as all the 
hotels on all the islands of French Polynesia combined. During 10 days, Hawaii 
receives roughly the same number of tourists that Tahiti welcomes in an entire 
year. So hurry. Papeete is no longer a backwater South Seas village, and 
developers are closing in on this peaceful corner of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Dining in Tahiti 
</P>
<P>
Meals are first-rate at Restaurant Captain Bligh (about seven miles from 
downtown Papeete). This is the home of Tahiti's Lagoonarium, an underwater 
showcase for viewing dozens of sea creatures: shark, parrotfish, manta rays, 
moray eels, turtles, zebra fish and butterfly fish. An evening package that 
includes admission to the Lagoonarium, dinner (with wine), a Polynesian show 
and round-trip transportation from your hotel is $35. The dinner show at the 
Maeva Beach Hotel figures out to $29.50. Others: Acajou and Auberge du 
Pacifique (French), the Jade Palace and Le Dragon d'Or (Chinese), La Belvedere 
(for spectacular sunset dinners on a hillside overlooking Papeete) and Le 
Pescadou (for the best pizza in Papeete). 
</P>
<P>
Game Fishing 
</P>
<P>
Chris Lilly, 41-year-old skipper of the game-fishing boat Tea Nui, is an 
ex-Southern Californian who promises anglers "an experience they may never 
forget." Searches out marlin, tuna, wahoo, mahi-mahi. Charges $600 for a full 
day (up to six persons). Lilly also does picnic excursions, surf safaris. His 
Bertram flybridge cruiser is powered by a couple of turbo diesels. Details from 
Tea Nui Charters, Pirae B.P. 51069, Tahiti, French Polynesia. 
</P>
<P>
Bora Bora 
</P>
<P>
On Bora Bora the big hotels offer guests free use of snorkeling equipment, 
outrigger canoes, windsurfers, bicycles and video films. Receptionists will 
also get you a car, a moped, scooters. Guests cruise the lagoon aboard 
glass-bottom boats or double-decker launches. Erwin Christian of Moana 
Adventure Tours accompanies the guests of Hotel Bora Bora on reef and 
around-the-island trips. Also does shark-feeding cruises and snorkeling 
safaris, and sails with guests to small islets for picnics. Write to Moana 
Adventure Tours, P.O. Box 5, Vaitape, Bora Bora, French Polynesia. Hotel 
Sofitel Marara and Hotel Moana Beach Bora Bora offer similar services. Both 
operate double-decker launches on picnic/sunset/dinner cruises. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping on Bora Bora 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the hotels, there's little shopping on Bora Bora. A rare 
find is Galerie Masson (a few doors from Hotel Moana Beach Bora Bora). Galerie 
Masson, owned by Rosine, Tahitian wife of the late French artist Jean Masson, 
displays her husband's paintings as well as her own hand-painted pareaus 
(sarongs), pillow cases, necklaces. 
</P>
<P>
Moana Arts stocks photography by Erwin Christian, books, black pearls, 
clothing. The Pofai Shoppe near Hotel Bora Bora sells souvenirs, pareaus, 
jewelry, Tahitian tapes, film, snack items. Handicrafts by local artisans 
(woodcarvings, shell jewelry, woven hats/handbags) are displayed at The Artisan 
Center of Bora Bora on the quay in Vaitape. For black pearls, air-brushed 
T-shirts and other souvenirs, stop by Martine's Boutique.

MT. ATHOS, Greece 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monasteries, regardless of religion, appeal to that side of my personality that 
is contemplative, bookish and escapist. I arrange for a room, choose worthy 
paperback roommates, load a camera and journey toward the silence. 
</P>
<P>
I remember past monasteries: a rainy night's climb to the Buddhist monastery on 
Adam's Peak on Sri Lanka; the dusty ride to St. Catherine's in the Sinai, the 
shattering of thin ice to wash my morning face at the Japanese monastery on Mt. 
Koya, Honshu Island. 
</P>
<P>
The years passed and I found myself in Thessaloniki, shortened to Salonika, 
applying for permission from the Ministry of Northern Greece to go to Mt. Athos 
on the Chalcidice Peninsula below the plains of Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
Chalcidice, on a map, is like a turtle inching southeast toward Turkey. Mt. 
Athos is the northeastern arm of the turtle, a peninsula 30 miles long by 10 
miles wide, ending in the 6,600-foot Holy Mountain itself. 
</P>
<P>
From the peak of this mountain, one can gaze north over a landscape distinct in 
today's world: a hilly, forested peninsula dotted with ancient, fortresslike 
monasteries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Donkey Trains 
</P>
<P>
The unpaved roads of its interior are walked by men in black leading donkey 
trains that wind slowly past chapels containing icons from the 10th Century. No 
cars, no electricity, no telephone poles. 
</P>
<P>
On the western coast, over a pebble beach fronting a blue-green sea, stands the 
monastery of Xenophontos, founded in AD 520. 
</P>
<P>
The promontory is physically part of the Greek mainland, but by custom and law 
it is quite removed. It's an autonomous monastic state consisting of 20 large 
monasteries and hundreds of chapels and hermitages. Many caves remain for the 
ascetic who wants to remove himself from temptation. 
</P>
<P>
You climb the rope ladder, pull it up after yourself and drop a basket down 
once a day for bread and water. For visitors less ascetically inclined, it is 
possible to spend a night or more at one of the monasteries. But the 
possibility is limited to men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sacred to Greeks 
</P>
<P>
This has long been sacred soil to the Greeks, even before Christianity. Ruins 
of a temple to Poseidon were found at the base of Mt. Athos, the highest point 
in Chalcidice Province. 
</P>
<P>
The monks who live and work around Mt. Athos are the sole monastic branch of 
the Greek Orthodox Church. These are monasteries of the earliest traditions -- 
prayer and self-sufficiency, and were not intended for proselytizing. The monks 
grow what they eat, have no private property and are under supervision of an 
elected abbot. 
</P>
<P>
There are restrictions for visitors: no women or small children, no short 
pants, no musical instruments, no pets or movie cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Buses leave daily from Salonika to Ouranopolis, the town bordering the monastic 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
Heaven City, as Ouranopolis translates, is aptly named. Women must wait for 
their men to come back, which makes it look like heaven to the pilgrim 
returning from a stay in a land for males only. 
</P>
<P>
The ferries run daily from Ouranopolis to Daphne, the port of Athos. At Daphne, 
dock permits are inspected. The monks standing on the wharf cast trained eyes 
on each person who disembarks, in case a woman dressed in man's clothing should 
be hidden among the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spectacular Views 
</P>
<P>
The one partially paved road and bus line goes from Daphne to Karyes, the 
capital of Athos, over a mountain range that provides the first of many 
spectacular views. 
</P>
<P>
On the western side are monasteries built on stilt foundations and precariously 
overlooking the sea; on the eastern side is Karyes itself, along with the 
Prototos Church, a basilica from the 13th Century; Koutloumousiou Monastery, 
and surrounding vegetable gardens, fruit orchards and vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
Along the roadside lie tangled blackberry bushes and ivy, obscuring approaches 
to the forests of poplar, pine and chestnut. Bells ring for services and 
black-robed monks slowly converge. 
</P>
<P>
There are grocers, vegetable dealers, cooks, peddlers, street cleaners -- all 
of them monks. You'll see beards of all kinds: black, brown, gray, blond and 
snow-white; some pointed, some spread out like bell-shaped brooms, others 
thick, curly, impenetrable. 
</P>
<P>
In Karyes, each visitor is taken to the office of Holy Supervision to purchase 
a card called a diamonitirion for 800 drachmas, about $5 U.S., which entitles 
one a visit to any of the monasteries plus room and board. It's not haute 
cuisine, but it's filling fare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cobblestone Roads 
</P>
<P>
All roads from Karyes, other than the one to Daphne, are cobblestone or dirt, 
and they often narrow down to trails. You can walk or rent a mule for the 
inland monasteries or hire a small launch for the coastal ones. The monasteries 
are situated so that to get from one to the next is never more than a day's 
hike, and often under two or three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Koutloumousiou is a 20-minute walk from Karyes. An ecclesiastical mansion 
covered by ivy and grapevines gone wild, it appears to be succumbing to the 
lush vegetation around it. Koutloumousiou was founded in the 13th Century, and 
counts among its treasures the left leg of St. Anna and the left hand of St. 
Gregory Theologos. Originally designed for 100 monks, it now houses 10. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few rooms on the upper two floors are in use; the rest are shuttered. 
Within the outer walls is a small chapel with gold and silver icons, 
ivory-inlaid prayer stools and an intricate, hand-carved wooden altar. 
</P>
<P>
On request, a monk opened the chapel's heavy door with a huge key hanging from 
his waist. The chapel is like a precious egg in a nest half-decayed, guarded by 
aged eagles. The monk demanded that our group stay close together and asked 
that I remove my hand from my pocket. 
</P>
<P>
While others listened to his tour, I wondered what was wrong with my pocket. 
Was it something Freudian or merely the fact that these relics were literally 
worth millions of dollars and there wasn't a cop within miles? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disappearing Cat 
</P>
<P>
Outside, in the courtyard, a cat -- fat and talkative -- rubbed gently against 
my ankle. I was bending over, stroking its back, when I heard a board creak. A 
frowning monk approached, wagging his finger at me. The cat disappeared into 
the shadows and I listened to a short lecture in modern Greek, which I couldn't 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
My four days were planned in a circle from Karyes, staying at three 
monasteries. After a night at Koutloumousiou, I walked to the Pantokratoros 
Monastery in the company of a Greek from Trieste and a German man with his two 
sons. 
</P>
<P>
When the monastery first came into view, it looked like a Gothic fortress. On a 
wooden porch built out over the massive front entrance sat two monks. One of 
them rose and came to greet us. His gray hair was tied in a bun behind, and the 
beard fell below his chin. He showed us to our rooms and told us when and where 
we would eat. 
</P>
<P>
It was as simple as that. There is no visitor's timetable of events, tours or 
sermons. 
</P>
<P>
The room I shared was in a large tower with a narrow archer's window that 
looked over a cliff down to the waves pounding on rounded boulders. It was 
clean and comfortable, and the view, illuminated by a full moon, was 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saints' Calendar 
</P>
<P>
For dinner we were taken to a small dining room at a corner of the tower, with 
views on two sides of the beach and cliffs. The long, wooden table was set for 
the 10 visitors, and a strong breeze from an opened window rustled the pages of 
a saints' calendar. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few young monks I saw brought our food. We had lentil soup, tomato 
salad, plates of small salty fish and home-baked bread washed down with fresh 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning we hiked to Vatopedi Monastery, where as recently as a hundred 
years ago 300 monks lived. Twenty-five remain today. Vatopedi is on the side of 
a hill where a valley opens to the sea and overlooks a harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Grapes grow in profusion, the ground sometimes smelling like a winery. In AD 
862, invaders burned the original monastery, killed the monks and took their 
treasures; the rebuilt monastery looks like a fortified medieval town. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finger of a Saint 
</P>
<P>
In the 19th Century, Robert Curzon, a British traveler, visited Vatopedi and 
was shown relics of St. John the Baptist. I didn't see St. John, but a monk did 
show me the reliquary, laying several relics on one side of the chapel's altar: 
the finger of one saint, the skull of St. Andrew encased in a gold and silver 
helmet with a hatch on top to view the bone, the belt of the Virgin Mary and a 
piece of the Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Vatopedi takes several days to explore. Twenty minutes up the coast, I found a 
secluded sand beach where I could meditate, feet submerged in the cooling 
waters of the Aegean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
I found myself spending less time in the dark halls of monasteries and more in 
surrounding gardens, observing scenes out of the Middle Ages: black-robed men 
hoeing the earth between lines of green beans and tomatoes, with the high 
crenelated walls towering behind, an arched stone aqueduct ending abruptly 
nowhere, the ruins of a Russian church open to the wind and two storks standing 
tall over a nest on a chapel roof at sunset. 
</P>
<P>
And everywhere the sound and smell of the Aegean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
To visit Mt. Athos, you must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Directorate of Churches, 3 Academias St., Athens, or at the Ministry 
of Northern Greece, Directorate of Civil Affairs, Platia Diikitiriou, 
Thessaloniki. 
</P>
<P>
A letter of recommendation from an American consulate is necessary for the 
permit. The permit is exchanged at Karyes on Mt. Athos for a diamonitirion 
permit at a cost of 800 drachmas for a stay of up to four days. Included are 
room and board at the monastery. 
</P>
<P>
A first-class hotel in Thessaloniki is the Macedonian Palace, which charges 
$110 U.S. for a double. In Ouranopolis, recommended hotels are the Eagles 
Palace Hotel and Bungalows (April through October, about $70 double, including 
two meals) and the Xenia Hotel (May through September, about $40 double, 
including two meals). 
</P>
<P>
KLM flies direct from Los Angeles to Athens. The APEX fare, with 14-day minimum 
stay, is $1,087 starting in June. Olympic Airways flies from Athens to 
Salonika. Cost is $86 round trip. The round trip by train is about $30, but the 
pace is slow. 
</P>
<P>
In Athens, the Greek National Tourist Organization office is at 2 Amerikis St. 
and at 34 Mitropoleos St., Salonika. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact the Greek National Tourist Organization at 611 W. 
6th St., Suite 1998, Los Angeles 90017, or call (213) 626-6696.

VOLUNTEER FOR VACATION AND SEE THE REAL WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM UPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Why would anyone of sound mind want to work during vacation and pay 
for the privilege? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: To feel the breezes of Fiji and play with the fishes. To enjoy a fresh 
baguette and a bowl of bittersweet cafe au lait under a new-born sun in the 
French Alps. To be transformed from suburban housewife and mother of three into 
someone who has dug ditches in Nicaragua and learned that the people aren't 
simply "Communists, Contras or Sandinistas . . . they are Julia, Juana, Ramon 
and Carlos." To cradle a baby orangutan in your arms while the rain forest of 
Borneo steams up around you and the local insects scratch out tunes of mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a vacation with a purpose. And while you are doing something, you enjoy 
all the beauty and scenery of an untraveled area," according to John Lucas, who 
has taken a volunteer vacation. He is talking about vacations to which he and 
others have contributed time and money. They pay their own expenses and help 
complete scientific, ecological and social service projects for organizations 
that can't afford to hire help. 
</P>
<P>
Some projects are near home. Others are baked beneath the stars in distant and 
exotic places. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Adventure 
</P>
<P>
They can range from excavating medieval ruins in the French Alps to planting 
trees for the U.S. Forest Service to building churches in East Africa to 
tracking down turtle nests for a study on the reproductive patterns of an 
endangered species in Quintana Roo, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions, projects and costs vary. On Lucas' trip, sleeping accommodations 
were aboard a boat floating on the crystal sea off Fiji. Dinner was prepared by 
a cook. Other travelers on other projects peppered around the world, however, 
sleep in tents and share dinner from cans which they open themselves. Costs 
range from about $500 to more than $2,000 for a project, plus transportation 
expense between home and the project site. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be flexible. This project in Fiji was relatively luxurious in the 
sense that we had beds and a cook," Lucas said. "There are a lot of projects 
where you're out in the rough in sleeping bags and cooking for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Skills 
</P>
<P>
Some projects require skills such as scuba certification. Some require good 
physical condition. Since projects are done in groups, an ability to get along 
with people in close contact is useful. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to be able to deal with situations you're not used to -- situations 
that can be as simple as the food you eat," Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
And you should be interested in the project. The 25-year-old Lucas, who teaches 
learning disabled students at the Landmark West school in Culver City, has 
applied to medical school. With that in mind, he looked for a project tied to 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-day University Research Expeditions Program (based at the University of 
California in Berkeley, but part of the entire University of California system) 
was exactly what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Dives a Day 
</P>
<P>
The program with which he became linked was involved in determining whether the 
chemicals in sponges could be used in medical treatment of humans. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas and others on the trip took three dives a day, collecting samples of 
sponges and tunicates, which are sponge cousins. The sponges will be analyzed, 
and knowledge of their chemical basis used for experiments later. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of intellectual stuff, but I have a slide of all of us near 
the end of the trip," Lucas said. "We were dressed in sarongs with this colored 
zinc oxide on our faces . . . trying unsuccessfully to look Polynesian." 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, there was dancing until dawn. "Those weren't intellectual pursuits . 
. . at least not in their purest forms." 
</P>
<P>
While Lucas was spurred by career goals, Ione Rice, who will be 80 in August 
and took her first trip seven years ago, had other needs in mind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finches in Costa Rica 
</P>
<P>
She just left on her 23rd project, this one to Fiji. She can converse with 
equal dexterity on Mayan history, whales, horseshoe crabs, dolphins, the 
leatherback turtles of St. Croix and the finches of Costa Rica. Her travels 
have been through Earthwatch, a Watertown, Mass.-based organization that 
sponsors more than 100 expeditions around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know what a dolphin feels like?" she asks. It is not a rhetorical 
question. "They feel like silk. They're slippery." 
</P>
<P>
After a short lecture on a trip to Borneo to study orangutans, she said: "They 
don't like being followed and they'll throw fruit at you. The first time they 
throw fruit the size of baseballs, you learn to get out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Her reasons for participating in volunteer vacations have a lot to do with 
ecology, history and the betterment of mankind and nature. But the bottom line 
for Rice is: "I like any trip where I learn something." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Meyskens, a self-described "Rockwell painting come to life," choose a 
voyage to Nicaragua with Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit Christian housing 
ministry that no longer accepts short-term volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not for Everyone 
</P>
<P>
In a book called "Volunteer Vacations," by Bill McMillon (Chicago Review Press, 
$11.95), Meyskens chronicled the voyage from her world into life in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Among her observations: "The people of Nicaragua have faces and names. We 
talked together for 18 days. We hugged together. We sang 'La Bamba' together 
under the stars. We slung picks in the hard, dry earth. They are not the 
enemy." 
</P>
<P>
In his book, McMillon has collected a variety of adventures and 
volunteer-vacation organizations and put them into a directory. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran of volunteer vacations himself, McMillon thinks such outings appeal 
to three types of people: those with a consuming interest in a subject, those 
with a need to serve others through social work and those who are somewhat 
dissatisfied with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, volunteer vacations are not a pastime for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
If giant cockroaches with antennae the size of chopsticks make you 
uncomfortable, perhaps a rain forest should not be your next vacation 
destination. But if you yearn for a trip that could retint the colors of your 
perception, a volunteer vacation might be just your style. 
</P>
<P>
There's one other thing. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Is it true that you get back what you put into life? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It must be. Many volunteer vacations are a tax write-off.

SOAKING UP A LITTLE HISTORY AT HOT SPRING SPAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
HOT SPRINGS, Ark. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the early decades of the century, the wealthy and wild poured into this 
central Arkansas town, joining the sick and the stiff for the warm, 
mineral-rich, bacteria-free waters said by local Indians to have curative 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
Just as they did at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., visitors also came for the race 
tracks, gin mills, bordellos and opulent gambling casinos, where people could 
get soaked when they weren't actually soaking. 
</P>
<P>
The town's rich and ribald history, especially the boom years from the turn of 
the century through the Roaring '20s, has the makings of a great potboiler of a 
novel, if not a movie. But beginning with the repeal of Prohibition, this once 
wide-open town began a long decline, speeded -- say locals -- by cortisone, Las 
Vegas and California-style hot tubs. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in an effort to revive the town, the National Park Service, which owns the 
springs and a good part of downtown, wants to restore the old spas along 
Central Avenue's "Bath House Row" and cut into the foot of Hot Springs 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Town fathers and mothers, together with the National Park Service, are doing 
all they can think of to lure tourists off the beaten interstate (I-40, an hour 
away) to what they are calling the "Vacation Capital of Arkansas." 
</P>
<P>
The Buckstaff, one of the eight bath houses, is offering "tingling surges of 
Hot Springs Thermal Water" and massages for about $10 each. The 
27,000-square-foot, Classic Revival structure, in continuous operation since 
1912, averages 30,000 baths a year these days, about 10% of the traffic in the 
boom years. 
</P>
<P>
Less than half a mile away is the Leo N. Levi Arthritis Hospital, built in 1914 
by the B'nai B'rith national service organization for indigent arthritis 
suffers of all faiths. It is still operating with the group's support, and is 
still treating stroke and chronic pain victims. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the bath house row restorations -- the elegant Fordyce -- opened 
this weekend as a visitors center, following a two-year, $5-million face lift. 
</P>
<P>
The structure, built by Col. Samuel W. Fordyce, a colorful railroad 
entrepreneur, is stuffed with original and restored furnishings, some donated 
by local residents. The National Park Service also is mounting photographic 
exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private 'Staterooms' 
</P>
<P>
The three-story Fordyce, considered "the most architecturally significant" 
structure on the row by the National Park Service, was completed in 1915 and 
built on the site of a previous bath house called The Palace. The colonel 
purchased a Knabe grand piano for the grand parlor, and equipped the lounges 
with phonograph machines and billiard tables. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to separate baths for men and women, the Spanish Renaissance 
Revival structure featured 22 private "staterooms," marble statuary, a gym, a 
library, music and assembly rooms, separate parlors, two bowling alleys and a 
roof garden. 
</P>
<P>
When Barbara Bush visited Hot Springs during the presidential campaign, she 
rode down Central Avenue on the Mule Trolley. But the best way to get the feel 
of the town is on foot. 
</P>
<P>
An energetic, hourlong walking tour of the historic district would begin with 
the Arlington Hotel, at one end. 
</P>
<P>
The twin-towered structure, described in Cutter's Guide Book of 1882 as "the 
most elegant and complete hotel in America," was where Al Capone used to stay 
-- in Room 442, facing the Southern Club, a gambling house, with his bodyguards 
and gang occupying the rest of the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Other guests at the Arlington have included former presidents Teddy and 
Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, H. L. Hunt and film producer Marvin 
Schenck. The hotel is open for guests and conventions, and mineral baths are 
available on the third floor. A hand-operated elevator, lined with beveled 
glass and polished brass, has been in use since it was installed in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inspection Tour 
</P>
<P>
From the Arlington, the next stop would be the Fordyce, then an inspection 
tour, if not a bath, at the Buckstaff. Period street lamps and new benches have 
been installed on Central Avenue, along with new landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
And, in conjunction with the Fordyce opening, a group of locals called "Friends 
of the Fordyce" are beginning regular tours, dressed in period costumes. 
Horse-drawn carriages will soon be available. 
</P>
<P>
After a tour, a short hike up Reserve Trail leads to the Promenade. This 
18-foot-wide, tree-shaded brick walkway is cut into the side of Hot Springs 
Mountain, parallel to Central Avenue, behind and above bath house row. 
</P>
<P>
Along the half-mile route -- which is about eye level with some of the ornate, 
bath house domes -- are benches and a permanent checkerboard. The promenade 
ends just above the Arlington Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
A good guide for such a circuit is "The American Spa" (Rose Publishing Co., 
Little Rock), an illustrated, anecdotal history by Dee Brown, author of "Bury 
My Heart at Wounded Knee." Brown writes of one shootout between rival gambling 
bosses, a Canadian named Frank Flynn and Maj. S. A. Doran, a Confederate 
veteran from Texas, in the 1880s: 
</P>
<P>
"The showdown on Central Avenue was a precursive model for the bootlegger 
battles on the streets of Chicago 40 years later. 
</P>
<P>
"On visits to Hot Springs in the 1920s, Chicago's most famous son, Al Capone, 
may have heard about the Flynn-Doran battle. In 1884, however, instead of an 
automobile, the vehicle was a horse-drawn cab, and instead of Tommy-guns, the 
weapons were Western-style six-shooters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bath House Ambush 
</P>
<P>
"On one of those infrequent but gloomy drizzly mornings that come to Hot 
Springs in mid-winter, Frank Flynn and his two brothers, Jack and Billy, were 
riding a cab near the south end of Bath House Row. Seven or eight of Doran's 
gunmen were posted nearby along the plank sidewalks or in doorways. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, shooting started, and in the first wild volley, Jack Flynn was 
mortally wounded and the cab driver was shot dead from his box into the street. 
When Frank and Billy Flynn leaped out to return fire, both were hit in a second 
round of bullets. Meanwhile, the frightened horses, dragging their reins, 
galloped away with the now empty vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Hot Springs' present is more prosaic, but much of the charm of a visit these 
days is the collection of folksy, funky roadside attractions -- some seemingly 
out of a bygone era -- sprinkled in and around the town of 35,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to such predictable tourist draws as wax and auto museums and a 
music revue, there are less antiseptic draws tucked around town: dusty antique 
shops, a small aquarium, rock shops featuring locally dug crystals, old 
hardware stores, several miniature metropolises -- known generically as "tiny 
towns" -- and reptile ranches. The Mountain Valley Water Co., also on Central, 
offers a self-guided tour of its museum of hydrology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I.Q. Zoo' 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best known of these attractions is the "I.Q. Zoo," now in a 
storefront across from bath house row. Here, to the delight of small children, 
a collection of "educated" animals strut their stuff: parrots play basketball, 
a chicken plays the piano, a duck plays the drums. 
</P>
<P>
For those with more sophisticated tastes, tea is served daily at a number of 
restored Victorian homes in the downtown area. From January through April, 
there is thoroughbred racing at Oaklawn Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
Outside town, there are such pottery kilns tucked into rural glens as Foxpass 
Pottery, where visitors can watch the distinctive stoneware thrown by hand. 
</P>
<P>
And on 21 acres, also on the outskirts of town, is perhaps the ultimate 
roadside attraction: the 50,000-square-foot Mid-America Museum, a publicly 
supported, state-of-the art, hands-on natural science and history facility, 
open seven days a week during the summer (closed Mondays until Memorial Day). 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are urged to "pull, tug, spin, pump, twist as you play with the 'toys 
of science.' Your own pace. Your own discoveries." 
</P>
<P>
No visit to Arkansas would be complete without mention of the razorback, a 
tusked wild boar that serves as the mascot of the University of Arkansas and 
all-around state totem. 
</P>
<P>
One whole wall of the Mid-America Museum is devoted to the folklore of the 
fabled, tusked pig. 
</P>
<P>
One small card recounts what happened when a razorback swallowed a stick of 
dynamite: " . . . killed my mule, wrecked my barn, broke every window out of 
one side of my house, and brother, I've got an awful sick hog." 
</P>
<P>
Most major airlines fly from the Los Angeles area to Dallas, with regular 
connections from there via American, Delta or Southwest to Little Rock, an 
hour's drive from Hot Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations in Hot Springs include the Arlington Resort Hotel &amp; Spa, 239 
Central Ave., at the end of Bathhouse Row (rates $48 to $72 per night; call

Albert Pike ($80-$145; (800) 426-3184). 
</P>
<P>

THE TIMES SHOPPER: MARKETS OF MEXICO CITY ARE A BROWSER'S DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN, Merin is a New York City free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico City markets can be an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every neighborhood has either a mercado, with shops brimming with food, 
clothing, gadgets and art, or a weekly tianguis where vendors hawk fresh 
fruits, spices, sweets and a wide variety of handicrafts from stalls. 
</P>
<P>
Large markets, which are accustomed to dealing with tourists, have good 
supplies of embroidered or hand-knit clothing, straw bags, colorful handicrafts 
and souvenirs in special stalls scattered between vendors selling foods and 
household goods. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller markets may sell more unusual goods and have prices that are often 
cheaper. However, if you don't restrict your browsing to the best (cleanest and 
most expensive) markets, be prepared for unfamiliar smells, sights and sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are rarely fixed and bargaining is expected. Most vendors accept pesos, 
dollars and traveler's checks, but few take credit cards. When paying in 
dollars, round off the exchange rate in your favor to get the best price. 
</P>
<P>
In the south of the city is Bazar Sabado, a browser's dream come true. It is 
set in an old mansion at Plaza San Jacinto 11 in the heart of San Angel, an 
exclusive, wealthy, residential area. 
</P>
<P>
This sprawling colonial structure was originally occupied by the Counts of 
Oploca, an influential aristocratic family that hired the best architects to 
create this showplace and family seat. 
</P>
<P>
Today the landmark building has dozens of stalls and shops on the first floor 
and balcony. A restaurant in the umbrella-covered central patio serves Mexican 
dishes. Outside the walls surrounding the mansion, streets are filled with 
stands set up by vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Artists turn the small park directly in front of the mansion into an outdoor 
gallery. Often a hurdy-gurdy man makes music on the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Bazar Sabado you'll find high-quality handicrafts including embroidered 
clothing, boxes made of brass and glass, ceramics from Puebla and Jalisco, 
hand-blown glass goblets, papier-mache and ceramic figurines of devils and 
peasants, carved-wood masks, hand-woven blankets and rugs, hand-knit sweaters 
and lacquered Olinala chests and trays. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Bazar Sabado's artists sell their work only here. One stall displays 
large and intriguing futuristic automobiles, airplanes, submarines and bicycles 
made out of discarded bolts, spatulas, saw blades, screwdrivers, other 
construction equipment and scraps of metal, for $25 and up per sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Another booth offers crystals in delicate silver (from $30) or gold settings 
(from $50) to be worn as rings or pendants. Others are carefully mounted on 
wooden base blocks (from $45) to be displayed on mantles or night tables. 
</P>
<P>
Girasol, the Mexican fashion label, has a boutique featuring long and short 
cotton dresses ($50 and up) with colorful embroidery and ribbon trim, 
multicolored pantsuits and hand-knit sweaters ($45 and up). Another boutique 
has handmade Christmas tree ornaments ($3 and up). 
</P>
<P>
Prices at Bazar Sabado are higher than at other crafts markets, but merchandise 
is more unusual and of better quality, too. Some vendors have fixed prices; 
several take credit cards. Bazar Sabado is open on Saturdays only, from 10 a.m. 
to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Centrally sited in the Zona Rosa, Insurgentes Market (Londres 154) is a 
mazelike alley with about 200 stalls filled to overflowing. Among the findings: 
embroidered clothing, hand-knit wool sweaters, baskets, blankets, glassware, 
ceramics, wood, leather, silver and gems (including pseudo-silver and gems, so 
buyer beware), copper and brass and papier-mache items that are functional or 
fanciful, plus blankets, rugs and rebozos (shawls). 
</P>
<P>
Best-bet stalls include Bertha de Ponce's silver shop at No. 145 (heavy silver 
and lapis necklaces, wide-band silver bracelets and eye-catching earrings of 
monumental proportion; about $8 and up); Juanita Garcia's lacquerware shop at 
No. 154 (black lacquer boxes with gold-leaf decorations, brooches and pendants, 
all from the state of Michoacan; $10 and up) and Artesanias Patricia at No. 174 
(specializing in all sorts of textiles and embroidered clothing from the states 
of Oaxaca, Jalisco and Chiapas; $40 and up). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bargain With Cash 
</P>
<P>
Insurgentes Market has reasonable prices for the skilled bargainer. Some stalls 
accept credit cards, but cash makes for a better bargain. Be on guard against 
onyx that is sold as jade and red and blue garments that may bleed during 
laundering. The market is open daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; some stalls close 
for lunch or on Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Centro de Antiquedades (Londres 161 in the Plaza del Angel, a series of 
little alleys and a picturesque courtyard), is a Saturday-only (10 a.m to 6 
p.m., more or less) antique fair. 
</P>
<P>
Antique armoires, made of richly carved wood and too large or too grand to fit 
anywhere other than a hacienda like the one in which it undoubtedly originated, 
sell for $800. 
</P>
<P>
Huge crystal chandeliers ($300 and up) deserve modern-day palaces. Smaller 
items include ancient tomes ($4 and up), vintage sheet music ($3 and up), 
coins, lamp fixtures ($6 and up), jewelry, china, photos and, best of all, 
retablos (religious paintings done with oil on tin; priced about $20 and up). 
</P>
<P>
Lagunilla, downtown at Rayon, Allende and Comonfort (near Plaza Garibaldi), is 
a multi-building market with stalls selling unexceptional food, clothing, 
household items, handicrafts and leather goods. 
</P>
<P>
However, every Sunday the area becomes a giant flea market, with hundreds of 
vendors selling antiques and second-hand paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
The objects, most of which sell for $15 or less, include crystal and china, old 
photos and watches, jewelry, paintings, vintage clothes and antique electrical 
devices for every imaginable application. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday market is very popular with Mexicans and tourists, who come in 
search of the bustling ambiance or the rare masterpiece that's been obscured by 
dust. Bargain hard, pay cash and watch out for hustlers . . . and for your 
wallet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Products 
</P>
<P>
La Ciudadela Arts and Crafts Market, downtown at the corner of Balderas and 
Ayuntamiento, is a shocking-pink building with 256 stalls selling wonderful 
folk art, run-of-the-mill handicrafts and a whole lot of junk. 
</P>
<P>
Best bets include painted wooden masks (from $15) from the state of Guerrero, 
most typically of tigers, pirates and demons with horns, and Nativity scenes 
(from $20) made of wood, ceramic or papier-mache, plus colorful lacquerware 
(from $40) chests, tables and trays, and copper (from $15) or earthenware (from 
$5) pots. 
</P>
<P>
Textiles include woolen rebozos and ponchos (from $20), and a selection of 
finely embroidered dresses with floral patterns (from $45). 
</P>
<P>
La Ciudadela features artesanias (craftsmen) at work. As many as 70 artisans in 
the mercado produce everything from weavings to woodwork. Prices depend on 
persistent bargaining; haggle down to the last peso, and pay cash only. Open 
daily from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Market, at Ayuntamiento and Arranda several blocks from La Ciudadela, 
is quieter, less crowded and somewhat less exciting, but offers a similar array 
of goods. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan Park Art Market (Sundays only from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) at Sullivan Park 
in Colonia San Rafael, is an outdoor gallery of modern Mexican art. Artists 
exhibit canvases and sculptures on the lawns, then sketch, read or chat while 
browsers stroll past. 
</P>
<P>
Quality, media and style vary but include: watercolors of typical Mexican towns 
or landscapes, oils or pastels of Indians or beautiful nudes, bold acrylic 
abstractions, sculptures of beggars in bronze and ceramic busts of Maya or 
Aztec chieftains. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is pleasant and friendly, and you don't have to buy anything unless 
it's perfect for that blank space over the mantelpiece. And don't forget to 
isit the nearby produce market for tasty nibbles of cheese from Chihuahua or 
Oaxaca, as well as exotic fruits. 
</P>
<P>
For readers with questions about the Reject China Shop (134 Regent St., London; 
Times Shopper, March 5): This shop and its branches went into receivership in 
December, 1986. All assets, including the name, were sold to new owners who 
resumed trading under the same name. However, the new owners are in no way 
connected to the previous owners and are not responsible for orders placed and 
paid for before their ownership. Claims for undelivered merchandise bought 
before December, 1986, should be addressed to N. R. Lyle, Joint Receiver, Grant 
Thornton Chartered Accountants, Fairfax House, Fulwood Place, London WC1V 6DW.

TRIBUTE TO A SLAIN ATHLETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 2,000 students of John Glenn High School in Norwalk filled the school's 
quad Thursday for an emotional memorial service for Juan Enriquez, 18, a senior 
football and wrestling star who was killed Tuesday in a drive-by shooting near 
his south Norwalk home. Students carried red, white and blue balloons and the 
football players wore their red jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a few days ago he was playing out here with everyone who was close to 
him," Principal Elias Galvan said, speaking at a podium decorated with 
Enriquez's letterman's jacket. "He always had a smile and friends around him. 
He always had a sense of pride and dignity. He did things to improve the image 
of John Glenn High School." 
</P>
<P>
Anger was expressed at gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Grace Napolitano said: "I'm speechless. It can't happen to us, but it can 
and it did. We have had enough, guys, enough of the violence, enough of the 
drugs. All of you have a responsibility to this (Enriquez) family, to yourself 
and to the community to cure what the heck is going on in this community. Until 
you wake up and start making a difference, who's going to be next?" 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Gutierrez, a football player, directed his comments at any gang members 
who might have been in the audience: "Chaka wasn't even in a gang . . . what do 
you think the chances are for you?" Football Coach Willie Norman announced that 
Enriquez's football jersey, No. 77, would be retired. The jersey he wore last 
season was given to his mother, Theresa Enriquez, who sat on the stage with her 
family and Caprice Fimbres, who had been Enriquez's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Tearful students expressed their feelings for Enriquez by sharing their 
memories of him and by reading poems they had written. 
</P>
<P>
Students also placed wreaths on the sidewalk at Horst Avenue and Algardi Street 
where Enriquez was gunned down. Football and wrestling jerseys with memorial 
messages written on them were left at the scene. Students also scribbled 
messages on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Enriquez's family, including his mother, also visited the student 
memorial.

HUNTINGTON PARK TO VOTE ON TAX FOR MORE POLICE, OTHER SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council is scheduled to decide Monday night whether to impose a 
utility tax on residents and businesses to generate $2.74 million for increased 
police protection and other services. 
</P>
<P>
The council will hold a special public hearing before it votes on the proposed 
tax, which would impose on residents and business owners an assessment equal to 
7% of their telephone, electricity, gas and water bills. The tax would take 
effect July 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William P. Cunningham said last week that he strongly supports the 
utility tax to pay for about 15 additional police officers and other services. 
The City Council would decide how to spend the money during deliberations on 
the 1989-90 budget this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more crime in Huntington Park like there's more crime everywhere," 
Cunningham said. "And there're more people also. It's impacted all services." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously last week to introduce the ordinance, setting up 
the final vote Monday night. There has been little public opposition so far. 
The city sent out notices of the special hearing last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the easiest thing to do politically, but I really think we have to do 
it," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrative Officer Donald L. Jeffers recently presented a proposed 
budget for the 1989-90 fiscal year to the City Council that was austere but 
balanced. The spending plan anticipated more than $200,000 in cuts for tree 
trimming and other city maintenance. It also reduced the budget for items such 
as Christmas decorations for Pacific Boulevard and a subsidy for the Huntington 
Park Symphony Assn., Jeffers said. It also includes no raises for city 
employees. Huntington Park employees received a 4.2% raise for this fiscal 
year, which costs the city about $300,000 annually, Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffers said the city is feeling the full effects of Proposition 13 now that 
state and federal subsidies have been reduced or eliminated. Revenues flowing 
into the city's general fund, which pays for most city services such as law 
enforcement and fire protection, have not increased. 
</P>
<P>
The city received about $9.8 million in general-fund revenues in the 1987-88 
fiscal year, for example, while revenue for the current year is projected to be 
several hundred-thousand dollars lower. Without the utility tax, revenues are 
projected to rise during the 1989-90 fiscal year to about the 1987-88 level, 
according to the preliminary budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Park Redevelopment Agency also has contributed to the city's 
financial woes, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Income Not Generated 
</P>
<P>
The agency's financial difficulties began in 1984, when several developers 
operating in a climate of high interest rates began defaulting or backing out 
of projects, city officials said at the time. Substitute developers were 
eventually found, but the projects failed to generate the property tax income 
that the Redevelopment Agency had counted on to meet its $4.4-million annual 
debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency has relied on the city to help make the bond payments. 
Sales tax revenue, which would otherwise go into the city's general fund, has 
been loaned to the agency over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
The city loaned the Redevelopment Agency about $1.5 million during the 1987-88 
fiscal year. That amount is expected to be reduced to about $800,000 this year, 
and to about $500,000 during the coming fiscal year as more projects are 
completed and generate tax revenue for the agency, Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the loans were responsible for a cash-flow crisis in 1987 
that forced the City Council to eliminate 13 positions and make other spending 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department suffered the brunt of the cutbacks, losing the positions 
of three officers, and five clerical and support positions. The department is 
authorized to have 59 sworn officers, but two officers are injured and two 
positions are vacant, said Police Chief Patrick M. Connolly. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary budget includes money to restore one of the lost positions, 
Connolly said. But the chief says he needs at least two more sergeants, and 13 
more officers to meet the law enforcement demands in Huntington Park, a city of 
about 52,000 people. The department also needs three more jailers, two 
dispatchers and two clerks, Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
About $1 million of the revenue generated by the utility users tax has been 
tentatively earmarked to pay for those 22 Police Department positions, Jeffers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The chief based his assessment on crime statistics that show a 21% increase in 
reported serious crimes from 1983 (3,573 arrests) to 1988 (4,334 arrests). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study at UC Berkeley 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city's ratio of officers to residents is lower than the state 
average, according to a recent study by the Institute of Transportation Studies 
at the University of California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
With a population of about 52,000, Huntington Park has 1.13 officers per 1,000 
residents. The average city police department in the state has a 1.51 officers 
per 1,000 residents, the report said. The 1980 U.S. Census counted 46,223 
residents in Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, Councilman Jim Roberts said the need for the tax "is almost 
critical." 
</P>
<P>
"I would say without additional police, we're going to lose our streets and we 
have no funds to buy additional police," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Other money from the tax has been tentatively earmarked for tree trimming and 
other maintenance ($284,100), and for the city's self-insurance and vehicle 
maintenance funds ($500,000), Jeffers said. Officials also have proposed 
restoring a $13,000 grant for the symphony association and about $19,000 for 
Christmas decorations along Pacific Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance to impose the tax would allow the council to exempt some 
parties, if it so decides. But no such exemptions are planned, Cunningham and 
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will be at 7:30 p.m. in the council chambers at Huntington Park 
City Hall, 6550 Miles Ave.

VETERAN LOGGER TEACHES FOREST SERVICE FIREFIGHTERS THE HAZARDOUS ART OF 'TREE 
FALLING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anybody can cut a tree down, says logger Douglas Dent. Start hacking a wedge 
out of the side of the trunk, and, as sure as rain falling from the clouds, the 
tree will come down. But try laying a 100-foot ponderosa pine out along a 
narrow clearing, veering from power lines, staying away from healthy trees and 
not injuring yourself. That's complicated, says the wiry Oregonian. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems awful simple, but, heck, I've been doing this for 20 years, and I'm 
just beginning to understand what it's all about," says Dent, a tree-cutting 
expert who has traveled to several continents, teaching the hazardous art of 
"tree falling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teaching Firefighters 
</P>
<P>
Dent, the author of a manual for professional timber men, was at Crystal Lake 
on Tuesday, 6,000 feet above Azusa in the San Gabriel National Forest, teaching 
his craft to 14 firefighters for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you're cutting eucalyptus in Australia, banyans in South America or 
ponderosas here, the principles are the same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hazards of tree chopping became vividly apparent two years ago, Forest 
Service officials say, when an engine foreman was killed on the fire line at 
Stanislaus National Forest. A tree he was downing snagged another tree, which 
snapped back and landed on him, killing him instantly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexpected Incidents 
</P>
<P>
"In my career, there were times when I was taking down between 50 and 100 trees 
a year," said Gordon Rowley, acting fire manager for the San Gabriel National 
Forest. "Every once in while, something happens that's unexpected to me." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the trainees were fire engine foremen or assistant foremen, who will 
take their newly acquired skills back to their units and teach them to others. 
</P>
<P>
Dent, 42, a short, bouncy man in faded jeans, a checkerboard wool shirt and a 
tin helmet, agrees that trees are as peculiarly individualistic as humans. But 
accidents like the fatality two years ago can be avoided, with some training, 
he says. "Experience is a great teacher, provided you live through it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, the trainees stepped up to designated trees and took their turns. 
These were big ponderosas, dead or mortally ill, lightning-struck or beetle 
infested. "Hazard trees," Karen Fortus, the Mt. Baldy District resource officer 
called them. "We get some pretty gusty winds up here, which could knock them 
down." 
</P>
<P>
In its simplest form, tree falling involves slicing a pie wedge, or "undercut," 
out of the side of the trunk with a big 36-inch chain saw, then attacking the 
other side with wedges and tipping the trunk into the sliced opening. "The 
undercut is like the sights on a rifle," guiding the trajectory of the falling 
tree, says Dent. 
</P>
<P>
But there are always complications, he suggests, sizing up a 100-footer. A tree 
can have rotten wood, or it can lean in one direction, both of which have to be 
compensated for, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the lean?" he asks his students, peering along the line of the trunk, 
encouraging some discussion. "Where's the best place to dump it?" 
</P>
<P>
Dent is a plain-spoken man, gently needling his students, quietly offering them 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tapping the Trunk 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see what it sounds like," he says to Patrick Williams, an assistant 
engine foreman in the forest's Chilao Station, who circles his tree, tapping 
the trunk with the back of an ax. ("A nice solid sound," explained a colleague, 
who had already downed his own tree, "means good wood. A thump means you got 
dried wood.") 
</P>
<P>
Williams slices into the big tree, sending chips and fragrant sawdust flying. 
His challenge is to avoid some power lines nearby and a stand of majestic old 
trees. When he pauses for a moment, Dent gives his undercut a critical look, 
sighting along the handle of the chain saw toward a clearing in the forest. "I 
think you can go a little deeper," he says, "but the angle of the dangle looks 
real good." 
</P>
<P>
After 30 minutes of sawing and sighting, the old tree crashes down. "The tree 
went just where you wanted it to go," said the logging expert. "Isn't that 
wonderful?" 
</P>
<P>
Dent says that the greatest hazard in "cutting the big uglies" is 
misunderstanding the dynamics of the cuts. "If you get those pie wedges 
crossing each other, the trunk can split right to the top," he says. 
</P>
<P>
John Armstrong, an assistant foreman in the national forest's Saugus District, 
pulls out a copy of Dent's book and points to an illustration of the "barber 
chair," when one slice is undermined by another, splitting the tree vertically, 
sending a piece of the trunk backwards. "You don't want to be standing behind 
it when that happens," Armstrong says. "It'll take your head off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Thrill 
</P>
<P>
But successfully dispatching a big one is a thrill. Seeing a big ponderosa go 
down where you want it gives you "an adrenalin rush," Armstrong says. 
</P>
<P>
You begin to understand why at the end of the day. Dan Smith, foreman at the 
forest's Redbox Station, is tussling with the day's biggest target -- a 
120-foot dead ponderosa, with some spindly branches near the top and a 
corkscrew lightning scar around its trunk, on the edge of the Crystal Lake 
picnic grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Lightning will literally cook a tree," Dent says. "That's what kills it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith must lay the trunk along a narrow alley between a paved road and a picnic 
table. But the equipment isn't cooperating. His saw has a fit of "altitude 
sickness," pumping weakly in the thin mountain air, and then its chain hits a 
nail, embedded there long ago by a camper. With a new saw, Smith cuts into a 
wedge of rotten wood, being careful to keep the sound wood at the corners of 
his undercut. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's a deep, resonant cracking sound, then another one, and the top 
of the big tree starts to move in slow motion. Smith turns off his saw, 
carefully pulls a pair of wedges out of the widening slice in the trunk, and 
steps back. He turns to watch the tree, about 30 tons of lumber, smash into the 
ground with a ferocious thump, shaking the earth and raising a cloud of dust. 
</P>
<P>
Smith expresses himself in the spare style of the experienced woodsman."It's 
kind of gratifying to see it go where it's supposed to," he says.

PANEL FACES $50-MILLION DECISION ON DISTRICT'S CROWDED HIGH SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MONTEBELLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with predictions that the Montebello Unified School District will soon 
outgrow its classroom space, the Board of Education will decide Thursday 
whether to build a new high school in Commerce or enlarge three existing 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The question has been hotly debated for several weeks by community and business 
leaders and school and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
They are at odds over whether to spend $69 million for a new high school when 
they could expand the old schools at a cost of $19 million. Backers of the new 
high school claim it would solve overcrowding for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the plan to build a new high school argue that the district would 
be forced to condemn commercial and industrial property for the proposed 
40-acre school. The debate was fueled by the recent refusal of Montebello 
voters to give the Redevelopment Agency the power of eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
The issue will be one of the most controversial and politically sensitive board 
decisions in recent years, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot at stake here," said Darline P. Robles, a spokeswoman for the 
31,000-student school district that covers Montebello, Commerce, Bell Gardens 
and parts of East Los Angeles, Downey, Monterey Park, Pico Rivera, Rosemead and 
South San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past several weeks, the school board has held four public hearings and 
expects to hold another Tuesday night for business leaders, residents, parents 
and officials before voting on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone agrees that we need more classroom space," Robles said. But that is 
where the agreement ends, she added. 
</P>
<P>
On the one side, School Supt. John P. Cook's proposal to build the school on 
one of two sites in mostly industrial Commerce is supported by many parents, 
the school board's president, Eleanor K. Chow, and by its business manager, 
Stephen Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
"We urgently request that you add a new high school to our already overburdened 
school system," a coalition of parents wrote to the school board recently. "We 
feel this is the only viable solution to a problem that will only get worse 
with the passage of time." 
</P>
<P>
The student population, which has nearly doubled since the last high school was 
built in 1971, will increase by another 10% by 1995, Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
And the three comprehensive high schools -- Montebello, Schurr and Bell Gardens 
-- and Vail Continuation High School are all operating at capacity. The 
libraries and cafeterias are outdated, and there is no more room for additional 
bungalows, Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the proposal for a new school include school board member 
Herbert M. Stearns, three of the four high school principals, acting budget 
director Walter Popkin, the Bell Gardens and Commerce city councils and local 
business leaders, all of whom point out that adding classroom space to the 
three comprehensive high schools would save $50 million and cut construction 
time in half. 
</P>
<P>
A new school could take up to eight years to complete, school officials 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the proposed new Commerce High School also say that expansion of 
existing facilities would not force the district to use eminent domain, the 
controversial power of governments to take land for public use. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the district, students and community would be best served by expanding 
the existing comprehensive high schools," Popkin said in a written testimony 
submitted to the board. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Norton, principal of Vail High School, supports a new school, saying 
crowding more students onto the three campuses will increase the district 
dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Arthur M. Chavez said he supports building a new school, and board 
member Darrell H. Heacock said he is still undecided. "I see merit on both 
sides," Heacock said last week. "I will have to wait to see what new testimony 
comes up on Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Willard G. Yamaguchi was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Halted Last Year 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to build a new high school was introduced in 1987 when as many as 
20 sites were identified, business manager Phillips said. But the plan was 
temporarily halted last year when enrollment seemed to stabilize, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In March when enrollments increased again, Supt. Cook resubmitted the plan to 
build a 2,000-student high school either next to Commerce City Hall or near the 
Bell Gardens-Commerce border. The first location would displace 21 industrial 
businesses. The second plan would displace 18 businesses, according to school 
district records. 
</P>
<P>
On May 2, the Commerce City Council unanimously voted to oppose the new high 
school plan, complaining that it would cost the city thousands of tax dollars 
and would take too many years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ruth R. Aldaco, in a letter to the school district, said the city would 
lose more than $410,000 in sales tax revenue if the school were built near City 
Hall, and $70,000 if the school were built on the second site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bell Enrollment High 
</P>
<P>
"We need immediate action against overcrowding, especially at Bell Gardens 
High," Commerce Councilman Robert J. Cornejo said in a telephone interview last 
week. "Enrollment at Bell Gardens High is way out of line." 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens High is the most crowded of the three comprehensive high schools, 
officials said. With an enrollment of 2,900 students, the school was originally 
built for half that number. 
</P>
<P>
Stearns said that expanding Bell Gardens High by adding several stories to 
existing buildings would alleviate overcrowding and the need for eminent domain 
proceedings against businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a lot cheaper," Stearns said. 
</P>
<P>
But Chow and Chavez said expansion of the existing high schools is only a 
temporary solution to overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Band-Aid approach," Chavez said. "We need to look out for these kids 
way down the line." 
</P>
<P>
"I am looking at the students who are in the second and third grades," he 
continued. "Expansion would not service those kids in the year 2000."

MONTEREY PARK BUILDING BAN EXTENDED 1 YEAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To give city officials more time to revise design standards for apartments, 
condominiums and townhouses, the City Council last week unanimously extended 
for one year its building moratorium on multiple-family units. 
</P>
<P>
The ban applies only to new construction in the community's most congested 
area, the northeast section. Although it was authorized for another year, 
council members and city officials say the ban will probably last no longer 
than 60 to 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was enacted last May so that city planners could consider 
downzoning more than 400 acres of residential property zoned for 
multiple-family housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reject Proposals 
</P>
<P>
But last month the City Council rejected all of the downzoning proposals 
suggested by the planners. In doing so, council members Judy Chu and 
Christopher F. Houseman said revising the zoning was not the best way to solve 
the problems of overcrowding in Monterey Park. Angry residents told the council 
that downzoning could hurt their property values. 
</P>
<P>
During that meeting, on April 27, Chu and Houseman said they wanted to find out 
what design restrictions might be placed on new construction to limit the 
number of units allowed in apartment and condominium complexes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ban Extended 
</P>
<P>
Although the ban was extended unanimously last Monday, some council members 
raised the issue of how long it would actually remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Houseman questioned the need to extend the moratorium for another year, arguing 
that the extension should be for only a few months. And Mayor Barry L. Hatch 
said: "I think we need to allay any fears that there is going to be an extended 
moratorium." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Hatch voted to continue the ban for another year, he said it should 
take no more than 60 to 90 days for the city staff to propose revised building 
guidelines and for the City Council to adopt any changes.

JUDGE ALLOWS PRIVATE FIRMS TO TAKE OVER CLEANUP OF OPERATING INDUSTRIES 
LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will hand over the job of cleaning up 
and monitoring the Operating Industries Inc. landfill in Monterey Park to a 
group of private companies within the next four months. 
</P>
<P>
The companies will do the work under terms of an agreement that was approved 
last week by U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Wilson, EPA spokesman, said responsibility for day-to-day monitoring and 
cleanup work at the site will be transferred gradually to the OII Steering 
Committee, organized by a group of companies that disposed hazardous waste at 
the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer of responsibility means that new contractors hired by the steering 
committee will replace the contractors that have been doing cleanup work for 
the EPA. The EPA and the state Department of Health Services will continue to 
supervise cleanup of the site, and the EPA will continue to develop a 
long-range cleanup plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Placed on Priority List 
</P>
<P>
The dump received more than 200 million gallons of hazardous waste from oil 
refineries, food companies and chemical and industrial plants before it was 
closed in 1984 after complaints about odors and other environmental problems, 
including the buildup of landfill gas laced with toxic chemicals. It was placed 
on the national priority list for cleanup under the federal Superfund program 
in 1986. The federal Superfund law makes companies liable for the hazardous 
waste they generate even after they have legally disposed of it in a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA gave companies that shipped more than 24,450 gallons of hazardous waste 
to the dump the choice of paying cash for the cleanup or taking on the work 
themselves. More than 50 companies agreed to pay more than $31 million in cash. 
An additional 60 companies chose to pay a much lesser amount, $1.9 million, and 
spend $34 million on cleanup work. The agreements cover only the initial 
cleanup efforts. EPA officials have said the cost ultimately could reach $200 
million to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Zimmerman, steering committee chairman, said the companies that took on 
the cleanup task believe they can do the job more efficiently than the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we can speed it up," Zimmerman said. "The whole idea is to accelerate 
the cleanup." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Approach 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman said experience has shown that the cheapest, most efficient way to 
deal with a toxic waste site is to tackle the problem aggressively, installing 
environmental controls as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The steering committee, through its contractors, will take over and expand the 
system for monitoring, collecting and burning landfill gas, improve irrigation 
and erosion control at the site and collect and haul away leachate, the 
contaminated liquids that accumulate in the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman said the group also will design and construct a plant to treat 
leachate at the site. Complicating the design of the leachate system is the 
fact that the 190-acre dump is bisected by the Pomona Freeway, and it may be 
necessary to install pipes over or under the freeway to carry leachate from the 
south side of the dump to the plant on the north side, he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 companies sent hazardous waste to the landfill, but 80% of the 
volume came from 182 of them, EPA officials said. Nearly two-thirds of the 182 
companies are parties to the agreement, including the top 10 sources: Chevron, 
Atlantic Richfield, American National Can Co., Texaco, Exxon USA, McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. Union Oil, Norris Inc., Sun Oil and Occidental Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Firms Added 
</P>
<P>
The cash settlements approved by the court last week for the initial stages of 
the cleanup range from $15,000 from the Coca-Cola Co. to $5.9 million from 
Atlantic Richfield. Two companies that were not part of the original settlement 
announced in December were added to the settlement this week. The companies, 
Ameroil and Southwest Processors, will pay a total of more than $440,000, 
including a 10% penalty for settling late. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the EPA intends to pursue action against companies that shipped 
hazardous waste to the dump but have not agreed to contribute to the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the next step in the cleanup plan will be construction of an 
expanded system to collect and burn landfill gas. The EPA has estimated the 
cost of building and operating the system for 30 years at $73 million. 
</P>
<P>
Landfill gas is created by the decomposition of trash. EPA studies indicated 
that the landfill will generate gas for 45 to 60 years.

JUDGE UPHOLDS REVOCATION OF CAR DEALER'S LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state's decision to revoke Brett Mitchell Chevrolet's license has been 
upheld by an administrative law judge, ending a five-month battle over the 
license for the dealership in the Compton Auto Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the state temporarily closed the dealership for tax and sales 
irregularities and later revoked its license, charging that Mitchell defrauded 
a Long Beach finance company. State officials said Mitchell received money from 
the company, Fidelity Financial, for titles for new cars and then failed to 
transfer the titles. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell appealed the action by the Department of Motor Vehicles but, after a 
series of hearings that stretched over three months, a judge ruled last week in 
favor of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The city, according to Ken Wibecan, special assistant to City Manager James 
Goins, has begun foreclosure proceedings against Mitchell for money owed the 
city. He owes $115,887 on a $175,000 loan he received in 1987 and $12,000 in 
back rent for the building that the city used to own. 
</P>
<P>
The city also is taking action, Wibecan said, to take back title to the 
dealership's building and land in the auto plaza. Shortly before the state 
closed the dealership, the City Council voted to sell Mitchell the land and the 
building for $2.5 million that he was to pay in monthly mortgage installments.

Photo, The Holiday, Latin-Style: Mother's Day in this country is the second 
Sunday in May, but many Latin American countries celebrate May 10. Catholic 
Charities workers in El Monte marked that date by presenting more than 300 
mothers with carnations, candy and groceries. Gloria Zamarripa had gifts for 
one mother whose baby didn't notice what was going on. Marie Munoz smiled as 
she received a flower, but daughter Gabriella didn't seem to understand the 
gesture. And it was a family day for Margarita Sanchez, Rosie, 2, and Edlyn, 11 
months. LOU MACK / Los Angeles Times

PORTRAIT OF A MEXICAN MASTER: DOGMATIC, BIZARRE, ACCLAIMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican artist Jose Luis Cuevas is at work in a studio at Pasadena City College 
as about 50 students, a couple of photographers and a television crew watch and 
record. Straight-backed, intense, his dancing blue eyes seeing nothing but the 
picture taking shape, Cuevas draws a pair of large male heads. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of Cuevas' work, there is only a passing resemblance to observable 
reality. The heads seem to take on the qualities of masks, heavy browed and 
snout-nosed. One displays a long seam with cross-hatching, like a sutured scar, 
the other seems to sprout another face from his ear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distinctive Signature 
</P>
<P>
Cuevas, surpassed only by 89-year-old Rufino Tamayo as Mexico's most widely 
acclaimed living artist, dabs with ink-soaked cotton, slashes with brush and 
grease pencil, then applies the distinctive Cuevas signature. He turns to his 
audience, glassy-eyed and disoriented, like a man who has just awakened from a 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
"Fantastico," says Bertha, his wife of 28 years, who is sitting to the side. 
"In 33 years, this is the first time I've watched him at work. I've seen those 
little pencils and brushes, but I never knew what he did with them." 
</P>
<P>
Cuevas, 54, who was putting in a one-week stint as the college's 
artist-in-residence, later dismissed his display in the studio as "theatrics." 
</P>
<P>
"The creative act is a private act, like making love," said the artist, a 
slight man with a Napoleonic ego who sometimes talks of himself in the third 
person. "Drawing in front of television cameras becomes a theatrical 
representation, like Cuevas playing the role of Jose Luis Cuevas drawing." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Malm, chairwoman of the college art department, said Cuevas was the first 
choice of the department's artists- in-residence committee. "They said, 'He's 
the world's best draftsman, and we'd like to get him,' " Malm said. Often 
compared to British artist Francis Bacon and American Willem De Kooning for 
their dark visions, Cuevas was the recipient of the 1983 World Print Award. His 
works hang in the permanent collections of, among others, the Museum of Modern 
Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Musee d'Art Moderne in Paris and 
the San Diego Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the artist's dismissal of public creation, his audience of art students 
is awed, admiringly hovering about him during a series of Cuevas-related 
activities at the school. They study the collection of recent Cuevas prints on 
display in the school's gallery, bloated, nightmarish figures with 
incongruously animalistic features. They listen reverently to the artist's 
flippant attacks on some of his Mexican colleagues. They push programs and 
posters into his hands to be autographed, and they ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you think of Chicano art?" a young woman asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Something extraordinary is happening with the Chicanos," said Cuevas breezily, 
basking in the attention of the students. "They've created a nostalgic art that 
refers back to something expressed by their parents or their grandparents." So 
powerful is this nostalgia, with its references to Pancho Villa and the Virgin 
of Guadalupe, that it is sending tendrils across the border toward its source, 
Cuevas said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have these artists in Mexico now who are returning to nationalism," he 
said. "They have a tremendous influence from Chicanos working in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Literary Influences 
</P>
<P>
A young man presses the artist on his well-known literary influences ("Those of 
us who draw are close to the art of calligraphy, close to the act of writing," 
Cuevas says). The student wants to know which artists best encompass both art 
and literature. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides myself?" snaps Cuevas, who has written six books. 
</P>
<P>
A provocative presence on the Mexican art scene since the early 1950s, the 
opinionated Cuevas has crossed swords with the mighty of the Mexican art world, 
suffered physical attacks and death threats, touched off brawls and carried on 
a passionate love-hate relationship with his native land. But he persists. 
</P>
<P>
"We all live in the middle of an earthquake," said Cuevas, talking in a 
deliberate, professorial Spanish, almost as if he were dictating a letter. "I'd 
say that in each Mexican artist, there is the heart and mind of a 
revolutionary. We all carry Pancho Villa around inside." 
</P>
<P>
Born in a poor section of Mexico City, Cuevas spent his early years living 
above a paper factory. "My first recollection is of paper trimmings, scattered 
over the floor like fallen streamers and confetti from the paper punches," he 
once wrote. "It was always carnival time at my house." 
</P>
<P>
The ready supply of something to draw on, an endless stream of bizarre 
characters outside his window and his own ill health (at age 10, he spent a 
year in bed with a heart ailment) drove him to art, he said.

SLAIN BOY'S DAD AWARDED $5.7 MILLION IN W. COVINA SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG QUINTANA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WEST COVINA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald Allan Tolleson Sr. never believed that all those responsible for 
murdering his 10-year-old son were brought to justice. 
</P>
<P>
Although the police and district attorney have closed the case, Tolleson thinks 
that others who either knew of or participated in the 1980 kidnaping and 
killing were never identified. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the jury awarded Tolleson $5.74 million in his wrongful death 
lawsuit against West Covina police, who Tolleson maintains bungled the original 
kidnaping investigation. Tolleson argued that police were negligent by not 
completely searching the main suspect's house. A thorough search, Tolleson 
argued, could have saved his son. 
</P>
<P>
In ruling against the city, the jury rejected testimony from Danny Jerome Young 
that he killed the boy immediately after abducting him. During the trial, 
medical examiners testified that Ronald was alive for up to four days after his 
abduction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City's Position 
</P>
<P>
In its defense, the city argued that Young -- who was convicted in 1982 of 
second-degree murder and kidnaping -- alone killed Ronald the day he was 
kidnaped and that others living in the Young household knew nothing of the 
crime because the body was hidden. 
</P>
<P>
But Tolleson never believed that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't buy it that a child was in that house for four days and nobody 
noticed," he said. "There were more people involved -- I want them all behind 
bars." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Craig Meacham said investigators are certain Young acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
"We're satisfied in our own minds that Danny Young did it," Meacham said. "We 
really have no reason to suspect that anyone else was involved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conspiracy Strategy 
</P>
<P>
Young was convicted after two trials in 1982. The first ended with a hung jury. 
At the second trial, the prosecution presented no evidence that Young killed 
the boy, but argued that he was involved in the conspiracy that led to murder. 
</P>
<P>
Young's brother, Orville Young, was tried as an accomplice in the case but was 
acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
In ruling against the city, the jury found that a "special relationship" 
existed between the Tolleson family and the Police Department, which did not 
live up to its assurances and responsibility to do everything possible to 
ensure the boy's safety. "Special relationship" is a legal term that expresses 
the duty of police to protect citizens under certain conditions. City officials 
say the jury misapplied the law. 
</P>
<P>
Tolleson said he anticipates an appeal by the city, but vows to take the case 
up to the state Supreme Court, if necessary. "Whatever it takes," he said. 
"I've been through two criminal trials and now this. We've come too far." 
</P>
<P>
Tolleson said he was surprised by the size of the jury's award, but that he 
does not expect to see much of it, given the appeals and his mounting legal 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Feeley, the city's attorney, said the city will file motions within 
two weeks to set the jury's verdict aside or force a new trial. A court hearing 
on those motions would probably come within a month, and any decision on filing 
an appeal would come later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tolleson first filed the case against West Covina in 1981. On a motion from the 
city, the case was ruled a "non-suit" in 1986 by a trial judge, meaning 
Tolleson had insufficient evidence to warrant a trial. Tolleson appealed, and 
the 2nd District Court of Appeal -- finding possible fault with the police 
investigation -- reversed that decision, a ruling that the state Supreme Court 
allowed to stand last year. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years after the murder, Tolleson, 42, continues to live in the house he 
shared with his son, just a few yards away from the household where Young lived 
and his son died. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Tolleson said, he will see a baseball game and think of his son, who 
was abducted while waiting for a ride to Little League. Pursuing the case has 
been a debt that he owes his son, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had my ups and downs," Tolleson said. "I've hit the wall a few times."

Free-Mail Issue 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 174 to 231, the House defeated legislation (HR 1149) allowing 
members of Congress to mail copies of the Constitution bearing their name to 
all households back home. The bill sought to ease franking, or free-mail, rules 
to permit the one-time mass mailing at a projected cost of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Lindy Boggs (D-La.) said the mailing would be "a great service to all 
of the people of the United States" in this bicentennial year of the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) called the bill "another congressional 
boondoggle . . . another chance to make ourselves look good at our 
constituents' expense." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

The 1990 Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 263 to 157, the House approved a fiscal 1990 congressional budget 
resolution that envisions $1.17 trillion in spending, $1.07 trillion in 
revenues and a deficit of about $99.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The measure (HR 106) will guide House and Senate action on individual spending 
bills for the year beginning Oct. 1, and prod Congress toward 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction goals. It also states congressional and 
presidential priorities for defense, foreign and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking major tax increases or spending cuts, the House budget was widely 
viewed as a status quo plan that repeats the congressional pattern of pushing 
tough fiscal decisions into the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) voiced support of the measure even though "we lacked 
the political will on both sides of the aisle to bite the bullet." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Schuette (R-Mich.) called the plan "a cover-up for inaction, 
postponing for tomorrow . . . real deficit reduction." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the fiscal 1990 budget plan.

Budget Freeze 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 30 to 393, the House rejected a budget substitute seeking greater 
deficit reduction primarily at the expense of domestic programs. The amendment 
by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) sought a 1990 deficit of $91.1 billion rather than 
the $99.7 billion targeted by the congressional budget resolution (above). It 
sought to curb Medicare outlays and block inflation-adjusted increases in 
certain non-entitlement domestic programs, and reaffirmed the defense spending 
freeze already a part of the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the substitute.

The House voted 49 to 373 to reject an alternative fiscal 1990 budget, proposed 
by Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) that sought to increase federal revenue by $9 
billion annually by levying a fee on imported oil. About $3.2 billion of the 
yield was to have been applied to deficit reduction and the remainder to 
domestic initiatives such as anti-drug and anti-poverty programs.

HIGH-TECH ARCHITECTURAL MODELS ARE SOPHISTICATED MARKETING TOOLS

"Balconies" reads one of the signs in Ron Knoll's storage area. "Solar Panels," 
says another, "Pines -- Black Forest" a third. 
</P>
<P>
The signs are just the sort of thing one might expect in a designer's 
warehouse, with one difference. They're glued to the front of small plastic 
boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the boxes are bunches of balconies and window frames, piles of solar 
panels and pines. All are no taller than three inches. 
</P>
<P>
These are the components of architectural models, small-scale constructions 
that render the flat blue lines of an architect's drawings into office 
buildings and shopping malls long before any ground is bulldozed or walls are 
built. 
</P>
<P>
A model maker "has to have the ability to see three-dimensionally. He breaks 
the drawings down into simple blocks and then builds it up again," said Knoll, 
founder of Knoll Architectural Models in Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 10 years ago architectural model makers used paper and wood, the 
traditional materials of ship models. Most models were straightforward 
interpretations of the blueprints, with painted-on lawns and mirrors glued to 
the base for lakes. 
</P>
<P>
But as the development of commercial complexes around the country has 
mushroomed, and the marketing of them has become increasingly competitive, 
architectural models have grown larger, showier and substantially more 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Use Remote Control 
</P>
<P>
They are fast becoming the vehicle through which office tenants are recruited, 
community zoning and planning bodies persuaded, and the project's overall 
ambience expressed. 
</P>
<P>
Some elaborate building models, costing several hundred thousand dollars, have 
moving parts that can be operated by remote control, much like changing 
television channels. 
</P>
<P>
Walls are moved to see inside a building, lights are dimmed to reflect a 
building's profile at nightfall and roofs are lifted to view an interior floor 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
As the real estate market began to tighten in the early 1980s, developers began 
to seek new ways to grab the attention of lenders and tenants. At the same 
time, movie producers such as Steven Spielberg and George Lucas began to expand 
the use of models with scenes such as the intergalactic battles in "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
The advent of computer-aided design, however, turned the model-making industry 
inside out. Computers can be used in photographic chemical milling, a process 
that uses an acid bath to cut tiny fences, doors, girders and the like out of 
brass or plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Such materials are much stronger than the traditional materials and allow 
greater complexity and crispness in model construction, Knoll said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, computers have given model makers the ability to go beyond mere 
technical accuracy to a level of factual design. 
</P>
<P>
In the construction of an office complex, for example, the model maker can 
fashion such detail that a viewer can see window dressings in the storefronts 
and patterns in the inlay of lobby ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complex Model Built 
</P>
<P>
"Models used to be pretty objects, but with computers, they have become 
interactive displays," said Trip Anderson, founder of Trip Tech Models Inc. in 
Waltham, Mass. "Model makers are not merely technicians anymore -- they're 
artisans. They're bringing ideas to life." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's firm has just completed a 10-foot-by-12-foot model of Reston, 
Va.-based Himmel-MKDG's proposed Reston Town Center that includes more than 70 
electrical circuits and 100 separately designed miniature storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny human figures in realistic poses crowd the model's streets. A man clutches 
his hat against the wind on one corner, while a group of office workers eat 
sandwiches in a park area near another. The miniature marquee on the model's 
movie theater advertises "Hairnet" and "Desk Jobs." 
</P>
<P>
While traditional models were meant to last only long enough to convey the 
architect's ideas to the developer, the newer models are meant to have a life 
of two or three years -- long enough for the developer to convey his ideas to 
prospective lenders and tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The new models also cost a lot more. Traditional models carry a price tag of 
between $5,000 and $20,000. Elaborate models with interactive lighting and 
other realistic details start at $250,000. Anderson's model of the Reston Town 
Center cost $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
For that, model makers say, a developer gets a creation that will not only show 
a planning commission how the buildings will sit on the land, but tenants and 
potential investment partners just what sort of atmosphere they'll be getting 
for their money. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is put together a sense of reality for a project before it exists," 
said David Gibson, the Dallas model maker credited with introducing theatrical 
lighting devices and intricately detailed interiors into the industry 
repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have Become Standard 
</P>
<P>
Gibson made the first of the "super-models" in 1974, when he fashioned an 
8-foot-high rendition of the lobby proposed for the Pennzoil Building in 
Houston by the Gerald D. Hines Interests firm.

MORE FIRMS SHIELDING DIRECTORS FROM SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A growing number of California and U.S. companies, finding it harder to attract 
directors, are continuing this year to seek permission to shield those officers 
from liability in certain types of shareholder lawsuits, a survey of this 
year's proxy statements reveals. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that many shareholders may no longer be able to sue and collect 
damages in cases where they lost money following a company board's rejection of 
a hostile takeover offer. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of companies this year are joining the list of firms that last year 
began seeking shareholder approvals for provisions that indemnify directors and 
possibly other employees from monetary damages where judgment errors may have 
led to a loss of shareholder value, according to William M. Mercer Meidinger 
Hansen. The human resources consulting firm surveyed proxy statements of 260 
California-based publicly held companies. 
</P>
<P>
"They are called raincoat provisions because for protected officers, they 
insulate them from the rain of litigation," said Richard D. Greenfield, a 
Haverford, Pa., attorney who represents shareholders in numerous lawsuits 
against companies. 
</P>
<P>
The provisions are intended primarily to discourage lawsuits in instances where 
directors may reject hostile takeover bids and then see the stock price drop, 
said Roger Lustberg, an attorney at the Los Angeles law firm of Riordan &amp; 
McKinzie. The firm has written indemnification provisions for such California 
firms as Comarco, Foothill Group and Transtechnology Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Covers Judgment Errors 
</P>
<P>
Major shareholder actions seeking damages for fraud or misrepresentation can 
still go forward, Lustberg said. Also, shareholders can still sue for 
violations of federal securities laws, such as for failure to disclose or 
insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
"This will assure that directors are not liable for acts that are not wrongful 
but merely judgment errors," Lustberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is meant to cut down on suits from shareholders angry just because they 
lost some money," said Michael O. McCullough, principal at Mercer Meidinger 
Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't found it to be any significant impediment" to serious actions, 
shareholder attorney Greenfield admitted. 
</P>
<P>
The moves to install these provisions started following Delaware's action in 
1986 to amend its corporate law to allow such measures. The action was 
triggered in part by the high cost of directors liability insurance and the 
difficulty many firms have in attracting directors. 
</P>
<P>
Larger California-based companies incorporated in Delaware, such as Columbia 
Savings, Great Western Financial, Hewlett-Packard and Transamerica, sought and 
won shareholder approvals of such provisions in 1988, according to Mercer 
Meidinger Hansen. Others, such as Gap Inc. and Intel, reincorporated in 
Delaware to allow themselves to use the provision. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Delaware action, however, numerous other states, including 
California, amended corporate laws in similar fashion, in part to stem an 
outflow of companies to reincorporate in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
That has led a number of other firms incorporated in California, including 
Price Co., Teledyne, Oracle Systems, Marshall Industries and Flourocarbon, to 
seek approvals in this year's annual meeting season without having to

MENTALLY ILL AND HOMELESS PEOPLE ACT OUT THEIR TROUBLES AT IMPROVISATION

Leatta woke up in a state mental hospital in Idaho a couple of years ago and 
was told that she had gone on a rampage on a golf course. She had run around 
all 18 holes, removing the flags from the holes and tossing them on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
When she picked a song to sing before a small gathering in Santa Monica on a 
recent Saturday morning, it was Patsy Cline's "I Fall to Pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Rodney was once found by the California Highway Patrol under his truck on the 
shoulder of the San Diego Freeway. He warned the officers that there were Viet 
Cong snipers in the vicinity and that they should take cover too. 
</P>
<P>
On that same Saturday morning, Rodney made a peace sign out of Play Doh and 
presented it to the gathering in the manner of a carnival pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the weekly theater-comedy improvisation workshop sponsored by Step 
Up on Second, a walk-in activity center for the mentally ill and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all about keeping the kid in these people alive," said Rahla Kahn, an 
actress who has been giving her "playshops" -- one of the best-attended 
activities on the Step Up schedule -- for four years. "When you are a little 
kid, everything is possible. The dreams you have seem so real. For these 
people, the dreams ended a long time ago. I use improvisation games to give 
them permission to get up there and do things. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to get back to the curious, playful place we all once had." 
</P>
<P>
The playshop and a sketching class are the two arts programs at Step Up, a 
nonprofit organization founded in 1984 by Susan Dempsey, whose son is a 
schizophrenic. "It's a good release of emotions for the people here," said 
Dempsey, looking around the former art and picture frame warehouse on Second 
Street, now furnished with donated furniture. Step Up clients were sitting at 
tables talking, standing in line for lunch, resting on cots, looking through 
donated second-hand clothing and signing up for showers. In one corner, a man 
repeatedly played "Somewhere Out There" on an upright piano. 
</P>
<P>
"The programs make people feel good about what they do," said Dempsey, whose 
organization is supported primarily with county and federal funds. "For someone 
who might feel they are not worth anything, that's very important." 
</P>
<P>
The sketching class meets Wednesdays and is taught by a volunteer, Mary 
Mackie-Hagerth of Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Three earnest Step Up clients joined her for a recent session and another took 
his place on a stool, quietly waiting to be drawn. Anthony, 27, went to work 
immediately, working intensely with broad strokes as he drew Carl's face. 
Although he worked quickly, the portrait that resulted was a more than fair 
representation of Carl. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony stood back and looked impatiently at his drawing from several angles. 
He seemed unsure about what to do next, even after talking over the drawing 
with Mackie-Hagerth, who urged him to include more detail. 
</P>
<P>
It was important to him that he get it right. "If I can draw something, it's 
almost like I can control the world," said Anthony, who lives in Santa Monica. 
"You can create your own little worlds. If you get really good at it, other 
people will look at what you have done and they can enter into the world you 
have created." 
</P>
<P>
Helen, who wore a wool cap and a flowered dress, kept up a steady stream of 
comic patter as she drew, sometimes lapsing into a mock Russian accent to get a 
laugh. It was not possible to get a straight answer out of her. 
</P>
<P>
How long has she been in the class? 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in a class of my own all my life," Helen retorted with a sense of 
timing that Groucho Marx would have admired. 
</P>
<P>
In her younger years, she was a comedian, she said, and her patter is full of 
references to writers and performers. It was apparent by her multicolored 
portrait of Carl that she has also had experience in drawing, but she seemed 
most interested in entertaining her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"This girl was beautiful ballerina in old country," Helen vamped, gesturing 
toward Melanie, who was quietly drawing next to her. "Now she is great 
artiste." 
</P>
<P>
Melanie, a diminutive, soft-spoken young woman, laughed shyly. "She is good for 
my ego," Melanie said. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie, who works as a pet groomer, fashioned a portrait of Carl in dark gray 
and peach. She had not drawn before she joined the class a year and a half ago. 
"When I started, you couldn't tell male from female when I drew a face," she 
said. "Then you start to get it. I practiced at home. I keep a book of drawings 
and watch my progress." 
</P>
<P>
The portrait captured a pensive look in Carl's eyes. Melanie worked in details 
with a sure hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she could sell her work," Mackie-Hagerth said. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, gregarious man, who is a client of Step Up but not in the class, walked 
over to watch her draw. Then he spoke to Carl. "You never looked better, young 
man," he said. "This woman has put a magic wand to this painting." 
</P>
<P>
Melanie blushed a bit, but she also beamed. 
</P>
<P>
The quiet of the sketch class was in sharp contrast to the rambunctiousness of 
the Saturday improvisation session later that same week, which was attended by 
18 Step Up clients. Kahn began it, as she always does, with everyone standing 
in a circle, singing the Rodgers and Hammerstein standard "Getting to Know 
You." 
</P>
<P>
The scene was nothing like her first visit to Step Up in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn, who believes in Norman Cousins' widely promoted theory that laughter can 
have a therapeutic effect, was filling in for a friend who routinely showed 
comedy videos at Step Up to raise the spirits of clients. "I pushed the little 
video cart around and showed the tapes," Kahn remembered, "and they were 
literally falling asleep on me as they watched them. I thought, 'Screw this.' I 
got them off their butts and doing things. I knew all these theater games, and 
they loved them." 
</P>
<P>
When Dempsey saw how Kahn sparked the Step Up people, she asked her to do a 
class on a weekly basis, for which Kahn gets a weekly honorarium of $50. "It's 
not much, but I needed to get a little something," said Kahn, who recently quit 
her job at an advertising agency to concentrate on her acting career. 
</P>
<P>
After "Getting to Know You," she had the group play a game called "Oh, Great 
One," in which the participants take turns being the wisest person in the 
universe. The others ask questions, to which the "Great One" must answer with 
the first word that comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, Great One, why are you a vegetarian?" 
</P>
<P>
"Love," answered Nina, a 60-year-old grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, Great One, what does theater mean to you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Greatness," answered Anthony, who later said he would like to be an actor. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, Great One, what is freedom?" 
</P>
<P>
"Lost," answered Rodney. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney, a Vietnam veteran, has been trying to put his life back together since 
that day when the CHP officer found him under his truck on the freeway. He said 
he was on his way to work when he reached a bend in the road that reminded him 
of where he used to drive in a jungle convoy. Rodney said he flashed back, 
thinking he was back in the war. He was released after a stay in a Veterans 
Administration hospital, but he is still haunted by the fear that he will flash 
back again. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't sleep much," said Rodney, who started out the playshop in a polo shirt 
but soon changed to his customary Army camouflage shirt. "I take pills to knock 
me out. I'm afraid I'll dream and go back. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming to this gets me out of my shell. I get a rush from this." 
</P>
<P>
Kahn asked everyone to take an everyday object or a Play Doh creation, and sell 
it like it was a great invention. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the playshop came everyone's activity, singing. One by one, 
the participants took the microphone in hand, some delivering their songs with 
grand gestures, others more sedately. 
</P>
<P>
Bill, an intense man, hardly moved anything but his mouth as he sang a terse 
version of "Old Man River." Phil sang "Home on the Range" complete with animal 
imitations; Chris got into her version of "Somewhere Out There"; Tom put a lot 
of heart into the old Herman's Hermits hit "I'm Henry the VIII, I Am"; Helen 
worked the room with a Yiddish song, and Nina had everyone join in on "God 
Bless America." 
</P>
<P>
Leatta, whose life has been like a country and Western song -- bad marriages, 
abandonment, beatings -- sang "I Fall to Pieces" sweetly, with a tear in her 
voice. She has been singing since she was a young girl, occasionally with 
bands, and would like to return to performing. Until recently, her home was a 
tent in the back of a bar, but she now lives at Daybreak, a Santa Monica center 
that provides transitional housing for women with a history of mental illness. 
With her life becoming more stable, she dreams of getting back into performing. 
</P>
<P>
"If I ever did make it big, half of what I make would go into buying land and 
putting up houses for homeless people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn greatly encourages the playshop participants to dream of better times. "I 
believe in this kind of stuff. I think I own every book ever put out by Dale 
Carnegie," she said later, with a laugh, over coffee. 
</P>
<P>
But is it dangerous to encourage their dreams? Could it lead to inflating the 
hopes of a fragile person? 
</P>
<P>
"I think about that," she said. "But I believe in the word hope. Not that I 
tell them they are going to become rich and big stars or anything like that. 
But I don't think it's bad to give Leatta permission to sing again. Would it be 
better just to take her dreams away? 
</P>
<P>
"What's important are the little moments, right now. When they are walking down 
the street, feeling bummed out about what has happened to them, I want them to 
think about how good they felt at the playshop." 
</P>
<P>
Kahn has dreams of her own that she freely shared with her playshop. She 
unabashedly wants a role in a sitcom and spends her weekdays going to auditions 
and meetings. But she said that even if she is successful, she will continue 
with the playshops. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do this just for them," she said. "Even when it's rough, I get 
something out of coming here too. When I've had a rough week and haven't gotten 
any callbacks, I'm the one who thinks of the playshop." 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the playshop, it was time for Tom to sing his song. He had said 
almost nothing during the two-hour session and when he had, it was in a quiet, 
gentle voice. He too had once been a performer and had had a hard life. 
</P>
<P>
Tom sat in front of the microphone, a guitar in his lap, for several seconds 
before he began to quietly strum it like a ukulele. Then, without any 
performance mannerisms, he sang the 1950s hit "Love Letters in the Sand." 
</P>
<P>
Tom's innocent interpretation of the song had none of the sappiness of the Pat 
Boone original. No one in the playshop made a sound as he sang. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, the applause, whoops and whistles were loud and rousing. Kahn 
stepped up and touched him on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"You're shaking," she said to him, quickly drawing her hand away like she had 
touched something hot. 
</P>
<P>
"I know," he said in a quivering voice, and then he managed a shy smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you hear that applause, did you hear what they did at the end of your 
song?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said, the smile growing broader. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Tom," she said, putting her hand back on his shoulder. "That was for 
you."

ADDING A VISUAL LIFE TO POETRY; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER PIECE PICKS UP ON THE RHYTHMS OF THE LOWER EAST SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's poetry like you've never seen or heard before in "The Rhythm of Torn 
Stars," a self-described "theatrical adventure" opening this weekend at The 
Pink nightclub (formerly the Pink Elephant) in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"All the dialogue in the show is poetry," said Julian Neil, who has conceived 
and directed the eight-character piece. "Shakespeare is poetry, right? I did 
the whole play that way. But instead of using iambic pentameter and Old English 
verse, I used the words of contemporary poets. Shakespeare told tales about 
kings and princes. I talk about the artists and poets, the life style of the 
Lower East Side." 
</P>
<P>
The contemporary New York poets represented are Barbara Barg, Ted Berrigan, Jim 
Carroll, Sandie Castle, Lucky Cienfuegos, Maggie Dubris, Michael Lally (who 
appears in the show), Elinor Nauen, Frank O'Hara, Miguel Pinero and Ed Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
"What I did was edit all the poems," said Neil, 36. "Some of them are performed 
in their entirety; a lot of them are excerpted. But they're all performed 
dramatically as part of the story line. Poetry's been put to music for a long 
time. We're just adding a visual life to it, filling it out. It's something 
that New York poets started and perpetuated -- the performance of poetry, not 
just the reading of it." 
</P>
<P>
Although he's never written poetry himself, Neil's contact with the poetry 
world is longstanding: "Most of the poets I knew growing up in New York. Some 
of them afterwards. But the Latin poets -- Mikey Pinero, Lucky Cienfuegos -- I 
knew since I was young." 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "I don't know if it's relevant or if I really want it printed, but 
I was in a gang when I was a kid, and there were a lot of Hispanics in it. We 
were different, I think, from the gangs today. More territorial than anything 
else. And I come from very bright parents who encouraged a lot of reading. Yet 
I lived on the street. So we used to have gang fights in the afternoon -- then 
I'd go off to some rooftop and read Henry Miller." 
</P>
<P>
"The violence and romance" of that street life -- in addition to the cultural 
ferment of the '60s -- made the Lower East Side an especially fertile place for 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
"Dylan lived there with Joan Baez; people were playing in the street," Neil 
recalled. "It was alive. A lot of people don't realize what was happening then: 
All the stylistic innovations coming out of there were influencing music and 
dance and theater -- and the poets were at the center of that. They were 
influencing everybody. If you lived there, you knew it. There was a poetry 
project at St. Mark's Church. And Mikey and Lucky started the Nuyorican Poet's 
Cafe, a real center for the whole community." 
</P>
<P>
Although much of his work has centered on those Latino poets, Neil has not been 
blind to the behavioral excesses of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Mikey was always being thrown into prison," he said of Pinero, "even after 
'Short Eyes. He was writing a 'Miami Vice' and was shot on the Lower East Side 
for selling bad dope. He never got out of the broken bottle," and died of 
cirrhosis of the liver in 1988. "Lucky died, too. And Berrigan, who taught at 
Oxford and was one of the great American poets, was very rebellious." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Neil doesn't see the personal destructiveness and artistic creativity as 
being at odds. "What you are in your life is not what you are in your art," he 
said firmly. "You don't have to regard the messenger, just the message." 
</P>
<P>
In this case -- since many of the messengers are no longer alive -- Neil had to 
go to their estates to get the rights to the poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Yet none of the heirs and poets, he said, had any trepidation about his 
fiddling with the work. "I'm just putting it in a different context," Neil 
said. "It's like a jazz riff. Like when John Coltrane did 'These Are a Few of 
My Favorite Things': It reached a lot of people and was very beautiful. The 
important thing about this is that it's allowing these poets' work to reach a 
greater audience -- people who'd never ordinarily pick up a poetry book or go 
to a poetry reading." 
</P>
<P>
Neil's first stab at such an arrangement came several years ago in New York, 
with poetry readings (accompanied by music and dancing) at the Nuyorican Poet's 
Cafe. With "Nuyoricans: Bicultural Nomads" at the Public Theatre, there were 
also musicians, dancers and poets reading their own works -- yet this time Neil 
had edited the pieces into the story line about being Puerto Rican in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's taken it a step further. Actors will take over for the poets, 
performing within a self-styled story line and new theatrical identity. Last 
summer, a workshop production of the piece was done at Venice's Pacific Theatre 
Ensemble, where creating the correct New York ambience included bringing in 
trash cans -- and hiring local graffiti artists to paint the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Recalled Neil: "When it came to putting the piece together, I'd say, 'This 
character needs these poems, this character needs these poems' -- and the words 
would start touching off each other, the concepts would interrelate. We kept 
changing the order around till it worked. My favorite thing was when, after the 
show, screenwriters would come up asking to see a script, and I'd hand them a 
stack of poems. That's all we had then." 
</P>
<P>
Now the script is set -- and written down, and eight distinctive characters 
(played by Tate Donovan, Meg Foster, M. K. Harris, Lally, Mimi Lieber, Perri 
Lister, Michael Tulin and Maura Tierney) inhabit the poets' voices. 
</P>
<P>
"One character, Hollywood Mike, does Jim Carroll's and Pinero's pieces," Neil 
said. "Another character does Berrigan and Frank O'Hara. Kathy, a woman who 
runs the Happy End Cafe, does Elinor Nauen. And Sheila Velveeta, who talks with 
a British accent, does a lot of different poets. The accent wasn't there to 
begin with, but she tried it and it worked. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is, you can change the actors, change the accents -- but the work 
stands up. That's what's so beautiful about it."

URGES BIGGER SOVIET CUTBACK;

<P>
BAKER FAILS TO HEAL RIFT WITH BONN ON MISSILES

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III failed Friday to heal a rift with West 
Germany over nuclear missiles, leaving a shadow over the May 29-30 summit 
President Bush will attend with other Western leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had bridged the gap I would tell you," Baker told reporters after he met 
with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. He said the security 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could be at risk if the allies let 
their nuclear defenses down. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, in comments echoed by other NATO foreign ministers, described Kremlin 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal to withdraw 500 short-range warheads 
from Eastern Europe this year as a good but "very modest" step given Soviet 
numerical advantage in that field. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after briefing the ministers on his two-day trip 
to Moscow last week, Baker said the cuts had to be compared with NATO's 
unilateral reduction of 2,400 warheads this decade. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that Gorbachev's short-range nuclear forces (SNF) proposal 
was flawed in that there was no commitment to destroy the warheads or to 
withdraw them any further back than the European territory of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was reconsidering U.S. opposition to early talks with Warsaw Pact 
nations on reducing short-range nuclear missiles in Europe, Baker said: "Maybe 
it's time for more unilateral reductions on the part of the Soviet Union. That 
would be welcome." 
</P>
<P>
In Britain Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe also said Gorbachev's offer was 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is a proposal to withdraw warheads which could, of course, be returned 
again," Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker called the news conference apparently with an eye to denying Gorbachev a 
clear public relations victory with his arms proposals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Deeds, Not Words 
</P>
<P>
He rejected a reporter's assertion that Gorbachev was upstaging the Bush 
Administration with his new proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that because of the big imbalances that exist in weaponry across 
the full range there is no way we are going to win by trying to play a public 
relations game of outbidding the Soviet Union with respect to arms control," 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"We must keep our attention focused on the security of the West. Where we see 
deeds as opposed to words we must be prepared to react. But we are entitled to 
look for deeds and to probe and look for real evidence of the so-called new 
thinking," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain are resisting pressure from front-line West 
Germany and other smaller European allies to hold early talks with the East 
Bloc on cutting short-range weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Baker conceded that in separate talks Friday with West German Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher that no compromise had emerged to bridge the 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Issue Stressed 
</P>
<P>
He said that while U.S. differences with West Germany posed political problems, 
"what would be a worse disaster is if we let domestic politics endanger the 
security of the alliance." 
</P>
<P>
After their discussion, Genscher said that while the Lance modernization issue 
was no closer to agreement, "it was not the aim of this meeting to make 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that after a "full exchange" on the issue, he hoped that Genscher 
"better understands our position." He said he was still hopeful for a 
settlement before the NATO meeting in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
He also met Friday with Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek, whose 
country is one of several NATO members trying to mediate in the modernization 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch official said he had "good hope" the issue will be resolved and 
didn't think Gorbachev's proposal "will have a direct influence."

NEW YORKER PLANS TO SELL BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- CABLE BY CABLE

<P>
Remember the one about the guy who tried to sell the Brooklyn Bridge? 
</P>
<P>
This time, the guy is for real. 
</P>
<P>
The guy is Lou Pabon -- construction worker, bouncer, entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
Tarnished cable that once stretched like so many gossamer strands of the 
Brooklyn Bridge now lies in a heap about a mile away from the bridge. It is 
Pabon's plan to untwirl this giant mound of steel spaghetti and cut it into 
3-inch paperweights ($30-$40) and larger brass-, silver- and gold-plated wall 
plaques ($150 and up). 
</P>
<P>
"They will come with a letter of authenticity, on very fine parchment, suitable 
for framing," he said. "This is going to be hotter than the Pet Rock." 
</P>

You laugh? Customers already have phoned in orders to Pabon's Brooklyn Bridge 
Commemorative Corp. -- the number is toll-free, just like the bridge -- as he 
advertises for a marketing expert who can route the conversation pieces to a 
national audience. If all goes as Pabon plans, he hopes to pocket more than $1 
million for his troubles. 
</P>
<P>
And nobody knows the troubles Pabon has seen since he hatched the idea last 
year. "I was driving over the bridge and I saw iron workers taking down some of 
the cable," the 36-year-old Brooklyn resident recalled. "That's when it all 
fell into place. The idea went off in my head like a light bulb." "Look," he 
added. "I'm a construction worker during the day, I'm the (superintendent) in 
my apartment building, and I've been a weekend bouncer for 12 years at 
Dangerfield's comedy club. Like Rodney, I'm looking for a little respect." 
</P>
<P>
Here is a guy who first tried his hand at selling jewelry, then flowers, before 
committing to his last dream venture, a food truck in New York's Wall Street 
area. 
</P>
<P>
After many late nights of buttering bagels and cooking sausage, Pabon lost his 
curbside location to a string of new parking meters. So he sold his truck and 
went back into construction. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came home and told me about the Brooklyn Bridge idea, I said, 'Here we 
go again,' " said Irene Pabon, Lou's wife. "But the more he talked about it, 
the better it sounded." 
</P>
<P>
"If you listen to Lou long enough, anything seems plausible," said Tommy Galda, 
a 35-year-old New York club owner who became Pabon's partner. 
</P>
<P>
The Pabons are so confident of a score that they have plowed into the 
enterprise most of their $40,000 profit from the sale of a Bronx apartment 
building that Pabon and Galda had purchased at a city auction. Each man has 
spent about $30,000 to gather the cable and prepare for manufacturing. Although 
the Pabons were going to put their money toward the purchase of a house, they 
and their two young sons will continue to occupy a crowded, one-bedroom 
apartment, hoping that the bridge souvenirs will pay for more than just a 
starter home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had to Attain Cables 
</P>
<P>
For Pabon, the first big task was getting his hands on the hundreds of thick, 
century-old, suspension cables. 
</P>
<P>
They are being replaced by Nab Construction Corp., under a contract with the 
city of New York. A foreman on the job first told Pabon that he could have the 
stuff for what it would command as scrap (about 1.5 cents a pound) plus removal 
costs. But that was not what Pabon had in mind. He wanted to acquire the cable 
in such a way that its origins as part of John A. Roebling's famous suspension 
bridge would never be questioned. 
</P>
<P>
He called Edward Simpson, the president of Nab. Technically, the cable that Nab 
workers have been replacing belonged to Simpson, because the city had declined 
a contractual option to keep the souvenir material for itself (If the city had 
accepted the option, it would have been obliged to pay Nab an additional $1 
million on the $50-million-plus renovation project). 
</P>
<P>
Simpson told Pabon that he had decided to keep the cable. "I couldn't accept 
that," Pabon recalled. Redialing Simpson a few minutes later, Pabon asked the 
executive to spare 15 minutes to hear his pitch in person. Simpson invited him 
over. 
</P>
<P>
As Pabon, an employee of Naclerio Construction Co., remembers it, he raced from 
his own work site, in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn, to Simpson's office, 
in the College Point section of Queens. Dust rose from his jeans as he sat down 
in front of the suited executive. 
</P>
<P>
"I was skeptical," Simpson said. "Lou looked like a worker, not a promoter." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson told him that it would be difficult to make a profit. And he knew what 
he was talking about. The Nab president had already mounted a few pieces of 
cable as souvenirs for his own customers, at a cost of about $50 apiece; he 
didn't see a way of cutting those costs. 
</P>
<P>
But Simpson did say he would entertain a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Huddling with Galda, who has worked in real estate and knew something about 
proposals, Pabon drafted a plan offering Simpson 20% of the profits from the 
enterprise in exchange for the cable, and paper work stating that this is 
indeed the cable that his company is taking from the Brooklyn Bridge. Simpson 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Since striking the deal, Pabon's boss, Joey Naclerio, has lent Pabon the 
equipment needed to remove the cable from the storage area near the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Pabon pays the labor costs on each load. Then there is the rental of the lot 
where he is storing the stuff and the adjoining building where Pabon and Galda 
hope to cut the cable with a band saw and then mount the pieces in Plexiglas. 
An outside company has been contracted to manufacture the plaques. 
</P>
<P>
Pabon is thinking big. He has about 20,000 feet of cable stored away right now. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see, he said: 10,000 feet will be divided into 40,000 plaques. By 
charging $150 and up per plaque, Pabon figures to gross more than $6 million. 
Then, after subtracting manufacturing costs of about $35 per unit ($1.4 
million), and giving 20% of the profits to Nab ($920,000), he will have around 
$3.68 million to split with Galda. 
</P>
<P>
"Go down to Wall Street," he said. "Who would say that spending $1.4 million to 
make $6 million is a bad deal?" 
</P>
<P>
And that $6 million projection does not take into account the other 10,000 feet 
of cable, which he expects to split into 40,000 paperweights, at $35 to $40 
each, as a start-up seller. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers sound fine. Just one question: What if the whole thing flops? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather take a shot and go bankrupt than not take a shot at all," Galda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And Lou? "I don't see it flopping, but if it does, it doesn't matter, because 
I'm already satisfied that I have overcome so many obstacles to get where I 
am," he said. "I put a lot together -- the contract with Nab, getting the cable 
and the rest of it." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he even looks to writing one of those motivational books after he 
succeeds. "If you have a determination to see something through, there's bound 
to be some level of success," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roebling himself couldn't have put it better.

STIFF TERMS HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON DRUG CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG STRUCK, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The emergence of crack cocaine on city streets, with its accompanying vicious 
crime, has prompted a new wave of calls for tougher, harsher prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state lawmakers have passed laws increasing the penalties for drug 
offenses and imposing lengthy mandatory terms for some drug crimes. 
</P>
<P>
They have done so even though a decade of "get-tough" laws and a massive 
expansion of the nation's prison system has had little apparent effect on 
crime, according to corrections experts. 
</P>
<P>
While the number of people in prison in the United States has more than doubled 
since 1978, and states have strained their budgets to build new institutions, 
crime has continued a cyclic pattern in which reported serious offenses have 
risen, fallen and risen again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Decrease Seen 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't worked," said Marci Brown, of the National Center on Crime and 
Delinquency in San Francisco. "Now there are more arrests, longer sentences, 
mandatory drug terms. As the sentences have gotten tougher and tougher, we 
haven't seen any drop in crime rates." 
</P>
<P>
The continued call for long prison terms in response to drug violence threatens 
to further burden the nation's overcrowded prisons, and impose staggering new 
construction costs on governments already coping with tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government, which has long had the model of a well-run prison 
system, suddenly has found itself with half again as many inmates as cells. It 
opened six new institutions last year, and last month announced an accelerated 
construction plan to build four new prisons this year and seven more by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The states have nearly doubled the number of their prison beds in the last 
decade, at a massive cost, but still find themselves 16% overcrowded -- 1% more 
than when they started the construction boom. They are now building 100 more 
jails and prisons, and the American Correctional Assn. estimates the current 
construction tab at $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Relation' 
</P>
<P>
"The irony is the more cells you build, the more people you put in them. 
There's absolutely no relation between how many people you lock up, and what 
happens to crime," said Jerome G. Miller of the National Center of Institutions 
and Alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The number of serious offenses reported to police rose in the late 1970s, then 
decreased in the first half of this decade, and have risen slowly since 1985, 
according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports. 
</P>
<P>
But drug offenses have loomed larger in those statistics. Between 1980 and 
1986, the number of federal drug convictions rose 134% to make such crimes the 
fastest-increasing offense, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In 
federal prisons, 44% of inmates are serving time for drug-related offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, this comes at a time when most indicators suggest that overall drug 
use in the United States is decreasing. The annual survey of high school 
seniors, for example, has reported a decrease in the reported use of marijuana 
since 1979, and a decrease in use of all categories of drugs, including 
cocaine, last year. 
</P>
<P>
The virulence of "crack" and the lawlessness of the turf battles between those 
selling it in the drug ghettos of cities like Washington, D.C., have spawned an 
outcry for action. Legislators often respond by passing tougher laws, arguing 
that those caught will at least be "immobilized" from committing further crimes 
while in prison. Nearly two-thirds of them will be rearrested within three 
years of their release, and while they are incarcerated, law officials say 
others will take their place on drug-market street corners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Doesn't Work' 
</P>
<P>
"Their immediate statement is (that) we are getting tougher, we are getting 
these people off the streets and out of your neighborhoods," said Brown. "It's 
only later that you find out it doesn't work, and somebody's got to pay for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The call for these laws continues despite the pitfalls of the early model for 
this tack, the tough Rockefeller drug laws of New York. In 1973, then-governor 
Nelson A. Rockefeller called drugs the "No.1 problem" of his state and proposed 
to "get tough" by imposing a mandatory term for anyone convicted of selling two 
ounces or more of marijuana and similarly small amounts of other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
A 1977 study by the New York City Bar Assn. concluded that the laws had not 
reduced drug abuse or drug crimes, and that the criminal justice system 
resorted to plea-bargaining and other bureaucratic back alleys to circumvent 
the harsh sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Such evasions did not always work, and when the New York Legislature found 
first offenders and college students being given life sentences, they modified 
some of the Rockefeller laws in 1979. Although Rockefeller's successors 
commuted the sentences of more than 100 people imprisoned under the laws, the 
15-to-life penalty still applies for sale of cocaine and some other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Since arrests nationally are made in only about 20% of reported crimes -- and 
many more crimes go unreported -- it often is easier to demonstrate political 
determination on crime by increasing the penalties for those caught. 
</P>
<P>
According to Nolan Jones of the National Governors Assn., many of the states 
this year passed laws calling for long prison terms for drug "kingpins," severe 
penalties for selling drugs around schools and laws easing the seizure of the 
assets of drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Congress imposed guidelines on the federal judiciary in November, 1987, that 
have lengthened the sentences of many offenses, and eliminated parole for those 
convicts. Congress made the drug offense categories even stiffer in 1988 Drug 
Abuse Act, guaranteeing that the predictions of the Federal Sentencing 
Commission of a 6% to 9% increase in prison population will be too low. 
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines and the 1988 drug act are going to have "a dramatic impact" 
on federal prison population, said Helen Butler of the Bureau of Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Facilities 
</P>
<P>
Similar consequences are occurring in the states. Prison overcrowding is caused 
by both an increase in new inmates coming in, and by longer sentences being 
served by those already there. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last 10 years, sentence length has gone up dramatically," said Al 
Bronstein, head of the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
"At correctional meetings, all the talk is what to do with these older 
prisoners. We are going to have geriatric prisons," he said. "The age is going 
up and up. They need special diets. They have special health problems. And how 
do you train these people? Do you sit them down at a computer and say this is 
what you will do when you get out? They aren't getting out." 
</P>
<P>
The governments have tried to keep pace. The capacity of state and federal 
institutions jumped from 268,000 in 1978, to about 529,000 last year. But the 
prison population swelled from 307,000 during that period to 627,000, according 
to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The continued overcrowding has left 39 
states under court orders or consent decrees to improve conditions, according 
to Bronstein. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the nation's prison population continues to grow by nearly 800 inmates 
a week, enough to fill two new prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatives to incarceration became a victim of public mistrust in the late 
1970s. But faced with the staggering costs of building and operating an 
institution, some states have tried to come up with different approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota has instituted sentencing guidelines that lower the sentences when 
the state's prisons are filled. Delaware and Washington states have other 
guidelines that allow judges to put some offenders in special programs of close 
supervision and halfway houses. Some states are experimenting with electronic 
monitoring devices to enforce "house arrest." 
</P>
<P>
There is more talk that the solution to crime created by the demand for drugs 
is in treatment, not penalties. And Congress for the first time last year 
dictated that appropriations for the 1988 Drug Abuse Act be split evenly 
between enforcement and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly, the response to crime remains the cry of lock-'em-up. "The 
legislatures are concerned about prison overcrowding, but they continue to pass 
these laws that strait-jacket the courts and send more inmates in," said Tom 
Smith, associate director of the criminal justice section of the American Bar 
Assn. "It's sort of like someone who wants to go on a diet but keeps eating."

OPEN MIKE AND CAPTIVE D.C. AUDIENCE;

DRIVERS' GAGS ADD NEW LINES TO SUBWAY 
</P>

WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
"Welcome aboard Metro. Sorry we don't serve coffee and doughnuts." 
</P>
<P>
That cheery greeting from a Metro subway operator, booming from his train's 
public address speakers one recent Monday morning, drew rueful smiles from 
suburban commuters lurching shoulder-to-shoulder toward the start of another 
week in their downtown offices. 
</P>
<P>
Shove a microphone in front of some people and they can't resist hamming it up. 
There's something about an open mike in the front cab of a commuter train, 
pulling a captive audience of several hundred passengers, that tempts subway 
operators to become amateur comedians and tour guides. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Washington's 70-mile Metro subway system frown on this 
lighthearted ad-libbing, but most passengers seem to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hold Your Breath!' 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome, all first-time riders and visitors to Washington," said one operator 
as his train swooped down from the Virginia river bank toward the District of 
Columbia. "You are now 35 feet below the Potomac River, so hold your breath!" 
</P>
<P>
Another: "The next station is Smithsonian, home of the world's largest flying 
dinosaur." Passengers laughed and applauded when another announced the train's 
approach to George Washington University and -- his voice dropping to an 
ominous Boris Karloff bass -- "FOG-GY BOT-TOM." 
</P>
<P>
One operator on the Yellow Line route heading south across the wide Potomac 
notes that "this is NOT the place where George Washington threw the dollar 
across the river." He points out the Jefferson Memorial's cherry blossoms and 
the Pentagon ("the world's biggest office building"), and tells bad jokes all 
the way into suburban Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
When his train suddenly filled up with boisterous teen-age tourists, one 
operator made his customary announcement that "the doors will open on the 
right" at the next station's platform. Then he added: "For tourists, the doors 
will open on the left." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Offer Patter 
</P>
<P>
Metro spokeswoman Mary Bucklew said that among the transit system's 345 subway 
operators who haul passengers on more than 500,000 trips each day, only a 
handful of those at the controls indulge in good-humored patter. 
</P>
<P>
They get a mixed reaction from passengers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most complaints come from people who, "if they've had a rough day -- or plan to 
have one -- a little humor might hit them the wrong way," Bucklew said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like art," she said. "Some people find it entertaining; others find it 
irritating. We ask the operators to stick to the script, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-week training course for new subway operators includes three days of 
special coaching, with rehearsals using tape recorders, on making a few 
standard announcements over their microphones. 
</P>
<P>
These include identifying which line the train is traveling -- Orange, Blue, 
Red or Yellow -- and its final destination, giving the correct name of each 
approaching station and noting whether the doors will open on the right or 
left, plus occasional safety reminders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Official Support 
</P>
<P>
"We neither encourage nor condone going off on their own as comics or tour 
guides," said Jim Winn, Metro's acting general superintendent for rail operator 
training. 
</P>
<P>
But operators are not reprimanded unless their off-the-cuff remarks are rude, 
vulgar or inappropriate. Metro officials said many tourists appreciate being 
told which station is close to the sights they want to see. 
</P>
<P>
Only one operator, accused of "just being too exuberant," has ever been 
admonished to tone down his act, Bucklew said. 
</P>
<P>
Hezekiah A. Briscoe, an 11-year Metro veteran as subway operator and training 
supervisor, said he plays the straight man when he's behind his train's 
controls. But he does not mind when his colleagues try to lighten their 
passengers' load. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a little humor goes a long way," he said, "especially when it's 
Friday afternoon."

IOWA FARMERS WAIT, WONDER IF ANOTHER DROUGHT LOOMS

<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Yoder keeps a wary eye on grain prices and she tracks the nation's 
weather patterns, waiting and wondering if disaster will strike her land once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
The drought that turned her crops into shriveled stumps last summer has not yet 
loosened its grip on her Iowa soil, and apprehension has replaced the 
anticipation she normally feels at planting time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm usually optimistic in the spring," Yoder said. "I'm usually gung-ho . . . 
to get out in the fields, to smell the fresh dirt, put the crops in and watch 
them grow. It's like I'm renewed. I'm not too renewed now . . . . I sit here 
and I see no rain. I have to say I'm a little nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"The drought to other people in this country is pretty much over," the 
sixth-generation farmer said, "but I'm sitting here and it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rivaled Dust Bowl Days 
</P>
<P>
This patch of eastern Iowa and several other areas, mostly in the Corn Belt and 
Great Plains, have not rebounded from last year's dry spell that rivaled the 
desperate Dust Bowl days. Pockets of west-central Illinois, the Missouri-Iowa 
border, Kansas, the Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming are among the areas considered 
by experts to be in the severe-to-extreme drought category. 
</P>
<P>
In the South and West, the drought has either receded or it wasn't as dramatic. 
Rising poultry profits and beef prices also helped those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about tough times prompted President Bush to announce a speedup of 
about $850 million in crop payments to help farmers early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
In Iowa, Gov. Terry E. Branstad has declared six counties drought-disaster 
areas. And top lawmakers are seeking a drought "master plan," as government 
reports say 94% of Iowa soil is short of moisture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Half Normal Rainfall 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is that more evident than Iowa County, where only half the normal 
rainfall has fallen in the first three months of 1989, after the driest year on 
record in 1988. Many farmers say they need four to six inches of rain to 
replenish the soil this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Though it's premature to predict doom, there are some early worrisome signs: 
the soil is dusty brown and some creeks are dry, forcing many farmers to pump 
well water for cattle. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like August around here," said farmer Don Cronbaugh. "I've never seen 
a spring where we just didn't have water everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
"It has the potential where '89 could make '88 look like a monsoon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperbole, perhaps, considering 1988's bleak legacy in this rural county of 
15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Precipitation was 15 1/2 inches to 18 inches short of the 35-inch normal. The 
county's 32 bushels-an-acre corn yield was Iowa's lowest. The county produced 
3.1 million bushels, compared to 14.2 million bushels in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corn Yields Plunge 
</P>
<P>
Across Iowa, corn yields averaged 84 bushels an acre last year, compared to 130 
bushels in 1987. Precipitation statewide is about half the normal amount this 
year, after Iowa's second-driest year on record in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Some losses have been offset by the $3.9-billion federal disaster aid program. 
About $10.48 million has been distributed to 1,247 county producers. Some 
applications still are being processed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who farms got some kind of drought assistance," said Irene O'Meara, 
director of the county Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. 
</P>
<P>
Payments were provided to those who lost more than 35% of their crop. In Iowa 
County, they ranged from a few hundred dollars to the $100,000 maximum; the 
average was $10,000 to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
For many farmers, that wasn't enough to make 1988 profitable but it helped pay 
some of last year's debts and buy chemicals and seed for this year, O'Meara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disaster Aid Helps 
</P>
<P>
Yoder, who farms about 500 acres with a neighbor, said about $17,000 in 
disaster payments they shared helped her keep her cattle and buy feed. 
</P>
<P>
But because she lost most of her crop, her income still was less than half of 
what it would be in a decent year. 
</P>
<P>
Accepting drought aid from the government "doesn't make me happy," said Yoder, 
whose husband works as an appliance designer. But she compared it to an 
insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Farming and producing food are basic necessities of life. I've heard people 
call it welfare and a free giveaway," she added. "I think that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Already, Yoder, who lives outside Marengo, is watching weather patterns and 
hoping they'll be better than 1988, when her pastures were burned up by June 
and her corn averaged nine bushels an acre, compared to her average 135 bushels 
an acre. 
</P>
<P>
She also lost about two-thirds of her soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Videotapes Her Misery 
</P>
<P>
Yoder, who has two daughters, captured her misery on videotape "so my children 
will have something to remember. . . . If I told you 30 years from now I 
averaged nine bushels, are you going to believe me? The corn was 3-foot tall! 
I've never seen 3-foot tall corn in my life. . . . I hope I don't have to do 
that again. (But) I may. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
There have never been two consecutive drought years, but if that happens, some 
farmers say that could doom them. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's dry this year, there's going to be a lot of farmers, I might be one 
included, that are not going to make it," said Leslie Slaymaker, who has 240 
acres near Victor, on the county's western edge. 
</P>
<P>
Slaymaker and others worry because they have no cushion to fall back on like 
they did a year ago. Much surplus has been sold off and the ground is drier 
than it was in the spring of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bigger risk planting crops and trying to get something out of them," 
Slaymaker said. "There's no way we can catch up, even in the growing season." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to have to be an extraordinarily good year to be an average crop 
year," said Cronbaugh, who said government aid -- about $8,000 -- and good 
livestock prices eased some of his losses in a year when more than 80% of his 
corn was wiped out.

FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS FOR HONG KONG IMMIGRANTS; 
</P>
<P>
CHINESE FIND A HOME IN VANCOUVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The view from the peak tram is stunning as you look out over the busy harbor, 
the business district is bristling with new office buildings, and expensive new 
homes and condominiums can be seen cropping up across the bay in the area known 
as the British Properties. A young Chinese couple holding hands shares the tram 
ride back down the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
A pleasant evening in Hong Kong? No, this is Vancouver, British Columbia, on 
the west coast of Canada. The tram ride is to the top of Grouse Mountain, not 
Victoria Peak, and the young couple is more than likely a pair of recent 
immigrants from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 12,000 to 15,000 Hong Kong Chinese immigrated to Canada in 1988, 
and growing numbers are expected every year until 1997. That's when the British 
Crown Colony of Hong Kong reverts to mainland Chinese rule, ending the 
99-year-lease agreement between China and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The coming change of government has caused many Hong Kong Chinese to take a 
serious look at their future and opt for a new life in the West rather than 
live in Hong Kong under the communists. They question the workability of 
Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping's proposed "One Country, Two Systems," 
principle of government. 
</P>
<P>
Under this system, Hong Kong would be allowed to continue as a center of free 
enterprise; to be a conduit for international funds coming into China. In 
essence, a capitalist system within a communist government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easy Money 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has always been an easy place to make money, and in fact, since World 
War II, has emerged as the third largest financial center in the world (there 
are no minimum wage laws or unemployment insurance, no sales tax or import 
duties). 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 500 to 1,000 extremely wealthy families in Hong 
Kong, families who control hundreds of millions of dollars in United States 
figures. There is also a growing middle class. 
</P>
<P>
But the designation "middle class" has a different meaning in Hong Kong than it 
does in North America. These are families with a net worth of $5 million to $15 
million, and they number in the tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
It is these middle-class Chinese families who are most anxious to move their 
fortunes out of Hong Kong before the communists move in. Owning property in 
Canada has become an important form of insurance for them. 
</P>
<P>
If you are from Hong Kong, and you want that kind of insurance, Andrea Eng is 
the person to see. She is a native of Vancouver from a Chinese family, a former 
Miss Canada, and a highly successful real estate broker. She sold close to $200 
million worth of Vancouver property in 1988 alone, mostly to Hong Kong 
investors, and nearly all for cash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pay With Cash 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, yes, they buy all cash," Eng says. "We don't even question 
where their money comes from." She points out that with a maximum tax rate in 
Hong Kong of 15% to 17%, it's not difficult to figure out how much cash her 
buyers can accumulate. 
</P>
<P>
According to Eng, as important as the accumulation of wealth may seem, Chinese 
value their families as more important. Business is seen not as an end in 
itself, but as a means of maintaining family stability. And it is that concern 
for family that has prompted the recent rash of Hong Kong Chinese emigration. 
But why Canada, and why Vancouver in particular? 
</P>
<P>
For Danny Gaw, a recent Hong Kong immigrant who started a multimillion-dollar 
food service business, Vancouver offers a better life style. 
</P>
<P>
"The people, we find, are quite friendly," says Gaw, "and it's quite accepted 
here for different races to work harmoniously together." He also cites the 
availability of fresh produce and seafood as further reasons to settle in 
Vancouver. "We love to eat," he adds with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver Mayor Gordon Campbell points out that aside from the physical 
similarities between the two cities, there is a strong cultural link. "We have 
a large proportion of our community who are already Canadians from a Chinese 
background," he says, "and we've encouraged them to build on their traditions 
and to contribute to our city." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$2 Billion in Real Estate 
</P>
<P>
All these obvious amenities are not lost on Hong Kong investors, who have 
pumped upward of $2 billion into the greater Vancouver real estate market since 
1970 -- about $500 million per year. A case in point is the recent sale of the 
entire Vancouver Expo 86 site, 205 acres of prime downtown waterfront property, 
to Li Ka-shing, a wealthy Hong Kong investor who paid $320 million for the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Li already has family living in Vancouver. His Concord Pacific Development Co. 
plans to develop the site as condominium housing. The site, ironically, abuts 
the existing Chinatown district of Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Back in her office, Eng points to a map of downtown Vancouver where she has 
colored in Hong Kong investments. As she reads off the names, one quickly 
realizes that these properties are not just grocery stores and apartment 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"The New World Group of Hong Kong bought this," she points to the Holiday Inn, 
Harborside, "and on either side of the Holiday Inn are two major office towers 
overlooking the waterfront, the Coopers &amp; Lybrand Building and the Thorn, 
Ernst &amp; Whinney Building, both owned by offshore Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
She then points to Robson Street, Vancouver's prime retail area. "You can see 
that the bulk of the activity is owned by Chinese, in fact probably 80% of the 
whole block." 
</P>
<P>
That's a big change from 100 years ago, when the first Chinese came to 
Vancouver to help build railroads and work in the mines. In contrast, it is now 
the educated and the wealthy who are leaving Hong Kong. They have the means, 
and they don't trust the central government in Beijing to administrate the 
island colony effectively. 
</P>
<P>
So for a Hong Kong family with the means to emigrate, Vancouver looks inviting. 
There is the underlying familiarity of British colonial influence, the tram 
ride to the top of Grouse Mountain, a busy harbor complete with annual dragon 
boat races, and a well-established Chinese community offering all the 
accustomed goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials play down the label, for thousands of Hong Kong Chinese 
looking for a secure future, Vancouver is indeed a new Hong Kong.

UNCLE DICKIE'S BAD HABITS CATCH UP WITH HIM -- AT 105 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If the body is a temple, Richard Lewis filled his daily with fat-laden, 
sugar-sweetened sin. 
</P>
<P>
The New York man's diet, relatives say, read like a list of substances to 
avoid: fatback, fried eggs, sacks of sugar and salt, all washed down with a 
pint of Thunderbird wine a day. 
</P>
<P>
When Lewis passed away last month at the ripe age of 105, it was the end of a 
life that laughed in the face of cholesterol-conscious cardiologists and 
teetotalers. 
</P>
<P>
"He smoked cigars, he drank wine, and, this is no joke, he'd consume 15 pounds 
of sugar a month. And fatbacks," his grandniece, Sandra Williams, said. "He 
never wanted bacon. I'd take him bacon and he'd say: 'I don't want that lean 
meat.' " 
</P>
<P>
In his efficiency apartment in Brooklyn, Lewis, a retired junk dealer from 
Buckingham County, Va., would fry the fatback, take out the meat, break two 
eggs into the sizzling fat, and when he sat down to eat, "he'd take a piece of 
bread and dip it into the grease," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
That would be breakfast, which he would polish off with coffee thickened with a 
half-cup of sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who did Lewis' grocery shopping once a week, said that each month 
Lewis also would go through a half-pound of salt, three dozen eggs, countless 
Titan Philly cigars and as many pints of Thunderbird as his friends and 
relatives would bring him. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd have enough cigars to last him until the next time I got there, but he 
wouldn't have enough wine to last him," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd bring him a pint and say: 'Now Uncle Dickie, don't drink this whole thing 
in one day.' Then I'd come back a day later and it would be gone, and he'd say: 
'It's all gone? Is that right? I must have spilled it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, when Lewis reached 102, Merion Dismel was hired to cook and 
clean for him three times a week. But for the first few months, he refused to 
let her in. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to say: 'What are you coming in here for? I can take care of myself.' 
He wouldn't let me in at first, but I kept coming, and seven months later he 
fell in love with me," Dismel said. 
</P>
<P>
Dismel would mix string beans and tomatoes in with his beef and pork and 
chicken. "It wasn't too appetizing but that's the way he wanted it," Williams 
said. "He'd say it all got mixed up when you ate it anyway," added Dismel. 
</P>
<P>
"Uncle Dickie, he did what he wanted to do. He did exactly what he wanted to 
do," said Williams, who believes that attitude was the secret to his long life.

SEA TURTLES' LAST REFUGE MAY BE LAND IN FLORIDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to create the country's first land 
refuge for a sea creature. 
</P>
<P>
It will give loggerhead sea turtles a safe place to nest and for their young to 
hatch. The proposed refuge would include segments of a 20-mile beach at the 
Brevard-Indian River county line on Florida's Atlantic Coast. 
</P>
<P>
About 25% of the loggerhead turtles on the East Coast of the United States nest 
on that one stretch of beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One Last Opportunity' 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got one last opportunity to protect the second most important 
nesting beach for loggerheads in the world," said Earl E. Possardt, 
Southeastern sea turtle coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some development down there now, but we can make a difference in the 
long-term protection of that population. We've got one last chance." 
</P>
<P>
The largest nesting population is in Oman on the Gulf of Hormuz, center of the 
world's oil tanker traffic and target of attacks during the Iran-Iraq War, said 
Marydele Donelly, director of the Washington-based Turtle Rescue Fund. Their 
safety is not assured. 
</P>
<P>
Loggerhead turtles at one time nested from the Florida Keys to North Carolina. 
Those remaining account for 30% of the world population of loggerheads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Steady Decline' in Turtles 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking in the range of 10,000 to 12,000 turtles a year, and we've seen 
a steady decline in the loggerhead population. In some areas it's a very 
dramatic decline, as in South Carolina," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last large concentration," she said, although there is a lot of 
nesting farther south in Broward County, Ft. Lauderdale. "Who's to say what 
kind of nesting they'd have if they didn't have a developed beach?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans to Protect Beach 
</P>
<P>
The state of Florida plans to create a park in the area, protecting 4 1/2 miles 
of beach. Acquisition of the first acreage could begin this year. 
</P>
<P>
The federal program has much further to go. The concept has been approved by 
former FWS Director Frank Dunkle, but now the service must prepare an 
environmental assessment and investigate alternatives, including land 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
If land purchases are the alternative, the service will begin seeking money 
from Congress to buy valuable, high-priced oceanfront property, with an 
estimated price tag of $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
Four segments of land totaling 9.3 miles of beach and about 500 acres of sand 
have been identified for protection. The refuge would be only 100 to 200 yards 
deep.

America's preschoolers have a new sister: Gabriela, born Friday to Luis and 
Maria on "Sesame Street." 
</P>
<P>
The blessed event, eagerly awaited throughout the television series' 20th 
season, was fairly uneventful. Muppet and human characters gathered around 
Maria's bed to be introduced to the infant. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to Sesame Street and the world!" said Big Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything went smoothly. When it was time to go to the hospital for the 
delivery, Luis and Maria found that their car had been towed. Oscar the Grouch 
drove them to the hospital, occasioning much hand-wringing on his part. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a grouch," he explained, and grouches are not supposed to do nice things 
or be happy about events like the birth of a baby. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage of Maria and Luis was the finale for last season. Sonia Manzano, 
who plays Maria, became a mother 13 months ago and her real-life daughter will 
eventually play her television daughter.

PARKING METER MANUFACTURER SEES BRIGHT FUTURE FOR NEW SUN-POWERED DEVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS BYRD, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
RUSSELLVILLE, Ark. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seth (Skeeter) Ward has devised what he calls a revolutionary parking meter 
that runs on sun power and can erase the time remaining when a vehicle pulls 
out of a parking space. 
</P>
<P>
Its jam-resistant coin chute can tell a U.S. quarter from a Mexican peso, a 
Canadian quarter or a quarter-sized washer or slug. Customers may also pay with 
a plastic debit card. 
</P>
<P>
Ward, 35, is president of P.O.M. Inc., one of the biggest parking meter 
manufacturers in the United States. P.O.M. stands for Park-O-Meter, the 
original name of the company's first mechanical meter in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
What happens to his new solar meter if the sun is not shining? 
</P>
<P>
"We have storage capacity that will run this meter in pitch dark for 72 hours," 
Ward said. "And we will probably improve on that." 
</P>
<P>
Ward said the meters would get plenty of power from available light on even the 
cloudiest day or in the shadiest area. 
</P>
<P>
Prototypes have been tested for two years on top of a building in Little Rock, 
about 80 miles south of Russellville, where P.O.M. is headquartered. 
</P>
<P>
The gizmo contains an electronic eye, like an auto-focus camera, that senses 
departing vehicles and returns its clock to zero, eliminating free time for the 
next vehicle. It also senses when new parkers arrive and can electronically 
alert meter police if they do not pay. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said the meter costs about $240 if installed in an existing housing; the 
complete unit including a new housing costs about $340. A conventional meter 
costs about $180, but Ward said the money-saving features of his new units make 
them a good purchase for revenue-hungry cities. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 were scheduled for shipment in last month to cities in 12 states and 
several overseas locations, including Shepparton, Australia, which bills itself 
as "the Solar City," and Auckland, New Zealand. Officials installed some in 
early April in front of the Federal Building in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
The meter also features a scrolling advertising message that runs across a 
digital display. The Australian meters, for instance, will scroll, "Welcome to 
Shepparton, the Solar City." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Sekely, general foreman for traffic in the Little Rock Department of Public 
Works, said the city is most interested in the meter's inventory capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be able to tell how much each meter is being used and would have the 
capability of moving meters around where they would be more beneficial," Sekely 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The potential ease of maintenance also was a selling factor, Sekely said. 
</P>
<P>
"Electronics repair people are easier to get than watch repairmen," said 
Sekely, who calls standard manual parking meters nothing more than "an 
eight-day clock." 
</P>
<P>
Ward gets excited when he talks about his new meter's capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell a city that I can measure the efficiency of their ticket writers," 
Ward said. "I can tell you, with an auditing system, how many people were 
illegally parked and didn't get tickets." 
</P>
<P>
But P.O.M. is not getting out of the manual parking meter business, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
The company got 60% of all bids it knew of in the United States last year, and 
about 30% of its 1988 sales were in foreign markets, said P.O.M. sales 
administration manager Bobra Wilbanks. 
</P>
<P>
When Ward bought P.O.M. about eight years ago, he discovered that cities were 
largely unwilling to mix different meters. To his dismay, the most popular 
meter was made by rival Duncan Parking Control Systems, located in Harrison, 
Ark. 
</P>
<P>
P.O.M. had some big cities -- Denver and San Francisco, for example -- using 
its mechanical meters but was unable to penetrate markets such as New York, 
which has 63,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
When the patent on the Duncan meter ran out three years ago, Ward virtually 
copied it. Now, he sells replacement parts and new meters that will fit in his 
competitor's housing. 
</P>
<P>
New York officials bought 18,000 handles for mechanical meters on the last 
order, Wilbanks said. Vandalism and normal wear-and-tear are the most common 
causes of broken handles, she said.

The state Commission on Judicial Conduct has made public allegations against a 
state judge who enraged gay activists and civil rights groups with his remarks 
about homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
After a court hearing Thursday, lawyers for District Judge Jack Hampton and the 
commission said they had agreed to release the contents of "formal proceedings" 
sparked by more than 2,000 complaints against the judge. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations cite comments Hampton made in December to the Dallas Times 
Herald and the Associated Press, and remarks court personnel in Hampton's 
office allegedly made to callers protesting the judge's statements. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton told the newspaper that he gave a lighter sentence to convicted killer 
Richard Bednarski, 18, partly because his two victims were "queers." 
</P>
<P>
The commission charges allege that Hampton's remarks violated the Code of 
Judicial Conduct, which prohibits a judge from publicly commenting on a pending 
case. Hampton is also charged with violating the code that requires a judge to 
conduct himself in a manner that promotes public confidence in the impartiality 
of the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
Bednarski was convicted of killing Tommy Trimble, 34, and John Griffin, 27, and 
was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He could have received a maximum life 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not care much for queers cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys," 
Hampton told the Times Herald. "I've got a teen-age boy." 
</P>
<P>
The same day that was published, he told AP Network News: "The victims were 
homosexuals. They were out in the homosexual area picking up teen-age boys. Had 
they not been out there trying to spread AIDS around, they'd still be alive 
today."

LOUISIANA PARISH'S SCHOOLS CONSOLIDATED; 
</P>
<P>
INTEGRATION COMES FOUR DECADES LATE

<P>
Change comes slowly down the two-lane highway that winds through forests and 
dairy pastures into Greensburg. 
</P>
<P>
It's taken four decades for desegregation to reach the seat of St. Helena 
Parish. Even now, a visitor looking for John Hall's house behind the Masonic 
lodge is asked: "You talking about the white Masonic hall or the black one?" 
</P>
<P>
"This parish hasn't changed since 1907 . . . . Education has been what kept it 
like it is," said Hall, a construction worker who has spent 37 of his 70 years 
fighting to give black students -- including his 14 children -- a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Hall filed suit in 1952, after he was told that the school district didn't have 
money to furnish a new school that he and other black residents had built to 
replace an inferior facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Integrated Term 
</P>
<P>
Segregation finally has ended because the district couldn't afford to keep 
separate schools going. This semester marks the first time in St. Helena Parish 
that all students, black and white, are taught under the same roof. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan approved in December by U.S. District Judge John Parker in Baton 
Rouge, classes were consolidated into three buildings -- including the one 
built by community blacks in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to take credit for anything," Hall said. "I wanted my children 
to get an education, and that's what they got." 
</P>
<P>
St. Helena Parish has one of Louisiana's poorest school districts. About 95% of 
the parish's annual $6.5-million budget comes from the state. Until Jan. 6, its 
2,040 students, 70% of whom are black, attended seven schools. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question the St. Helena Parish School Board has been operated in 
violation of the U.S. Constitution," Parker said in December. He added that the 
consolidation "means desegregation will be accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seven Schools Combined 
</P>
<P>
The judge said some of the schools "are not fit for a dog house," and Supt. 
Perry P. Spears said all seven were substandard. Spears, who is black and went 
to school here, plans to do away with a fifth school and is working to float a 
$7.5-million bond issue this fall, to pay for improvements to the remaining 
two. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed my elementary and high school career in St. Helena, but at the same 
time, I knew that we were not being supported equally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The point was driven home for Spears when he became superintendent three years 
ago and saw that the whites' schools had equipment such as washing machines and 
dryers for the athletic programs. The blacks' schools did not. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the early 1950s, black students often sat on soft drink cases, boxes 
and logs to hear a teacher who didn't have enough supplies "or even a chair to 
sit down on," Hall said. "These schools were as bad as anything you've ever 
seen. I don't know why they'd send children up here to get an education at a 
place like that. I'd rather put them under a tree." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built Own School 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, he asked the board for a new black school. Officials told him there 
wasn't enough money, but they offered a deal: Build the school yourself and the 
parish will furnish it. The black community pitched in their meager assets and 
their elbow grease to build a new school, but then Hall was told there was no 
money for furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him right then 'I'm going to take my children up there to go to school 
with the white folks,' " he said. "He took him a good laugh. He and his crew 
had a big fun-making deal about it, I understand." 
</P>
<P>
Hall didn't laugh. He, his father, and two other blacks who still want to 
remain anonymous turned to A. P. Tureaud, an attorney for the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
"They said 'you're going to have some mad white folks here,' " Hall said. "I 
said I was already mad." After all, he said, the black residents faced "nothing 
more than talk. All kinds of threats and talk." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Supreme Court ruled against segregated schooling in 1954, Hall's 
suit and scores of other desegregation cases floated in the courts for years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Token' Transfers 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, St. Helena Parish built a modern high school for blacks. A few 
blacks started going to the white Greensburg High and a few whites attended 
classes in the black schools. "It was all token desegregation," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Segregation hurts both black and white students, he said. "You can't hold back 
one race without holding the other back." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, running seven schools used up the parish's allotment of 
state-supported teacher salaries and resulted in duplication of basic classes. 
As a result, few advanced classes were offered and the students suffered. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been able to offer a comprehensive curriculum," Spears said. "I 
feel that was the biggest disadvantage we had over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Under consolidation, elementary school pupils eat lunch in a makeshift 
cafeteria in an old gymnasium, and some classes meet in trailers. Head Start 
pupils still go to the cramped building the black residents built. 
</P>
<P>
Most opposition to the change came from parents, Spears said. "They have caused 
a problem by letting their kids see how much they oppose consolidation. I don't 
think our kids generally oppose consolidation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Reactions 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the students gave consolidation mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going on pretty well now," said Pamecia Foskey, a black senior. "It's all 
coming together. We're thinking of it as one school." 
</P>
<P>
"It'll probably be better next year, but I won't be around to find out," said 
Kelly Smith, a white sophomore who is transferring to a private school in 
Mississippi next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gone better than everybody thought," said DeAnn Fugler, a white sophomore 
who also plans to go to private school. "It's too crowded right now. If the 
facility gets better, I might come back. It's hard to tell." 
</P>
<P>
About 150 students, most of them white, have enrolled in private schools or are 
illegally attending public schools in other parishes, Spears said, but he is 
enthusiastic about the future, especially if the bond issue passes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the community is going to have more pride in its schools. We 
won't have that competition between schools. The competition is because we had 
all-white and all-black schools." 
</P>
<P>
A recent high school basketball game was an example of what Spears hopes will 
become the rule. "It was obvious that these were kids that had never been 
brought together before. The support was like we hadn't had before. It's now 
one-and-one. I feel good about it. It's going to be a family relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who thought his lawsuit would be settled in four or five years, isn't so 
sure of that. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be slow, slow," he said. "The chance for change will have to come with 
the new generation, not with none of the ones who are here now."

CENTER HELPS INDIANS ADJUST TO NEW LIVES IN LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AURELIO ROJAS, United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200 years of painful experiences have engendered a mistrust of 
government agencies among American Indians, who have gravitated to Los Angeles 
more than any other U.S. urban center. 
</P>
<P>
John Castillo is assistant executive director of the Southern California Indian 
Center, a nonprofit organization that serves as a conduit between the nation's 
largest urban Indian population and government social agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Indians won't go to government offices, but they'll come to us," said 
Castillo, whose organization is staffed primarily by Indians. 
</P>
<P>
With a budget of more than $3 million, provided mainly by federal, state and 
local government grants, the organization's 40-member staff provides 
educational counseling, job training and housing assistance to about 10,000 
American Indians and ethnic Alaskans and Hawaiians each year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Poverty and Unemployment 
</P>
<P>
According to the 1980 U.S. Census, about 100,000 American Indians live in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. The Los Angeles County Community Development 
Department estimates that 75% of the Indian population is below the poverty 
level. More than 40% are unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo said more than 300 tribes are represented in the area and predicted 
that the 1990 census will show that the overall population has grown 
substantially as more young Indians have moved from rural areas and 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, this group is not emotionally or economically prepared for 
the rigorous competition of urban residency, organization officials said. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the growing need, the SCIC, which Castillo said was founded in 1968 "by 
a group of people who used a garage for meetings," opened its fifth regional 
office last month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help in Mastering Skills 
</P>
<P>
The North Hollywood office is designed to meet the needs of the 10,000-plus 
American Indians in the San Fernando Valley. The organization's other offices 
are in Carson, Commerce, Garden Grove and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary responsibility is to assist the unemployed and underemployed," 
Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have marketable skills, we develop them. If they don't, we provide 
referrals for classroom training or work experience." 
</P>
<P>
The center also provides a variety of programs for senior citizens, including 
counseling, transportation and arts and crafts activities. Emergency housing 
and food are also made available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Food Disbursed 
</P>
<P>
"We give out about 5,000 tons of food a month, and about 600 food baskets 
during Christmas season," Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
The average age of American Indians is less than 18, Castillo said. The goal of 
his organization, he said, is to "foster an atmosphere in which we can help 
American Indians work toward economic and social self-sufficiency."

SCHOOL HEALTH CLINICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1986, Dr. Thomas Payzant proposed school-based so-called "health clinics," 
and the Board of Education voted against them. He was quoted as saying: "The 
community has spoken. The message is very clear, and that's that." 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, do we have another attempt to push the idea at Hoover High School? 
It's useless to disguise the purpose of such clinics as "health" programs. Why 
not call them by their true name of contraceptive-dispensing and 
abortion-advice centers that promote the agenda of the Planned Parenthood 
organization? 
</P>
<P>
I pay taxes on properties in San Diego, and these taxes help support the public 
schools. I am angry that sex clinics are proposed on school property for 
purposes that I oppose as being immoral. 
</P>
<P>
The schools should be supporting families and churches in helping children 
become responsible and moral, whole persons instead of pushing programs to 
destroy their virtue.

ANIMAL RIGHTS PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to take issue with the commentary on April 30 ("Protest in Wrong 
Place, Wrong Time") by Diane Calkins and Rosemary Shelton regarding the picket 
demonstration held at the San Diego Animal Control Department, of which the 
organization STOP (Stop Taking Our Pets) was a part. I am a board member of 
Friends of County Animal Shelters, a member of Fund for Animals, Animal 
Advocacy and STOP, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
First, I believe both Ms. Calkins and Ms. Shelton were missing the thrust of 
the entire demonstration. STOP was not demonstrating against the volunteers who 
work at the shelters. STOP recognizes and applauds the work done by the 
volunteers in the shelters in their efforts to help the animals. STOP also 
applauds the adoption program at the shelters. 
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the picketing was against the use of pets for animal research, 
and both Calkins and Shelton agreed that they "adamantly opposed any shelter 
animal being used or abused by researchers." As with all demonstrations, a 
focal point has to be used to bring attention to the public that this abhorrent 
use of pets for research goes on, and that these pets are obtained from our 
very own shelters. Shelters that we, the taxpayers, support. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the Department of Animal Control is an unfortunate pawn in this 
travesty of animal lives, being caught in the middle of a very grave situation, 
that of being part of a program dictated by the San Diego County Board of 
Supervisors. However, other county shelters throughout the state of California 
have been influential in helping break such contracts by taking stands against 
the use of pets for research. Some staff and heads of departments have put 
their jobs on the line and just said "NO!" to such atrocities. In fact, San 
Diego County is one of the last four counties in the whole state that partake 
in such programs. 
</P>
<P>
It is my hope that the public will do a massive letter campaign to the Board of 
Supervisors to end the use of our lost and abandoned pets for such atrocities. 
I also believe that such persons as Ms. Calkins and Ms. Shelton, although their 
hearts seem to be in the right place, should work to end such a practice and 
applaud the efforts of organizations such as STOP. Animal welfare groups 
attacking animal welfare groups is a total misplacement of energy that could be 
used in saving more animal lives.

SCHOOL HEALTH CLINICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego city schools Board of Education is again taking what should be 
valuable planning time to consider whether or not to implement proposed health 
clinics on public school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Our schools are already teaching sex education and AIDS awareness. They would 
do well to now concentrate on developing and implementing better basic 
educational programs for our children and grandchildren, who to date are being 
taught at a level that is already leading us -- inevitably -- to becoming a 
second-class nation in tomorrow's world. 
</P>
<P>
Our school boards would do well to stay out of moral issues, particularly when 
they are bound so greatly in religious tenets and are considered by a majority 
of us to be a primary parental responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
We want -- we need -- concentration on truly educational courses, better school 
facilities and better teachers receiving substantially better pay, commensurate 
with what should be a professional and honorable career.

MISPLACED HOPE OF SEDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the April 30 edition of The Times, there is a rather lengthy commentary 
titled "Seder Becomes a Meal of Hope." I have had the opportunity to celebrate 
Passover with my Jewish friends at the Seder, most recently at the San Diego 
Community Seder. They have truly been meals of hope and freedom. However, the 
tone of your article disturbs me a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
The impression I was left with after reading the article was that the hope 
provided by the Seder was the conversion of Christians to Judaism, almost 
gleefully recorded. One of the most sensitive issues facing Jewish-Christian 
relations is the whole problem of conversions. In my work with Jewish and 
Christian -- specifically Catholic -- couples contemplating marriage, I 
emphasize that the Jewish partner must, in no way, give up his or her Judaism 
in order to marry a non-Jew. In fact, both are encouraged to support the other 
in his or her religious belief. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, equal sensitivity is seldom reciprocated. At the recent National 
Workshop for Christian-Jewish Relations in Charleston, S. C., one of the most 
troubling issues was the seminar presented on intermarriage. It boiled down to 
the fact that, in order for a Jew to marry a Christian, the Christian must 
concede to raise the children Jewish or no marriage could take place. 
Furthermore, having clergy from both traditions present was discouraged and 
conversion to Judaism of the Christian was preferred. I have run across similar 
mentalities in San Diego. This article in The Times reinforces this 
observation. 
</P>
<P>
If Jewish-Christian dialogue is ever to succeed, we must mutually agree to play 
by the rules. Both Jews and Christians must learn to work together, accept each 
other's differences, not to try to coerce conversion of the other and respect 
each other's heritage, tradition and rights. This is the way each of our faith 
communities can find hope; not by gloating over conversions in the newspaper.

HEALTH CLINIC RHETORIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Tuesday, the San Diego city school board will face a tough decision: whether 
to give conceptual approval for a health clinic to serve 8,000 students at 
several East San Diego schools. 
</P>
<P>
The decision will not be tough for the usual financial reasons. The clinic's 
operating costs would come primarily from private foundations. The school 
district's contribution would mostly be in administrative services and donated 
space. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the decision tough is the opposition of a vocal minority, led by the 
Catholic bishop, who, in a pastoral letter called the health centers "sex 
clinics" in disguise that will promote free sex, contraception, masturbation 
and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Such rhetoric is absurd. First of all, the clinic will not provide abortion 
referrals or information. Second, if it provides birth-control information and 
devices -- and it should -- that is not synonymous with promoting sexual 
activity. It only recognizes that many teen-agers are sexually active whether 
or not their parents want them to be. 
</P>
<P>
Third, all services will require parental permission. The notion that state law 
would overrule that requirement has not proven true at clinics elsewhere in 
California, and school district officials say opponents are misinterpreting the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
What school board members need to keep uppermost in their minds is that the 
medical and mental-health services the clinic would provide are sorely needed. 
The religious beliefs of a minority should not be able to deny those services 
to the majority who support them.

MOURNING A LOVED ONE, AND THE LOVED ONES LEFT TO STRUGGLE ALONE

I stared up at the billboard, my eyes frozen on the words, my heart numb. 
</P>
<P>
High above Santa Monica Boulevard, the numbers screamed: 281,859 dead because 
of lung cancer in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The date was Nov. 11, and, less than 2 miles away, my mother was in a Century 
City hospital. She had just been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Every day the numbers would creep up on that billboard. As I drove by, I 
wondered at what point in the tally my mom would become just another number. 
</P>
<P>
Would she make it to Thanksgiving? Hanukkah? Christmas? New Year's? Mother's 
Day? 
</P>
<P>
She died Jan. 9. The billboard had been zeroed out, its annual count begun 
anew. 
</P>
<P>
Now there's Mother's Day, but no mother. 
</P>
<P>
Darlene was her name. I don't want to make this a maudlin tale of how I miss 
her, although I do miss her. Terribly. 
</P>
<P>
But, after four months, I'm pretty much resigned that she's gone. And the urge 
to call her every time I want to chat is subsiding, much to my chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
But there still isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of her a dozen 
times. And as Mother's Day approached, my anxiety grew. 
</P>
<P>
My family is going to gather this morning, and there will be plenty of mothers 
in our clan to celebrate. But my best friend, my big booster, the woman who 
turned my second-place finishes into world championships -- she won't be there. 
</P>
<P>
Those thoughts swirling in my head -- and my heart -- the past few weeks were 
not sparked only by Mother's Day, however. I spent much of April with senior 
citizens, mostly in nursing homes and board-and-care facilities, working on a 
weeklong series for KNSD-TV about life in nursing homes and cases of abuse and 
neglect of the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The research took me into a world where I was confronted with the vision of 
what my mother might have become. 
</P>
<P>
Her death had come quickly, although at the time, as I watched this beautiful 
61-year-old woman being consumed by an aggressive cancer, the two months 
between her diagnosis and demise seemed an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
We hoped that she would stabilize. But that meant tackling the question of how 
to care for her. 
</P>
<P>
Do we hire a nurse? Should she be in a nursing home? Wouldn't she be happier in 
her own home, surrounded by things familiar? 
</P>
<P>
We never had to answer those questions. She died, at home, in her own bed. 
</P>
<P>
But as I wandered the halls of the nursing homes last month, as I walked past 
the closet-like rooms with two single beds jammed in, as I watched seniors 
wheeled to their tables in crowded dining halls, I thought of my mother. And I 
thought about visiting her in a place like that -- not as a reporter, detached 
and taking notes, but as her son. 
</P>
<P>
It was a jarring, gut-wrenching experience. Because, much as I didn't like to 
admit it, my honest response was that I was glad she had died if this were the 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
What a horrible reaction! Here I was surrounded by seniors -- some in terrible 
physical condition -- who were struggling just to survive, sometimes barely 
holding on. 
</P>
<P>
How could I favor death when so many were fighting so hard to stay alive? 
</P>
<P>
I hated myself for thinking it, and yet it was what I felt. 
</P>
<P>
I thought about what the mothers in the nursing homes would be doing today. 
More than any other complaint, the seniors we talked to yearned for visitors, 
especially their children. Sometimes the patients would talk about how their 
kids were due to show up anytime. But the truth was, it had been some time 
since their children had seen them. 
</P>
<P>
My anger rose. 
</P>
<P>
But how could I be grateful that my mother had avoided institutional life, and 
yet also be angry at the children whose parents weren't as lucky? 
</P>
<P>
I had no answers at the time. I still don't. I don't think I ever will. 
</P>
<P>
"People are so busy with their own thing, whatever that may be," Wylie Haywood 
had told me. Wylie had lived in a nursing home for five months, after he was 
run over by a car while he was crossing a street. He suffered two broken legs 
and a skull fracture, but gained an insight into a life he hopes to soon leave. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have time for the old folks," he said of his fellow residents' 
children. "That's regrettable, very regrettable." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I am glad my mother isn't living in some nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
But I wish she were alive so I could visit her there.

REFLECTIONS: 'I'M WHAT'S CALLED AN ECOIST, A PERSON WHO BELIEVES IN WORKING FOR 
THE SURVIVAL OF ALL SPECIES, NOT JUST THE HUMAN SPECIES.'

Retired financier Norman Roberts, 68, once occupied a seat on the New York 
Stock Exchange and founded his own brokerage. In San Diego, he has been a local 
Republican Party mover and shaker since 1963 -- working on campaigns, going to 
the Republican National Convention three times as a delegate and serving as the 
San Diego County chairman for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign. But 
the license plate on the Jaguar XJS parked outside Roberts' La Jolla home tells 
of his true avocation: "NATRLST." Times staff writer Leslie Wolf interviewed 
Roberts and Kenneth Lam photographed him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I was born in San Diego and graduated from Hoover High School. My grandparents 
on both sides of the family came to San Diego at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
I think I was 7 when I took my first trip down to Baja California. It was 
pretty primitive then. I have been going down there ever since. 
</P>
<P>
I enjoyed Baja so much that I decided to write a natural history of the 
peninsula. I wrote about the reptiles first, and then I did the mammals, and 
then the birds. But those manuscripts are not published because nobody wants to 
buy them. Then, I decided I'd go with the plants. I have a degree in veterinary 
medicine, so I had learned something about plant physiology and poisonous 
plants in college. 
</P>
<P>
My book, "A Field Guide to the Common and Interesting Plants of Baja 
California" was first published in 1975. It turned out to sell pretty well, I 
sold 10,000. I'm doing the final work now on an updated version, which should 
be out in June or July. It will have a different cover and will be almost twice 
as large, with 336 pages and 315 color photos. 
</P>
<P>
I spend a lot of my time with the plants when I'm down in Baja, but I run into 
a lot of people as well. I've met the mountain people, who are very reclusive 
but very friendly. Most of them are descended from the families of soldiers who 
came with the missionaries in the 1700s. 
</P>
<P>
They use the agave a lot, which we call the century plant. The agave has a 
stalk, which it puts up once every 25 to 30 years. They cut down the stalks and 
roast them for a couple of days until it's tender enough to eat. They also dig 
out the center of the agave and eat the leaves off. 
</P>
<P>
They eat the barrel cactus, too, by breaking off the spines and scooping out 
the insides with a machete. The inside is very fibrous but has a lot of water 
in it. Sometimes it's pretty sweet. The exciting one to eat is the pitaya 
cactus. The fruit is about golf-ball size, and it's red and it's delicious. You 
can make great daiquiris with it. 
</P>
<P>
California is getting very crowded, so Baja is a perfect place to get away to. 
Besides the beaches, there are wonderful places to camp in the deserts and 
mountains. It's a wonderful outlet for Californians and others who want to take 
a primitive vacation and enjoy nature as it is rather than nature as it has 
been tampered with by humans. There's just so much that people don't realize is 
there . . . but sooner or later they will. 
</P>
<P>
When I wrote the first book on plants, I estimated there were 10,000 people who 
went to Baja consistently. Now there are about 50,000, and that estimate may be 
conservative. Ultimately, Baja California will be ruined by people. 
</P>
<P>
What's happening right now in Cabo San Lucas is they don't have any water, and 
as a result they're having salt water infiltration in the fresh water. They're 
continuing to build new condos on the cape, and the runoff from the mountains 
is nowhere near enough to help them. Their only hope for getting water is 
saline conversion, and that's very expensive. Until that happens, they're 
heading for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
I'm what's called an ecoist, a person who believes in working for the survival 
of all species, not just the human species. I believe other species in the 
world should live, because, when they die, we die.

JAPANESE FIRM BUYS 20 ACRES IN TORRANCE FOR BUSINESS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Japan's largest construction companies has purchased a 20-acre site in 
an industrial area of Torrance, the latest in a wave of Japanese investment 
there that has totaled hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu Land Corp. bought the Reynolds Metals Co. property east of Crenshaw 
Boulevard and north of Dominguez Street for about $14 million in a transaction 
completed May 5. 
</P>
<P>
The company, a subsidiary of multibillion-dollar Shimizu Construction Co. of 
Tokyo, announced plans for a $40-million business park but has not decided 
whether to move its U.S. headquarters to the South Bay's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strategic Location 
</P>
<P>
Torrance, strategically located between Los Angeles International Airport and 
the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, has become the U.S. headquarters for 
major Japanese companies including Toyota, Honda and Epson America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu, based in downtown Los Angeles, plans to build 400,000 square feet of 
offices on the vacant land, where maintenance yards for the old Pacific 
Electric Co. streetcar system once stood. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Shimizu project, a group of Japanese investors and an 
American partner are planning to build a six- to eight-story, 200- to 300-room 
hotel in the Torrance Center project, part of Torrance's east-side 
redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel project on Western Avenue at 213th Street will involve an investment 
of about $30 million, said Allan Mackenzie, partner in Gascon-Mar Ltd., a San 
Diego-based development company. 
</P>
<P>
To the north, American Honda Motor Co. has begun work on a five-story adminis 
tration building, the centerpiece of a $225-million U.S. headquarters complex. 
</P>
<P>
Honda plans to build 1.2 million square feet of offices, including the 
administration building, a computer center, service building, warehouses, 
research and development complex, and regional center, said Torrance planner 
Mike Bihn. 
</P>
<P>
The Honda project is being built on 101 acres, including 26 acres purchased 
from the Torrance Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Symbolic of the change in the South Bay economy, the Japanese auto maker's 
American headquarters is rising on the site of a former U.S. Steel plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$150 Million Toyota Investment 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, on Western Avenue at 190th Street, is the U.S. headquarters for 
Toyota Motor Corp. The Toyota complex, which houses the sales, service and 
distribution arm of the Japanese auto maker, consists of five buildings on 41 
acres. The project represented an investment of $150 million when construction 
began in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Torrance, the steel skeleton for the U.S. headquarters of Epson is 
rising on 10 acres immediately north of the Torrance Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which Epson executives estimated two years ago would cost $30 
million, involves construction of four low-rise buildings at Madrona Avenue and 
Civic Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Epson, which manufactures personal computers and computer printers, is building 
the complex in partnership with Shimizu. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Councilman George Nakano said Torrance's location is an important 
factor in the decision of Japanese companies to locate their headquarters in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Toyota and Honda have moved in and gotten a foothold (in Torrance) and word 
has gotten back to Japan that this is a very desirable place," Nakano said. "It 
seems like it kind of snowballs." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Applegate, who owns a commercial real estate company, said 
Torrance is well-known in Japan and the Far East. "Torrance is viewed by the 
Pacific Rim companies and investors as a very safe, a very clean, and a very 
accepted place to conduct your business," Applegate said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the presence of good housing for employees and executive homes on the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula, along with Japanese schools, stores and restaurants, 
have helped make Torrance a comfortable place for Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
But the Shimizu project caught city officials off guard. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Planning Director David Ferren said city planners were shown only a 
very sketchy plan for the office project last week. A formal application for 
approval of the office complex has not been submitted. 
</P>
<P>
Paul D. Bonevac, general manager of Reynolds Metals Co. property development 
group in Richmond, Va., said the land was sold because it was surplus property. 
</P>
<P>
The sale will not affect operation of the Reynolds Metals' aluminum can 
production plant in Torrance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Environmentally Clean Site 
</P>
<P>
Before the transaction was completed, some soil on the property was removed to 
an approved landfill because it was contaminated with toxic materials. "The 
site was environmentally clean when we sold it," Bonevac said. 
</P>
<P>
Toxic pollution has affected some other Torrance projects on old industrial 
properties, including Honda's development on the former U.S. Steel site. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance planner Bihn said Honda will install vapor barriers to prevent 
underground methane gas fumes from entering Honda's buildings. A special vapor 
extraction system will be constructed to remove solvent vapors from soil on 
part of the sprawling property. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts have not begun to remove gasoline that has polluted ground water 
beneath the Honda property. State water quality officials believe the fuel 
leaked from storage tanks at the nearby Mobil Oil Corp. refinery.

OPPONENT ATTACKS KORENSTEIN'S SALVO AT PORTER RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles school board candidate said Saturday that incumbent Julie 
Korenstein's attack on the proposed $2-billion Porter Ranch development is "a 
campaign publicity ploy" designed to mask "an overenrollment crisis" that 
Korenstein has failed to solve. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald E. Horowitz did not endorse the Porter Ranch plan, which calls for 3,000 
residences and 7.5 million square feet of commercial development in the hills 
above Chatsworth. But he called Korenstein's attack "curious" since the 
developer has set aside five acres for construction of a school and will pay 
the Los Angeles Unified School District millions of dollars in state-mandated 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference at Castlebay Lane School in Northridge, Horowitz accused 
Korenstein and fellow Board of Education members of allowing busing of pupils 
under the Capacity Adjustment Program to create "educational havoc" in west San 
Fernando Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz, principal of Byrd Junior High School in Sun Valley and Korenstein's 
opponent in the June 6 runoff election, said students from overcrowded schools 
are being bused under the program to 61 West Valley schools, where frequent new 
arrivals disrupt classes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet four other West Valley schools have been "capped" by crowding, forcing new 
enrollees in those neighborhoods to attend more distant schools, he said. "I 
don't want to see all the West Valley schools being 'capped out' to other 
schools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you bus a youngster, you're disrupting the educational process and 
family life," Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz noted that 16 Valley schools remain closed despite the overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"What we don't have is a board member who has the sense and the ability to get 
those schools open, cut the CAP program and put temporary classrooms on the 
campuses where they are most needed," Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
But Korenstein accused Horowitz of getting "his facts wrong, per usual." She 
said overcrowded schools already have temporary classrooms and bus pupils to 
less crowded schools when space for more temporary classrooms is exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School to Reopen 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein said Parthenia School is to be reopened next fall through her 
efforts. "Yes, we have overcrowding and, yes, we must reopen closed schools, 
and my being on the Board of Education has made it possible for the very first 
San Fernando Valley school that's been closed to be reopened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein said she opposes the Porter Ranch project not only because of the 
impact it would have on schools but because of the effect it would have on air 
quality and traffic. "It's going to be a small Century City," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Accusing Korenstein of failing to back district administrators in Monday's 
scheduled teachers' strike, Horowitz said she is "bought and paid for" by the 
teachers union. She "represents the union and not the kids of our community," 
and has "no conscience about damaging their future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein maintained that she has put students first. "I am encouraging a 
solid, competitive salary for teachers" to provide "the best teachers for our 
children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein led five challengers in the April 11 election for the West Valley 
seat on the board but fell 57 votes short of the 50% plus one vote needed to 
avoid a runoff. Horowitz qualified for the runoff by finishing second with 22% 
of the vote.

TV ANCHOR SETS STING FOR COLORFUL PROMOTER IN PORNOGRAPHY TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an industry that uses cardboard scenery and camera angles to turn diminutive 
actors into legendary tough guys, Gil Cabot may be the ultimate illusionist. 
</P>
<P>
For two decades, the colorful promoter has used a variety of entertainment 
industry gimmicks to snare clients. But police and others say Cabot, once 
depicted in a flashy brochure as "Supermanager" in tights and a cape, is really 
a sophisticated con man. 
</P>
<P>
"All he has ever done is preyed upon people for his own good," said San 
Fernando Superior Court Judge Robert D. Fratianne, who sent Cabot to prison in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the man described in one investigator's report as "an Artful 
Dodger" has himself been flimflammed by a 28-year-old newswoman from Moline, 
Ill. Jann Carl turned the tables last year when Cabot allegedly offered to 
arrange for the destruction of sexually explicit pictures of her for $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Confident that no pictures existed, the KTLA-TV anchorwoman pretended to be 
frightened of exposure in a series of taped telephone conversations with Cabot 
that led to his arrest June 20 on charges of attempted extortion and 
conspiracy. He is free on bail while awaiting trial in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Carl played her part so well that Cabot's attorney, Rowan K. Klein, said his 
client was entrapped by the slender, blonde newswoman. "She sniffed. She cried 
on the phone," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Mr. Cabot underestimated me," Carl said. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy like me can't win," said the 43-year-old, mustachioed promoter. "It's OK 
for the FBI to lie and manipulate" by having an agent pose as Carl's fiance 
during the alleged extortion drama. "But when I lie and manipulate, it's 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his anger toward Carl, Cabot said he registered a script last year with 
the Writers Guild called "Film at 11," about a distressed anchorwoman named 
Fran. 
</P>
<P>
His involvement with Carl is the latest episode in a career that led from the 
recording industry in Tampa, Fla., to Sunset Boulevard. There, police said, 
Cabot preyed upon celebrities -- he posed as KABC-TV anchorwoman Tawny Little's 
husband and used actress Jaclyn Smith's name to obtain appliances and a car. 
</P>
<P>
However, research into his past shows that he is not just a Hollywood predator. 
He has worked, with no success, at selling real-life stories to television. And 
an actress on a once well-known television situation comedy, who requested 
anonymity, said he "did as many good things as bad things" for her. 
</P>
<P>
His downfall, according to some people who knew him over the years, was his 
desire to be more than another businessman selling small film projects around 
Hollywood. These people say he wanted to be a star himself. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Cabot's former clients say they were lured by glossy promotions, one of 
which depicted Cabot as the "Supermanager." Trade publications reported him 
winging from coast to coast, signing film deals. Only later, say his critics, 
did they come to believe that Cabot was more duper than super. 
</P>
<P>
"We project what we know can be," Cabot said. 
</P>
<P>
True to that code, Cabot's version of his life unfolds like a film script of a 
hard-driving, bankable executive with projects swirling on several continents 
at once. 
</P>
<P>
He greets a visitor to his Topanga Canyon home dressed in a white robe. He has 
thick hair with streaks of gray and seems almost frail, despite his 6-foot 
height. His manner is urgent and intense. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls his beginnings at 15 as host of a Tampa television dance show called 
"Gil Cabot's Campus Corner." Then, he says, came a career as the producer of 
million-selling records. Now the man who billed himself as a "star behind a 
star" says he is looking for projects for East German figure skater Katarina 
Witt, who he maintains wants to do movies with American muscle men such as 
Sylvester Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
But Cabot's claims often collapse when the curtain is pulled back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Acquainted, Friend Says 
</P>
<P>
Jirina Ribbens, a friend of Witt's in New York, said that when she asked Witt 
about Cabot, "she didn't even know who I was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Telephone inquiries to libraries, newspapers and television stations in Tampa 
failed to turn up any evidence of a television dance show featuring Cabot. 
</P>
<P>
Even the successful apparently are not immune to his charms. Anchorwoman Little 
said he tried to talk her into letting him represent her. "He's a heck of an 
actor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
He was later arrested when he posed as Little's husband to buy $800 worth of 
suits at Bullock's, police said. The charge became part of the 1982 grand theft 
case against Cabot, police said. He was placed on probation but violated it, 
resulting in a two-year prison sentence at the California Correctional 
Institution in Tehachapi, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Cabot later used Jaclyn Smith's name without permission to coax appliances out 
of Whirlpool Corp. and a car out of Chrysler Corp. for a charity ranch, police 
say. The charity is called CHARM. Cabot said his goal is to set up a retreat 
for victims of child abuse. So far, however, there is no land for the ranch, 
and police say Cabot's mother is driving the Chrysler. Authorities are expected 
to launch an investigation of CHARM. 
</P>
<P>
Cabot denies using Smith's name in a promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best con artist I have ever personally seen at work," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Phil Rabichow, who prosecuted Cabot in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Police say his techniques are legendary. A client who pressed for an 
explanation of nearly $8,000 in expenditures of his money received a telegram 
from a Cabot associate saying that Cabot had been in a plane crash "while 
supervising the filming of opening sequences for his new ABC television 
series," according to a source close to the investigation of the Carl case. 
Cabot was the only survivor and was in the hospital, the telegram said. "I 
trust you will continue to exercise patience and understanding," the note 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say there is no evidence of such a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pop Record Produced 
</P>
<P>
But there is substance to some of Cabot's contentions. For instance, he was 
involved in the distribution of a pop music record called "Love (Can Make You 
Happy)," by a group called Mercy in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Sigler, the one-time Tampa high school student who wrote the song, said 
the record was put out on Cabot's tiny Sundi label but that Cabot did not 
produce it, as he claimed. Further, he said, Cabot later formed a band with his 
wife and called it Mercy, sparking a 3-year-long lawsuit over rights to the 
name. 
</P>
<P>
But what confounds some of his critics is that he has been able to deliver on 
other occasions. An author who was trying to market an AIDS book was impressed 
with Cabot's ability to place him on a morning talk show in Los Angeles, even 
before the book was in stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Gil Cabot has never given me a reason to doubt him," said Jenny Sherman, 
Cabot's partner in a company that markets television movies of the week. So 
far, none has been produced. 
</P>
<P>
Cabot said he makes ends meet by living off the royalties of his recordings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planned Talk Show 
</P>
<P>
Cabot wanted to use Carl as host for an interview show to be called "Up Close 
and Personal," for which he said he had lined up Whirlpool as a sponsor (which 
Whirlpool denies). But he said he was shown a videotape that was making the 
rounds of bachelor parties in Los Angeles. The star performer appeared to be 
Jann Carl, fresh out of a hot tub, cavorting in front of hidden cameras, Cabot 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the jaw and I saw the mole," he recalled. "I hit my machine with my fist 
and threw" the videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Cabot was angry, he said, because he knew his project was doomed. Nobody would 
want an interviewer who had starred in a stag film, even unknowingly. 
</P>
<P>
He said he discussed with Carl ways to get rid of the tape and of pictures that 
were taken from it for publication in a magazine, only as a favor to a 
distressed woman. 
</P>
<P>
Carl, however, was not thankful. "This is the first time in my life someone has 
committed such a severe wrong against me personally. It's my nature to stand 
firm." 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of a farm-equipment executive, Carl decided on journalism as a 
career at Moline Senior High School. But when she went for advice to the 
University of Missouri, a teacher discouraged her. 
</P>
<P>
"That made me so mad that I knew that was what I wanted to do," she said. "I 
was determined at that point." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Iron Will 
</P>
<P>
According to friends, that attitude is typical of a woman who presents a 
deceptively innocent face to the world. She excuses herself when she says 
"damn," chooses restaurants for their onion rings, and counts as her favorite 
actors Katharine Hepburn and James Stewart. Behind all this, these people say, 
is an iron will. 
</P>
<P>
At age 23, she became a street reporter for WLS-TV in Chicago, one of the 
nation's most competitive news towns. A year later, she was wooed away by 
KABC-TV in Los Angeles, where she went to work on "Eye on L.A.," the fast-paced 
"infotainment" show that specializes in stories about haunted houses and 
bikini-clad bathers. 
</P>
<P>
"We joked that we would eventually do haunted bikinis," Carl said. 
</P>
<P>
She took the anchor chair next to Hal Fishman at KTLA two years later. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, a man calling himself Terry called her news director, Jeff 
Wald, about the sexually explicit video. Over the next few weeks, there was a 
series of calls that led from Terry to a man identified as Christopher Wright 
to Gil Cabot. When tapes of all three were played in court, witnesses said they 
sounded alike. 
</P>
<P>
Carl said she never considered quietly paying off, just to ensure her privacy 
and safeguard her career from scandal. She never thought about telling the 
caller to lay off. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he would go on to someone else," Carl said. "The next woman may not 
have a supportive boss, and she might pay it. It would be my fault." 
</P>
<P>
She decided to feign fear of exposure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Need Your Help' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm frightened," she said in one tape-recorded conversation. "Gil, I really 
need your help." 
</P>
<P>
The plot was complex and carefully woven, police said. Cabot's undoing, 
according to authorities, was his choice of a victim. He assumed "anyone in the 
business would have a Rolodex of partners," said one officer. 
</P>
<P>
But Carl said she was confident that no tapes could exist. She had been 
involved in one relationship for the past seven years, to television sales 
representative David Sears, whom she recently married. 
</P>
<P>
Cabot and his attorney, Maurice J. Attie, were arrested after a meeting June 10 
with Carl and an undercover FBI agent. The payment from Carl was discussed 
during that session, according to a tape played at Cabot's preliminary hearing 
two weeks ago. Charges against Attie were dismissed after Los Angeles Municipal 
Judge Karl W. Jaeger concluded that there was not enough evidence that Attie 
knew what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
Rowan K. Klein, Cabot's attorney during the hearing, maintained that Carl 
entrapped Cabot. "Supposedly nothing my client said was true," he said. "Yet 
Miss Carl took it upon herself to call him and plead to get these pictures 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Carl was never in fear, he said. "That's one of the reasons there is no crime 
in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, even his critics praise Cabot as a dynamic man with a pot always 
boiling with ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"He was bright and intuitive in ad campaigns," said Dick Hieronymus, a record 
producer who worked with Cabot. "Had he stuck to promotion and been honest," he 
would have been a success. 
</P>
<P>
"The real problem is he wanted to be a superstar." 
</P>
<P>
OTHER TARGETS 
</P>
<P>
TAWNEY LITTLE: Cabot wanted her to work with him. "He's a heck of an actor," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
JACLYN SMITH: Used her name without permission to coax companies to donate 
appliances and a car to his charity. 
</P>
<P>
KATARINA WITT: Says he represents her in the United States. A friend said she 
doesn't know him.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: GRUNT MOVES ON TO A BETTER LIFE: A STY OF HIS OWN AND 
THREE OTHER PIGS TO PLAY WITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gerald Faris 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grunt, the homeless, 1,000-pound porker whose new-digs-or-death dilemma made 
him a celebrity, took off for a pig sty of his very own early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling in a spacious, 16-foot trailer that normally holds four horses, Grunt 
left the Los Angeles County Animal Control Shelter in Carson bound for a 
193-acre ranch in Ojai, where there are three other pigs for him to play with. 
</P>
<P>
"Grunt has a two-acre fenced area by the pond reserved for him," said Jerye 
Mooney, Los Angeles coordinator of the national Fund for Animals. The animal 
rights group got ranch owner Ozzy Osborn -- a plumbing contractor, not the rock 
star -- to adopt Grunt. 
</P>
<P>
The Carson shelter took Grunt in nearly a month ago after Dee Keese was no 
longer able to keep him on her one-acre Palos Verdes Peninsula ranch. She has 
goats, horses, opossums and llamas, but zoning laws forbid swine, and neighbors 
complained. Earlier, Grunt was rescued from slaughter after being given away by 
the Rolling Hills Estates family that raised him from the time he was a piglet. 
The family moved and couldn't take him. 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officials said Grunt faced death unless adopted by someone, and 
that's when Fund for Animals came to the rescue. Mooney said the first choice 
was to give Grunt to the Los Angeles County Fair as a mascot, but her group 
settled on the Osborn ranch, where the living will be much more genteel. 
</P>
<P>
"Osborn will build him a special shelter and Mrs. Osborn's hairdresser has 
offered grooming services," Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
Grunt was taken to Ojai by Sunland animal handler Diana Smith, who owns the 
lovable pig featured in the movie "The Milagro Beanfield Wars." Although 
shelter officials held up boards along the ramp to the trailer lest Grunt put 
up a fuss, he trotted quickly inside. Smith lured him with his favorite foods: 
strawberries and corn on the cob. 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officer Lt. George Warfield said Grunt, who was penned near 
other barnyard animals, was a perfect guest. "He was real gentle and we had no 
problems," he said. And Grunt's celebrity boosted the adoption rate for the 
shelter's homeless dogs and cats. 
</P>
<P>
Said Warfield, "People would come in to see Grunt and walk out with other 
animals." Gerald Faris

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACETONE FLASH FIRE HOSPITALIZES 2 MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were seriously burned Saturday morning in a flash fire at a Sun Valley 
company. Lee Reese, 46, and Enrique Perez, 39, were taken to Pacifica Community 
Hospital and later sent to Sherman Oaks Community Hospital after suffering 
second- and third-degree burns over 70% of their bodies, a Fire Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The men were transferring acetone from one container to another when the 
chemical's vapors flashed. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters are not sure what caused the flash fire, which caused little 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
The sprinklers at the company, Advanced Packaging Techniques, extinguished the 
fire.

POINT / COUNTERPOINT: SHOULD THE NANCY REAGAN CENTER FOR DRUG-ABUSE TREATMENT 
BE ALLOWED TO LOCATE IN LAKE VIEW TERRACE?; 
</P>
<P>
AGAINST; 
</P>
<P>
FRED TAYLOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Phoenix House, a nonprofit drug-treatment organization, wants to establish the 
210-bed Nancy Reagan Center for drug rehabilitation on the site of the defunct 
Lake View Medical Center. Los Angeles zoning officials have approved the 
project but want several security measures added. Homeowner groups in the 
northeast San Fernando Valley vow to keep fighting the project. Both sides are 
appealing to the Los Angeles Board of Zoning Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Taylor, 50, is a political consultant, an appointed member of the Los 
Angeles County Children's Services Commission and owner of a business on a 
block once considered Pacoima's busiest spot for drug dealing. He has worked 
closely with police to fight drugs and argues that a treatment center would 
hurt Lake View Terrace and nearby communities. Taylor lives in Panorama City 
with his wife, Janet. They have two children and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You once said that if Phoenix House were allowed into Lake View Terrace, it 
would be the straw that would break this community's back. What did you mean by 
that? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The whole problem is that this community has been kicked so many times, 
it's emotionally worn down. Phoenix House is the last nail in the coffin, 
because of who they represent. You're talking about Nancy Reagan, Merv Griffin; 
you're talking about Mr. T. 
</P>
<P>
These people really don't know what's going on in this community. They should 
come and find out what we're trying to do here. We're trying to turn this 
community around. We're trying to get a library and we're trying to get a bank. 
These are basic building blocks of a community, and we don't have these things. 
</P>
<P>
If the bank finds out that Phoenix House is going to be here, it's going to 
hurt our situation drastically. Already, because of the threat of Phoenix House 
coming in here, a lot of people have moved out of that area. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are some of the other issues faced by the community? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We have the Lopez Canyon Landfill situation. There's no water in Hansen 
Dam, whereas monies have been allocated to put a new dam at Sepulveda. We have 
a dam. All we need is to have the water put back in it. 
</P>
<P>
We have an inordinate number of halfway houses wreaking havoc up here. They're 
everywhere in Lake View Terrace, in Pacoima, in Hansen Hills, and a lot of 
things happen. A lot of burglaries started occurring. Cars getting ripped off. 
Drunkenness, urination in the street, the whole bit. 
</P>
<P>
What we really have is a community under siege. And this is not a community 
that is turning its back on its problems. We are actively involved. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Have you made progress in these other battles? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Great progress. We had three liquor stores causing us a lot of problems. 
They were catering to the drug dealers and the drug users. They became 
hangouts. By noon, right where we're sitting, there would be 50 to 60 drug 
dealers here four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This community took the liquor stores to the zoning administrator to get them 
to comply with the needs and wishes of the community. I told them at the 
hearing: 'You don't cater to the wino types. You don't sell alcohol to minors. 
You don't create a situation where people are hanging around loitering.' If you 
get control of the alcohol situation, you get control of the drug thing. 
</P>
<P>
And now alcohol-related crime is down because some of the liquor stores have 
gotten the word that we mean business. Two of the three liquor stores have 
already agreed to start closing their doors at 10 o'clock at night. That's what 
we want for the entire northeast Valley. If that happens, the police commander 
for the area can allocate his men to more serious situations, as opposed to 
busting drunks and minors buying alcohol and that kind of thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How would Phoenix House set your efforts back? 
</P>
<P>
A. Phoenix House is going to be dealing with people who are on rock cocaine. 
And when you get the urge to get some rock cocaine, you're going to go get it. 
And you only have to walk two blocks from that hospital to find a rock house. 
There's half a dozen rock houses in and around that hospital. 
</P>
<P>
And it affects all of us. We're less than 10 minutes away from that hospital 
here on Glenoaks Boulevard. A year ago, right at the corner of Pierce and 
Glenoaks, in the Pierce apartments, that was the worst drug-trafficking center 
in this area. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Phoenix House supporters argue that the drug problem here creates a need for 
the program in this area. How do you respond to that? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The bottom line is that none of the people from this community are going to 
end up at Phoenix House. They would come from all over the county, and there's 
only going to be 200 beds. 
</P>
<P>
I would have problems if someone from this community was placed up there, 
anyway. Because the individuals selling the cocaine would know they were up 
there, and they're going to make every attempt to sell them more cocaine. And 
there aren't locks and keys and there aren't guards up there. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does the zoning administrator's ruling that Phoenix House must install a 
seven-foot fence, video-camera surveillance and hire 24-hour guards ease your 
mind at all? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No. I still wouldn't approve of it. The thing is that if you climb over the 
fence from that location, you're in somebody's back yard. You're 100 yards from 
a convalescent home. You're a block away from an elementary school. You're two 
blocks away from a senior citizens apartment complex. None of Phoenix House's 
other locations is in a residential area of that nature. None of them. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Drug-treatment facilities are needed and have to be located in someone's 
neighborhood, so why not this one? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We're not saying put this in some other residential area. We had real 
estate brokers bring in additional properties where Phoenix House could locate 
where they would be away from people. There were a dozen locations in the 
county, and they turned every location down. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What has been the effect of the Phoenix House proposal on the community? 
</P>
<P>
 A. They've caused people who were friends and next-door neighbors to not even 
talk to each other. That is what bothers me. We need all our efforts and 
resources to fight the things that we have to fight in the community. Not to be 
fighting Phoenix House. 
</P>
<P>
We're all trying to coexist and make it here. For once, we were getting focused 
on doing some things for our community and that's what we're all about. Not 
about doing a number on Phoenix House. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you think it will turn out? 
</P>
<P>
A. The trail we're on now is going to lead us right into the courts. And if 
that happens, we're going to be in big trouble. I don't know if the community 
is going to be willing to raise $100,000 just to get started with a lawsuit.

TREATMENT OF ART TEACHER PROTESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing to protest the arbitrary action taken by the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula Unified School District administration against one of our most 
dedicated and outstanding high school teachers, Chizuko de Queiroz (Times, May 
12). She has worked in the school district for 27 years and has been 
chairperson of the art department for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The entire school faculty sent a petition to Dr. Jack Price (district 
superintendent) and approximately 200 of her students signed another petition 
demanding to have their colleague or teacher return to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The district administration removed her from the classroom due to a medical 
opinion which is contrary to the teacher's own physician's evaluation and the 
consistent evaluation of the district's appointed medical doctor for the last 
five years. The teacher suffered an industrial (on-the-job) injury while 
teaching in 1983. Since then she has remained teaching with the district where 
her evaluations remained excellent. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher was removed from the classroom several days after she complained at 
a school meeting about overcharging her school supplies account. Was she 
dismissed because she complained that the district purchased art supplies from 
a retailer rather than a wholesaler at a cost of over $500 more? 
</P>
<P>
This teacher should be returned to the classroom immediately.

HIGH SCHOOL CONSERVATORY PLAN GETS STATE GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino College's South Bay Center for the Arts and a consortium of six South 
Bay school districts have been awarded a $125,000 state grant to establish a 
High School Conservatory for the visual and performing arts, officials 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
College spokeswoman Mary Ann Keating said this is less than the $300,000 the 
consortium applied for, but officials nevertheless are pleased because $125,000 
was the maximum amount given any proposal statewide. 
</P>
<P>
She said the money will be used to hire a principal and secretary for the first 
year and to help set up the program, which would offer specialized art classes 
to high school students in six South Bay districts. Classes would not start 
until the fall of 1990, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a proposal for a math and science high school at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills was not among the 12 projects funded in the 1988-89 state budget, 
according to Cathy Barkett of the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The program at Dominguez Hills, co-sponsored by the Long Beach Unified School 
District, will be a strong candidate for next year's grant funds once the 
state's 1989-90 budget is approved, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Barkett said that 42 school districts statewide competed for $2.1 million in 
specialized secondary education grant funds in this year's budget and that it 
is "very likely" an equal amount will be available for the next fiscal year, 
starting July 1, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Westin, El Camino College's dean of fine arts and executive director of 
its South Bay Center for the Arts, said Friday, "We are excited about receiving 
the funds." The statewide competition was "extremely tough, not only in the 
quantity of applicants, but the quality," Westin said. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of receiving the news Friday from Barkett, Westin notified the 
superintendents of the six participating districts: Centinela Valley Union High 
School District, South Bay Union High School District, and El Segundo, 
Inglewood, Palos Verdes Peninsula and Torrance unified school districts. 
</P>
<P>
They are expected to meet next week to formally accept the grant, and to start 
working out how the districts can give additional funds and services to help 
create the arts conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Located at El Camino 
</P>
<P>
The conservatory would be located at El Camino College. Participating students 
from the six school districts would attend their home high school, and take 
advanced visual and performing arts classes at the conservatory, according to 
the formal grant proposal. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 to 550 students are expected to participate, Westin said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday afternoon, Barkett said state officials "hope to offer 
Dominguez Hills a $125,000 planning grant (in the next fiscal year), contingent 
upon there being enough funds in the 1989-90 budget." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Wiley, the dean of science, math and technology at Dominguez Hills, said 
Friday, "We are hopeful of getting support." The math and science magnet school 
would draw students from all over the Los Angeles basin, he said.

REPAIRS SCHEDULED FOR PARKING LOT AT CABRILLO BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Repairs to the Cabrillo Beach parking lot that was damaged by a winter storm in 
1987 will begin in August. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the 320 spaces at the parking lot off Stephen White Drive in San Pedro 
were lost when pounding waves sent boulders flying from a sea wall onto the 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Bids for the repair job are expected to go out Tuesday, said officials of the 
city Recreation and Parks Department, which operates the lot. Construction is 
to begin in August and will cost about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lot manager Jean Thaxton said the missing spaces are badly needed because the 
lot serves a popular beach, museum and boat launch area.

young, was having a small relapse. His racket had committed that offense 
punishable by death -- an error -- so he slammed it to the ground and kicked it 
half the length of the tennis court. He placed his hands on his hips and began 
what might have been, had he continued, a wail. But then a remarkable thing 
happened. He stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Not completely, of course. There are certain forceful emotions -- those 
wracking tremors and heaving sighs of pure anguish -- that McEnroe will never 
subdue. But he is 30, a doting father of two with a new equilibrium and 
apparently a new tennis life as well. His behavior is on the whole composed and 
quite bewildering. His game, after a three-year decline, is at last approaching 
something like its previous form. 
</P>
<P>
He is relaxed and fit and currently No. 6 in the world, winner of two 
tournaments within three weeks in February. Only a year ago he was laboring at 
No. 25 and making early exits from tournaments, like his first-round loss to 
Diego Perez at the Tournament of Champions. He returned to the Forest Hills 
tournament last week to play doubles only, with younger brother Patrick, in 
hopes of sharpening his game on clay in preparation for the French Open next 
month, because a major championship is suddenly possible again. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe may never again achieve the sublime as he did between 1979 and 1984, 
when he won three Wimbledon and four U.S. Open singles titles and was ranked 
No. 1 for four straight years. But with a 20-3 match record this season, he is 
making semifinals with regularity and seems only a fraction away from resuming 
his place in the top echelon. It is his best start since 1985, and also one of 
his most enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hungry again," said television analyst Mary Carillo, a former player and 
longtime friend who once teamed with McEnroe to win a French Open mixed-doubles 
title. "I think for a while he didn't love tennis. Now it's his identity again, 
it's like at some point he fell in love with it all over again." 
</P>
<P>
His once sneering relationship with crowds has turned almost sentimental. He 
has balanced tennis with his family life, wife Tatum and sons Kevin and Sean, 
and he is rarely seen off the court without a stroller. His nervous psyche has 
calmed, as he has conceded that the famous tantrums had become 
self-destructive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a combination of a lot of things," he said. "It's been like climbing. You 
don't just take eight steps on a ladder. It's feeling more enjoyment playing 
than I have in a long time. It's a better concept of juggling family life. I 
got stronger, healthier." 
</P>
<P>
He defeated No. 1 Ivan Lendl in the semifinals in winning his WCT title in 
Dallas, after winning the Grand Prix at Lyons. His only losses have come to the 
best in the world: He made the quarterfinals of the Australian Open before 
falling to Lendl, lost to Boris Becker in the semifinals of Milan, and to 
Stefan Edberg in the semis at the Japan Open. 
</P>
<P>
He was the clear leader of the Davis Cup team that defeated France soundly last 
month in San Diego, where he doled out match and behavioral advice to Andre 
Agassi, the teen idol who has struggled with both his tennis and his image 
after rising to No. 3 last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Who better than somebody who's been through it?" Agassi said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"John set the tone for the team in practices and matches," Davis Cup captain 
Tom Gorman said. "He showed how a great player plays great matches. He's doing 
it again, that's what I see." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe's decline was not clear-cut, just an overall fraying of his game and 
temper. In 1984, arguably his finest year, he amassed a 79-3 record. But it was 
never easy emotionally. Never one to train, he began to be betrayed by his body 
as he suffered nagging injuries. He felt increasing resentment at the chaotic 
tennis life and demands of being No. 1, and then there were the overwhelming 
new chores that go with marriage and family. 
</P>
<P>
He slipped to No. 2 in 1985, and his on-court ranting eventually led to his 
being barred from Davis Cup play when he (and Jimmy Connors) refused to sign a 
code-of-conduct agreement. In 1986 he lost to Brad Gilbert in the first round 
of the Nabisco Masters, and by the end of the year had plummeted to No. 14, as 
he began his series of sabbaticals and attempted returns. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not one thing, it was five or 10 things," he said. "The difficulty of 
coping with No. 1, a lot of years of strenuous tennis without protecting myself 
physically. My body broke down. So when I mentally broke down, and that had 
always been my strongest part, I was not able to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to get away. With all of my accomplishments, and everything I had 
done and everything I had, I was looking at the negatives. And I realized I 
shouldn't be doing it if I was going to be that miserable." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe's recovery has been a matter of fits and starts, with some desperate 
measures, enforced absences and misdirected efforts. He appeared to be pulling 
his game together at the end of 1987 until he was given a two-month suspension 
and $10,000 fine for code-of-conduct violations resulting from a particularly 
severe tantrum at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared genuinely repentant over the incident, and finally resolved to seek 
some compromise between being the game's finest player and its most tortured. 
"I told myself that the next time the attitude just had to be better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But from a technical standpoint, the recovery of his game was no simple matter 
of resolve. McEnroe plays with the same untutored ease that allows some people 
to play music by ear, and essentially what he had to do was relearn many skills 
that depended on instinct and reflex. It was a painstaking process. For the 
first time he turned his attention to training; he tried yoga and bicycling and 
massages and diets. "It was like having to learn my body all over again," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There were some blind alleys. He trifled with various rackets, and altered his 
strategy to combat power hitters like Becker, only to find that he needed to 
return to his natural game, with its various paces and artful shot-making. He 
had stopped playing doubles to spend more time at home. But it turned out that 
doubles helped some essential facets of his game -- his serve, reflexes and 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed he was progressing when he made the round of 16 at the French before 
succumbing to Lendl in four sets, with two tiebreakers. But he lost in the 
second round at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. The Open was particularly 
frustrating as he fell to Mark Woodforde of Australia on what is generally 
considered his home court, scant miles from Douglaston, N.Y. Observers 
considered it a sign that he was finished, noting his lack of quickness. 
</P>
<P>
"The age wasn't a question," Gorman said. "The only aspect you questioned was 
how a player who has been at the top starts again. When you lose to players you 
never lost to before, and never dreamed you could ever lose to, how do you deal 
with that and try to play through it?" 
</P>
<P>
But McEnroe displayed considerable maturity in that loss. "I never felt close 
to quitting," he said. "My idea was actually to come back even better. So I 
felt like I had to win the U.S. Open three weeks later. But that was putting 
too much pressure on myself; I was trying to do too much." 
</P>
<P>
After the Open loss, he decided to simplify his physical regimen and took the 
advice of many of his friends to play doubles again. He has paired with both 
his brother and Woodforde, and it has had a clear effect on his game. His 
volleys are sharp and unhesitating, his strokes have regained their pace and 
angles, and his serve is a weapon again. He served 10 aces in Davis Cup play 
against Yannick Noah. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe acknowledges he is still not in peak form, and the true indication of 
where he stands will probably come the next couple of months in Europe. He 
pulled out of the Italian Open but is still expected to compete in the French. 
If he can't make the final leap to No. 1, he says he doesn't necessarily desire 
it, certainly not the way he did before. He was too pursued by its 
responsibilities, too subject to its pressures. "It's a difficult position to 
be in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But with his future growing more limited, there may still be some Grand Slam 
events with his name on them.

BENNETT HAS DUAL ROLE ON PENSKE RACE TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIGEL BENNETT, For Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
INDIANAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As chief designer of Penske Racing, I direct the design team whose assignment 
is to create the fastest and most competitive car possible. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend in qualifying we can test the outer limits of our abilities to 
make a race car go fast. 
</P>
<P>
The other half of my responsibility is to convert the theory into reality in my 
role as race engineer on Danny Sullivan's Miller car. 
</P>
<P>
(However, a crash in practice on Thursday is expected to keep Sullivan from 
attempting to qualify for the race this weekend.) 
</P>
<P>
Our Penske PC18s are the result of nearly 100 days of wind tunnel 
experimentation and combine the best that our designers, model builders, 
aerodynamicists, engine builders, mechanics and fabricators can produce. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to our Prime Computer CADDS system, we have cut the time it takes to 
design a car in half. That leaves us much more time for research, testing and 
refining our cars. 
</P>
<P>
The cars which Penske Racing will present for qualification this weekend will 
have undergone literally hundreds of design changes since they were first 
sketched last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Each change, no matter how small, is the result of a bit of testing, research 
or experience. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly tiny changes all add up, and that is part of the reason for the 
terrific speeds here at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
With straightaway speeds in excess of 230 m.p.h., the cleaner we can make the 
car aerodynamically, the better we like it. 
</P>
<P>
If that means using thinner decals on critical areas of the car, we do it. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the cars are going faster because they stick to the track better. In 
simple terms, we've taken the design of an airplane wing and turned it upside 
down. The lift that helps an airplane take off, and every airplane I know of 
will take off at 230 m.p.h., is instead used to push the car down on the track 
by creating downforce rather than lift. 
</P>
<P>
The Penske team has enjoyed great success on pole day here, winning eight poles 
and last year taking the entire front row with Rick Mears, Sullivan and Al 
Unser. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, we would have been delighted to repeat that performance this year. 
However, with the crash, that is now impossible. It would have been 
exceptionally tough to repeat competition is quite strong and several more cars 
are in position to claim a front-row spot. 
</P>
<P>
For qualifying, we want the car right to the edge, but comfortable. We would 
like to use as little wing angle as possible to limit drag. But we must keep 
enough downforce to make the car stick to the track. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying at Indy is a four-lap average speed and a driver simply cannot 
"carry" a poor-handling car to a peak speed for four laps. The car must be 
right. 
</P>
<P>
We will carry only enough fuel to complete the warm-up laps and four-lap run. 
The Penske crew will seal any gaps in the bodywork which may permit wind to 
seep in at speed and add drag. 
</P>
<P>
At our current speeds, it requires more than 10 additional horsepower to 
achieve a one m.p.h. gain in straightaway speeds, so mechanical speed is 
difficult to find, hence the premium on aerodynamics. 
</P>
<P>
Penske Racing is blessed with the finest tradition, mechanics, drivers and 
sponsors in Indy-car racing. My responsibility is to provide a race car worthy 
of their record.

THERE'S EVEN ROOM FOR ROMAR IN THE BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN HUNT, Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SPRINGFIELD, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Part of the world's most extensive Romar collection hangs in a back room at the 
Basketball Hall of Fame, away from public view. 
</P>
<P>
The legend of Lorenzo Romar, a 6-foot-1 guard, began when he averaged 9.3 
points as a University of Washington senior. Or was it when the Golden State 
Warriors selected him in the seventh round of the 1980 draft, or when he 
averaged 7.6 points in his best National Basketball Assn. season, was waived 
three times in little more than a year, played for the Continental Basketball 
Assn.'s Evansville Thunder and Tampa Bay Thrillers in 1984-85, or . . . 
</P>
<P>
Before the 24-second clock runs out, let's toss this one up: What in the name 
of Topsy Del Gobbo is a Lorenzo Romar uniform doing here anyway? 
</P>
<P>
It's time Romar thanked the Detroit Pistons for waiving him Nov. 8, 1984. He 
went to Milwaukee, a free agent. His Detroit uniform went to the Hall of Fame, 
a goodwill contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes basketball fame is nothing more than convenience. The Pistons didn't 
need Lorenzo Romar, or his uniform. The Hall of Fame needed a Piston uniform 
for an exhibit of representative NBA uniforms. The rest, as they say at 1150 
West Columbus Ave., is basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
"Me? In the Hall of Fame?" said Romar, 30, who became a Christian six years ago 
and joined Athletes in Action in San Diego. "I wasn't even aware of it. It's a 
complete shock. And I'm not sure it makes a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
Well, history at the Hall of Fame can mean many things. It can mean George 
Mikan, Bob Pettit, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Wilt Chamberlain, Pete Maravich and 
Julius Erving. And it can mean Lorenzo Romar, John Paxson, Mark McNamara, 
Clemon Johnson, Moore's All-American Redheads, the South Philadelphia Hebrew 
Assn. and the menu from Larry Bird's Boston Connection restaurant in French 
Lick, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," Romar said, "they're trying to draw some sort of contrast." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the contrast -- and a surprising number of genuine basketball artifacts 
-- is tucked away beyond the "Spalding Shoot Out," past the Bob Coyne cartoons, 
the Sports Illustrated covers and the NBA locker-stall exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
In an isolated storage area not much bigger than the Boston Celtics' locker 
room, a Romar uniform shares rack space with those of Earl Jones of Springarn 
High School in Washington, D.C., Neal Walk of Florida (the difference between 
him and UCLA's Lew Alcindor was a coin flip in the 1969 draft), LaRue Martin of 
Loyola, John Paxson of the San Antonio Spurs and Clemon Johnson of the 
Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
From the sublime to the generic: jerseys from the University of Connecticut 
(women's), Slippery Rock College and Punxsatawney High School. Detroit Piston 
fans should note that the latter was acquired for a Groundhog Day display, not 
for a tribute to Coach Chuck Daly. 
</P>
<P>
Here one can find trophies, stained green by time, saluting national industrial 
league champions from 30 years past, Civilian Conservation Corps and 
Caterpillar (as in tractor) AAU jerseys, a watch by Elgin commemorating the 
1944 NBL champion Zollner Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
And, oh, those basketballs. A red, white and blue ABA edition ("Dave 
DeBusschere, Commissioner") signed by Julius Erving or immortalizing a 92-foot 
field goal by the Pacers' Jerry Harkness that beat the Dallas Chaparrals Nov. 
19, 1967. Even a ball from the 1924 National Interscholastic championship game 
-- Windsor (Colo.) 25, Yankton (S.D.) 6. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the bouncing balls and you'll find one dribbled 451.8 miles from 
Hodgdon, Maine, June 14-21, 1984 for the opening of the new Hall. Do not, under 
any circumstances, overlook the nonstop dribbling record of 347.2 miles at 
Covenant Children's Hospital in Decatur, Ill., Aug. 8-11, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Authenticity? Be serious. There's more tread left on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Could those be Bob Lanier's size-22 sneakers? And, there, below a tabletop with 
Michael Jordan's NBA All-Star jersey and Elgin Baylor's Seattle University 
jersey, Spud Webb's garment bag. Hold on . . . sorry, it's another Lanier 
colossus, a white canvas Converse, in a king-size sneaker bag. The other 
sneaker was part of the U.S. exhibit at last summer's World Expo in Brisbane, 
Australia. The Hall's prized Lanier pieces are a bronzed pair on display. 
</P>
<P>
Spike Lee and Michael Jordan weren't even Air-born when Lanier first laced up 
what may be the most famous artifacts in basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking industrial-strength odor-eaters," says Michael Brooslin, the 
Hall's curator. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the Hall's storage walls are 150-200 basketballs, 300 uniforms, a table 
of trophies, trinkets and watches, six shelves of sneakers, pennants, plaques, 
cartoons and life-size cutouts of Parade All-Americans. Boxes are stacked on 
top of boxes. And still more boxes: The Hall's inventory grows by 300-400 items 
yearly. Only a small percentage makes it to the big show, the Hall of Fame 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Some trophies are broken. You'll have to excuse the shooter's shattered left 
leg on the 1980 Pepsi-Cola NBA Old-Timers game trophy. But the gold touchtone 
phone presented to Ed Gottlieb at the 1969 NBA All-Star game probably could get 
through to the Miami Heat hotline. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like the 1986 Hall of Fame game trophy, are unwanted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was supposed to be given to the Celtics," Brooslin said. "They 
never took it." 
</P>
<P>
Politics (President Calvin Coolidge), royalty (Spain's Prince Felipe de 
Borbon), Hollywood (Cary Grant), fantasy (Linus, Snoopy, Charlie Brown), Lana 
Turner and Andre Turner converge here as unlikely memories of a game invented 
in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a Springfield College professor. 
</P>
<P>
How to organize such a mess? Andy Warhol's estate recruited Sotheby's. The Hall 
of Fame has only Brooslin to sort, document and organize an intriguing 
collection from the 1890s to the 1980s. Brooslin, 33, became the Hall's first 
curator almost two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually everything was in boxes before I came here," Brooslin said. "Now we 
pretty much know what we have. But it's a five-year type of deal. It looks like 
we'll go to a computer next year. That will help.' 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Brooslin sits before stacks of index cards, tagging and 
cataloguing. Although Brooslin admits to visiting the old Hall of Fame at 
Springfield College only once while a student at nearby American International, 
he says he's having the time of his life. Beats his last job by a longshot -- 
curator of the National Rollerskating Museum in Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Some items Brooslin will never ID, such as the faded orange tanktops with 
stenciled numbers, no player or team names. The tag reads, "Orange tank, 
unidentified." 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like, 'Why the heck do I even have these?' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent afternoon Brooslin returned from the basketball shelves, his eyes 
as big as the Walter Brown Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a complete inventory," he says. "I didn't even know I had this 
Hollywood stars basketball until two days ago." 
</P>
<P>
Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Tony Curtis. Lana Turner, Barbara Stanwyck, Hayley 
Mills. Gene Kelly, Doris Day, Gina Lollabrigida. Tony Randall, Sandra Dee, Rock 
Hudson. It's a bouncing Hollywood autograph book, auctioned by Dorothy Lamour 
to raise funds for the 1968 Olympic team. The Beta Shoe Company bought it for 
$285. 
</P>
<P>
If only the names were so clear on the lace-up ball signed by Calvin Coolidge. 
His signature and the year, 1924, are clearly visible. So is John C. Jeets, 
tournament director. That's about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone through it and through it," Brooslin said. "I can't even figure out 
what tournament it is." 
</P>
<P>
A classic ball -- so, it looks like a football exposed to a mutant air pump -- 
with a president's signature doesn't make the cut. It sits next to a ball 
dribbled 185 miles by Boxboro High School on Dec. 23, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to use it not so much for the signature," Brooslin said, "but it's one 
of the better lace-up balls we have. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors pay up to $5,000 for a uniform. The Coolidge ball? 
</P>
<P>
"For that particular basketball," says Carol Sherman of Profiles in History, an 
autograph broker in Beverly Hills, Calif., "we'd probably price it at 
$500-$1,000. If we knew who else signed it, it might be worth much more." 
</P>
<P>
Profiles prices the "Hollywood" ball at $750-$1,000. Of course, once in the 
Hall, always in the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Collectors," Brooslin said, his faced curled in a sour look. "I don't even 
want to talk about it. With old stuff, it can be difficult for us. But anything 
new, you know who's going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Remember the NBC peacock, brought to you in living color? Presenting Ira 
Harge's contribution to basketball history, a 1971-72 ABA Miami Floridians 
uniform: black, orange with a magenta stripe and stirrups. Let's be kind and 
say the design lies somewhere between Bo Ellis and Alexander Julian. 
</P>
<P>
And no ABA collection is complete without a Marvin Barnes (never inducted, 
never indicted) original, "Spirits of St. Louis" printed in orange over the 
Lindbergh plane with "Marvin" on the back. 
</P>
<P>
For pure, glow-in-the-dark slickness, we suggest a red satin jacket with an 
Indian emblem worn by Clarence (Bevo) Francis. An appropriately flashy outfit 
for someone who scored 113 points for Rio Grande College against Hillsdale Feb. 
2, 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Francis' jacket was displayed in the old Hall, more a shrine for New England 
basketball. Now the uniforms of Walter Luckett (Kolbe-Bridgeport), Tom Roy 
(South Windsor) and Ron Perry (Catholic Memorial) and a ball commemorating 
Danny Moore's 71-point night for South Catholic Feb. 13, 1970 are here, in the 
Hall of Fame but not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Well, take heart. Fillipe de Borbon's Celtic jersey, a replica of that given 
Spain's prince at the McDonald's Open last year, didn't make it. Even though, 
Brooslin says, "It's our first piece of royalty." 
</P>
<P>
You'll also find Rick Barry's No. 24 (Golden State Warriors), Oscar Robertson's 
No. 4 from the Cincinnati Royals, Earl Monroe's No. 10 from Winston-Salem, 
ceramic ashtrays made by Maurice Stokes, the uniform top of Dick Van Arsdale 
(Phoenix Suns) and the shorts of twin brother Tom, a crumbling banner from the 
1904 Universal Expo in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
And Lorenzo Romar. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to give some reasons why I'm there," Romar said, "but I can't think 
of any statistic that would qualify me for the Hall of Fame. I had a career 
high of 22 points, twice. I had eight steals once. I had 14 assists a couple of 
times -- guys are almost averaging that now." 
</P>
<P>
But he was waived at the right time. Twice. Don't bother looking for Romar's 
Warrior uniform. You'll never see it. The other half of the Hall's Romar 
collection is open year-round to the public, part of the NBA uniform exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
It's true. Lorenzo Romar, Detroit Pistons, has made it to the floor of the Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Don't give up hope, Mike Smrek.

Becoming the only man to lead the International League in home runs four times 
during its more than 100-year history should have made Howie Moss something 
beyond a mere provincial hero. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles recognized him as one of their most awesome power 
hitters, yet his achievements never received the acclaim they deserved. 
</P>
<P>
Was that a tough ultimatum dictated by the fickle winds of fate, or was he 
arbitrarily labeled a minor-league home run king who couldn't produce at the 
major-league level? It all seems unfair, considering the numbers he put up for 
the Orioles more than four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Moss carried the colorful tag of "Howitzer Howie," a right-handed pull-hitter 
who came out of the dugout swinging. He led the International League in homers 
with the Orioles in 1944, 1946, 1947 and 1948 with 27, 38, 53 and 33. 
</P>
<P>
In 1945, during the war, he was in the Navy at the Bainbridge (Md.) Training 
Station. Moss was later with the Cincinnati Reds and Cleveland Indians in 1946 
for brief looks but was turned back each time. It was a career disappointment, 
yet he never complained that the game hadn't rewarded him with the thorough 
chance it had offered others with less impressive credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Moss, age 70, died unexpectedly at his home in Baltimore Sunday and is to be 
buried Wednesday. He was the first of three Orioles to receive International 
League Most Valuable Player Awards in the '40s -- Moss in 1944, Sherman Lollar 
in 1945 and Eddie Robinson in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
A third baseman and outfielder with a strong arm, Moss hit the ball high and 
took advantage of a short left field in Baltimore's Municipal Stadium that had 
been converted from football to baseball after Oriole Park burned down on July 
4, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Moss' former Oriole teammates, Ray Flanigan and Milt Stockhausen, offer 
fond recollections. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a great guess hitter, one of the best I ever saw," Stockhausen said. 
"He hit a lot of curveballs for home runs and had the right stroke for that 
fence in the stadium. It was about 280-feet down the line but went out sharply 
toward center field." 
</P>
<P>
Flanigan, like Stockhausen and Moss, went to the Indians from the Orioles. "I 
don't know what happened that he didn't make it," Flanigan said. "Maybe he 
couldn't handle the good fastball up and in, but that goes for a lot of 
hitters. I do remember he'd chase a bad curveball when he got behind in the 
count but, again, so many others do that, too." 
</P>
<P>
It seems unfair that the records categorize Moss with such other home run 
champions as Joe Hauser, Buzz Arlett and George Puccinelli -- all of whom wore 
out International League pitching yet didn't do it in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
They hit a ton but never had the advantage of a ready-made job situation in the 
big leagues, which at the time was limited to 16 clubs. Talent was evaluated in 
a severe and often discriminating manner. 
</P>
<P>
Moss came to the Orioles after an unusual minor-league career that saw him 
start for Greenwood, Miss., in 1936 in the Cotton States League and suddenly 
quit for three years to play for an "outlaw" team in his hometown of Gastonia, 
N.C. It wasn't until 1941 that he got reinstated and returned to organized 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The 1944 International League campaign saw the Orioles win the pennant, 
playoffs and Little World Series as Moss topped the league in home runs, 27; 
runs-batted-in, 141; doubles, 44, and hits, 178. Injuries were a problem, 
always seeming to occur when opportunity beckoned. 
</P>
<P>
"I never believed in alibiing," he once said, "but every time I got a chance to 
go somewhere I either wound up on crutches or in a cast."

CELTIC INTEGRITY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Potentially one of the ugliest moments in National Basketball Assn. history was 
avoided in the last game of the regular season when a struggling former 
champion refused to be seduced by the benefits of losing. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Celtics had much to gain by dumping that last game. A victory 
guaranteed them nothing more than a first-round playoff loss to the Detroit 
Pistons. A defeat created the possibility of winning the draft lottery and 
getting an impact player to team with a healthy Larry Bird. The Celtics could 
have regained their elite standing quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious immorality of losing on purpose was magnified by the fact that the 
Celtics would have had to lose to the helpless Charlotte Hornets in front of 
the Boston Garden home crowd while playing on the storied parquet floor below 
16 NBA championship banners. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, however, played it straight. No funny stuff with weird lineups. No 
resting regulars. They won the game and lost a chance at the No. 1 pick. Then 
they lost three consecutive games to the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
"What did we gain?" asked Boston President Red Auerbach. "Nothing. But it was a 
matter of maintaining our self-respect. You try to win every single game you 
play." 
</P>
<P>
But what about Boston fans and members of the Boston media who wanted the 
Celtics to lose so that they could win in the draft? "I don't give a damn about 
those people," Auerbach growled. "Once a team loses its integrity, then you're 
in the wrong business. It's a terrible thing to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Which is true, but it hasn't stopped others. Anyway, the point for the Celtics 
now is: Where to from here? During the 1989-90 season, Robert Parish will be 
36, Bird will be 33 and Kevin McHale will be 32. McHale has trade value, so 
perhaps it is time to move him for a younger player and a No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't contemplate major moves," Auerbach said. "We feel with Larry back and 
the development of our younger players and adding a player in the draft, we'll 
be all right." 
</P>
<P>
And that, too, may be true. Consider the rise of the Phoenix Suns, who went 
from 28 to 55 victories in one season, primarily because of the acquisition of 
Tom Chambers. And the Golden State Warriors went from 20 to 43 victories with 
Mitch Richmond as the only significant addition. 
</P>
<P>
It seems now that the NBA is in an era in which teams can swing drastically 
with one major and perhaps one or two minor additions. And the Celtics will 
have that major addition in a healthy Bird, who is expected to be fully 
recovered from heel surgery. Boston also has the 13th pick in the college 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
The playoff experience, although limited, also should help young players such 
as Reggie Lewis and Brian Shaw, much as the first-round, four-game series 
against the Celtics last year helped the New York Knicks' young players. 
</P>
<P>
But more than anything else, what will help the Celtics is that they maintained 
their championship tradition of trying to win. They understand that any team 
that believes losing leads to winning is nothing more than a loser. 
</P>
<P>
The Word From Bird -- Bird met with Boston reporters the day after the Celtics' 
elimination, and he had some pointed comments, although he refused to name 
names. "To get this going again, everybody's got to give 100 percent," Bird 
said. "You (reporters) are around enough to know who's doing it and who's not. 
Everybody's been sliding for a couple of years. We never had to worry about 
guys not giving the effort three or four years ago, but we have that now. Not 
only this year, but last year and the year before." 
</P>
<P>
Interesting. The only other players on the roster who were in Boston during the 
1986-87 season are McHale, Parish and Dennis Johnson. So who is Bird talking 
about? Speculation in Boston is that Bird has not been enamored with McHale's 
play, but neither player will comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
If Bird is upset with McHale, that increases the likelihood of a McHale trade. 
What Larry wants in Boston, Larry usually gets. 
</P>
<P>
The Denver Bricklayers -- The Denver Nuggets won the Midwest Division 
championship in 1987-88 but finished third this season, then were eliminated in 
the first playoff round. Part of their problem was their reliance on outside 
shooting, particularly their reliance on low-percentage outside shooters. 
</P>
<P>
Of the top 50 scorers in the NBA, Fat Lever was 47th in field-goal percentage 
(.457) and Michael Adams was 49th (.433), and those two, the starting guards, 
were two of the Nuggets' top three scorers. 
</P>
<P>
Lever has suggested that he might be traded in the off-season because he is the 
Nuggets' most marketable player. Denver Coach Doug Moe said, "Nothing is 100 
percent in the NBA. But the closest thing is that we're not going to trade Fat 
Lever." 
</P>
<P>
The dreaded vote of confidence. Bye, Fat. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Games in LA -- Anyone in need of an August basketball fix might consider 
a vacation in Los Angeles. David Robinson will be there, playing for the Spurs' 
summer league team. And Roy Tarpley, who played in only 19 games this season 
because of a knee injury and a second stint in a drug rehabilitation clinic, 
will play for the Mavericks' summer league team. 
</P>
<P>
Caught Short -- Seattle backup guard Avery Johnson had a minor problem with his 
shorts in last Tuesday's Sonics-Rockets game. Johnson apparently wasn't too 
careful when he dressed, so when he entered the game, he noticed that his 
shorts were on backwards. Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff called time out and 
the Sonics players huddled around Johnson, who made the proper adjustments. "I 
know everyone is laughing at me now," Johnson said, "so what can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
He Isn't What He Drinks -- Witnessing this scene might have been worth the 
price of a round-trip plane ticket to Oakland, Calif. After the Warriors 
eliminated the Utah Jazz last Tuesday, there was a going-away party for Golden 
State public relations director Cheri White, who will join the NBA PR staff in 
New York after the Warriors' season ends. Several players attended, including 
Larry Smith, who entered the restaurant and worked his way to the bar. A person 
standing near the renowned Mr. Mean burst out laughing when Smith, in a deep 
voice, told the bartender, "I'll have a Shirley Temple." 
</P>
<P>
Highs and Lows -- Ricky Pierce's 35 points in last Tuesday's Bucks-Hawks game 
were a career high. . . . And, as difficult as it is to believe, Bill 
Cartwright is getting less aggressive. Last season, he led the NBA by scoring 
37% of his points from the free-throw line. This season, he was down to 25%.

HE STUDIES WHY BASEBALL PLAYERS SUFFER UPON EXITING NEVER-NEVER LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dodger great Roy Campanella once said there had to be "a lot of little boy in 
you" to succeed in the major leagues. Tom House made a similar observation but 
carried the thought one step further. A professional baseball player, House has 
written, "is for all practical purposes terminally adolescent." 
</P>
<P>
Campanella's combination of ability and attitude was such that he was elected 
to the Hall of Fame. House's spirit was willing but his flesh was considerably 
weaker. His lone contribution to the baseball shrine at Cooperstown was as an 
adjunct to Henry Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
House caught the ball that Aaron hit to surpass Babe Ruth's career home run 
record and appeared in a famous photograph gleefully handing the ball to Aaron 
at home plate in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the statement of my (playing) career," he said Monday night, smiling at 
the memory 15 years later. A left-handed pitcher, House spent six full seasons 
in the majors. Later this month he will mark his fourth anniversary as pitching 
coach of the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
What really sets House apart from former players and current pitching coaches, 
other than an inquisitive mind that has antagonized traditionalists, is a 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Gooden still carries his childhood nickname of Doc. Casey Stengel used 
to address everyone as doctor because it excused him from memorizing the first 
names of the thousands he met. But House comes to the designation of doctor 
honestly. He holds a doctorate in psychology. 
</P>
<P>
House didn't have to venture far to find a topic for his doctoral thesis. "When 
I was released as a player," he said before Monday night's game between the 
Rangers and New York Yankees, "I looked around at my peer group. The divorce 
rate was above average, there were bankruptcies and substance abuse of all 
kinds. Even with people who were financially secure, there was an unhappiness 
with the quality of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
One former teammate he chose not to identify called him in desperation. The man 
said he was holding a gun to his head. House talked him into counseling and he 
has since straightened out his life. 
</P>
<P>
But the inability to cope with demands of the real world, with "civilian" 
status, led House to study terminal adolescent syndrome among professional 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
House knew whereof he spoke. "I was losing a marriage," he said, "I did go 
bankrupt and my children made no sense to me. When I was released (as a 
player), my parents didn't even talk to me for a year and a half." Their status 
in the community, it developed, was founded on House's athletic success. 
</P>
<P>
Now House has taken his personal situation and observations, tested them 
against the experiences of contemporaries and set the results to public 
scrutiny in a volume entitled, "The Jock's Itch." 
</P>
<P>
Published by Contemporary Books, it is a successor to the enormously successful 
"Ball Four" that stops short of naming names. Instead, House chooses to 
concentrate on the behavior patterns of professional athletes and the way in 
which the demands and rewards of their sport inhibit their mental and emotional 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Athletes are Nintendo," he said. "Real world people are human computers." 
Because of the special deference paid to extraordinary athletes dating to 
childhood, they are not programmed to deal with everyday problems that confront 
those whose skills do not inspire adoring crowds or million-dollar contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is an extended family with its own culture, its own rules of 
deportment that have little to do with the rest of society. House likened it to 
the card game played by the closed family in "The Accidental Tourist," 
unintelligible to outsiders but comforting and bonding to the members. 
</P>
<P>
He identified strongly with Jim Bouton's conclusion to "Ball Four:" "You see," 
Bouton wrote, "you spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball and in 
the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time." 
</P>
<P>
To this day, House remains in baseball's grip. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got you for life," he said. "It got me." Fortunately, he was able to stay 
with it after his playing days, although it took great sacrifices on the part 
of his wife and three children and the willingness of his superiors, notably 
Ranger Manager Bobby Valentine and General Manager Tom Grieve, to take a fresh 
approach to the game. 
</P>
<P>
The book is small, much like the man was in the world he chose. House is 5 feet 
9, 165 pounds. His energy always has exceeded his strength. When he faced 
reporters after the catch of Aaron's homer in the Braves' bullpen on that April 
night in 1974, he identified himself in the terms of his teammates. "(They) 
call me the 'Human Greenie,' " he said then. 
</P>
<P>
He realized early in his career he would not be the next Sandy Koufax. In his 
own words, House worked to become "the best 81 m.p.h. left-handed fastball 
pitcher in baseball." With no small measure of pride, he said it was his 
opinion that only Randy Jones did better with similar talent. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of USC, House was relentlessly hyper and curious. When a manager or 
coach gave an order, he asked, Why? He's still asking. "The Jock's Itch," he 
said, is a serious attempt not only to deal with the problems but also to find 
solutions. It's a search of self-identification. 
</P>
<P>
House certainly hasn't discovered a cure. Sitting on a stool in the visitors' 
clubhouse at Yankee Stadium, he said he's still wondering "why I am not 
comfortable outside this environment." He remains happiest "working with 
pitchers on the mound, throwing batting practice, staying with a game called 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
It's a relationship Dr. House hopes he never has to sever even as he continues 
to study why parting is so difficult for so many.

LEMOND STRUGGLING IN CLIMB BACK TO TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL GLAUBER, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HARRISBURG, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ceremony is now familiar. The cyclists gather at the starting line, 
politicians are introduced, an announcer plugs the race sponsors and Greg 
LeMond steps forward to receive the loudest cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice," he says. "But it's also embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
The American who conquered Paris is back home, more popular than ever, but 
struggling to regain the form that propelled him to the 1986 Tour de France 
title. Clearly, LeMond is the marquee figure of the inaugural Tour de Trump. 
Plainly, he is struggling. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, he was ill. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond issued a speech of concession while lying on a bed in his hotel room. He 
was weary from the flu and exhausted after the tour's third stage, a 116.3-mile 
leg from Allentown, Pa., through the Lehigh Valley to the Market Square Bridge 
finish in Harrisburg. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a fever and woke up five to 10 times during the night," LeMond said. 
"I'm just not feeling healthy. This is all much harder than I thought it would 
be." 
</P>
<P>
After 5 hours, 30 minutes and 45 seconds of pack tactics, Eric Vanderaerden, a 
Belgian competing for the Dutch-based team Panasonic-Isostar, edged Soviet 
amateur Viatcheslav Ekimov to win a field sprint involving 54 cyclists. LeMond 
showed up 71st. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to stick with it," LeMond said. "I need to race, and it's important 
for me to finish." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond has virtually no chance of claiming the neon pink leader's jersey. Dag 
Otto Lauritzen, a Norwegian who competes for 7-Eleven, kept the jersey for the 
second straight day with a combined time of 15:51:02. LeMond is 6:53 behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It would take a miracle to take that much time off Lauritzen," LeMond said. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, of course, is accustomed to performing miracles in cycling. He was the 
first American to crash the European domination of the sport, living in Belgium 
and challenging the world's best racers on their own turf. The pay-off came at 
the 1986 Tour de France, when LeMond finally silenced his European critics and 
emerged as the first American-born champion. 
</P>
<P>
But he had little time to enjoy his success. On April 21, 1987, LeMond was 
nearly killed when he was shot by his brother-in-law in a hunting accident. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hunting for wild turkeys," said LeMond, who still has 30 buckshot 
pellets in his body. "I was the turkey." 
</P>
<P>
During his lengthy physical recovery, LeMond said his attitude about the sport 
changed. Cycling no longer dominated his life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like I was hit from the top and knocked to the bottom," he said. 
"That's the way it is in life. I could have been paralyzed. I could have been 
in a wheelchair. I could have died. I'm lucky to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Still, LeMond was determined to make a comeback. Injuries curtailed his 
performances in the last year, and he has enjoyed only nine months of 
uninterrupted training. 
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, they always write you off," he said. "Two months after my accident, 
the writers there said I was finished." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond is out to prove his critics wrong. He is 27, prepared to enter what 
could become the best years of his racing career. The Tour de Trump was 
supposed to be his catapult back to the top. Instead, he has dropped back. 
</P>
<P>
"There are difficult times even now," he said. "When you're on top and all of a 
sudden you're out, you only remember the good times, not what it took to get 
there. There are times when you're impatient." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he seems to enjoy a good life, splitting time between homes in suburban 
Minneapolis and Belgium. He plays golf, goes fishing, eats ice cream and drives 
a Range Rover. He has a comfortable six-figure income from his contract with 
the newly created Coors Light-ADR team. 
</P>
<P>
But money and fame create pressure. The race is always on to win . . . now. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not robots," he said. "We're not always at our best." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the flu and the harsh fact that he can't win the Tour de Trump, LeMond 
will continue to race. Tuesday's fourth stage is another difficult test, a 
111.5-mile ride from Gettysburg, Pa., through the western Maryland towns of 
Emmitsburg, Thurmont, Wolfsville, Middletown and Brunswick, and on to a finish 
in Winchester, Va.

Police officer Jim Davidson never had boxed when he went to trainer Jimmy 
Bivins with a plea. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson, 38, wanted to enter an Olympic-style competition for law enforcement 
officers from across the nation and asked Bivins to train him. 
</P>
<P>
"He watched me for a little while. After about six weeks of strictly putting me 
into condition, he put me in the ring. Jimmy's contention is that boxing is 
almost 90 percent conditioning. He proved it by me. He put me in the best shape 
of my life," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
Last August in Las Vegas, Davidson decisioned a 23-year-old deputy sheriff from 
California to win a gold medal. Bivins was in his corner. 
</P>
<P>
"I was elated," said Davidson, who competed as a 175-pound light heavyweight. 
"It culminated everything. He told me all along I could do it, even though I 
was concerned about my age." 
</P>
<P>
Bivins, 69, runs a small boxing gym in a former elementary school classroom at 
St. Malachi Center. The atmosphere recalls days when poor, street-wise kids 
thrived in big-city boxing clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers and young adults train with Bivins. He says he goes to the gym each 
day out of love of the sport. Bivins, a retired delivery truck driver, spends 
most of his money on equipment and weekly Saturday "feasts" for his boxers. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, you get in there and show your self esteem," Bivins said. "Nothing's 
impossible. You just try. You get to a place where you can do it. It brings out 
the man in you. It lets folks know if you work toward a goal, it can shine for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Bivins became a professional fighter in 1940 as a 180-pound light heavyweight 
in bouts that paid $5 a round. 
</P>
<P>
By 1942 he was widely considered among the best heavyweights and 
light-heavyweights in the country. He went into the Army in 1944, but otherwise 
dominated Cleveland boxing in that decade. 
</P>
<P>
During his career, he fought many of the biggest names in boxing, including 
heavyweight champ Joe Louis in a 10-rounder in Baltimore at a time when Louis 
was making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think I beat him, but he was Joe Louis. He had the name," Bivins said. 
</P>
<P>
Bivins had a professional record of 86 victories, 25 losses and one draw but 
never had a title fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Some folks said the promoters didn't want to take a chance of putting their 
guy in there with me," Bivins said. 
</P>
<P>
Bivins runs his gym outside of today's pro boxing circles. He works with no 
big-name fighters, as does promoter Don King of Orwell, east of Cleveland.

is. I never bother anybody. I just mind my own business. I don't shoot off at

LOYOLA TO INDUCT 6 INTO HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The six newest members of the Loyola Marymount University athletic hall of fame 
will be inducted Friday at St. Robert's Auditorium on the Loyola campus. 
</P>
<P>
This year the school honored four athletes, a coach and an administrator: Hugh 
Boyle, Harry (Bud) Brubaker, Harold (Skip) Giancanelli, the Rev. Donald 
Merrifield, Jerry Neri and James Tunney. Their addition brings the hall 
membership to 54. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle, class of 1942, played baseball and basketball and has been a member of 
the school's Athletic Board of Control for three decades. Former USC baseball 
Coach Rod Dedeaux, the winningest coach in NCAA history, named Boyle to his 
all-opponent team. 
</P>
<P>
Brubaker, class of 1932, lettered in football and basketball four seasons each 
and was an honorable mention All-American in football in 1931, when he recorded 
a 108-yard punt. He later played professional football and coached at Dorsey 
and Westchester high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Giancanelli, class of 1951, was a standout halfback for Loyola's football teams 
from 1947 through 1950, then continued on to a pro career with the Philadelphia 
Eagles and the Hamilton Tiger Cats of the Canadian Football League. He went on 
to coach football at Lincoln High School and El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
Tunney, a posthumous selection, lettered in football, basketball and baseball 
in the 1920s and played in the college all-star football game in 1929. He later 
became vice president of Fremont High School and was a referee in both Pacific 
Coast League football and the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Neri was an assistant football coach from 1949 to 1952 and was one of the most 
popular coaches in Loyola's football history. He later served as assistant 
coach at Yale and with the Washington Redskins, and from 1963 to 1983 was a 
scout and personnel director for the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Father Merrifield, Loyola's president from 1969 to 1984 and the university's 
chancellor since, oversaw the construction of Loyola's two major athletic 
facilities -- Albert Gersten Pavilion and George Page Stadium.

SELECT TEAM CAN'T HOLD BACK SOVIETS IN THE SECOND HALF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everything the San Diego Select basketball team had psyched itself up to worry 
about was true. 
</P>
<P>
And more. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night in front of 1,200 at San Diego State's Peterson Gym, the Soviet 
Junior National team defeated San Diego, 80-71, to give the Soviets their first 
victory after three losses on their 15-city U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually really happy," San Diego Select Coach Bill Peterson said. "We 
only had eight practices, only two when all the kids were there. We didn't get 
blown out. It was a good game, and I thought it was very entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
Before the first visit by the Soviet juniors to San Diego, Peterson, coach at 
Kearny High, said he was concerned about their intimidating size and practice 
time together. San Diego, he said, couldn't compete on either point. 
</P>
<P>
What they hadn't counted on was Yuri Leonov and his three-point shooting 
ability in the second half. Leonov had four three-pointers as the Soviets 
erased a 40-38 halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the Soviet shot the three-pointer better than we had been told," 
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets were four of 14 on three-pointers after halftime, compared with San 
Diego's feeble one for 12. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of missed opportunities," Valhalla's Tony Clark said. "We had a 
lot of chances, but we just missed. My best shot's from 15 (feet) in, and if I 
had gotten hot . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets led only once in the first half, on a turn-around jumper by Sergey 
Grezin that made it 33-32. San Diego came back with less than a minute to play 
to take the lead, 37-35, on a missed three-pointer by Joe Temple that was 
rebounded by Joe McNaull. Ray McDavid finished the first-half scoring with a 
three-pointer at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite three Soviets fouling out in the second half, San Diego couldn't hold 
its slim lead. Any remaining momentum waned with just under eight minutes to 
play as the Soviets took the lead for good. With 7:46 remaining, Leonov hit a 
layup that put the Soviets ahead, 64-63. San Diego never really challenged 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost our continuity," Torrey Pines Kevin Flanagan said. "At the end, we 
didn't have it. Obviously, they've been playing together for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan finished with 10 points. San Diego's leading scorer was Lincoln High's 
Aaron Wilhite, who had 21. McDavid added 14, and San Diego's Clark James had 
12. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Wilhite and McDavid played excellent," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said fatigue was a factor and that "we had kids in foul trouble, and 
there was that period when we got two points in five minutes (from 8:03 to 
3:57)." 
</P>
<P>
"I would say the Soviets couldn't have lost another one," he said. "They 
couldn't have gone 0-4 or they would have aborted this tour, so they had a lot 
of intensity." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, who lost their first three games to New York, Iowa and Indiana 
all-stars, were led by Leonov with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego took a 3-0 lead and were then tied on a three-pointer by Leonov. But 
the visitors looked out of sync and slow as San Diego reeled off 10 points for 
a 13-3 lead with 16 minutes remaining.

SISTERS IN CRIME; 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN MYSTERY WRITERS, FANS UNCOVER CLUES OF FEMININE INFLUENCE IN CLOAK AND 
DAGGER AT WEST HOLLYWOOD MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They call themselves Sisters in Crime, but the dozen women gathered in a West 
Hollywood bookshop weren't up to anything more nefarious than promoting the 
interests of women mystery writers. 
</P>
<P>
The national Sisters in Crime organization was founded three years ago by Sara 
Paretsky, a successful Chicago-based writer of hard-boiled mysteries. Although 
women have written some of the greatest mysteries of all time, Paretsky and 
others believed women mystery writers were being given short shrift, 
particularly by reviewers for influential publications that have a major impact 
on sales. The women were also distressed at the violence against women that is 
a staple of crime stories. 
</P>
<P>
The local group was organized last fall and has about 20 members, its 
president, Phyllis Zembler Miller, said. Unlike Mystery Writers of America, 
which limits its regular membership to published writers, Sisters in Crime is 
open to anyone. As a result, the Los Angeles chapter includes women who have 
published mysteries, women (including Miller) who want to, booksellers, book 
reviewers, fans, even men. 
</P>
<P>
Since April the group has been meeting on the first Sunday of the month amid 
the 25,000 volumes at the Mysterious Bookshop West, 8763 Beverly Blvd. A 
replica of the Maltese Falcon statuette broods over their gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fraternity of Writers' 
</P>
<P>
Member Elizabeth Ward drove up from Newport Beach to attend. "I just wanted to 
be with a fraternity of writers," Ward said. "Writing is such an isolated 
thing." Ward is the author of three mysteries, the most recent "A Nice Little 
Beach Town," published by St. Martins. 
</P>
<P>
The nice little beach town in question is very like Newport Beach, she 
acknowledged. "I've called it a different name so nobody will be hurt, but 
everyone will recognize it." In addition to Ward's book, the shop had copies of 
a mystery set in another nice little beach town, Michael Katz's "Last Dance in 
Redondo Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Goldstein, a family-law attorney who lives in Hollywood, said she joined 
because "I have a desire and a need to be around other people who are 
knowledgeable about and enjoy mysteries. You find when you talk to people who 
don't read mysteries, they tend to put them down as not serious literature -- 
especially my boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
As Goldstein spoke, she clutched a prize -- a slightly battered first American 
edition of "The Moonstone." The Wilkie Collins book, published in 1868, is the 
first modern detective novel. Goldstein first read it as a child, and it turned 
her into an aficionado. Goldstein, who happily paid $100 for her treasure, said 
she has begun writing a mystery of her own, inspired in part by her job. "If 
you want to find the greatest stories of all time," she said, "sit in my office 
for two hours." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide Discussions 
</P>
<P>
Carol Russell Law, who lives in Eagle Rock, is writing a mystery for children 
featuring a little girl sleuth named Holly Dean. "She has an older brother who 
is already a P.I.," Law said. "She's helping him, but she has all the ideas." 
Law joined the group because "it is trying to right some wrongs, as it were, 
and because I believe in having women write about women." 
</P>
<P>
The members discuss everything from how to resolve a plot to how to find an 
agent, which can sometimes be the greater mystery. "It's so important to have 
'sisters' who can tell you honestly that something works or doesn't work in a 
manuscript or in the publishing world in general," said Miller, who has written 
but not yet published a mystery about "a mythical Beverly Hills community 
center." 
</P>
<P>
"It's turned into a support group, a network," said Wendy Nelson Hornsby, whose 
second novel, "Half a Mind," will soon be published by New American Library. 
Like her first mystery, "No Harm" (which is being reissued in paperback), the 
new book has a female protagonist named Kate Teague -- heroines don't have 
names like Wendy, Hornsby said. "She's a schoolteacher just like me, except 
she's richer than I am, taller than I am and thinner than I am." 
</P>
<P>
Hornsby, who teaches history at Long Beach City College, said the group helps 
her stay in touch with the far-flung community of mystery writers in the area. 
"I live in Long Beach. Nobody lives in Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought by Collectors 
</P>
<P>
At their meeting Sunday, the sisters heard a talk on collecting mysteries by 
John Mitchell, who sells used and rare mysteries at his shop in Pasadena. 
Mitchell said New Mexico writer Tony Hillerman and Sue Grafton, who lives and 
works in Santa Barbara, are the two contemporary writers most sought by his 
collectors. He pointed out that a first edition of Grafton's first Kinsey 
Millhone mystery, " 'A' Is for Alibi," published only seven years ago, recently 
sold for $250. Sheldon MacArthur, who manages the Mysterious Bookshop West, 
sold the book to one of his collectors, a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Bookseller Terry Baker, who runs a mystery annex at Small World Books in 
Venice, is also active in the group. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters take no vow to write only about women. Member Gerry Maddren 
recently sent the manuscript of "Murder Though It Have No Tongue" off to her 
agent. The novel features a mother-daughter detective team, with offices in 
Burbank, where Maddren lives. But she is also at work on a sequel to her first 
mystery, "The Case of the Johannisberg Riesling," published by Cliffhanger 
Press. The book-in-progress, called "The Case of the Cabernet Crossing," has a 
male protagonist, a sleuth named Jerry Cool, who, after a wild night in 
California wine country recounted in the first book, woke up with a hangover 
and purple feet. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the evening "Sue Grafton" begins to sound like a ritual 
incantation. Grafton's success is the stuff that sisters' dreams are made of. 
One who dreams is Kathleen Dougherty, who lives in El Toro and is trying to 
place a suspense book called "Flashpoint." So far, she has had only rejections 
but, she said, "my agent says these are great rejections. They don't say, 
'Under no circumstance send the work of this writer to us or we'll never deal 
with you again.' "

FOREST WORKERS LEARN TO FELL TREES ON TARGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anybody can cut a tree down, says logger Douglas Dent. Start hacking a wedge 
out of the side of the trunk, and, as sure as rain falling from the clouds, the 
tree will come down. But try laying a 100-foot ponderosa pine out along a 
narrow clearing, veering from power lines, staying away from healthy trees and 
not injuring yourself. That's complicated, says the wiry Oregonian. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems awful simple, but, heck, I've been doing this for 20 years, and I'm 
just beginning to understand what it's all about," says Dent, a tree-cutting 
expert who has traveled to several continents, teaching the hazardous art of 
"tree falling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teaching Firefighters 
</P>
<P>
Dent, the author of a manual for professional timber men, was at Crystal Lake 
on Tuesday, 6,000 feet above Azusa in the San Gabriel National Forest, teaching 
his craft to 14 firefighters for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you're cutting eucalyptus in Australia, banyans in South America or 
ponderosas here, the principles are the same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hazards of tree chopping became vividly apparent two years ago, Forest 
Service officials say, when an engine foreman was killed on the fire line at 
Stanislaus National Forest. A tree he was downing snagged another tree, which 
snapped back and landed on him, killing him instantly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexpected Incidents 
</P>
<P>
"In my career, there were times when I was taking down between 50 and 100 trees 
a year," said Gordon Rowley, acting fire manager for the San Gabriel National 
Forest. "Every once in while, something happens that's unexpected to me." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the trainees were fire engine foremen or assistant foremen, who will 
take their newly acquired skills back to their units and teach them to others. 
</P>
<P>
Dent, 42, a short, bouncy man in faded jeans, a checkerboard wool shirt and a 
tin helmet, agrees that trees are as peculiarly individualistic as humans. But 
accidents like the fatality two years ago can be avoided, with some training, 
he says. "Experience is a great teacher, provided you live through it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, the trainees stepped up to designated trees and took their turns. 
These were big ponderosas, dead or mortally ill, lightning-struck or beetle 
infested. "Hazard trees," Karen Fortus, the Mt. Baldy District resource officer 
called them. "We get some pretty gusty winds up here, which could knock them 
down." 
</P>
<P>
In its simplest form, tree falling involves slicing a pie wedge, or "undercut," 
out of the side of the trunk with a big 36-inch chain saw, then attacking the 
other side with wedges and tipping the trunk into the sliced opening. "The 
undercut is like the sights on a rifle," guiding the trajectory of the falling 
tree, says Dent. 
</P>
<P>
But there are always complications, he suggests, sizing up a 100-footer. A tree 
can have rotten wood, or it can lean in one direction, both of which have to be 
compensated for, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the lean?" he asks his students, peering along the line of the trunk, 
encouraging some discussion. "Where's the best place to dump it?" 
</P>
<P>
Dent is a plain-spoken man, gently needling his students, quietly offering them 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tapping the Trunk 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see what it sounds like," he says to Patrick Williams, an assistant 
engine foreman in the forest's Chilao Station, who circles his tree, tapping 
the trunk with the back of an ax. ("A nice solid sound," explained a colleague, 
who had already downed his own tree, "means good wood. A thump means you got 
dried wood.") 
</P>
<P>
Williams slices into the big tree, sending chips and fragrant sawdust flying. 
His challenge is to avoid some power lines nearby and a stand of majestic old 
trees. When he pauses for a moment, Dent gives his undercut a critical look, 
sighting along the handle of the chain saw toward a clearing in the forest. "I 
think you can go a little deeper," he says, "but the angle of the dangle looks 
real good." 
</P>
<P>
After 30 minutes of sawing and sighting, the old tree crashes down. "The tree 
went just where you wanted it to go," said the logging expert. "Isn't that 
wonderful?" 
</P>
<P>
Dent says that the greatest hazard in "cutting the big uglies" is 
misunderstanding the dynamics of the cuts. "If you get those pie wedges 
crossing each other, the trunk can split right to the top," he says. 
</P>
<P>
John Armstrong, an assistant foreman in the national forest's Saugus District, 
pulls out a copy of Dent's book and points to an illustration of the "barber 
chair," when one slice is undermined by another, splitting the tree vertically, 
sending a piece of the trunk backwards. "You don't want to be standing behind 
it when that happens," Armstrong says. "It'll take your head off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Thrill 
</P>
<P>
But successfully dispatching a big one is a thrill. Seeing a big ponderosa go 
down where you want it gives you "an adrenalin rush," Armstrong says. 
</P>
<P>
You begin to understand why at the end of the day. Dan Smith, foreman at the 
forest's Redbox Station, is tussling with the day's biggest target -- a 
120-foot dead ponderosa, with some spindly branches near the top and a 
corkscrew lightning scar around its trunk, on the edge of the Crystal Lake 
picnic grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Lightning will literally cook a tree," Dent says. "That's what kills it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith must lay the trunk along a narrow alley between a paved road and a picnic 
table. But the equipment isn't cooperating. His saw has a fit of "altitude 
sickness," pumping weakly in the thin mountain air, and then its chain hits a 
nail, embedded there long ago by a camper. With a new saw, Smith cuts into a 
wedge of rotten wood, being careful to keep the sound wood at the corners of 
his undercut. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's a deep, resonant cracking sound, then another one, and the top 
of the big tree starts to move in slow motion. Smith turns off his saw, 
carefully pulls a pair of wedges out of the widening slice in the trunk, and 
steps back. He turns to watch the tree, about 30 tons of lumber, smash into the 
ground with a ferocious thump, shaking the earth and raising a cloud of dust.

<TEXT>
<P>
Riccardo Muti is the epitome of the glamour maestro. 
</P>
<P>
This means the 47-year-old Italian conductor heads both a great orchestra and a 
great opera company, dividing his time equally between the Philadelphia 
Orchestra (which he will lead in concerts in Pasadena and Orange County this 
week) and La Scala. 
</P>
<P>
It means he can limit his guest conducting to the world's two most prestigious 
orchestras, the Vienna and Berlin philharmonics. 
</P>
<P>
It means that Muti is very, very popular. He even has two fan clubs in Japan, 
and he cannot make records fast enough to satisfy his two record companies, EMI 
and Philips. 
</P>
<P>
It means he is paid a salary (about $650,000 for 15 weeks at the Philadelphia 
Orchestra) that puts him into the stratosphere of highly paid conductors. 
</P>
<P>
And it means that Muti is a celebrity. He has a matinee idol's good looks; he 
wears Armani suits and can go nowhere, especially in Italy, without being 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it means that Muti lives in a very fast lane, and not just when he is 
speeding down the autostrada as fast as his blue Mercedes will take him between 
his home in Ravenna and his office at La Scala or jetting between Milan and 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, so busy is Muti that squeezing in an hour for an interview entails 
substantial scheduling difficulties. In the two weeks between arriving in 
Philadelphia from Italy and beginning a major United States and Japan tour with 
his Philadelphians, Muti has not only the tour programs to prepare but regular 
subscriptions concerts to be given in Philadelphia and New York, along with 
recording sessions, filming for a television documentary and endless other 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
This particular morning Muti is in a Manhattan hotel after being driven up from 
Philadelphia in the white limousine the orchestra provides for him. Following 
the interview, he has a lunch appointment and then a rehearsal for the 
Philadelphia Orchestra's evening program of Persichetti and Brahms in Carnegie 
Hall. Directly after the concert, he makes the two-hour drive back to 
Philadelphia (the hotel room is only a place for a change of clothes and maybe 
a quick nap). 
</P>
<P>
The next day Muti has an early-morning piano rehearsal, followed by two 
orchestra rehearsals and a recording session. He is currently recording cycles 
of Brahms and Scriabin symphonies and Rachmaninoff piano concertos in 
Philadelphia, Schubert and Mozart symphony cycles in Vienna, Strauss and 
Bruckner cycles in Berlin. At La Scala, he has just made the first complete 
recording of Rossini's "Guillaume Tell" (all six hours of it); a video disc of 
the controversial La Scala production will also be released. 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes, day after day, with rarely an hour to spare. And all this 
following a grueling month at La Scala, where he conducted three Mozart operas. 
</P>
<P>
How does he do it all? 
</P>
<P>
"First, you have to try to do what is possible, not the impossible," Muti 
replies. "The second thing is you have to be organized. That doesn't mean that 
organization makes the thing easier, but at least you know what you can do and 
what you cannot do." 
</P>
<P>
All of this said in the comfortable and relaxed way of someone who really is 
organized and has everything under control, no matter the maelstrom that 
surrounds him. 
</P>
<P>
It has not been the calmest of mornings. Aggravating an already relentless 
schedule, Muti has spent the morning stuck in traffic on the drive to New York. 
And it also happens to be the day Herbert von Karajan has announced his 
resignation from the Berlin Philharmonic, and Muti's name is in all the papers 
as being on the short list of likely successors for the conducting world's most 
coveted position. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't make any difference," he says of Karajan's resignation. Muti 
already has extensive recording plans with Berlin. His current Philadelphia 
contract with the 
</P>
<P>
orchestra runs through the 1992-93 season, and he treats his commitments as 
sacred. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, after nine years, he has managed to build up a considerable amount of 
good will with the musicians and the orchestra, something becoming increasingly 
rare in the orchestra life. Philadelphia audiences, finally convinced that 
there can be life after Eugene Ormandy, have come to adore him. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Muti says, he will not likely become another Ormandy, whose association 
with the Philadelphia lasted nearly half a century, or another Karajan, who 
spent 34 years as music director with the Berlin Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I don't believe that a music director should stay decades and 
decades in one place," Muti confesses. "There is a moment when the orchestra or 
when the music director himself needs different experiences." 
</P>
<P>
But now Muti is happy cherishing his hard-won victories in his attempts to 
offer Philadelphians some new experiences. When appointed music director of the 
orchestra, Muti was still considered a young, up-and-coming conductor, full of 
beans, while Philadelphia was a city encrusted in musty tradition. 
</P>
<P>
At La Scala, which Muti took over in 1986, he has shown the same strong 
determination to overcome stultifying tradition that has distinguished his 
Philadelphia tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Performing three Mozart operas -- "Nozze di Figaro," "Don Giovanni" and "Cosi 
fan Tutte" -- in March was, he says, historic. While the operas are not unknown 
in Italy, they are surprisingly uncommon, and Muti says that to perform them in 
repertory, night after night, in a fluent and natural way was quite an 
achievement for an Italian opera company. 
</P>
<P>
But Muti also points out that La Scala is perhaps the most adventurous company 
of all the world's major opera houses. He is committed to having the company 
complete Stockhausen's seven-opera cycle, "Licht," of which three operas have 
thus far been given premieres at La Scala. Muti is also determined to 
commission a new opera each season, something no other major company can come 
close to boasting. Plus he is willing to take a chance on stage directors who 
have interesting ideas. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Muti will open La Scala next season with a new Franco Rossi 
production of Verdi's "I Vespri Siciliani." Rossi, who directed a popular film 
version of "Carmen," is from Naples and has made two films on Sicily, Muti 
says. "So I thought he was the right person to re-create this feeling of 
Sicily. It's an experiment again. It will be the first time he directs opera. 
It could be good, or it could be a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Naples, where he studied at the local university before attending the 
Verdi Conservatory in Milan, Muti first attracted attention when he won the 
Guido Cantelli Competition for conductors in 1967. Two years later, at 28, he 
was appointed music director of the Maggio Musicale festival in Florence, a 
post he held for 11 years. In 1972, he succeeded Otto Klemperer as principal 
conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra in London, and he remained with the 
orchestra for 10 years, after which he was made its conductor laureate. 
</P>
<P>
Muti's reputation as a hot-blooded conductor full of fire and energy grew fast 
though concerts and recordings. But what Muti found when he began in 
Philadelphia was an orchestra that had ossified under Ormandy into an ensemble 
with a famous lush sound and no other, along with a limited repertory of the 
late-Romantic music Ormandy excelled in. He also found a concert hall, the 
Academy of Music, with unacceptably dry acoustics. And he found a city that 
liked its traditions just the way they were. 
</P>
<P>
Muti says his goal was to retain the Philadelphia orchestra's sound for music 
of the late Romantic period, but he wanted to expand the repertory, conducting 
more Classical and Baroque music and also adding more 20th-Century music. He 
also wanted to develop "sounds" that were right for those musics too. Plus, he 
insisted upon and fought for a new concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years later, Muti, who has gone on to become one of the most distinguished 
of today's conductors, has won his battles. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Orchestra now plays as varied a season as any major orchestra. 
It has an admirably extensive program for commissioning new works from American 
composers. It plays far more Haydn and Mozart and early music than it ever had. 
Muti has added concert opera to the orchestra's agenda. And, in the 1992-93 
season he will preside over the opening of a $103-million new concert hall that 
is being designed by Michael Graves. 
</P>
<P>
But Muti says that there is always more to be done. For one thing Muti would 
like to include more new music. In Italy he has championed a number of Italian 
composers, and he says that his obligation in Philadelphia is to help American 
music. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started here," he says, "I was not familiar with American music and now 
I know much more about it. But there is a lot to do in this country. Many 
composers work in universities and they are fine musicians, but they seem to 
have a life that is separate from the real world of performing. It's difficult 
for them to be performed. 
</P>
<P>
"And television doesn't help here. There is a distance, a wall, between the 
public and the composers, and I think that very much should be done. If the 
government would decide to help this situation, it would be a very great help 
to the culture." 
</P>
<P>
The situation for Italian composers in Italy, where there is more state support 
for new music, is much better, Muti says, pointing out that he recently 
premiered a new work by the avant-garde composer, Salvatore Sciarrino, which 
was televised throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know many cases in America where television will come to you and say we 
want to televise contemporary music and show it to the public?" 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Muti points with pride to all the new American works the orchestra has 
commissioned recently. (One was for Los Angeles Philharmonic 
composer-in-residence Steven Stucky's Concerto for Orchestra, which Muti 
introduced this season and which was a finalist for this year's Pulitzer Prize. 
Another was for Chinary Ung's "Inner Voices," which Dennis Russell Davies 
premiered with the orchestra in 1986 and which has just been awarded the highly 
prestigious Grawemeyer Award). 
</P>
<P>
Muti also says he insists upon including an American work on each of the 
orchestra's tours. 
</P>
<P>
Another of Muti's proud achievements with his Philadelphians is his new set of 
the nine Beethoven symphonies on EMI/Angel. Making such a recording is not 
without peril. Muti risks his performances being compared with recorded 
interpretations by the century's great conductors. He also must face 
competition from the attention-getting "authentic" performances played on 
period instruments and at Beethoven's tempos. 
</P>
<P>
As the early music movement encroaches more and more on the territory of the 
standard symphony orchestra -- Muti's Beethoven symphony performances, for 
instance, are outsold by Roger Norrington's period-instrument ones on the same 
label -- conductors of modern symphony orchestras find themselves forced to 
take some sort of stand. 
</P>
<P>
Muti says that he follows the historical research closely but that 
interpretations change from generation to generation and that there is room for 
more than one approach. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not really say that one is completely right and one is completely 
wrong," he argues. 
</P>
<P>
But Muti is also suspicious of some of the claims he hears about authentic 
performances. "You cannot re-create an entire world just by putting your hands 
on old instruments and trying to become extremely dry and play extremely fast," 
he contends. 
</P>
<P>
"The instruments are only one of the elements. We as human beings have changed 
a great deal between Beethoven and Mozart. We perform in big concerts halls. We 
dress in different ways. We travel in different ways. We eat in different ways. 
So to have a really stylistically original performance of something, old 
instruments are not enough. We should physically and spiritually go back 200 
years, or 150 years." 
</P>
<P>
Muti has, however, been in the forefront of restoring a certain degree of 
historical authenticity to Italian opera, which is perhaps the music that is 
closest to his heart. He now regularly gives the first performances of Verdi 
and Rossini operas in their new critical editions, which correct a great many 
of the errors of previous versions. But correcting errors and actually 
returning to a performing style of a century ago are, for Muti, different 
things. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, the performer has the final choice of what he wants to do. The 
critical edition doesn't mean that it's a sort of bible that you have to follow 
word by word. The freedom of the artist is still sacred." 
</P>
<P>
Muti has reached the point in his career where he can afford to take chances, 
however visible. He is also willing to take chances because the most important 
thing in making music, he says, is not to be pedestrian. 
</P>
<P>
But, then, who walks in the fast lane?

THE BILLION-DOLLAR SUMMER; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIE STUDIOS PLOT THEIR STRATEGIES IN BOX-OFFICE WARS, DREAMING OF MEGA-HITS 
IN A SUMMER OF SEQUELS

<P>
Meet James Bond -- and enjoy a fabulous weekend getaway for two to Key West, 
Fla. All you have to do is win the "License to Thrill Weekend" sweepstakes -- 
part of MGM/UA's promotion for its upcoming James Bond picture, "License to 
Kill." 
</P>
<P>
It's one of countless ploys to lure moviegoers into theaters this summer. In 
coming weeks -- and months -- studios will spend tens of millions of dollars in 
a marketing, promotion and publicity battle to sell some three dozen pictures 
scheduled to open in the 15 weeks between the Memorial Day and Labor Day 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
To some, that kind of money spent on promotion must seem shockingly wasteful. 
But with the collective budgets of this summer's movies topping $500 million, 
studio marketers are attempting to cover a huge investment. 
</P>
<P>
But won't so many titles, however glitzily promoted, flood the market? 
</P>
<P>
Art Murphy, longtime industry analyst for Daily Variety, maintains that a burst 
of exciting movies expands the marketplace. Studio marketing and publicity 
executives echo that sentiment. But they also talk nervously of "the 
competition," and of "strategies." Some even take shots at the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a kind of war," acknowledged one publicity chief, while declining to 
reveal strategic details about the promotion plans for her own films. 
</P>
<P>
The studios with the biggest summer entries at first refused to discuss their 
upcoming campaigns, partly, they said, because they didn't want to appear 
self-promoting. But as details were leaked to a reporter, they ultimately all 
cooperated -- to varying degrees -- openly worried that the competition might 
get more coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The cries for attention will clearly be loud, plentiful and even, at times, 
clever. Among the stunts you'll be seeing: 
</P>
<P>
* Kids: Stay tuned to Nickelodeon for details on how you can win a trip for you 
and your family to Tasmania. The picturesque island (south of Victoria, 
Australia) happens to be one of the settings for Warner Bros.' new film, "Young 
Einstein." 
</P>
<P>
* Want to know more about "Great Balls of Fire"? It's inevitable. Orion 
Pictures publicity staffers are making plans to take 300 VIPs, including lots 
of movie and music journalists, on a publicity junket to Memphis. That's the 
home of Jerry Lee Lewis, subject of the film, who'll be on hand to talk, along 
with cast and crew. 
</P>
<P>
* Columbia Pictures is also planning a big junket for "Ghostbusters II," to be 
held in New York City. And a glitzy benefit premiere party at the Hollywood 
Palladium. Decor will include props from the movie, such as the Ectomobile, the 
ghostbusters' equivalent of the Batmobile. 
</P>
<P>
* Speaking of which: An ominous batsymbol has been materializing on outdoor 
billboards in 10 major cities. One looms over a theater in Westwood. Countless 
others have landed on bus stop billboards across the city. In Manhattan, a 
gigantic batsign watches over Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts and marketing executives are predicting that this year's 
summer box office, which traditionally represents 38% to 40% of the annual 
income generated by movies, could be worth as much as $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe it could go higher. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran film marketer Gordon Weaver of the independent entertainment marketing 
firm the Gordon Weaver Co. summed up the possibilities: "There's a point beyond 
which no one can project. Anticipation is so high, the question this summer 
seems to be, how high is high?" 
</P>
<P>
The high hopes are directly related to the coming attractions, which include 
big stars, big budgets and a slew of sequels to monster hits. 
</P>
<P>
Kicking off the summer: Paramount Pictures' "Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade." Opening May 24 in more than 2,000 theaters, it has already been 
singled out by industry analysts as one of three big potential blockbusters. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: The last "Indy" installment was largely critically assailed, but 
still sold $175 million in tickets and set an opening weekend record of $33.9 
million over four days. (In an interview in the June issue of Premiere 
magazine, director Steven Spielberg says one of the reasons he made "III" was 
"to apologize for the second one.") 
</P>
<P>
Mega-business is also expected for "Batman" and "Ghostbusters II," the sequel 
to the most successful comedy of all time. (The 1984 title grossed $220 
million.) 
</P>
<P>
"Batman" may be a non-sequel, but it has a built-in recognition factor -- a 
50-year legacy as a comic book hero that is currently being merchandised to the 
hilt. (See accompanying stories on summer merchandising on Page 29 and history 
of "Batman" on Page 30.) With 10 sequels due in what has been dubbed "sequel 
summer," titles with audience recognition will have an instant edge over the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
According to Phil Garfinkle, executive vice president of Entertainment Data 
Inc., which tracks box-office performance on a daily basis, the summer's big 
sequels could account for $600 million to $800 million of the summer ticket 
sales. (This figure does not encompass "Batman.") 
</P>
<P>
To the great relief of many marketers -- especially those who are not in the 
sequel sweepstakes -- the titles will arrive in waves, not all at once. 
</P>
<P>
The first inundation includes "Indy," the Clint Eastwood picture "Pink 
Cadillac" and "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier." Plus "Road House," which 
sneaks into summer on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The second assault begins in mid-June, with the release of "Ghostbusters II" 
and "Batman." Then comes "The Karate Kid III" and "Great Balls of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
The third wave begins in early July and includes "Lethal Weapon 2," "License to 
Kill" (No. 16 in James Bond's never-ending adventures) and "The Abyss," the 
James Cameron-directed underwater thriller. 
</P>
<P>
A final skirmish is due in August with titles including "A Nightmare on Elm 
Street V: The Dream Child" (scary thought: the last Freddy Krueger entry 
grossed $50 million), "Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan," "The 
Return of the Musketeers" and "Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives." A 
theatrical flop, the original "Eddie," was resurrected by cable and 
videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed with all of the aforementioned will be comedies, and even 
occasional "serious" titles which will grow in number in the second half of the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if the carnival has come to town. I believe it's going to send people 
from one theater to another," said Charles O. Glen, executive vice president of 
marketing for Orion Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Devised many months ago, at the top echelons of the studios, the campaigns now 
in motion are the result of intricate studies aimed at targeting specific 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
The studies not only help shape how a film will be released, but also when it 
should be released, and in how many theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghostbusters II" and "Batman" will each open in more than 2,000 theaters. But 
the less-known "The Abyss," which lacks star names, will open slowly -- 
beginning with only two cities. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the results of the campaigns are currently on display in theater 
lobbies -- where large promotional stand-ups, called standees, vie for space. 
</P>
<P>
The one for "Great Balls of Fire" has Dennis Quaid playing a piano that has 
burst into light-up flames. The "Ghostbusters II" standee includes light-up 
phaser guns and appearances by the cute trademark ghost. 
</P>
<P>
Soon-to-arrive: a "Batman" "glider," which will hang from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "teaser" trailers -- some of which debuted at Christmas -- are being 
replaced by official trailers with film scenes. 
</P>
<P>
The one for "Indy" began running a few weeks ago, auspiciously attached to 
Paramount's surprise spring hit, "Pet Sematary." "Batman" trailers are due 
Memorial Day weekend. At the same time, between 5,000-6,000 trailers will 
surface for "The Abyss." 
</P>
<P>
As for product tie-ins: There's an "Indiana Jones"-Pepsi Cola sweepstakes and 
"Roadhouse" contests involving La Batt's Beer and a men's apparel line. 
</P>
<P>
To tap into the family audience, Disney's "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" will have 
a McDonald's promotion. The studio's reissue of "Peter Pan" will have tie-ins 
with Peter Pan Peanut Butter and Wonder Bread. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be "Ghostbusters II"/Coca-Cola promos. (Columbia is 49% owned by 
Coke.) And the film will have tie-ins with the Hardee's fast-food chain, Fuji 
Film and Ralston Purina. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to over-commercialize," stressed Buffy Shutt, president of 
marketing for Columbia. "The idea isn't to meet someone who says, 'Well, I 
bought the cookware, but I don't want to see the movie.' " 
</P>
<P>
"The key is to make your movie accessible," declared Barry London, president of 
distribution and marketing for Paramount's motion picture group. 
</P>
<P>
For instance: 
</P>
<P>
* Orion is touting "Great Balls of Fire" for its rock 'n' roll heritage. 
(Enthused Glen: "Rock 'n' roll was Jerry Lee Lewis, and Dennis Quaid is Jerry 
Lee." ) Indeed, Sam Phillips, who founded the legendary Sun Records, Lewis' 
early label, is involved in the film's publicity. 
</P>
<P>
* MGM/UA is stressing that this year younger audiences can relate to "a more 
realistic" James Bond. "It's ('License to Kill') not as far-fetched," said 
Barry Lorie, senior vice president of marketing. "This time, the bad guy is a 
drug dealer." 
</P>
<P>
* Warners chose to lasso the country market for its Eastwood film, "Pink 
Cadillac," by wining and dining some 100 country music disc jockeys earlier 
this week at Harrah's in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
According to Joe Hyams, senior vice president for special projects, the plan -- 
which included a screening and a chance to talk with Eastwood, co-star 
Bernadette Peters and some of the sound-track artists -- was similar to one 
that proved a success for Eastwood's 1978 film, "Every Which Way but Loose." 
</P>
<P>
* For "Karate Kid III," Columbia is taking stars Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita 
on a tour of some 20 key cities. (This film series may promote a benign 
philosophy, but it's proven a box-office killer -- with combined grosses of 
$214 million. "II" also has the distinction of having outgrossed the original 
"Karate Kid.") 
</P>
<P>
* Paramount Pictures regularly stays in touch with Trekkies -- the better to 
promote its "Star Trek" series. Three weeks ago at a Trekkie gathering in 
Denver, none other than executive producer Harve Bennett showed up to talk 
"Star Trek V." 
</P>
<P>
For audience awareness, it would seem hard to top "Ghostbusters II" and 
"Batman." In fact, a showdown is looming, since the films open just one week 
apart. ("Ghostbusters II" has a one-week jump on "Batman.") 
</P>
<P>
Both films are currently grappling for major national magazine covers. Both 
films will have music and video tie-ins. Both even have hot cars! (To that, a 
Warners rep quipped, "Yeah, and we'll race them any day.") 
</P>
<P>
Briefly, here's how the promo bout looks: 
</P>
<P>
In the "Ghostbusters II" corner: 
</P>
<P>
It will be hot pop/R&amp;B star Bobby Brown doing songs for the "Ghostbusters 
II" sound track (on MCA Records), along with Run-D.M.C., who will do a rap 
cover version of Ray Parker Jr's. infamous "Ghostbusters" theme, "Who You Gonna 
Call?" 
</P>
<P>
There will be MTV "Ghostbusters II" promos -- including a giveaway in which 
someone will win the Ectomobile. (The winner has to make it driver safe.) 
</P>
<P>
Plus the junket -- which will be attended by the entire Ghostbusters gang. 
</P>
<P>
And "lots of TV things that we'd like to keep quiet about, for now," said an 
informed spokeswoman, who added, "You really do want to watch your competition, 
and not tell them too much." 
</P>
<P>
(If Columbia appears to be exhaustively promoting "Ghostbusters II," it's 
because the studio has seemed to be asleep this past year. Its top-grossing 
title of 1988, "Punchline," earned a measly $21 million at the box office. 
"Ghostbusters II" along with "Karate Kid III" could revive one of Hollywood's 
legendary studios.) 
</P>
<P>
As for the "Batman" corner: 
</P>
<P>
It will be Prince doing songs for "Batman," on the Warner Records sound track. 
Also from the Purple One: "Batdance," an original song with dialogue from the 
film that is his "ode to the movie" (but not included in it). 
</P>
<P>
MTV will do a "Batman" promo throughout the month of June -- complete with 
contests in which someone will win, yes!, a replica of the Batmobile. (It does 
not have a drive train.) 
</P>
<P>
An air date also will be announced for a "Making of Batman" documentary -- "a 
hotly contested item," claimed Rob Friedman, president of worldwide advertising 
and publicity. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be a big publicity junket; Jack Nicholson -- a.k.a. The Joker 
-- will be the only principal who won't participate. (He's at work on "Two 
Jakes.") 
</P>
<P>
And a gala Westwood premiere -- with the Batmobile on view. 
</P>
<P>
During interviews for this story, several executives at competing studios 
expressed concern about Warners' "Lethal Weapon 2." 
</P>
<P>
And Warners' Friedman did some gloating. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: "Lethal Weapon 2" scored amazingly high in early testing. It is 
also generating "buzz" throughout the industry for being better than the 
original -- "more accessible." 
</P>
<P>
Said one executive (who did not want to be named, "because I'm not about to let 
my name be used to promote another studio's film"): "The first film was such a 
huge cassette picture. That's a tough thing to fight." 
</P>
<P>
According to Alexander &amp; Associates, a weekly tracking service, from 
October 1987 to the present there have been more than 26 million rental 
transactions involving "Lethal Weapon." And that is just a U.S. figure; it does 
not include Canada. Moreover, that figure reflects households. Additionally, 
there have been about 250,000 units sold. 
</P>
<P>
All of which could mean a secret weapon in the summer line-up. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Easily the major curiosity of the season, Fox's "The Abyss" was filmed under 
super-secrecy at the never-completed Cherokee Nuclear Power Station outside 
Gaffney, S. C. An estimated 40% of the live-action principal photography takes 
place underwater. 
</P>
<P>
James Cameron is the writer-director; Gale Anne Hurd is the producer. They're 
the critically admired duo responsible for "The Terminator" and "Aliens." 
</P>
<P>
Heading the ensemble cast: Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael 
Biehn, in a story about a team of divers whose work on a manned underwater 
oil-drilling habitat leads them to an alien presence. 
</P>
<P>
But two previous underwater films -- "Deep Star Six" and "Leviathan" -- 
recently flopped. 
</P>
<P>
Do moviegoers really care about what lies fathoms below? 
</P>
<P>
"I could only draw one analogy to that -- and that's 'Big,' " said Tom Sherak, 
president of domestic distribution and marketing at 20th Century-Fox. 
</P>
<P>
(A runaway hit for Fox, "Big" was the fourth in a series of "body-switch" 
films, following "Like Father, Like Son," "Vice Versa" and "Eighteen Again.") 
</P>
<P>
Added Sherak: "Look, it's going to be hard this summer for any picture that's 
not a sequel, and that doesn't have big stars. 
</P>
<P>
"So we're not going to overdo it. We're going to open the film slowly, 
beginning with L.A. and New York." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't want to talk marketing tactics: "But we just may decide to call our 
movie, 'The Abyss II.' " 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Pictures will release "Dead Poet's Society," a drama starring Robin 
Williams as an inspirational teacher, opposite "Star Trek V." 
</P>
<P>
"We are clearly counterprogramming," said Bob Levin, director of worldwide 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Disney is counting on Williams' popularity, and his Oscar-nominated performance 
in "Good Morning, Vietnam," to be a come-on. 
</P>
<P>
With a nod to "Bull Durham," the adult-themed film from Orion, which grossed 
$50 million last summer, Levin added: "I think there's been ample proof that 
some moviegoers want something fresh. There's no question that what we've got 
is going to be different from the norm." 
</P>
<P>
The most serious title on the summer slate? Undoubtedly Columbia's "Casualties 
of War." A Vietnam drama directed by Brian De Palma, it stars Michael J. Fox 
and Sean Penn. 
</P>
<P>
So how will Columbia sell it? 
</P>
<P>
For starters, said a studio source, "We aren't going to pull any punches. Our 
campaign is going to reflect the film." A trailer is now being made: "It will 
convince you that Michael J. Fox can have extraordinary credibility as a 
serious actor. 
</P>
<P>
"The next step will be getting audiences to want to 'see serious.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Marketing may get moviegoers out to opening weekends. But at that point, the 
movie itself becomes the marketing tool. 
</P>
<P>
For better or for worse. 
</P>
<P>
As Art Murphy put it: "Once you get your big crowd, it's up to them. 
</P>
<P>
"If they like what they see, you'll have an army our there working for you. If 
the movie disappoints, you've got an army of guerrilla terrorists working 
against you."

THE MARKETING: A SUMMER CRUSADE FOR BAT DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY JENEL SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holy merchandising dollars, Batman! 
</P>
<P>
When the Caped Crusader swoops into movie theaters this summer, he won't be 
empty-handed. He'll be hauling along a cargo of products mighty enough to 
satisfy the ego of any superhero. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, despite competition from such notables as Indiana Jones, the 
Ghostbusters, and Peter Pan, Batman is already being called the sure -- and 
easy -- victor in this summer's movie merchandising sweepstakes by toy industry 
analysts, retail store buyers and memorabilia dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The Batman product blowout runs the gamut, from everyday movie tie-ins like 
posters, key chains and automobile sunshades to imaginative goodies including a 
$150 motorized ride-on Batmobile for kids. 
</P>
<P>
On their way to stores this summer are Batman Nintendo games, Batman walkie 
talkies, Batman shirts, robes, pajamas -- even Batman boxer shorts -- and 
Batman costumes ranging from $6 vinyl hooded capes to $200-plus Bat wear 
fashioned along the lines of Michael Keaton's film wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Toy Biz company is putting out a Batman line that includes 
plastic replicas of the movie's rocket-launching Batwing aircraft ($15.25) and 
ultra high-tech Bat Cave ($17.95). 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there's much more. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 24 companies who have deals with Warner Bros. to produce 
items in conjunction with the Batman movie, D.C. Comics has licensed 101 
companies in the United States and Canada to manufacture products in honor of 
the Caped Crusader's 50th birthday this year. 
</P>
<P>
It may well be that comic-book Batman, clad in his classic blue-and-gray gear, 
turns out to be the toughest competition for Batman, the all-in-black film 
star. Both Batmen, however, face some dynamic challengers, including: 
</P>
<P>
* Indiana Jones. With "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" set for a May 24 
opening, Indy is about to become quite a ubiquitous guy around supermarkets and 
convenience stores participating in the Pepsi company's summerlong "Indiana 
Jones" contest/promotion. Giveaways include a trip for two to Venice or Egypt, 
"adventure kits" (complete with khaki-colored Indy watches, soft drink coolers, 
visors, sweat bands and radios), adventurous Indy-style jackets and Stetson 
hats and movie posters. 
</P>
<P>
For those who would rather buy their Indy gear outright, some similar items 
will be available through retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
* Ghostbusters. Although "Ghostbusters II" movie tie-in items including fabric 
"Ghostbusters" costumes ($14.99) and vinyl "Slimer" duds ($5.99) are expected 
to appear in stores by summer's end, the real powerhouse "Ghostbusters" line is 
already on the shelves. Kenner's "The Real Ghostbusters" cartoon show tie-ins 
comprised an $80 million toy line in 1988. With some additional products, it's 
expected to grow to $100 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
* Peter Pan. Sears has an exclusive deal to sell "Peter Pan" products in 
conjunction with the re-release of the 1953 Disney classic. The company expects 
to have "Peter Pan" items including dolls and plush toys ($10-$20) and 
children's apparel ($5.33-$20) in stores by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
* Babar. In terms of movie merchandise, the dark horse of the summer may turn 
out to be an elephant. "Babar is a 56-year-old classic character who has never 
really been exploited, until now," notes Stanford Blum, executive vice 
president of the Toronto-based Nelvana Entertainment. Nelvana ("The Care 
Bears") plans to open its animated "Babar: The Movie" in 800 theaters 
nationwide July 28. The company also has a commitment for 65 episodes of HBO's 
twice-a-week "Babar" series, which debuted April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Nelvana has licensed some 40 U.S. manufacturers and 60 foreign companies to 
produce a truly elephantine quantity of Babar toys and other goods. Since it 
views Babar as "a yuppie property," says Blum, the firm began its product 
launch at department stores on the level of Bloomingdale's and Neiman Marcus, 
pushing plush toys (priced at up to a very plush $500), lead crystal, jewelry, 
linen and other upscale items. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Babar will lumber into more common territory with less pricey 
</P>
<P>
merchandise as well as personal appearances at shopping centers and malls 
across the country. "We have 20 Babar costumes and they're all booked for the 
summer," reports Blum. 
</P>
<P>
And if that's not enough to place Babar in the collective consciousness of Los 
Angeles residents, Nelvana has also orchestrated a June 28 event at the L.A. 
Zoo in which a newly "adopted" elephant will be named King Babar.

MAN BEHIND THE MASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT H. BROESKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is that masked man? 
</P>
<P>
Briefly, the saga of Batman -- subject of one of this summer's 
most-talked-about movies -- goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
* It is 1938, and Superman is the most popular character at DC Comics. But, 
they'd like another . . . Bob Kane, an 18-year-old artist who once worked for 
Max Fleisher Studios (home of Popeye and Betty Boop), is asked to come up with 
one. Kane thinks about a Leonardo da Vinci drawing he once saw, of a man 
wearing bat-like wings. And he recalls favorite childhood movies, "The Mark of 
Zorro" and "The Bat." He gets to drawing. 
</P>
<P>
* The Batman debuts in May of 1939, in Detective Comics 27. The cover shows the 
caped figure chasing a bad guy across rooftops. Inside: a six-page story about 
"bored young socialite" Bruce Wayne, who is -- by night -- "a weird menace to 
crime." Later that year, another Detective Comics story explores The Batman's 
past: His parents were killed before his eyes when he was just a lad. Now, he 
constantly seeks revenge. 
</P>
<P>
* In April of 1940, Robin the Boy Wonder-sidekick appears. And Batman, who's 
also acquired an adversary named The Joker, gets his own comic. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1943, "Batman" becomes a Columbia serial. Lewis Wilson stars opposite J. 
Carrol Naish who plays a Japanese agent. Six years later, there's a sequel. In 
"Batman and Robin," Robert Lowery, who plays Batman, has a tough time seeing 
through the little eye slits in his bat mask. 
</P>
<P>
* Flash forward a decade. Batman is now the scoutmaster-type. He's also taken a 
back seat to DC "stars" like The Green Lantern and Flash. 
</P>
<P>
* Jan. 12, 1966: ABC airs a campy new Wednesday night TV series. "Batman," 
starring Adam West, becomes a phenomenon and generates $150 million in assorted 
merchandising. As a result of all this, the Batman of the comics goes campy, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
* 1970: The TV series is history, but Batman continues, with some help from 
artist Neal Adams and writer Denny O'Neil, who restore him to his past glory. 
That is: once again he's a dark avenger. 
</P>
<P>
* August 1981: Producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber announce they plan to make 
the "Batman" movie. Peters is asked, "Will Adam West be involved?" His 
response: "Who's Adam West?" 
</P>
<P>
* In 1986, the sleepy world of comics awakens with a start -- as "The Dark 
Knight Returns." The Warner Books trade paperback (today in its seventh 
printing), which was originally a four-comic series, is by Frank Miller. Miller 
has an aging and embittered Batman coming out of retirement in a decaying 
Gotham City. It is, says one critic, "a comic literature for the Age of 
Anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
* September, 1988: Warner Bros. officially announces that production will begin 
on "Batman," starring Nicholson as The Joker and Michael Keaton as Batman. 
Michael Keaton? Produced by Guber-Peters, the film will be directed by comedy 
meister Tim Burton ("Beetlejuice"). Tim Burton? Ardent Batfans begin worrying. 
</P>
<P>
* Immediately following Warner's announcement, the Comic Buyer's Guide -- the 
industry trade, which reaches everyone from creators to retailers -- is deluged 
with mail protesting the movie. 
</P>
<P>
* On November 29, 1988, a Wall Street Journal headline reads: "Batman Fans Fear 
the Joke's on Them." To counteract the concerns, Warner sends Batman creator 
Kane, now 68, on the road. At comics conventions, Kane cheerleads the movie, 
"which will be a serious 'Batman.' " And he asks the fans to "give Keaton a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
* February 1989: Shooting wraps. Warner's massive PR campaign gets under way. 
As for the protesting Batfans: Maggie Thompson, co-editor of Comic Buyer's 
Guide, says they've had a change of heart. She credits Warner's special promos 
at comics conventions with "turning the thing around." Now, said Thompson, 
"We're just biting our nails in concern over the quality of the execution." 
</P>
<P>
* April 1989: Kane predicts Batman, which opens June 23, will make "$250 
million worldwide or better . . . I feel it." Some industry analysts have a 
similar feeling. Meanwhile, because the film's massive sets are still intact at 
Pinewood Studios in London, talk of a sequel persists. PAT H. BROESKE

'INTERACTING' AT THE GETTY;

<P>
MUSEUM AIMS TO PLEASE VISITORS WITH NEW WAYS TO LEARN ABOUT ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Clustered in the dark, visitors at the J. Paul Getty Museum watch a colorful 
slide show describing how an ancient Roman villa was buried by the volcanic 
wrath of Mt. Vesuvius. The glorious Villa dei Papiri, they learn, acted as the 
architectural model for the Getty. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs in a hands-on gallery, Pauline Chambers and her two sons look through 
an original 19th-Century view camera. An instructor extends its accordion-like 
bellows to show how early photographers found their focus. 
</P>
<P>
In a cubicle nearby, Alma Ruiz and two friends gaze at a 13-inch video screen, 
transfixed. Centuries-old artworks, reproduced with the latest laser-disc 
technology, flash before their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it. I think it's very informative," said Ruiz, using the Getty's new 
"interactive" video about illuminated manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
By tapping the screen with a finger, visitors advance the video's images, 
allowing them the otherwise forbidden luxury of leafing through the fragile 
artworks page by page. Users may also learn all about the books, from how they 
were bound to the meaning of their miniature illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
The recent installation of the video, like the debut of the Getty's hands-on 
gallery and introductory slide show, is part of a revamped educational program, 
one which is now coming into full operation after about five years' work, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to find ways to help people -- who need and want the help -- to 
understand and enjoy the works in our collection. That's the bottom line," said 
Bret Waller, associate director in charge of education and public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty's educational program was "very modest" when director John Walsh 
hired Waller in 1985 to begin the improvement process, Walsh said recently. "It 
was a kind of home-grown thing, well done, but not even scratching the surface 
of its potential." 
</P>
<P>
Restructuring, reorganizing and restaffing, Waller and his staff have addressed 
a range of needs, from tours to help visitors find their way around, to bigger 
art history classes, to gallery talks on the art of appreciating fine art. 
</P>
<P>
But the world's wealthiest museum had an obligation that went beyond its own 
audience, Walsh and others thought. Its resources should be used to find 
innovative ways to enrich visitors' trips -- such as a $280,000 interactive 
video -- that could serve as models for museums internationally. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty introduced it's first interactive video in 1986, a tape concerning 
its Greek vase collection. Many other museums use such teaching tools but the 
Getty's videos are more advanced, reproducing detail with greater precision, 
and they contain more information, Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had visits from at least a dozen museum professionals to look at (the 
Greek vase video) and see what they can learn from it -- how much it cost, how 
much time was involved in making it, how you hire an outside firm to produce 
it, as we did," Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
Public education has begun to command more attention -- and funding -- at 
museum's nationwide, said David Ebitz, the Getty's head of education and 
academic affairs. And it will continue to do so in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a limit on what you can acquire, a limit on what's left in private 
hands," he said. "You can't build much more, so you turn to education" and 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
To discover what their own museum browsers need to deepen their experience of 
art, Getty officials have conducted several studies as well as evaluations to 
gauge the success of their efforts. (Along with 10 other museums nationwide, 
they've also held revealing visitor focus groups. See adjoining story.) 
</P>
<P>
The illuminated manuscripts video, which features live action sequences and 
most of the Getty's manuscripts collection spanning the 5th to the 16th 
centuries, attracted one viewer after another on a recent Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's hands-on gallery was popular too. Like the video's Browsing Room 
(also a place to read about museum collections), this "Information Center" is 
small and often cramped. But administrators "pushed ahead" with such projects 
partly because they are considered experiments for the Getty's new expanded 
Brentwood museum, slated for completion in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The center will always contain displays that relate to a current exhibit and 
will be staffed with a gregarious educator ready to demonstrate how the items 
on view operate. 
</P>
<P>
"The First Golden Age, 1851-1889," a photography show, is the theme of its 
current display that charts the early days of the medium. Its objects include a 
19th-Century view camera, tinted stereographs -- the first three-dimensional 
images -- and a stereoscope to see them with. 
</P>
<P>
Educator Sara Cannon encouraged visitors to try out the equipment as she 
answered their questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to have people interact (with the materials) and learn about 
photography, then go into the gallery with greater appreciation of technique 
and artistry," said Cannon, a USC graduate student. "This is one of the few 
hands-on interactive gallery spaces for adults in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Peering into a stereoscope, visitor Diane Faust said she preferred the approach 
over the old stop, look and linger method. "It's boring," she said, " if you 
just walk around."

SPANISH LESSONS

My colleague Bill Stern penned an article a decade or more ago maintaining 
flatly that there were no Italian restaurants in America. His point was that, 
though there were certainly plenty of places that called themselves Italian, 
and though some of these restaurants might well serve very good food, not one 
of them genuinely resembled the restaurants he had come to know and love in 
Italy. Today, there are plenty of authentic Italian restaurants in America; we 
have come a long way in that regard. But Stern's old point might very well be 
adapted today to restaurants purporting to serve the food of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
California has a particular problem in defining its Spanish restaurants -- 
because Californians have historically considered Spanish and Mexican cooking 
to be more or less identical. Consider this rather confusing passage from Craig 
Davidson's "Dining Out in Hollywood and Los Angeles," published in 1949: 
"Californians love their hot Spanish-Mexican food," wrote Davidson, "and it is 
possible to get into innumerable arguments with Angelenos over . . . which is 
the best Spanish restaurant in town. El Cholo is vigorously presented as one of 
the tops in Spanish dishes. . ." 
</P>
<P>
One of the first restaurants in Los Angeles -- if not the first -- to serve an 
approximation of real Spanish food was the Matador, on Pico Boulevard in West 
L.A., which opened in 1958. In that establishment's early days, recalls its 
proprietor, William Fremont, "at least 25% of (the) patrons . . . came to the 
restaurant, munched on the complimentary tapas that were on the table and . . . 
ate up all the crispy bread with butter. Then, reading the menu in disbelief, 
they called me over and asked in an angry voice how I dared call this a Spanish 
menu -- where were the tacos, the enchiladas, etc.? The customers (then) 
stormed out of the restaurant. Leaving their car on our lot, they walked across 
the street to have dinner at the Cafe Escobar, which proudly displayed a 20x6 
sign on the roof: 'Fine Spanish Cuisine'. " 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that, despite certain obvious exchanges of influence and of raw 
materials, Mexican and Spanish cooking today 
</P>
<P>
resemble each other about as much as the cooking of Lyon resembles that of New 
Orleans -- which is to say not very much at all. Even the terminology has 
different meanings: A tortilla is an omelete in Spain, for instance. A tostada 
is a piece of toast. A taco is (among other things) a billiard cue. 
</P>
<P>
Integrating elements of Roman, Moorish, Germanic, Italian and French cooking 
styles, Spain has developed a veritable panoply of regional cooking idioms, 
ranging from agreeable peasant dishes to truly sophisticated cuisines. 
</P>
<P>
At a good, medium-range restaurant in Spain today, for instance, the diner 
might encounter such things as mountain ham as good as Italy's best prosciutto; 
raw sea urchins or goose barnacles just out of the water; simply grilled giant 
prawns (gambas) moistened with olive oil; sweet little red piquillo peppers 
stuffed with mousse of hake or salt cod; fresh brood eels or angulas, sizzling 
in olive oil; rabbit or quail braised with chestnuts; snails stewed with ham, 
potatoes, red wine and a whole handful of fresh herbs; grilled goat chops with 
sherry vinegar and mint; hearty ragouts of beans and sausage and the 
pot-au-feu-like boiled dinners; a whole treasury of great rice dishes, from the 
arroz brut or "dirty rice" of Marjorca to the real country paella of the 
Valencia region; and above all fish, fish, fish -- superbly fresh, deep-fried, 
grilled, roasted, baked in a crust of salt . . . 
</P>
<P>
Where are such dishes in the Spanish restaurants of the U.S. today? In very 
short supply, that's where. And I haven't even mentioned the more 
sophisticated, contemporary fare available in Spain's best restaurants -- for 
instance baby sole with minced green beans and baby shrimp at Eldorado Petit in 
Barcelona; lamb chops stuffed with sweetbreads and fresh thyme at Arzak in San 
Sebastian; sea bass tartar and pigs' feet stuffed with ground lamb at Zalacain 
in Madrid (which recently became the first Michelin three-star restaurant in 
Spain). 
</P>
<P>
While diners in Spain itself sit down to food like this, must we continue to 
make do, in our own Spanish restaurants, with the chunky tomato juice that goes 
by the name of gazpacho hereabouts, with roasted peppers and San Jose-made 
sausage, with paella made with the wrong kind of rice? Well, yes. Apparently. 
For now. Spanish cooking in Los Angeles -- in the United States in general -- 
awaits its Rex, its Valentino, even its Pane Caldo or its Prego. . .

THE PAELLA PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just as Italian restaurants in America used to drown their pastas in an excess 
of sauce, Spanish restaurants in this country tend to overload their paellas 
with shellfish, vegetables, chicken and such. 
</P>
<P>
In the region of Valencia, where it was born, paella, in common with Italy's 
risotto, is a rice dish with a bit of something else for flavoring -- not some 
sort of show-off seafood dish served on an almost accidental bed of rice. The 
original paella Valenciana involved no seafood at all; it was an inland dish, 
made with chicken, rabbit, beans and, sometimes, snails. 
</P>
<P>
The rice used for paella should be -- must be -- short-grained, preferably the 
variety grown around Valencia or on the Costa Brava. You can't make risotto 
with long-grained rice, and you can't make a proper paella with it, either. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Rodriguez at From Spain and Eduardo Apitz at Tasca both put too many 
superfluous ingredients in their paella. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, in addition, makes his with long-grained rice. The only 
short-grained kinds he can find here, he says -- even Italian risotto rice -- 
make the paella too mushy. For his part, Apitz uses a mixture of about 70% 
short-grained pearl rice and 30% long-grained rice. He agrees that 
short-grained rice alone turns mushy. Maybe so, but Valencian rice is now sold 
in the U.S. -- and if that's the only kind that works, then any local Spanish 
restaurant that wants to be taken seriously should get ahold of some. COLMAN

ARGUING THE RACE OF 'THE MOST FASCINATING FIGURE IN HISTORY'

Stanford's claim of Greek/Macedonian/Iranian (Persian) ancestry for Cleopatra 
is historically accurate. Her Ptolemaic ancestry (Greek/Macedonian) goes back 
to Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great; she was also 
descended from the Seleucid dynasty of Persia. No historian has discovered any 
trace of African blood in either the Seleucids or Ptolemies. 
</P>
<P>
Just because Cleopatra's father was depicted as black doesn't make him so: Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. has been called the second coming of Gandhi, but does 
that make him Indian? 
</P>
<P>
It may interest Kiela Jamal to know that Osiris is a god of vegetation, and as 
such has been depicted with green skin.

CSUN A LOSS FROM ELIMINATION IN SOFTBALL REGIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge's "Drive for Five" is still alive, but the engine is 
sputtering and one of the wheels fell off Saturday in the NCAA Division II 
women's softball Western regional at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors, in search of their fifth Division II softball title, are one 
game from elimination after dropping a 10-inning, 3-2 decision to 
defending-national champion Bakersfield in the double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (61-18), the top-ranked team in Division II, will have to win three 
consecutive games today to advance to Saturday's division finals in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors will meet Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at noon, and the winner 
will face Bakersfield at 2 p.m. for the regional championship. Because 
Bakersfield won both of its games Saturday, the Roadrunners (34-22) can afford 
one defeat and still advance to the regional final. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Northridge won its opening game, defeating Dominguez Hills, 6-0, 
behind the two-hit pitching of junior All-American Debbie Dickmann, then met 
Bakersfield, a 5-4 winner over San Luis Obispo in its opening game. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Coach Gary Torgeson started Heather Lindstrom against the Roadrunners, but 
Dickmann found herself on the mound when the game was decided. With the score 
tied, 2-2, in the 10th inning, both teams started the inning with runners at 
second base under the international tiebreaker rule. 
</P>
<P>
Dickmann retired the first two Roadrunners in the inning, but Leean Couch's 
infield single and an intentional walk to Barb Santa Cruz loaded the bases. 
Dara Ferris then lined a single to center field to drive in Lisa Uranday with 
the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Lindstrom started quickly, retiring the first six batters, but the freshman ran 
into trouble in the third inning, part of it her own making. 
</P>
<P>
Anna Martin led off with a single, and, after a pop out, took off for second 
base on Margie McCune's tap to the mound. Lindstrom threw high to second, 
pulling Anna Getherall off the bag and putting Roadrunners at first and second. 
</P>
<P>
The runners held on Tonya Warren's fly out, but Couch doubled down the 
left-field line, scoring two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Lindstrom worked out of the inning, leaving the bases loaded, and CSUN came 
back to tie the score in the top of the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Erickson, the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. MVP, led off with a 
single and Getherall reached on an error, putting runners at first and second. 
Leilani Artis bunted the runners over, and Char Schmitt walked to load the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Smith followed with a line single to left to tie the score, 2-2, but 
Bakersfield's Margaret Harvey (11-9) worked out of the jam. 
</P>
<P>
Dickmann (29-7) relieved Lindstrom in the seventh and allowed only two infield 
singles heading into the decisive 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge appeared to be in good shape when Erickson led off the top of the 
10th with an infield single, putting runners at first and third. But 
Getherall's bunt was caught by Harvey, who fired to third to double up 
pinch-runner Jennifer Miller. Moments later, Erickson was called out for 
leaving first too soon, and CSUN had run itself out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"When I took over the program four years ago, we were intimidated by 
Northridge. But we don't feel that way at all now," Bakersfield Coach Kathy 
Welter said. "I'm certainly glad we don't have to be the one to win three in a 
row." 
</P>
<P>
Said Torgeson: "I'm not counting us out. We've been in this situation before." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Lady Matadors lost their opening game in the 1985 and '87 
regionals, according to Torgeson, but each time rallied to win a national 
title.

CS NORTHRIDGE UNCERTAIN OF PLAYOFF BERTH AFTER 9-6 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge baseball team was looking forward to an opportunity to 
determine its postseason destiny. 
</P>
<P>
But after the Matadors dropped a 9-6 decision to Cal State Dominguez Hills on 
Saturday in their final regularly scheduled California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. game, they left their future, or lack of same, in the hands of a 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
The loss at Dominguez Hills made unnecessary a makeup game between Northridge 
and conference-champion Cal Poly San Luis Obispo today. It also put the 
second-place Matadors in a tenuous position. 
</P>
<P>
Today at 3 p.m., a six-member committee will conduct a conference call to 
choose the three teams that will participate in the NCAA Division II West 
regional, which will begin next Friday at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo has earned the automatic bid into the regional by virtue of its 
CCAA title. Cal State Sacramento, an independent that has been ranked in the 
top 10 all season, is also considered a shoo-in. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the committee to decide between San Francisco State (30-20), which 
won the Northern California Athletic Conference, and Northridge (30-19-1). 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way in the world that anybody can put together an argument that 
says San Francisco State had a better year than Cal State Northridge," 
Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
Kernen may be biased, but he is probably right. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was 9-6 against Division I opponents, including wins over 
playoff-bound Fresno State, Pepperdine and USC. San Francisco State was 1-11 
against Division I teams. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco State also played 13 games against Division III schools and 
members of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics. Northridge played 
three games against Division III and NAIA schools. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the conferences also would seem to favor the Matadors. Unlike 
the CCAA, the NCAC champion does not receive an automatic bid into the 
regional. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody understands that this is the most difficult (Division II) 
league in the country," Kernen said of the CCAA. "It's been proven year after 
year that champions come out of here." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the CCAA has placed two representatives in the regional several times, 
including 1984 when Northridge finished second in the conference standings 
behind Chapman, then went on to win the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday against Dominguez Hills, right-hander Robert Wheatcroft (11-3) spotted 
the Toros nine runs in 2 2/3 innings before he was replaced by Dan Cory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm jinxed against that team," said Wheatcroft, who was knocked out in the 
second inning the last time he faced Dominguez Hills. "I can't do anything 
right against them." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dominguez Hills pitchers David Haggard and Rick Davis did little 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Haggard, a senior right-hander, earned his first win in eight decisions by 
allowing two runs through five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a senior right-hander making his first relief appearance, replaced 
Haggard in the sixth in an attempt to break the CCAA single-season strikeout 
record of 170 set in 1970 by Mike Wiley of Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Davis (7-7), needing six strikeouts to tie the record, struck out the side in 
the sixth and got two more in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
He then gave up four runs on four hits in the ninth before breaking the record 
by striking out Anton Siegl for the first out and Greg Shockey to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills (16-29-2, 11-18-1 in conference play) scored three runs in the 
first inning on a bases-loaded triple by Vic Fresca, then scored six more runs 
in the third with help from Wheatcroft, who surrendered a two-out, run-scoring 
single to Lenny Hokanson, then walked in two runs before Robert Campbell drove 
in two more with a bases-loaded single.

ARREOLA RETAINS 3 CCAA TITLES BUT CSUN WOMEN SETTLE FOR 2ND

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many athletes would have been elated after winning two individual titles at the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. track and field championships. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy Arreola of Cal State Northridge, however, was disappointed with the form 
that had gained her a pair of victories. 
</P>
<P>
So she entered -- and won -- the 3,000 meters Saturday and emerged with a third 
title to go with victories in the 1,500 and 800. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't plan on running the three," Arreola said. "But I ran so crappy in the 
other races that I wanted to. I felt like I had to punish myself." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, however, vented the brunt of her frustration on her opponents. She 
broke away from Tina Colebrook of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with 1,000 meters 
left to win the 3,000 in 9 minutes, 28.82 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge junior ran 4:19.47 in the 1,500 and 2:07.32 in the 800 and won 
female athlete of the meet honors for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, the defending NCAA Division II champion in the 1,500 and 3,000, has 
won eight CCAA track titles in her career. She won the 800 and 1,500 as a 
freshman in 1987 and has won the 800, 1,500 and 3,000 in each of the past two 
CCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
Her performances led Northridge to a second-place finish in the team standings 
behind host San Luis Obispo, which won its ninth consecutive CCAA title with 
229 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors scored 170 points and were followed by Cal Poly Pomona (92), 
Cal State Bakersfield (58), Chapman (10) and UC Riverside (8). 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Jeffries of Northridge won the 100 (10.64) and 200 (21.21) and placed 
third in the 110-meter high hurdles (14.23) in the men's meet. His individual 
efforts, however, did not prevent Cal State Los Angeles from winning its fourth 
consecutive conference title. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles, buoyed by Jesus Gutierrez's victories in the 5,000 and 
10,000, totaled 166 points. San Luis Obispo was second with 142, followed by 
Northridge (125), Pomona (114), Bakersfield (86) and Riverside (13). Chapman 
did not score in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola's victory in the 3,000 -- she won by almost six seconds -- may have 
been the least impressive of her three wins. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1,500, she broke away with 600 meters remaining to win by more than 11 
seconds, and in the 800, she took command with 300 meters remaining and won by 
more than four seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Her successful triple further inspired Northridge Coach Don Strametz, who 
intends to enter her in the 1,500, 3,000 and 5,000 at the NCAA Division II 
championships in Hampton, Va., May 24-27. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, who was vehemently opposed to an NCAA triple three weeks ago, has 
softened her stance. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to enter me in all three events," she said. "But I'm still not 
convinced that I'll run all three." 
</P>
<P>
Although Arreola was the standout of the women's meet, she had plenty of 
support from teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Laural Isles won the 100 in 12.00 seconds, placed second in the 200 (wind-aided 
24.7) and ran the opening legs on the Lady Matadors' victorious 400 (47.62) and 
1,600 (3:49.81) relay teams. 
</P>

Coaches of the four volleyball teams left in the City Section 4-A Division 
playoffs agreed Saturday to continue to direct their teams even if teachers 
strike Monday against Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>

Chatsworth High Coach Steve Berk made the announcement after a morning meeting, 
saying that he will honor picket lines during the day but join his team for 
practice and matches this week. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth will play host to Taft in one semifinal Tuesday at 7 p.m., and 
Westchester will play at Palisades at 4 p.m. in the other. The final is

CALLED STRIKE COULD END SEASON BUT LESSONS LEARNED MAY LINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troubled City Section coaches who have agonized over their options as Monday's 
strike date approaches should take heart. If nothing else turns out right for 
them, officials of Los Angeles Unified School District have given them ample 
reason to believe that sports are, indeed, more important than academics. 
</P>
<P>
How else can one interpret a district stance that would allow coaches to direct 
their teams after school even if they participate in the proposed United 
Teachers-Los Angeles strike? The games apparently mean a lot to school 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The district scrambled during the week to round up as many warm bodies as 
possible to throw into the breach if the strike is not averted. Officials 
launched a $40,000 advertising campaign this past week to recruit substitute 
teachers. Of course, the new teachers won't be asked to do much more than 
baby-sit. The district has said that most classroom work will cover review 
material. 
</P>
<P>
Some administrators, most of whom have assiduously avoided the classroom for 
years, will be thrown back to the students, and others will become 
$60,000-a-year hall monitors. Many students already have turned in their books 
and may spend most of their class time watching movies. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, but that's just academics. Why worry about the insignificant? If a science 
class is in the midst of an important experiment, that result will keep. 
English students in the middle of a novel? Mark your place and we'll get back 
to you. 
</P>
<P>
But different rules apparently apply for sports. In the face of massive plans 
to deal with the strike in the classroom, the district plans business as usual 
on the sports field, insisting that the City playoffs must go on. 
</P>
<P>
The district has canceled bus service for midday trips, so a field trip to a 
museum or an art gallery has been scrapped. But those same buses will be ready 
to roll when it's time to get the softball team to a game. Now what does that 
tell you about priorities? 
</P>
<P>
The district's stance on athletics runs counter to the policy adopted for the 
1970 strike when coaches who participated in the walkout were ordered to the 
sidelines. Board and district officials claim that they switched gears this 
time in order to give coaches the option of staying with their teams. 
</P>
<P>
That argument doesn't ring true. Many coaches claim that the district is trying 
to undermine union solidarity by encouraging them to cross picket lines to keep 
up appearances. How bad can things be at the local high school if the baseball 
team is still playing? 
</P>
<P>
Coaches also claim that the district is attempting to shift the burden of blame 
for canceled games from the district to coaches. Phone calls from angry parents 
can be rerouted to the coaches. Let them take the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Valley baseball coaches apparently aren't biting. Of the area's 17 coaches, 13 
have agreed to boycott Tuesday's games that mark the end of the regular season. 
Baseball coaches from the City's 49 schools have been invited to a meeting 
Monday to discuss plans for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Boycotting one regular-season game is a bold stance, given the risks. Not only 
do coaches run the danger of alienating disappointed parents, they are testing 
the loyalty of their players. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches take a hard-sell approach to the concepts of commitment, dedication and 
team unity. If they walk away from games this year, what effect will that have 
not only on this year's players, but next year's team? When a coach sets team 
rules at the first practice next year, will players demand a commitment from 
the coach to see them through the entire season? 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, baseball coaches took those fears into consideration when they agreed 
to boycott. And those concerns likely will weigh on their minds when they 
consider the future of the playoffs at Monday's meeting. Few sports fans will 
protest if they decide to end the boycott and return to their teams for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But if they return, they will miss an opportunity to say something important 
about the values that athletics are supposed to instill. What's wrong with 
ending the season now? Most Valley teams that have qualified for the playoffs 
already have played at least 20 games. Most of the worthy players already have 
earned college scholarships, and everyone has had ample opportunity to 
demonstrate their skills. 
</P>
<P>
The compelling reason to return is to crown a champion, for one team to win it 
all. The desire to be the best strikes a vibrant chord in many of us. 
</P>
<P>
But if sports are about learning values such as teamwork, fair play, discipline 
and the joy of participation -- the virtues coaches always talk about -- 
haven't they been learned already? What's wrong with letting the players walk 
away now with their qualified successes? Let their lasting memories of their 
high school careers center on the friendships made and the experiences shared 
rather than the final won-lost record. 
</P>
<P>
If the decision to suspend the games prompts a vehement cry from players who 
clamor for a winner at any cost, maybe those lessons haven't been taught well 
enough.

LOMBARDI'S 8 RBIS PACE TIDEWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Lombardi of Granada Hills drove in eight runs Saturday night as the 
Tidewater Tides defeated the Toledo Mud Hens, 10-3, in an International League 
baseball game in Toledo, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Lombardi, a graduate of Kennedy High, had a two-run double in the first, a 
three-run double in the second, a two-run double in the third and a run-scoring 
single in the fifth. Tidewater is the triple-A affiliate of the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Lombardi, a first baseman, came within one RBI of tying the single-game league 
record, last achieved in 1963.

NEW OWNER TO RENOVATE THE BARKER BROS. BUILDING; 
</P>
<P>
N.Y. DEVELOPER BUYS LANDMARK STRUCTURE, THREE ADJOINING PARCELS ON FIGUEROA 
STREET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Multimillionaire Harry Macklowe has purchased the landmark Barker Bros. 
building, at 818 W. 7th St., and three adjoining parcels on Figueroa Street for 
about $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based developer has plans to put about $165 million into 
renovating the building and constructing a conference center and 600-room 
hotel, which he will name, following the tradition of another well-known New 
Yorker, for himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Linked to Building 
</P>
<P>
The 450,000-square-foot Hotel Macklowe and conference center will be linked to 
the Barker Bros. building, which will continue to be restored, Macklowe said, 
"with its architectural integrity preserved." The hotel will have what he 
described as "a sympathetic design that respects the historical significance of 
this important structure." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-story Barker Bros. building, completed in 1929, housed the Barker Bros. 
furniture mart and headquarters until 1984, when Hammerson Properties West USA 
purchased the building and an adjacent site for $57 million. The furniture 
company then relocated, the structure was redesigned and several specialty 
stores moved in. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the hotel, Macklowe said, "With the planned expansion of the Los 
Angeles Convention Center by 1992, we recognize the need for additional quality 
hotel space." The Hotel Macklowe will provide 350 jobs during construction and 
600 jobs at completion. A date for starting construction hasn't been set yet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Projects 
</P>
<P>
Through his Macklowe Organization and Harry Macklowe Real Estate Co. Inc., 
Macklowe has developed more than 2.5 million square feet of hotels, commercial 
and residential space in Manhattan. He is currently building a 638-room, 
52-story hotel in Times Square that is expected to open in April, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Macklowe entered his first West Coast real estate venture in 1986 when he 
purchased, with Swig Weiler &amp; Dinner of San Francisco, the 
436,000-square-foot, twin-tower Arco Center at 200 Oceangate, Long Beach.

CITYLINES: MORE TO WRIGHT MYTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Hall Kaplan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The interest in all things Frank Lloyd Wright continues. The latest book on who 
many consider America's greatest architect of the ages is "Frank Lloyd Wright: 
The Crowning Decade, 1949-1959, Selected, and With a Commentary, by Bruce 
Brooks Pfeiffer" (The Press at Cal State, Fresno: $22.95 hardback, $13.95 
paperback.) 
</P>
<P>
The thin book of large type and a selection of personal photographs focuses on 
the last 10 years of the architect's tumultuous life. Offered are views of 
Wright by the public through a selection of articles; Wright's own reflections; 
his wife's, drawn from her own personal papers; his daughter's, through 
interviews, and those of his apprentices. 
</P>
<P>
Although when his widow, Olgivanna, is quoted as saying shortly before her 
death, "I ruled him, but I ruled him with love," it is perhaps more than we 
want to know. Nevertheless, the volume adds to the myth that was Wright, and is 
sure to be of interest to his faithful followers. Sam Hall Kaplan

CITYLINES: DINING IN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The design of restaurants -- from menus and matchbooks to furniture and 
furnishings -- has of late become a high art, with restaurateurs being as 
concerned with architectural styling as they are with sauces and wines. After 
all, style is a food, of sorts, for the senses. 
</P>
<P>
One of the pioneers of restaurant design was the multitalented Winold Reiss, 
whose diverse projects in the 1920s, '30s and '40s included Mike Lyman's in Los 
Angeles, the Chicago Tavern Club and Longchamps in New York's Empire State 
Building. Lyman's, which was on West 6th Street, alas is gone. 
</P>
<P>
A modernist of the Vienna school with a distinct, powerful style that 
emphasized simple geometric forms, Reiss also is known for his murals and 
portraits, as well as his industrial and decorative designs. A selection of his 
work is now on exhibit until the end of the month at the Turner Dailey Gallery, 
7227 Beverly Blvd. Call (213) 931-1185 for times. The gallery specializes in 
the fine and applied arts.

CITYLINES: COVINA AND DANISH

<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty years ago, Denmark invaded America's homes and offices with a 
distinctive line of modern furniture and furnishings. Indeed, the sleek look in 
time became know as "Danish," even though it was soon being produced 
everywhere, Covina as well as Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
Now Denmark is invading America's playgrounds with an equally distinctive line 
of play equipment and structures. Imaginatively styled, brightly colored and 
well constructed with an emphasis on safety, the line known as Kompan is 
gaining rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the hottest playground design line in years," says Gilda Ongkeko, of the 
Santa Monica-based school supplies and equipment firm of Three Wishes.

MORENO ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruth Ryon was misinformed regarding the estate she attributed to Antonio Moreno 
in Hot Property (April 23). 
</P>
<P>
This was originally the Canfield Estate. Moreno married Daisy (I think that was 
her name) Canfield. Since he was a popular movie star at the time, his name was 
associated with the estate. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, we purchased a small home across from the main gate. The estate at 
that time was a very nice school for young ladies. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years later we purchased the larger home on the corner of Micheltorena 
and Landa, across from the side wall of the estate. The female occupants at 
that time (except for the nuns) were wards of the court and were certainly not 
young ladies.

HOME PRICES

<TEXT>
<P>
To complicate further the problem of measuring home prices, we analyze the 
characteristics (including price) of new homes sold in California. 
</P>
<P>
Because we measure new-home prices, our prices differ from resale prices. In 
large part this difference is due to new-home prices being more influenced by 
the pattern of development. In 1988, the lower-priced, faster-growing areas of 
the state increased significantly. This caused the statewide increase in 
new-home prices to be more modest (6.8%) than the increase in resale price 
(+18.4% for detached, +9.3% for condos).

Catherine Collins' article is to the point and she is absolutely right. She 
should be commended for her fortitude in expressing publicly a notion that is 
very unpopular with the real estate industry and, alas, our government. 
</P>
<P>
In an article of mine, published in the January, 1989, issue of the National 
Real Estate Investor magazine, I expressed similar views. 
</P>
<P>
As a concerned citizen, I followed up by writing to some of our elected 
government officials asking them to give this point of view serious thought and 
consideration. So far, it would appear, my appeal fell on deaf ears.

I hope Collins' article might achieve better results.

GORBACHEV'S MEETINGS THIS WEEK IN BEIJING WILL END INTENSE RIVALRY, HAVE GLOBAL

<P>
Thirty years of intense rivalry between the world's two great Communist powers, 
China and the Soviet Union, will come to an end when Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev meets with Deng Xiaoping and China's other top leaders here this 
week for a historic summit whose impact will be felt worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who arrives here Monday for the first Sino-Soviet summit meeting 
since 1959, is coming to open a new relationship between China and the Soviet 
Union -- one that ends the hostility that nearly led to war between the two 
countries in the late 1960s but also one that does not re-create the old 
Communist alliance that so frightened the West in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Virtual War Footing 
</P>
<P>
The four-day summit, both Chinese and Soviet officials say, will bring to an 
end the long, acrimonious quarrel over who has been truer to Marxist-Leninist 
ideals and move the two neighbors away from the confrontation that had both 
virtually on a war footing for many years. 
</P>
<P>
The angry denunciations of each other as the main threat to world peace have 
already given way to cooperation on a growing number of international issues, 
to rapidly expanding trade and development projects and to warmer bilateral 
relations than have been seen in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
Although the summit agenda includes several difficult issues, notably their 
disputed 4,500-mile border through Central Asia and the Far East and the 
continuing conflict in Cambodia, both sides have said that they expect the 
talks to place their relationship on what they call "a good neighborly" basis 
as well as to open the way for extensive economic cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
As Deng, China's senior leader, put it earlier this year, the summit will "look 
toward the future without arguing over the issues of the past." 
</P>
<P>
And Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, commented in Moscow 
last week that the Soviet Union expected that "normal, good neighborly 
relations will develop with China and will be beneficial not just to our two 
countries but also to the entire international community." 
</P>
<P>
So great a factor has the Sino-Soviet rivalry been over the past three decades 
that the summit meeting, the result of more than six years of difficult 
negotiations between Beijing and Moscow, seems certain to rank in international 
impact with President Richard M. Nixon's trip to China in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"This trip goes beyond its immediate, practical consequences, and it goes 
beyond symbolism as well," Prof. Vladimir S. Myasnikov, deputy director of the 
Soviet Institute of Far Eastern Studies and one of his country's leading 
specialists on China, said in a Moscow interview. "Given the hostility that has 
existed between us, this trip is historic, truly world-historic in character." 
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Soviet rivalry, rooted deeply in ideological disputes of a bygone era 
as well as in problems that have festered between the two countries for 
centuries, became a major element in the relations between the Soviet Union and 
the United States, between East and West, in the Asian-Pacific region and in 
the Third World, even as far away as southern Africa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Triangular Geopolitics 
</P>
<P>
The two countries' rapprochement will bring an end to the triangular 
geopolitics through which the United States for more than a decade balanced its 
confrontational and often tense relationship with the Soviet Union through the 
counterweight of closer ties with China, placing Beijing under the protective 
U.S. nuclear umbrella and making it a virtual ally of the West for a time. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Moscow rivalry, once so sharp that it divided the whole Communist 
movement and much of the Third World, will be removed from the continuing 
strife in Cambodia and Afghanistan and from other international disputes where 
it had long been a complicating factor. 
</P>
<P>
Improved relations, moreover, will allow China, the world's most populous 
nation, and the Soviet Union, the largest, to shift more of their resources to 
economic development, their overriding priority today. 
</P>
<P>
Both countries are already reducing the costly defenses they built in the 1960s 
and 1970s out of fear of a calamitous war along their border, and they are 
discussing the possibility of a step-by-step demilitarization of that long 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
"What is happening is of extraordinary importance for us and for China," Roy A. 
Medvedev, a prominent Soviet historian who was recently rehabilitated by the 
Communist Party after 20 years as a dissident, said of the improvement in 
Sino-Soviet relations. "It is certainly a new era in Soviet development and a 
new era in socialism, and it will have a worldwide impact because of the impact 
that the conflict had worldwide. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This conflict has cost us both greatly," Medvedev continued. "We interrupted 
economic relations, though they were complementary and quite beneficial to both 
of us. In the Soviet Union, we had this huge army -- more than 100 divisions, 
if you included reserve and support troops -- along the border, and in China 
they had even more. And through our ideological rigidity, upholding the 
rectitude of our position, we heavily distorted our political and economic 
development." 
</P>
<P>
The two countries' rapprochement, based on a degree of mutual respect that was 
not present before, should also greatly strengthen reformist trends in 
socialist countries, which are now closely watching the Soviet Union's 
determined push for greater democracy and China's experiments with market 
socialism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pacific Influence 
</P>
<P>
"This summit is important not only to our two countries, but it will influence 
the Pacific region and the whole world," Zhao Dalun, deputy director of the 
Institute for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe at the Chinese People's 
University, commented in an interview here. "And not only will relations of the 
two countries be normalized, but also, it goes without saying, the relations 
between the two (Communist) parties." 
</P>
<P>
Already, both Chinese and Soviet officials see political changes under way in 
Asia as a result of their improved relations. The Cambodian conflict is being 
pushed toward a solution, China and India are on friendlier terms, as are India 
and Pakistan, and South Korea is winning recognition from socialist countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, which is determined to play a major role in Asia in coming 
decades, sees better relations with China as a basic requirement for its 
acceptance in the region, and it plans to make its next diplomatic push on 
improving relations with Japan, with which it has a serious territorial 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Policy Diversity 
</P>
<P>
These shifts, particularly those by Moscow, are "a very important historical 
change from a bipolar world to a multipolar one," Wang Yizhou, an associate 
professor at China's Institute of Marxism, Leninism and Mao Tse-tung Thought, 
said in an interview here, arguing that with the end of their long 
confrontation, both will now be able to have greater diversity in their foreign 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander I. Bovin, one of the Soviet Union's top political commentators, said 
that the importance of the summit -- Gorbachev will meet not only with Deng, 
China's senior leader, but also with Zhao Ziyang, the Communist Party's general 
secretary, Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun -- will lie in "simply 
talking civilly, candidly and in a comradely way to each other . . . after 30 
years of cursing back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need anything concrete, no agreements, no pieces of paper," Bovin 
said in a Moscow interview. "We have to learn how to talk, how to talk with 
each other as comrades, how to come and go without a big deal, how to live as 
good neighbors, helping each other. We need to develop a feel for one another 
as neighbors, as socialist countries, as great powers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Frighten Others' 
</P>
<P>
"But we have to do all this in a way that we do not frighten others, 
particularly in the United States, Japan or Europe, and make them think we are 
plotting a campaign to spread world revolution. . . . That we no longer are 
treating each other as enemies does not make us allies like we were in the 
1950s." 
</P>
<P>
The enormity of the political, economic and ideological shifts that lie behind 
the summit amaze even specialists on Sino-Soviet relations who have seen the 
rapprochement slowly growing for almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Huge, dramatic changes are occurring now in both countries, and these domestic 
developments virtually dictated the normalization of relations," Lev Delyusin, 
a leading China scholar at the Soviet Institute of Oriental Studies, said in an 
interview in Moscow. "Both of us now are more pragmatic, both of us have 
stopped thinking that we are going to reach communism tomorrow, both of us 
realize that Marx and Lenin did not leave us a blueprint for building socialism 
and both of us are trying to work out down-to-earth policies that produce 
results and that make people's lives better." 
</P>
<P>
Such a realization, first in China and more recently in the Soviet Union, 
removed the ideological basis for the dispute, which began in 1956 when Nikita 
S. Khrushchev, then the Soviet leader, denounced the crimes and personality 
cult of his predecessor, dictator Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Mao, who shared many of Stalin's ideas and who was beginning to 
develop his own personality cult, objected to Khrushchev's assessment, arguing 
that Stalin's achievements far outweighed any political errors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Hostile Move' 
</P>
<P>
"Mao took the dethroning of Stalin as a very hostile move," Medvedev, who as a 
historian has specialized in Stalinism and in the politics of Soviet 
leadership, said in an interview in Moscow. "Mao also saw himself, not 
Khrushchev, as Stalin's true heir and the leader of the world Communist 
movement. For him, Khrushchev was not an authority at all." 
</P>
<P>
Mao and Khrushchev also quarreled in 1959 over Moscow's policy of "peaceful 
coexistence" with the West. Mao feared that this would prevent Beijing's 
recovering of Taiwan, which was held, then as now, by the Chinese Nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow had already rejected a 1958 plan, disclosed recently by retired Soviet 
President Andrei A. Gromyko, the country's longtime foreign minister, to lure 
the United States into an attack on the Chinese mainland so that Soviet nuclear 
weapons could be used against the American troops. Khrushchev then abrogated a 
Soviet commitment to provide China with the technology and expertise needed to 
develop its own nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"The dispute over nuclear weapons brought all the political and ideological 
differences into the open," Medvedev recalled. "The distrust intensified. We 
saw the Chinese as very dangerous and likely to get us into a nuclear conflict. 
They saw us as renegades to the revolution and people who did not honor 
commitments. The stage was set for a conflict that continued for 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
Khrushchev and Mao also feuded personally. "Khrushchev, who had both a temper 
and a loose tongue, called Mao things like 'old galoshes' and other things that 
are too earthy to repeat, and Mao told people he found Khrushchev stupid and 
half-literate," Medvedev said. "Each knew that the other would hear." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese specialists, however, trace the conflict back even further to relations 
between Czarist Russia and the Chinese empire in the 17th, 18th and 19th 
centuries when, in Beijing's view, large tracts of territory, hundreds of 
thousands of square miles in Siberia, Central Asia and the Soviet Far East, 
were taken from it and incorporated into what is now the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The refusal of Soviet leaders to acknowledge what China regards as a theft of 
territory that might have been used for its huge population has meant, 
according to Chinese specialists, that Sino-Soviet relations were never on a 
firm basis, even during the 1950s when Moscow was providing billions of dollars 
worth of economic and military assistance to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"They should recognize that Czarist Russia invaded China and imposed unequal 
treaties," Zhao said, stressing that Beijing is not demanding the return of the 
territory but wants Moscow to admit the czarist sins. "This is history. It 
should be acknowledged." 
</P>
<P>
We are not seeking to make the present Soviet leaders take responsibility for 
this. The historical question should not be an obstacle to good relations." 
</P>
<P>
Although some progress has been made in recent negotiations on resolving 
disputed points along the border, Moscow remains unwilling to acknowledge that 
much of what today is the Soviet Union was stolen from China. "They say they 
don't want it back today," a Soviet Foreign Ministry official commented in 
Moscow. "But what about tomorrow? What will their sons or grandsons say, 
particularly as the need for land becomes more acute with their growing 
population?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subsurface Tensions 
</P>
<P>
Relations appeared good during the 1950s, but there were still tensions beneath 
the surface, according to Zhao. The Soviet Union provided a vast amount of 
economic and technical assistance, building 250 major factories and other 
projects, at a time when China was isolated by an American-led Western boycott 
and Moscow itself was still engaged in postwar reconstruction. "We spoke of 
'elder brother and younger brother,' " Zhao recalled, "but actually it was 
father and son." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Injustices 
</P>
<P>
Delyusin, a former Soviet party official with 40 years' experience in 
Sino-Soviet relations, said that Stalin "committed a lot of injustices in 
relations with China, and Khrushchev tried to rectify them," but Mao and 
Khrushchev clashed so often and so angrily that "we could not resolve a single 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
China made two serious mistakes in its relations with the Soviet Union at that 
time, Zhao said, reflecting current thinking here. The first was allying itself 
too closely with Moscow in the Cold War struggle between communism and 
capitalism; the second was rejecting Khrushchev's reformist approach and 
perpetuating the Stalinist errors in Maoist doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Leaning to One Side' 
</P>
<P>
"Chinese leaders carried out a policy of leaning to one side," Zhao said. "At 
the time, we felt we had no choice. But my own view is that this 
'lean-to-one-side' policy had many weak points and caused China to lose 
opportunities with other parts of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Zhao, as do today's Soviet leaders, sees Khrushchev as "a great reformer," not 
the ideological and political opponent that Mao took him for. Had his famous 
"secret speech" to the Soviet Communist Party in 1956 denouncing Stalin been 
assessed properly, Zhao contended, China and the Soviet Union might have 
avoided the hostility of the past 30 years -- and China might have been spared 
the upheaval of its 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relations Became Worse 
</P>
<P>
After Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, Sino-Soviet relations became even worse, 
Zhao said, and for 20 years "we were in a state of total confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
However complex its origins, the Sino-Soviet conflict grew "to the point where 
we were on the edge of war," Zhao said, recalling the military buildup along 
the long frontier and the increasingly fierce border clashes. 
</P>
<P>
Leonid I. Brezhnev, from the time he assumed the Soviet leadership, was afraid 
of a war with China, according to Medvedev, who noted that the Chinese 
hostility, in addition to the West's arms buildup, increased Soviet fears of 
isolation, containment and even "a two-front war." "For him, China was the 
'yellow peril,' " Zhao said, "and he even told Nixon, 'We white people need to 
unite against the Chinese.' " 
</P>
<P>
China, for its part, engaged in small military actions along the border, 
including the bloody clash on Damansky Island on the Manchurian-Siberian border 
in 1969, that kept tensions high. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Totally Unpredictable' 
</P>
<P>
"Under Mao in the 1960s and early 1970s, China was totally unpredictable," 
recalled a senior Asian diplomat who alternated between Beijing and Moscow most 
of those years. "He would put millions and millions of people into the street, 
all of them in a screaming rage, and his lieutenants in the provinces would do 
the same. He was also building shelters and storing grain and making physical 
preparations for war. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, there were hundreds of thousands, maybe even several million, Red 
Guards, all whipped into ideological fanaticism, very close to the (Soviet) 
border. And, seriously, what was Moscow supposed to do if they started to pour 
across? How do you contain 2 or 3 million people? That thought contributed a 
lot to the Soviet hysteria of the era." 
</P>
<P>
In his famous "Letter to the Soviet Leaders," dissident Russian novelist 
Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970 and 
was exiled in 1974, warned that a war with China would last 10 to 15 years, 
that it would cost the Soviet Union at least 60 million dead and that afterward 
the Soviet people would virtually cease to exist as a nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preemptive Strike Studied 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s, the Soviet general staff drew up plans, although more as a 
feasibility study than a proposal, according to accounts of both former 
government officials still in Moscow and some defectors now in the West, for a 
preemptive nuclear strike against China's own nuclear forces, missile bases, 
weapons facilities, laboratories and test ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet diplomats in Washington sounded out the Nixon Administration in 1969, 
former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger recalls in his memoirs, and they 
were told emphatically of U.S. opposition to such an action. 
</P>
<P>
"A preemptive strike was a military option, and apparently it was discussed," 
Medvedev said. "Even aside from political morality, it was a bad option. This 
was not the ultimate solution to the so-called 'Chinese threat,' for it would 
not have defeated China. The Chinese would simply have gone underground. War 
with China was too dangerous because of its colossal size." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, seeking a way out of this "two-front" confrontation, made its 
first rapprochement overtures to China in the late 1970s, following Mao's 
death, and renewed them more strongly after Brezhnev's death in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"We always thought, through the darkest days, that China would have to correct 
the Maoist line and normalize relations," China expert Myasnikov said. "By the 
end of 1978, when China adopted its modernization program under Deng Xiaoping, 
it was clear that they could not think about China becoming a modern economic 
power while remaining on a war footing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"About five years later, the Chinese leadership acknowledged as incorrect the 
concept of the 'inevitability of war.' . . . That was the basis for the 
progress we now see in Sino-Soviet relations." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, they held to the position that war with the Soviet Union, or 
'social imperialism,' as they referred to us, was inevitable and had to be 
fought and won." 
</P>
<P>
When Gorbachev assumed the Soviet leadership four years ago, he made the 
improvement of relations with China a foreign policy priority, and Deng 
responded with an encouraging letter that he sent to Gorbachev with Romanian 
President Nicolae Ceaucescu. Progress had been slow, Deng told Ceaucescu in 
October, "but it is happening." 
</P>
<P>
China had set tough conditions for the "normalization" of relations, including 
the restoration of party-to-party ties. Moscow had to reduce the military 
forces deployed along their border and in Mongolia, a Soviet ally between the 
two countries; it had to end its support for the Vietnamese occupation of 
Cambodia, and it had to withdraw its own troops from Afghanistan, which also 
borders on China. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing's conditions have largely been met during the prolonged negotiations 
that led to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Withdrew From Afghanistan 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan in February. Of the 
unilateral 10%, 500,000-member reduction in the Soviet armed forces that 
Gorbachev announced in December, 200,000 are being cut from the deployments 
along the Chinese border, and on Monday, the first units of Soviet troops based 
in Mongolia will leave as part of troop withdrawal there. 
</P>
<P>
Cambodia remains the most difficult question, both sides acknowledge, but 
Vietnam has now promised to pull its remaining 50,000 troops out of the country 
by the end of September. China and the Cambodian resistance, however, have 
expressed skepticism whether Vietnam will really fulfill this pledge. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pushing hard for a fair resolution of the issue," a senior Soviet 
diplomat remarked in Moscow, asking not to be quoted by name, "but as the 
Chinese should know better than us, the Vietnamese can be very, very difficult 
people, particularly when they do not see themselves gaining much from the 
deal. . . . But this problem, too, will be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
For both Beijing and Moscow, the negotiations themselves have been an important 
part of the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
"They started with the 'three obstacles,' but gradually they became the 'three 
difficulties,' then the 'three conditions,' and now they are the 'three 
questions,' " China scholar Delyusin said. "And all the time that we talked 
about and around these, we have proceeded with expanding trade, resuming 
exchanges and contacts of all sorts and engaging in the broadest range of 
political dialogue . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of stupid things in our propaganda that blinded us," he 
continued. "We started from the basis that hostility was inevitable and 
eternal, and we were even concerned about the possibility of a Chinese military 
attack. There was some matching stupidity in China, as well, and although the 
negotiations were long and often quite difficult, it was good to move carefully 
and not rush ahead or paper over differences."

OPPOSITION CALLS FOR NEW PROTESTS AGAINST NORIEGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With growing international support and a strengthened American military 
presence nearby, Panama's opposition Saturday stepped up its pressure on the 
regime of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, announcing new public protests, including a 
general strike. 
</P>
<P>
As these plans were disclosed, diplomatic sources said they were picking up 
increasingly loud expressions of discontent within the Noriega regime, 
particularly among the officials used as a civilian front for the military 
elements who control the government. 
</P>
<P>
"Noriega is in trouble," said one diplomat whose country has a close 
relationship with Panama. "Some of them (the civilians) are fighting among 
themselves and want to get out before everything collapses." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, since the crisis sharpened after last Sunday's election debacle, any 
semblance of a normal government has nearly disappeared. Most government 
offices have stopped operating in any normal capacity, and few Cabinet 
ministers appear at work. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition itself says there is no longer any civilian government and says 
it will deal only with the military as the true ruling force here, an 
assessment largely agreed to by diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are no concrete signs that Noriega has lost control or that he 
intends to give in to demands that he give up power. 
</P>
<P>
But leaders of the Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition expressed 
determination to confront Noriega and keep domestic and world attention focused 
on their effort to unseat him, even if it means provoking new violence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coincide With Meeting 
</P>
<P>
They said that a 24-hour general strike will begin Tuesday at midnight to 
coincide with a special meeting Wednesday of the Organization of American 
States called in Washington to consider the Panamanian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In past anti-Noriega general strikes, businesses closed, workers stayed home 
and Panama resembled something hit by a neutron bomb -- structures stood but 
the people disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
However, the call issued Saturday was far more militant, urging people "to 
leave and protest in your street or in your neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
But an earlier -- and equally potentially dangerous -- protest will come today 
when all supporters of the Democratic Alliance have been urged to attend 
morning Masses at Roman Catholic churches to protest Noriega's nullification of 
presidential elections in which the regime is widely seen as having been 
overwhelmingly repudiated. 
</P>
<P>
After the last Mass ends in early afternoon, opposition sources expect that 
their followers will take to the streets to show their rejection of a ban on 
demonstrations and to support the alliance leaders who were mauled by security 
forces during a protest march Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those who were beaten, Democratic Alliance vice presidential candidates 
Guillermo (Billy) Ford and Ricardo Arias Calderon, will attend services at two 
churches and then lead followers into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Endara, the alliance presidential candidate, remains hospitalized 
from the beating he took Wednesday from army and paramilitary forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increasing Force 
</P>
<P>
The last two opposition rallies were met with increasing levels of government 
force, including the use of tear gas, water cannon, birdshot and rifle fire. In 
addition to brutalizing Endara, Ford and Arias Calderon with steel pipes, the 
government forces killed one of Ford's bodyguards, wounded others and arrested 
at least 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
Many diplomats and other observers expect Noriega to meet today's protest with 
more violence. 
</P>
<P>
So does the opposition. "We have to show our people that their leaders are not 
in hiding. We are not going to hold back," said Ford to reporters Saturday in 
his first public appearance since the regime arrested him during Wednesday's 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to ask our people to confront these animals," he said of the 
government. "We are not going to take them (supporters) to the butcher shop. 
But we can't control their emotions." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the pressure on Noriega is the arrival of about 1,900 American combat 
troops to augment the 12,300-member military force already assigned here. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to guarding the Panama Canal, President Bush said the troops would 
aggressively assert American rights, including the free movement of U.S. forces 
through Panama City and the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
American military and diplomatic officials said the troops would be used to 
protect the lives and property of Americans threatened by Noriega's 
15,000-member Panama Defense Forces and the paramilitary units.

EERIE DEATHS OF 17 WOMEN BAFFLE MIAMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY BEARAK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what has become a bizarre and persistent pattern, 17 women have died here in 
the past 2 1/2 years. All of them young. All of them black. All of them found 
in empty lots or gutted buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all were prostitutes. Almost all held traces of cocaine in their 
systems. Almost all were discovered naked from the waist down, with their legs 
spread apart. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for the first time, the county's chief medical examiner, Dr. Joseph 
Davis, pronounced the deaths probable homicides. "I suspect we are looking at 
the work of one man," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And the people of Miami, until now largely unaware of the ghastly sequence, 
began facing the possibility that a serial killer was in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
For months, detectives and pathologists have been confounded. None of the dead 
bodies shows any signs of trauma. No bruises. No internal injuries. No needle 
marks. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, investigators remain unsure whether this is a medical mystery or a 
criminal one. If prostitutes are being murdered, why no signs of struggle? 
After all this time, why no reports of a near miss? 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about mysteries in deaths, these are by far the most mysterious 
you'll ever find," said Miami Police Sgt. David Rivero, who worked some of the 
first cases. "I mean, usually you have a motive or a witness or at least a good 
cause of death. Here, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
All the corpses have been found in the north half of Dade County, though 
prostitutes and cocaine are commodities in the south end too. The first death 
dates back to September of 1986 -- or even earlier if, as some investigators 
figure, the list includes more than 17 names. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, the prevailing theory about the deaths was a highly unusual 
one -- that the prostitutes died from the toxic effects of cocaine accompanied 
by the stimulation of sex. Neural exhaustion, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner 
Charles Wetli called it. 
</P>
<P>
If true, that would explain the partially disrobed bodies. Cheap hookers often 
exchange sex for crack cocaine. They ply their trade in abandoned buildings or 
the tall weeds of vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Linked to Deaths 
</P>
<P>
The theory has an impressive advocate. Back in the late 1970s, Wetli was among 
the first to show that cocaine, even in modest amounts, could lead to death. He 
is the co-author of articles commonly cited in texts and journals, implicating 
the drug in a variety of fatal illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the police think the theory is very plausible. "We're just finding out 
all of what crack does to people," said John Farrell, chief of detectives for 
the county police, which has jurisdiction in most of the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"In men, we're finding that crack -- in amounts 10 times lower than a basic 
overdose -- sometimes triggers psychotic episodes where a guy just goes 
berserk, starts running a real high fever, then just dies." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe these women, then, were victims of prolonged binges on crack, living on 
the edge until even the relatively low arousal of sex-for-hire was enough to 
finally induce a fatal reaction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seemed Far-Fetched 
</P>
<P>
To some, however, the theory has always seemed far-fetched. Why were the 
prostitutes dying in only one part of the county? Or, for that matter, in one 
part of the state or the nation? 
</P>
<P>
"As you went through any medical theory, you always came back to why not this 
and why not that," Chief Farrell said. "Same thing with the question of murder. 
You always came back to why weren't there any signs of trauma." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, meetings began taking place at the senior level between the county 
police and the medical examiner's office, Farrell said. Inquiries were made 
around the nation. More tests were done on the bodies. Crack was purchased on 
the street, then analyzed for toxins. 
</P>
<P>
A flyer was even distributed to prostitutes -- at once a warning and plea for 
information: "If you should experience a reaction to crack cocaine, please 
furnish us a sample so we can analyze it. You may save a life!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Theories 
</P>
<P>
Not much came back that was helpful. The hookers had as many theories as the 
cops: The drugs. A killer. A killer and his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last December, Body No. 12 was found. Antoinette Burns, 14, died in a 
junk-strewn yard under a Brazilian pepper tree. She was lying on her back. Her 
skirt was pulled up. Everything fit the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Or almost everything. The girl's body tested clean for drugs. There was no 
evidence she worked the streets. 
</P>
<P>
And that complicated the riddle. Either the teen-ager did not belong on the 
list -- or her case tipped the scales further toward homicide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Can't Figure It' 
</P>
<P>
What was going on? "We just can't figure it," Chief Farrell said. "There may be 
the possibility of different causes of death. Is there a serial killer? Is 
there a medical explanation? Maybe yes to all possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
The list has grown by five in 1989. More help has been sought. 
</P>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta has been consulted regarding 
extensive toxicology tests. The FBI in Quantico, Va., has been asked to help 
put together the profile of a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forensic Dentist 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Souverin, a well-known forensic dentist, has been called in to 
examine the lips of the dead women. One theory suggests that they died from 
"forced fellatio," which cut off their air supply. 
</P>
<P>
In that regard, Souverin is also comparing the women's teeth with any marks 
found on suspects -- so far unproductively. "If the skin is broken and a scar 
is left, you can make a match," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Dr. George Hensley, who teaches pathology at the University of Miami 
Medical School, has been asked to offer his opinion. He believes someone is 
suffocating the women in a way that leaves no signs of trauma. 
</P>
<P>
But how? "You're talking about little girls on the street, and it's not too 
hard to asphyxiate them, especially when you have their backs on the ground and 
your weight on their abdomen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Escaped Attention 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, in a city where strange crimes ordinarily enjoy a long run of lurid 
retelling, this investigation largely escaped the media's attention until a 
local weekly, New Times, ran a lengthy cover story about it. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the airwaves have filled with the views of several of the 
participating investigators. Finally, the chief medical examiner weighed in: 
probable homicide. 
</P>
<P>
But if so, by whom? And by how many? 
</P>
<P>
There are other questions as well. Amid the sudden glare of publicity, some 
wonder if the cases of 17 dead black women -- mostly prostitutes -- have been 
given short shrift. The Miami Times, a newspaper for the black community, 
charges that there has been an "intolerable delay" in solving the cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women's Families 
</P>
<P>
That feeling is shared by some of the women's families. Thelma Rahming, the 
grandmother of Antoinette Burns, said the homicide detectives were uninterested 
in what she had to say last year. "Now they're back telling me they're starting 
from scratch," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Farrell, however, insists the cases have been vigorously investigated all 
along. "And we've reached out to the group we need to, and that's not the 
general public," he said. "These are not women just walking down the street 
getting accosted. These are women having sex near crack houses." 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, a prostitute who identified herself only as Lynette along busy 
Biscayne Boulevard, said she has been well aware of the deaths -- in fact knew 
a few of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
"A bad dude is taking out the girls," she said. "Of course, we're just a bunch 
of black whores. He'd go do it to a white woman and you'd see the FBI, the CIA 
and the Marines down here, for a thing like this."

Money. Power. Respect. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the words that combatants on both sides use over and over to describe 
what is at stake as the Los Angeles Unified School District and its teachers 
enter the final hours before a strike set for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of hard bargaining, the two sides remain at an impasse over the 
size of the salary increase for teachers. On Saturday, hopes of reaching a 
settlement dimmed when a divided school board said it could not raise its 
latest offer of a 21.5% pay increase over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Also unresolved is the delicate and complex question of who should run the 
district's 600 schools. Should the authority remain almost solely with 
administrators, or should teachers share the power? Or parents? Or some 
combination of the three? 
</P>
<P>
And then there are stumbling blocks of politics and personality. Two of the 
seven members of the Board of Education are fighting for their political lives 
in the June 6 runoff election, with the union a central player in both races. 
The board is deeply divided over key aspects of negotiations, especially over 
money. 
</P>
<P>
To a significant degree, the dispute has been a standoff between the district's 
low-key superintendent, Leonard Britton, and the union's tough-talking 
president, Wayne Johnson. They are about as different as two people can be -- 
and it is no exaggeration to say they are not the best of friends. 
</P>
<P>
Districts locally and throughout the nation will be watching closely to see how 
the bitter fight ends. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to have a major impact," said state Supt. of Public Instruction 
Bill Honig, who has urged the union to accept the district's salary offer. 
"People are watching and are worried about it. We may all get tarred with the 
brush . . . and risk a backlash from Sacramento," possibly in the form of more 
restrictions on the way schools spend the state's money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Obstacle Is Money 
</P>
<P>
Money remains the major obstacle to a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The union has asked for a 21% raise over two years -- 11% this year and 10% in 
1990 -- which would cost $241.5 million. Under this proposal, the current 
beginning salary of $23,440 would rise to $26,018 this year and $28,620 next 
year, while the current top pay of $43,319 would rise to $48,084 this year and 
$52,892 next year. 
</P>
<P>
The district has given a firm offer of 8% this year, 5.5% in 1990 and 8% in 
1991 -- for a total cost of $247 million. The beginning salary would increase 
to $25,316 this year and to $28,427 by 1990, while the current maximum salary 
would jump to $46,594 this year and to $52,030 by 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The district has pledged to go higher -- up to 24% over the three years -- 
using a formula that would give teachers 60% of any new state money that 
becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
The union argues that the district's $3.5-billion budget already has enough 
money for a 20% raise over two years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Misrepresentation Alleged 
</P>
<P>
In a report to a state arbitrator, the union contends that the district 
routinely misrepresents its finances. For instance, the union says the district 
underestimated the amount of lottery money it will receive from the state this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The district maintains that the vagaries of the state budget process make it 
difficult to predict how much money will be available for salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"The union is half right and half wrong," says board member Warren Furutani, a 
union ally. "We clearly need to tighten up (the budget) in some areas. Their 
focusing on year-end balances is legitimate. But they point to some (accounts) 
that can't be used for salaries." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson sums it up this way: "We're trying to get some control over district 
budgeting, to get them to re-prioritize" and place teachers' and classroom 
needs before those of administration. "In that sense," he said, "this (fight) 
is very much about power." 
</P>
<P>
The seven members of the Los Angeles Board of Education are wrestling not only 
with how to heal their fractured relations with thousands of teachers, but with 
deep divisions among themselves. Only four members -- Furutani, board President 
Roberta Weintraub, Jackie Goldberg and Julie Korenstein -- support the 21.5% 
pay offer. The others -- Rita Walters, Leticia Quezada and Alan Gershman -- are 
opposed to financing the offer by making deep cuts in other areas, such as 
emergency reserves and administrator salaries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Election Runoffs 
</P>
<P>
Gershman and Korenstein both face tight runoffs with challengers next month. 
The union opposes Gershman and supports Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
Caught in the middle is Britton, whose effectiveness as a peacemaker, some 
board members say, has been severely hampered by their disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very, very hard for him," Weintraub said. "He's not working with a 
totally pro-union board or with a totally pro-administration board. The board 
vacillates and has major differences on all the big philosophical issues. So it 
is very difficult to be the superintendent in this district." 
</P>
<P>
Britton came to Los Angeles two years ago from the Dade County, Fla., school 
system, where he was widely regarded as the best friend Miami teachers ever had 
in a superintendent. According to Pat Tornillo, United Teachers of Dade 
executive vice president, Britton built an atmosphere of trust between teachers 
and the administration, encouraging collaboration instead of confrontation. 
Today, Dade is considered a path-breaking district in the movement to empower 
teachers. And Britton, Tornillo says, "laid the groundwork for it," helping to 
devise a "school-based management" program now in 96 Miami schools. 
</P>
<P>
However, Britton -- at least publicly -- has played the heavy in the drama over 
the teachers' contract. Last fall, when teachers expanded a boycott of certain 
duties, he announced that the district would dock their pay. When teachers 
threatened to withhold first semester grades, he countered by threatening to 
hold back paychecks. And last Monday, he ordered teachers to turn in final 
grades early or risk losing their May salaries. The union's response was to 
move up the strike, which originally had been scheduled for May 30. 
</P>
<P>
According to one district official, Britton got swept up in "trying to outgun 
Wayne Johnson . . . instead of trying to win the hearts and minds of teachers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Failed 
</P>
<P>
Britton's main attempt at collaborating with union leaders -- to devise a 
shared decision-making plan -- ended in failure, district and union sources 
said. The proposal called for creating school councils composed of union 
teachers, the principal, parents and other school employees, but it stipulated 
that teachers would have one more seat than the total of the others. The 
principal would head the council, with the union chapter chief serving as vice 
chair. The councils would make decisions on budget allocations, use of school 
equipment and scheduling of final exams, grading periods and other events. 
</P>
<P>
"We were comfortable with (the proposal) and the superintendent was comfortable 
with it," Johnson said. "But he took it back (to the board) and they rammed it 
down his throat. He couldn't get the board to agree on something he worked with 
us on on a personal level. So we wrote him off. There's no sense dealing with 
someone who can't make a deal and make it stick." 
</P>
<P>
So, with Johnson leading the charge, the union's rank and file turned against 
Britton, even calling for his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Johnson's motivation, some observers believe, is his drive to be a 
major player in the labor movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shanker of the West' 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to be the Al Shanker of the West Coast," says one acquaintance, 
referring to the powerful, longtime head of the New York-based American 
Federation of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But while Shanker has changed from a hard-liner and a militant to a more 
reasoned advocate for school improvement, Johnson remains entrenched in 
traditional union tactics, emphasizing bread-and-butter issues and painting 
administrators as the enemy, supporters and critics say. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson represents "the old-fashioned pump 'em up, get 'em angry, 
make-management-into-the-bad-guy (approach)," state schools chief Honig said. 
"This is the old industrial confrontation model. Almost nobody is using that 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, both his detractors and admirers agree that Johnson is an 
effective leader, ever mindful of his constituency. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things about Wayne," said Miles Meyers, president of the California 
Federation of Teachers, "is that he pays a lot of attention to schools. He 
doesn't lose sight of the fact that what matters is what goes on at the school 
sites. It's the reason he has the strength he does. He's got a lot of contacts 
(with individual teachers) . . . and he's built up a lot of political credit." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lucy Findlay, a Nimitz Junior High School teacher: "Wayne is a fantastic 
spokesperson. He verbalizes and demonstrates the will of the teachers. He 
expresses all the things that are festering inside me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tone of Negotiations 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some critics say, Johnson has purposely made the negotiations 
more venomous than they should have been. 
</P>
<P>
"He has leaped at every opportunity to beat up on Britton instead of searching 
for peace," said one labor leader, who spoke on the condition that he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Both the district and the union say they are close to agreement on the issue of 
school governance. Both concur that more decisions -- such as those concerning 
curriculum, discipline, class schedules, budgets and teaching methods -- should 
be made at the school level instead of by a remote central office staff. And, 
they agree that new school councils should be created to make such decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are so close on this one," said board member Jackie Goldberg. "What we're 
fighting over is what is the best formula" to determine the councils' 
membership and implementation. 
</P>
<P>
The union has proposed a two-stage approach. The first would establish a 
"shared decision-making" council of teachers, parents and administrators at 
each school. Teachers would hold 51% of the seats. The councils would have 
authority to make decisions only on issues that affect teachers, such as use of 
copying machines and classroom equipment, scheduling of standardized tests and 
budgeting for supplies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Phase 
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, the union proposes a districtwide task force to develop 
"site-based management" councils, which would have more sweeping powers. 
Schools would be invited to submit plans to the task force to show how the 
school would raise student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Under the district's proposal, each school would design its own council with 
equal input from parents, teachers and administrators. The district and the 
union would have to approve of each plan. Johnson objects to this, saying it 
would set up a bureaucratic "gauntlet." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree, however, that the big "loser" under either proposal is the 
principal, who would be forced to share power with parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"From the principal's perspective," district negotiator Dick Fisher said, "we 
are proposing a fairly radical change." 
</P>
<P>
Some administrators are worried because they believe the principal is legally 
responsible for the safety and performance of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Also unresolved are questions about providing elementary teachers with 
preparation time and eliminating yard duties for elementary instructors. 
Elementary teachers have 30 minutes before school and 10 minutes after class 
for preparation, but teachers say those times are often spent on meetings or 
supervision duties. For most, that leaves the lunch period to plan lessons, use 
the copying machine, call parents or attend to paper work and other tasks.

An investment group that includes two Ronald Reagan Administration officials 
has entered the bidding for troubled Eastern Airlines, according to a newspaper 
report. Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci would temporarily be in 
charge of Eastern and Joseph Wright Jr., a former director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, would be involved, the New York Times said. Options 
trader Joseph Ritchie, who now heads the bidding group, declined to reveal the 
size of the offer but said it would give the troubled carrier's unions a bigger 
stake in the airline than did a bid led by former baseball commissioner Peter 
V. Ueberroth, the newspaper said. Eastern has been virtually grounded since its 
machinists union went on strike in March.

Haiti's president, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, has fired two widely criticized 
Cabinet ministers in one of the highest-level personnel moves since 
rank-and-file soldiers brought him to power eight months ago. The government 
decree, read over state radio, came less than six weeks after the president 
narrowly escaped an attempt by some officers to oust him. The two Cabinet 
members, Foreign Affairs Minister Serge Elie Charles and Information Minister 
Anthony St. Pierre, caused a public outcry for their role in granting a safe 
conduct pass out of Haiti in December to former Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck 
Romain. Romain was indicted in connection with a massacre of church 
parishioners in November, 1988.

Philippine soldiers aided by a former Communist rebel found three mass graves 
where the remains of scores of people killed by guerrillas are believed buried, 
a military spokesman said. Those buried in the graves, just south of Manila, 
are thought to have been killed by the Communist New People's Army in a purge 
of suspected spies in their ranks after arrests of rebel leaders last year. 
Reporters said they counted 28 bodies in a mass grave in the town of Kavinti in 
Laguna province.

Apartheid was officially banned in Namibia, keeping to a U.N. independence 
timetable that designated May 13 as the day when South African-inspired laws 
discriminating by race should be scrapped. However, South African and U.N. 
officials say it will be about six weeks before all apartheid-related laws are 
repealed. For example, town councils, school education, health services and the 
national pension scheme are still racially segregated. Meanwhile, South 
African-led army and paramilitary police forces returned to their bases, ending 
searches for fighters of the South-West Africa People's Organization. The 
rebels entered Namibia on April 1, just as the U.N.-backed independence plan 
was getting under way.

A Soviet Politburo commission blamed most of the 25,000 deaths in Armenia's 
earthquake last Dec. 7 on shoddy construction and turned its findings over to 
prosecutors to "file criminal charges and bring those responsible to account," 
the official Tass news agency reported. "The catastrophic consequences of the 
earthquake in Armenia are explained above all by the low quality of the 
building and assembly work, by the inadmissible violation of design norms and 
the strength of underground tremors," Tass said. The report ended an 
investigation that began after the earthquake, which was measured at a 
magnitude of 6.9. The Politburo commission was headed by Premier Nikolai I. 
Ryzhkov.

At least 11 Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with Israeli troops 
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the army reimposed a nightly 
curfew from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. A full curfew, imposed on the entire Gaza Strip 
last Monday, remained in force at the Shati, Jabaliya and Nusseirat refugee 
camps and parts of the Rafah camp and Gaza City after demonstrations broke out 
there Friday. Hospital officials in the Gaza Strip reported eight shooting 
injuries from clashes in those camps and in Gaza City. In the West Bank, troops 
shot and wounded three Palestinians in the Nur esh Shams refugee camp in 
clashes after the army lifted a curfew for two hours, an army spokesman said. 
The army reimposed the curfew.

CANADA TO CHECK U.S. FUEL

Canada closed 125 U.S. border crossings to petroleum tankers after reports that 
some U.S. companies are blending toxic wastes into gasoline and selling the 
fuel in both countries. A joint special unit is also being formed to 
investigate the reports of contaminated gasoline shipments, Canadian 
Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard said. He said the border closures will 
permit better inspection of tankers at the remaining 50 crossings. The Toronto 
Globe and Mail newspaper reported last week that solvents, toxic PCBs and waste 
oil have been mixed into fuels by several firms in New York to save disposal 
costs and that the mixture has been sold to unsuspecting customers.

CAPE COD SHACKS, HOME TO LITERATI, RULED HISTORIC BUT MAY BE RAZED

Seventeen rustic shacks on the outer dunes of Cape Cod could still be ripped 
down even though the huts, which provided soul-searching solitude to Eugene 
O'Neill, Jack Kerouac and other creative minds, have won national historic 
designation. 
</P>
<P>
The National Park Service on Friday placed the primitive huts on the National 
Register of Historic Places at the urging of the Massachusetts Historical 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Park Service officials in Boston previously had maintained that the shacks 
located on the Cape Cod National Seashore did not have the architectural or 
historic value to warrant preservation. The service had indicated the shacks 
would be demolished after leases with the current owners expire. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Cables, regional director of the Park Service in Boston, said earlier 
this year that a historic designation "affords no guarantee of protection." 
</P>
<P>
"The National Park Service could raze these shacks. There's still potential for 
that to happen," said Edie Shean-Hammond, a Park Service spokeswoman in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
But she said regional officials vowed in December that all of the huts would be 
preserved until plans for the area have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
The one- and two-room gray shingled beach huts lie between Truro and 
Provincetown near the tip of Cape Cod. Built in the 1920s and 1930s by the 
Coast Guard as shelters, they offer none of the conveniences of modern life, 
such as electricity and plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists say the shacks have been used by O'Neill, Kerouac, poet E. E. 
Cummings, author Norman Mailer and scores of lesser-known painters, poets, 
playwrights and novelists.

AGENCY ADMITS UNDERESTIMATING EXPOSURE TO CANCER-CAUSING CHEMICAL; 
</P>
<P>
EPA RAISES ESTIMATE OF ALAR USE TO 15% OF APPLE CROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a sharp revision of earlier estimates, the Environmental Protection Agency 
reported Saturday that as much as 15% of the nation's apple crop may have been 
treated last year with Alar, the cancer-causing chemical whose use has prompted 
national concern. 
</P>
<P>
The agency conceded that its earlier contention that just 4% of apples were 
exposed to Alar had vastly underestimated the chemical's use. It said its new 
estimate was based on "additional information" gathered during a two-month 
investigation prompted by the public uproar over Alar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unreasonable Health Risk 
</P>
<P>
In disclosing the new figure, the EPA also said it would move ahead with 
previously announced plans to remove Alar from the market, saying that exposure 
to the chemical over a lifetime may pose an unreasonable health risk. Such a 
ban will take at least 18 months to become final. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejects Suspension 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the action, EPA officials again rejected steps that could suspend 
use of Alar immediately, saying that the agency has uncovered no evidence to 
justify emergency action. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on our current estimates, the short-term risks of eating food treated 
with daminozide (Alar's chemical name) are not significant and do not pose an 
imminent or major public-health threat," deputy administrator Jack Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
While data about the carcinogenic effects of daminozide are "a cause of 
concern," the agency said, "the level of risk during the time necessary to 
complete a cancellation are not unreasonably high." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA also said it expected public exposure to Alar to decrease as a result 
of declining use of the chemical, which would further reduce the health risks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Not Hesitate 
</P>
<P>
But in acknowledging that its previous assessments of Alar use had been 
mistaken, the agency said it would not hesitate to act "if additional data 
indicate that more immediate action should be taken." 
</P>
<P>
While the new EPA estimate of Alar use is much higher than its earlier figure, 
15% is still less than estimates by some environmental groups and consumer 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
A government official said the agency's decision to publicize its new findings 
this weekend was prompted in part by the impending broadcast of a CBS News 
report that 32% of last year's apple crop contained traces of Alar. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said in February that it would begin regulatory action aimed at Alar, 
and has urged that the chemical be taken off the market voluntarily because it 
has been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disputes Health Claims 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer of Alar, Uniroyal Chemical Co., has disputed the health claims 
and continued to sell the chemical, which keeps apples on trees longer and adds 
to the fruit's shelf life. The substance is used almost exclusively on red 
apples, particularly the Delicious, Staymen and McIntosh varieties. It cannot 
be removed by washing or peeling. 
</P>
<P>
Public concern about Alar erupted this spring after the Natural Resources 
Defense Council, an environmental group, published a report contending that 
Alar-treated apples posed an "unacceptable risk" to children, who eat a large 
volume of apples and apple products. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the report, apple sales plummeted and a number of school 
districts removed apples from school lunch menus. 
</P>
<P>
Although the concern abated somewhat after government agencies assured 
consumers that it was safe to eat apples, an organization representing 
producers of apple juice and apple sauce reported this week that sales of the 
products lagged at least 20% behind last year's levels.

GREENSPAN SEES SLOWDOWN IN LEVERAGED BUYOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said Saturday that he believes 
the number of leveraged buyouts of companies has started to subside, but a 
panel of business experts disagreed, contending that many more large companies 
would be takeover targets. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan expressed his view at a closed-door meeting of the Business Council, 
a group of 65 top executives of the nation's biggest corporations assembled for 
their spring meeting here. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed chief refused to comment to reporters afterward on leveraged buyouts or 
on any other topic, especially the moderate 0.4% rise in the producer price 
index for April that sent the stock market soaring Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oppose Fed Restraints 
</P>
<P>
Many of the corporation executives hope the Federal Reserve will refrain from 
further restraints on growth of the money supply, which they fear may trigger a 
recession. Greenspan "ducked a question" on his views about whether inflation 
has been checked by the Fed's recent tightening of monetary policy, one of his 
listeners said. 
</P>
<P>
Other participants in the session discussed Greenspan's views on leveraged 
buyouts -- the controversial practice of corporate raiders making acquisitions 
through heavy borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of business leaders differed with Greenspan's conclusion, however, 
indicating that they felt the use of such buyouts would be "accelerating" in 
the future, even though the trend could not be sustained indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
David M. Roderick, chairman of USX Corp., said: "There's a tremendous amount of 
cash out there to keep leveraged buyouts going for some time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airline a Target 
</P>
<P>
A manager of pension funds from Los Angeles, Robert G. Kirby, agreed, saying 
that Northwest Airlines, a target of takeover attempts in recent weeks, was a 
"sitting duck" because the value of its stock was much lower than the value of 
its assets. 
</P>
<P>
"And there are a lot more out there like that," Kirby said. 
</P>
<P>
Roderick said those who take over corporations by heavy borrowing must usually 
cut back on research and development in order to repay the loans, thus making 
the firm less competitive in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"America is paying a horrible price to get short-term gains by burdening 
corporations with tremendous debt," Roderick said at a news conference after 
the private session. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the excesses, however, neither Kirby nor Roderick favored federal 
legislation to interfere with the buyouts, saying the free market should be 
allowed to operate.

FIERY PERONIST STILL A BIG FAVORITE IN TODAY'S VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Juan Facundo Quiroga, a brutal 19th-Century provincial warlord from La Rioja, 
reigned for decades over northwest Argentina with his gaucho army until he was 
waylaid and murdered by rivals from powerful Cordoba province. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Saul Menem, the Peronist party's presidential candidate who styles 
himself after Quiroga, complete with long-flowing hair and extravagant 
sideburns, appears likely to avenge that insult by defeating Cordoba province 
Gov. Eduardo Cesar Angeloz in today's election. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant Menem, the La Rioja governor who crusades on a populist campaign 
theme of "Follow Me," leads in all the polls in his race for president against 
the businesslike, bespectacled Angeloz, candidate of the centrist Radical Civic 
Union, the governing party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3,000% Inflation 
</P>
<P>
Euphoria that accompanied the return to civilian rule in 1983 has evaporated 
with the onset of hyperinflation running at 3,000% annually, depressing 
salaries and a currency that has lost four-fifths of its value against the 
dollar since February. 
</P>
<P>
Menem, a fiery 58-year-old lawyer, has capitalized on disgust with the economic 
failures of Radical party President Raul Alfonsin in forging a lead of 6% to 
8%. Building on the Peronist party's traditional working-class base, Menem has 
sought to dispel latent fears of Peronism's authoritarian past to attract 
middle-class voters as well. 
</P>
<P>
The disillusioned Argentine people have turned to him in their quest to 
rediscover this nation's former prosperity, now just a distant dream. 
</P>
<P>
How is it possible, Argentines ask, that a country that laid claim to sixth 
place among world economies in the 1920s, equal to that of France, is now 86th 
and falling? 
</P>
<P>
Angeloz, a year younger than Menem, has groped to find ways to distance himself 
from Alfonsin's economic wreckage, applauding the president only for having 
consolidated civil liberties since he took office in 1983 after a harsh 
seven-year dictatorship. The liberal wing of the party did not go out of its 
way to help Angeloz campaign, feeling that he was abandoning Alfonsin even 
though the candidate had little choice, given the nationwide anxiety and rage 
over the economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turbulent History 
</P>
<P>
In the final days of the campaign, Angeloz began to emphasize the turbulent 
history of the Peronists, founded in the mid-1940s by then-Col. Juan D. Peron, 
who held sway until he was deposed by the military in 1955, and then again 
briefly from 1973-74 until his death, when he was succeeded by his third wife, 
Vice President Maria Estela Peron. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the days after the 1976 coup against Maria Estela Peron, when secret 
police rounded up left-wing revolutionaries, Angeloz said in his stump speech: 
"Never again will a Montonero (guerrilla) or a green Ford Falcon come in the 
night to take away people's children just for thinking differently." 
</P>
<P>
In his final rally to a throng of 300,000 supporters in central Cordoba, 
Angeloz hit hardest at Menem, saying that when both were at Cordoba University 
Law School, "I was on the side of those who defended university reform, and he 
was a member of the General University Concentration, a grouping of fascist 
origins." 
</P>
<P>
The reference to fascism struck close to home for the Peronists, who pride 
themselves on the internal "renewal" of the party since Alfonsin's victory in 
1983. After decades in which Peron himself dominated every decision and a 
clique of autocratic union bosses were in control, the party democratized 
itself and nominated Menem in an open primary election last July. In an upset 
victory, he defeated the party's urbane president, Gov. Antonio Cafiero of 
Buenos Aires province, who counted among his supporters most of the party 
hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
As the attacks against him mounted during the campaign, Menem angrily accused 
Angeloz of having been cozy with the last military regime, while Menem spent 
five years in jail without being charged with any crime. Angeloz adamantly 
denied having such links. 
</P>
<P>
Menem, an amateur race car driver who is often photographed with starlets, 
likes to invoke the memory of the caudillo Quiroga, who was called "the jaguar 
of the north," and early 19th-Century dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas, both folk 
heroes to many. 
</P>
<P>
Deriding that sentiment, Angeloz said he favors the memory of Juan Bautista 
Alberdi, a famed constitutionalist, and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, a mid-19th 
Century president who emphasized education and culture. Sarmiento condemned 
Quiroga and other provincial caudillos as tyrants who scourged the land. 
</P>
<P>
Menem counts on support from the rural provinces, which have a heavier say in 
the election than urban areas, but he is also considered likely to win Buenos 
Aires province, home to one-third of the 20 million voters. Menem needs about 
46% of the popular vote to win a majority of the 600 electoral college votes at 
stake. If he falls short of the 301-elector majority, fierce bargaining will 
ensue for minor-party electors. 
</P>
<P>
After three military uprisings and a bloody leftist attack on a military base 
in January, both front-running candidates are sensitive to the need to get 
along with the armed forces. Both deny that they favor an amnesty for human 
rights abuses during the dictatorship -- trials of officers brought Alfonsin 
into continuing conflict with the military -- but many believe an amnesty by 
another name is likely, whoever wins. 
</P>
<P>
Angeloz, shunning any links with Alfonsin's economic policies, promised to 
privatize chaotic, deficit-ridden state enterprises, to slash the inflationary 
budget deficit and to promote private industry and exports. Alfonsin was 
virtually invisible during the campaign and never appeared with Angeloz. 
</P>
<P>
Despite accusations that Menem is vague and contradictory on some issues, he 
galvanized the hopes of the poor and the working class, invoking the memory of 
Eva Peron, the president's legendary second wife who died in 1952 at the age of 
33, as he promised a "productive revolution." At every campaign appearance, he 
spoke against a backdrop of a huge portrait of Juan and "Evita," recalling 
their generosity to the descamisados, or shirtless ones. 
</P>
<P>
Menem also insisted that a newly democratized Peronist party now balances the 
demands for social justice with the need for a modern, technocratic state. Yet 
he offered virtually no specifics on how he would end inflation, raise salaries 
and cut government spending at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Menem said that his party, more a social movement embracing nationalists from 
left to right, would prove pragmatic rather than ideological, privatizing state 
businesses where necessary and placing greater emphasis on private enterprise. 
Juan Peron initiated a wave of nationalizations of industries that now generate 
more than $2.5 billion a year in deficits. 
</P>
<P>
To protect his consistent lead in the polls, Menem sought to avoid gaffes and 
contradictions, which dogged him early on. 
</P>
<P>
Angeloz seized on a Menem remark about someday recovering the British-held 
Falkland Islands, known here as the Malvinas, as a sign of his opponent's 
rashness, but the likeable Peronist enjoyed a kind of Reaganesque Teflon 
coating: nothing stuck. He later promised never to lead Argentina into a war 
and said that his Falklands statement was a figure of speech. 
</P>
<P>
There was little debate on Argentina's huge $60-billion foreign debt, on which 
the government has paid almost no interest in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Most parties agree that without economic growth, political stability will 
remain elusive. A 64-year-old homemaker, standing in a depleted supermarket 
aisle where prices were being marked up as she shopped, said she was voting 
Peronist: "Freedom, yes, it is important. But you can't eat freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Argentine elections, when they do take place, are among the fairest on the 
continent, and no one has raised the possibility of fraud. No one need fear a 
repeat of Panama in the pampas.

earlier, offer support and advice through Comintern. Moscow also helps fledging 
Chinese Republic, based in south, headed by Sun Yat-sen. Under Soviet prodding, 
Communists and Sun's Nationalists join in mid-20s in a united front against 
warlords. 
</P>
<P>
1927: Chiang Kai-shek, Nationalist leader after death of Sun, turns against 
Chinese Communists. In surprise attacks in Shanghai, thousands of Communists 
are killed. United front ends, Chinese civil war begins. Communists undertake 
Long March in 1934 to escape Chiang's forces; Communist faction that includes 
</P>
<P>
Mao and Chou En-lai wrests control of party from "28 Bolsheviks," a 
Soviet-trained faction. 
</P>
<P>
1949: Mao's Communists triumph over Nationalists, who flee to Taiwan, and Mao 
proclaims the People's Republic of China. Moscow quickly recognizes new 
government. Mao complains later that Soviets had pressured Chinese Communists 
to stop short of victory over Nationalists in Chinese civil war for fear of 
provoking U.S. intervention. During early 1950s, Moscow supplies loans, 
blueprints and technical assistance to help Chinese build up industry. 
</P>
<P>
1959: Sino-Soviet relations deteriorate. Moscow objects to Beijing's truculence 
in international affairs, reneges on giving Chinese technical data for nuclear 
weapons; Soviets disparage China's abortive Great Leap Forward, and Nikita S. 
Khrushchev calls Mao's people's communes old-fashioned and reactionary. Mao 
suspects Moscow of meddling in Chinese Communist factionalism. In 1960, Moscow 
abruptly ends aid to China, withdraws all of the nearly 1,400 Soviet 
technicians and advisers from China, leaving about 200 major projects 
unfinished. Pullout disrupts China's development, causing great losses but 
eventually forcing China to become more self-reliant. Ensuing Sino-Soviet split 
opens deep gap in world Communist movement. 
</P>
<P>
1962: Chinese accuse Soviets of provoking incidents along their border in 
Central Asia, and of stirring resistance to Beijing's rule among Muslim 
minorities. Moscow charges Chinese with violating Soviet frontier. Chinese in 
mid-60s press for settlement of boundary disputes dating from "unequal 
treaties" of czarist times, but talks collapse. Soviets build up military 
forces along frontier. Soviet and Chinese troops clash in 1969 along Manchurian 
border, killing dozens on each side. Summer brings more clashes in Xinjiang. 
Amid war fears in China, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin meets Chinese Premier 
Chou En-lai at Beijing airport their,tough talks leading to inconclusive border 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
1972: After Chinese and U.S. diplomatic feelers, President Richard Nixon visits 
Beijing in 1972, launching Sino-U.S. reconciliation after years of hostility. 
Sino-U.S. detente reshapes triangular rivalry among Beijing, Moscow and 
Washington. China and the United States restore diplomatic relations in 1979, 
and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping urges the United States, Western Europe and 
Japan to work together to contain the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
1979: Soviet backing for Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, and Moscow's own 
intervention in Afghanistan, anger China, which adds these issues to existing 
Soviet military buildup along Chinese border to make "three obstacles" barring 
improved Sino-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
1985: The new Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev says that one of his top 
priorities will be to improve Sino-Soviet relations. Showing more flexibility 
than his predecessors, Gorbachev over next three years softens stance on border 
dispute, reduces Soviet forces on China's border, withdraws Soviet troops from 
Afghanistan, after Moscow's nine-year intervention there, and urges Vietnam to 
pull its troop out of Cambodia, where they have fought Chinese-backed rebels. 
The groundwork is laid for a Sino-Soviet summit in Beijing.

<P>
When Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev's propjet airliner touched down in 
Beijing on Sept. 30, 1959, the burly Russian was ready for a bitter 
confrontation with a man he had come to detest, Chinese Communist Party 
Chairman Mao Tse-tung. 
</P>
<P>
"The warmth had gone out of our relations with China, and it had been replaced 
by a chill that I could sense as soon as I arrived," the Soviet chief said in 
"Khrushchev Remembers," the unofficial autobiography published in the West in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
Sino-Soviet friction had been building for several years before the 1959 
Khrushchev-Mao summit, and the icy estrangement between Communist giants would 
not reach its full bitterness for several more years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Start of the Rift 
</P>
<P>
But Khrushchev's 1959 visit to China -- together with an only slightly less 
tense trip in 1958 -- can be said to mark the start of the Moscow-Beijing split 
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping 
hope to heal this week in the first Sino-Soviet summit since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
The bitterness of the Mao-Khrushchev meeting seems clear with the benefit of 
almost 30 years of hindsight. But the depth of the Soviet-Chinese friction was 
not understood at the time in the West, which continued to view Moscow and 
Beijing as two pillars of a Communist monolith. 
</P>
<P>
"The relationship had begun to come apart when Khrushchev became an outspoken 
critic of the Great Leap Forward," Mao's often brutal campaign for Chinese 
self-reliance in the mid-1950s, John King Fairbank wrote in "The Great Chinese 
Revolution," published in 1986. "On his two visits to Peking, in 1958 and 1959, 
he and Mao did not get along. The Russian leader thought the Chinese leader was 
a romantic deviationist whose judgment could not be trusted." 
</P>
<P>
On the Chinese side, there is now substantial evidence that Mao berated 
Khrushchev for what the Chinese leader considered a timid policy toward the 
Third World. Mao also complained that the Soviet Union gave only tepid support 
to China's bombardment of an offshore island garrisoned by Nationalist Chinese 
troops from Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
But this evidence was largely overlooked in the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Herter's Position 
</P>
<P>
A few days after the 1959 Khrushchev-Mao summit, American Secretary of State 
Christian A. Herter told a Washington press conference that Moscow, because of 
its presumed place as the leader of the Communist world, bore "a degree of 
responsibility for the actions of other members of the bloc," including China. 
</P>
<P>
Herter noted, with apparent surprise, that the public statements of the Chinese 
and Soviet leaders during their summit exhibited disagreement over the basic 
approach to international disputes, with Khrushchev urging the peaceful 
settlement of conflicts and Mao advocating revolutionary force. 
</P>
<P>
Khrushchev flew to China 31 hours after he returned to Moscow from a 10-day, 
coast-to-coast tour of the United States, which included talks at Camp David 
with President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Although Khrushchev's U.S. trip was 
frequently marked by Cold War rhetoric on both sides, its overall impact was an 
easing of East-West tensions that came to be known as "the spirit of Camp 
David." The detente proved to be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
In "Khrushchev Remembers," the Soviet leader related that he was reluctant to 
go to China so soon after returning from the United States. The ostensible 
purpose of the China trip was to allow him to attend ceremonies marking the 
10th anniversary of the Communist victory in the Chinese civil war. 
</P>
<P>
But a major reason, at least from the Soviet standpoint, was dictated by rising 
border tensions between China and India. Khrushchev apparently hoped to serve 
as peacemaker between China and India, whose prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, 
the Soviet Union was assiduously courting. 
</P>
<P>
"We were eager to give Nehru a chance," Khrushchev wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But from Mao's standpoint, the Soviet neutrality in the border dispute between 
China and India was a betrayal of Communist solidarity. The Chinese said it was 
of little use to have the Soviet Union for an ally if it would not take their 
side in a disagreement with a non-Communist neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Envoy of Peace' 
</P>
<P>
In his public statements in Beijing, Khrushchev called on all Communist nations 
to "do everything possible to preclude war as a means for settling outstanding 
questions." Premier Chou En-lai publicly referred to Khrushchev as "an envoy of 
peace." But the Chinese leaders showed their displeasure with the summit by 
refusing to issue a joint communique at the end of the visit. 
</P>
<P>
Khrushchev's book, recalling the 1959 incidents and the later heavy border 
fighting between India and China in 1962, said: 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it was Mao himself who stirred up the trouble with India. I think he 
did so because of some sick fantasy. He had started the war with India, and now 
he wanted to drag the Soviet Union into the conflict. Here was Mao trying to 
dictate policy to other socialist countries -- just as Stalin had done before 
him. Here, once again, was the dictatorship of one individual masquerading as 
the dictatorship of the proletariat." 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank, the dean of U.S. China scholars, wrote that the Mao-Khrushchev 
animosity "reached the point in mid-1960 where Khrushchev suddenly withdrew all 
the Soviet technicians from China together with their blueprints." 
</P>
<P>
"The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) was soon sending ideological blasts against 
Soviet revisionism to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and being paid 
back in kind." 
</P>
<P>
In the three decades since the last summit meeting between the Communist 
powers, the leaders of both China and the Soviet Union have met regularly with 
U.S. presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with President Richard M. Nixon's visit to China in February, 1972, 
there have been seven Sino-American summits. And, counting Khrushchev's 1959 
trip to the United States, there have been 14 meetings between the top leaders 
of the United States and the Soviet Union.

U.S. SEES BENEFIT IN NEW COMMUNIST DETENTE

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brushing aside the superpower politics of the last 17 years, during which the 
United States and China built a peculiar friendship on the foundation of mutual 
hostility for the Soviet Union, the Bush Administration says it welcomes Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to Beijing because it promises to ease 
tensions in Asia and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's relaxed attitude toward the first full-scale Sino-Soviet summit in 
almost 30 years is based on a new assessment that antagonism between the Soviet 
Union and China does more harm than good to U.S. interests, according to a 
consensus of Administration policy-makers, former U.S. officials and 
non-government specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, these experts say, the American ability to exploit the Sino-Soviet 
rivalry has eroded over the years. Even if it wanted to, there is not much the 
Administration could do to influence the meeting between Gorbachev and Chinese 
leader Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Force Behind Relationship 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-China relationship started on the basis that 'the enemy of my enemy 
is my friend,' " a State Department official said. "That was certainly the 
force behind the relationship in the 1970s and much of the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
But now, China and the United States have more common interests than a common 
enemy, this official said. This is so despite the sharp differences between the 
two nations on matters such as Chinese suppression of human rights, freedom of 
expression and individual liberty. 
</P>
<P>
"China does things for us in Asia and will continue to do things for us in 
Asia," said the official, who asked not to be named. As examples, he said, 
China "tacitly supports" U.S. bases in Japan and the Philippines, helps to 
buttress the security of Thailand and has supplied money and arms to the 
U.S.-backed moujahedeen guerrillas in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
From its side, China looks to Washington and the West for the technology it 
needs for its economic modernization program. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the official said, China and the Soviet Union are not expected to end 
their mutual mistrust as the result of a single summit. No one expects a 
reprise of the Sino-Soviet alliance of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"China still perceives that the Soviet Union is the chief long-range threat to 
its security," the official said. "That assessment has not changed. One can't 
accuse the Chinese of moving with wholesale haste to improve their relations 
with the Soviet Union at the expense of their American friends. China has been 
moving slowly because they did not want to frighten the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials admit that there may be an element of wishful thinking in their 
assessment, an attempt to put the best possible face on something they cannot 
change anyway. Only Vice President Dan Quayle has sounded a word of caution, 
and even his assessment was weighted to emphasize the positive. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a lessening of Sino-Soviet tensions is a logical course for 
both nations to pursue and have no objections to that," Quayle said in a recent 
speech, "provided that any new relationship harms neither our own interests nor 
those of our friends, and that it directly addresses our common security 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Result of U.S. Policy 
</P>
<P>
Michel Oksenberg, a University of Michigan professor who was the White House 
National Security Council's chief China expert when the Jimmy Carter 
Administration established normal diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979, 
said the Sino-Soviet rapprochement resulted from the success of U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's overture to China, he said, represented a sharp change in Soviet 
policy "due in no small measure to Sino-American cooperation over the past 10 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Other experts say that Washington's ability to shape the three-cornered 
U.S.-Chinese-Soviet relationship will certainly decline as a result of the 
Gorbachev-Deng summit. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, restoration of normal relations between the Soviet Union and China 
is going to erode the favored U.S. position in the triangle," a senior 
Administration official said. "However, it will make it more difficult for any 
side of the triangle to manipulate the others. Frankly, that's not a situation 
that we are uncomfortable with. I think we can live with it." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Pollack, head of the political science department at the RAND Corp. in 
Santa Monica, added: "We harbored a lot of illusions about our ability to 
manipulate relations between the Russians and the Chinese even during the time 
of Deng Xiaoping's most violent anti-Soviet rhetoric in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese clearly sing a very different song today than they did a few years 
ago," Pollack said. "This is because they find Mr. Gorbachev a different breed 
of cat" from former Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts see Gorbachev's trip to Beijing as part of a global "charm 
offensive" by the Soviet leader, which may ultimately challenge Washington's 
position around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev thinks in classical 19th-Century balance-of-power terms," said 
George Carver, a former deputy director of the CIA. "I think his long-term plan 
is to isolate us by achieving bilateral ties with all of the people we used to 
use as a counterweight to Soviet expansion." 
</P>
<P>
Carver, now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies in Washington, complained that the Bush Administration has failed to 
devise a long-term strategy to deal with the change in style at the top of the 
Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that messes us up is a continuing concentration on the short term," 
Carver said. "We are sprinters competing with marathon runners in a marathon." 
</P>
<P>
For Carver and many other experts, both in and out of government, the most 
significant long-term consequences center on Soviet relations with Japan, not 
China. But there is no agreement among the specialists over whether Washington 
should be reassured or alarmed by this prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"The bigger issue is whether Gorbachev's opening to China gives him any 
leverage with Japan because Japan is the one major global player that stands 
apart from the love-in for Gorbachev," Pollack said. "A Gorbachev overture to 
Japan might be a cause for concern." 
</P>
<P>
Oksenberg agreed: "The most important trip Gorbachev will take is still ahead 
of us. The route to Tokyo is through Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
But Oksenberg added that a Soviet-Japanese rapprochement might ultimately 
advance American interests by giving Washington an opening to resume relations 
with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Cambodia 
</P>
<P>
"The Russians and the Chinese are dealing with each other over Indochina, and 
we are peripheral actors," he said. "I think it is important for us to become 
more engaged in that equation, but to do that, we would have to spend more 
money for the reconstruction of Indochina. We don't have the money for that, so 
it will have to be done by Japan." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials believe that a major topic of the Gorbachev-Deng meeting will be 
the situation in Cambodia. Moscow has supported the Vietnamese invasion, while 
Beijing backs a three-sided rebel coalition -- two non-Communist factions 
supported by the United States plus the murderous Khmer Rouge, blamed for the 
deaths of more than 1 million Cambodians when it was in power in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia has been an important obstacle to Sino-Soviet relations because they 
were backing different horses," one U.S. official said. "It now appears that 
the Chinese and the Soviets will sit down and agree on a solution for 
Cambodia."

BOTH SIDES SAY SCHOOL STRIKE APPEARS SURE; 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS AND BOARD DEADLOCKED OVER PAY AS MONDAY DEADLINE NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With a strike deadline only a day away, union teachers and the Los Angeles 
Unified School District remained deadlocked Saturday on the issue of pay 
increases and leaders of both sides said a strike now appears likely. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said the chances of a 
strike on Monday now are "99.9%" and that "it would take a minor miracle" to 
avert one. School board President Roberta Weintraub said, "I am going to assume 
that on Monday morning a strike will occur." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, both sides continued to prepare for a strike. The district signed 
on more substitute teachers Saturday, as union picketers angrily shouted 
outside. At union headquarters, hundreds of teachers scooped up strike signs 
and flyers and huddled over tactics they hope will bring the nation's 
second-largest district to a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Meeting 
</P>
<P>
The divided school board held an emotional private meeting for three hours 
Saturday, but members were unable to agree on raising the previous pay offer of 
a guaranteed 21.5% increase over three years, with the possibility of going to 
24% if the district gets more state funds. 
</P>
<P>
The union again rejected that offer, but for the first time said a three-year 
agreement would be possible. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he would "be very interested in" an offer that would use state 
surplus revenues to give teachers a 10% raise retroactive to last July, when 
the last contract ended, a guarantee of a 5.5% raise for the coming year, with 
a formula to go up to 9% using any state surplus next year, and a further 8% 
raise in the third year of a new contract. The previous union demand was for a 
21% raise over two years. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the board is unwilling to gamble a settlement on expectations 
that a rise in state revenues could bring the district between $34 million and 
$60 million in extra funds, Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans for Cuts 
</P>
<P>
The board has already agreed to cut as much as $120 million from other programs 
to fund its latest offer and is divided over whether to make deeper cuts, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fundamentally, the question was whether the board was willing to make those 
additional cuts," Weintraub said. "And there are four board members against it 
. . . so the board will hold with its present offer." She would not identify 
the members. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators for both sides were in telephone communication through the day but 
early morning optimism vanished by evening. Weintraub said that no meeting of 
the school board was scheduled for today although members were available if the 
situation changed. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said it would be difficult to call off a strike if there was no 
settlement by 6 p.m. today. But they said they would be willing to keep in 
contact with district officials. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson characterized as "a con job" the board's offer to stick to 8% for this 
year and to apply all state surplus funds to the second year of a contract. 
According to the union chief, the non-monetary issues could be settled easily. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the money," he stressed, that is blocking a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical of Board 
</P>
<P>
Johnson criticized political divisions within the school board. "The internal 
fighting (on the board) is making it more difficult for us to reach a 
settlement," he said. And Johnson repeated charges that the existing school 
budget, even without the expected state surplus, could afford the pay increases 
teachers want. 
</P>
<P>
School board members Julie Korenstein, Warren Furutani and Jackie Goldberg 
hurriedly left the private session shortly after lunch, waving off reporters' 
questions. Board member Alan Gershman, who left later, said only that "we're 
talking." 
</P>
<P>
"They feel very strongly and each member shared their feelings," said district 
spokeswoman Diana Munatones of the session. "Each member is agonizing over this 
whole process." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, hopes for a settlement were raised by speculation in 
Sacramento that tax revenues would be $750 million higher than expected and 
that the Los Angeles school district could get some of that. The board has 
agreed to use 60% of that money to raise teachers' salaries above its current 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
However, the size of and uses for that surplus are being debated. State 
lawmakers may require that much of the extra money be used for only for 
textbooks and maintenance, not salaries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Governor's Plans 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian is expected to announced his revised budget by the end 
of the week. A state fact-finder is scheduled to issue a report on the labor 
dispute Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub said the board majority concluded that additional state funds "have 
to be a certainty" before they will increase the district's offer. 
</P>
<P>
Union Vice President Helen Bernstein said the district could shift other funds 
even if the state surplus comes with strings attached. "It's time to take a 
risk. It's time to be a little creative," she said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Union sources suggested that both sides are seeking face-saving ways to 
postpone a strike. One scenario would have teachers delay a strike, even 
without a final settlement, if district Supt. Leonard Britton would drop his 
demand that teachers turn in student grades on Monday or face withholding of 
last month's pay. It was that order that led the union to move the strike date 
from May 30 to Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But other people close to the situation said that it is unlikely that the board 
would order Britton to reverse his order, even though some board members think 
the action was ill-timed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plea to Students 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub urged the district's 595,000 students to attend school Monday. She 
said that although the district has not found as many substitutes and 
administrators as it needs to maintain regular classes during a strike, "we 
will do our best to maintain order and safety in the schools." 
</P>
<P>
Between 500 and 600 people have answered the school system's call for 
substitutes, said Michael P. Acosta, a personnel administrator. The district 
has about 32,000 teachers, counselors, librarians, nurses and psychologists and 
about 17,000 of those voted to strike. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the third day of recruiting substitute teachers, union teachers 
set up picket lines outside district headquarters and shouted at people coming 
to apply to work as substitute teachers. There were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"Scab! Scab! Scab!" two dozen sign-holding teachers shouted at a car crossing 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
One teacher boomed out: "About this time Monday, you are going to wish you 
hadn't done this. Don't take my job." 
</P>
<P>
Another picketer took pictures as people crossed the line. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, one woman said she was not prepared for the sidewalk confrontation. 
"They got kind of nasty," she said. "This was completely unexpected. I had, 
like, no time to psych myself out for it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Month of Vacation 
</P>
<P>
Ike Michaels, 27, who said he is a financial analyst, said he was going to take 
a month of vacation to teach during the strike in order to keep inner-city 
students off the streets. "I'm a strong believer in education and politics 
shouldn't be brought into it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At union headquarters, hundreds of teachers showed up Saturday for pre-strike 
planning sessions and to pick up picket signs, flyers, buttons and tee-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
In gearing up for the financial trauma a strike may bring them, teachers 
received some good news Saturday. Under threat of a union lawsuit, the district 
dropped its threat of stopping payments on health insurance and its demand that 
teachers start paying $270 monthly premiums on their own. According to union 
president Johnson, federal law requires the district to keep up insurance 
coverage for at least 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
One meeting at union headquarters was for the many provisional teachers who are 
teaching while earning their state credentials. The district hires more than 
1,000 of these instructors each year to help ease its teacher shortage. 
However, many feel the strike puts them in a precarious position because they 
need good recommendations from administrators to become permanent teachers. 
Union leaders urged provisionals to join the picket line, saying any settlement 
will include a clause protecting them, as was the case in the agreement ending 
the 1970 strike.

A five-alarm fire Saturday destroyed a craft-supply shop in the city's downtown 
shopping district, snarling traffic and spewing a column of black smoke visible 
for miles. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the midday blaze at Bonnie's, a store that sold 
spray paints, lacquers and hobby paraphernalia. The fire threatened shops and 
restaurants at the heart of downtown but nearby businesses suffered only smoke 
and water damage, Ventura Fire Chief Bob Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
Horne said the cause of the fire was not known. It spread quickly, he said, 
because of the "volatile nature" of the materials inside. 
</P>
<P>
The shop's roof and mezzanine collapsed, and its entire inventory was burned. 
Fire officials estimated the damage at several hundred thousand dollars.

WITT DOESN'T CRY FOUL, GETS 6-1 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Witt's quest for the elusive shutout ran afoul again Saturday afternoon, 
which, it could be argued, also happened to the hit that produced the New York 
Yankees' only run in a 6-1 loss to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
By many accounts, Mike Pagliarulo's fifth-inning home run down the left-field 
line actually left the field in foul territory. Angel left fielder Chili Davis 
thought so. Angel Manager Doug Rader thought so. Witt thought so. 
</P>
<P>
Television replays corroborated these thoughts, showing Pagliarulo's long fly 
ball sailing just outside the left-field foul pole. 
</P>
<P>
But third-base umpire Tim Welke thought differently. Welke gave a quick 
home-run signal and waved Pagliarulo around the bases, just as quickly waving 
goodby to Witt's latest shutout bid. 
</P>
<P>
Can Witt not catch a break or what? 
</P>
<P>
Consider his last three starts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- April 30 against Toronto, Witt pitches 10 scoreless innings and winds up 
with no decision as the Angels win in 11, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 -- May 6 against Toronto, Witt takes a 3-0 lead into the eighth inning before 
the Blue Jays score four times to knock him out of the game. The Angels rally 
to win, 5-4, but Witt is left holding another no-decision. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And then there was Saturday. Eight innings without a blemish, a sterling 
five-hitter, but again no shutout, at least in the eyes of umpire Welke. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, getting used to the feeling, opted for the betterment of his state of 
mind and chose to look on the bright side. 
</P>
<P>
At least this time, he said, he got the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We won the game. That's the big thing," said Witt (3-3). " . . . Whether I get 
a shutout or not is not important. It may be important in the long run, but as 
far as how we're playing right now, me pitching well is the biggest thing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, more than a few fans in Anaheim Stadium's left-field corner were pulling 
for the shutout -- and weren't about to let Welke forget it. For the rest of 
the game, mocking chants of "Fair, Fair" accompanied any ball sprayed foul and 
out of play. 
</P>
<P>
Rader left the dugout to protest the call, but later, in the company of 
notepads and tape recorders, he decided to tread lightly on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"If he missed it, he missed it," Rader said. "The guy was trying. He thought it 
was fair; the replay showed, maybe, otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to open a can of worms. He was doing his best and his opinion 
carries more weight than mine." 
</P>
<P>
The question was put to Witt -- fair or foul -- and Witt had to side with the 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe (it was foul)," Witt said. "We'll never know. The guy called what he saw 
-- actually, two guys called what they saw. I saw what they saw and I thought 
it was foul." 
</P>
<P>
So did Davis, who had the closest view of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"A foul ball," Davis proclaimed. "It was a couple feet foul. If you watched the 
people who caught the ball, they were in foul territory. 
</P>
<P>
"But, it's over with. What the hell. He blew the call and I think he knows it. 
. . . The fans were on him the whole day. He doesn't need me to get on him, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Davis grinned. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was in Pags' shoes," he said, "I'd take it." 
</P>
<P>
So would the man seated in front of Pags' locker, taking off Pags' shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see it, but they called it fair, so I guess it was fair," Pagliarulo 
said with a smile. "You say it was foul, but I say it was fair." 
</P>
<P>
And about that television replay? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't care to look at it," Pagliarulo said. "Sometimes, television can fool 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, ignorance can be bliss. 
</P>
<P>
Once Pagliarulo was officially credited with his first home run of the season, 
Witt set about setting the Yankees down. Witt retired the next nine hitters in 
a row, yielding only two singles -- to Don Slaught in the eighth inning and 
Steve Sax in the ninth -- the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
He also yielded one more deep fly ball, this one to center field by Jesse 
Barfield, but the Angels' Devon White nullified it with a leaping catch against 
the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a great play," Witt said. "From where I was on the mound, I thought 
it had a chance to be a home run. I'm sure Jesse thought the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
So, maybe things do even out after all. 
</P>
<P>
Rader claimed to be satisfied solely with the end result -- a victory that 
ended a two-game Angel losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"Witt is our No. 1 guy and today was a golden opportunity for him to show it," 
Rader said. "We'd lost two in a row and he comes in and shuts those guys down. 
</P>
<P>
"That lends credence to our feeling that's he's our No. 1. He stopped a 
two-game skid in an exceptional way." 
</P>
<P>
It might have been a little more exceptional, if not for Pagliarulo's ball and 
Welke's call. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a good pitch to Pagliarulo," Witt maintained. "The pitch ended up where 
I wanted it to. Well, it was where I wanted it (in the strike zone). It really 
didn't end up where I wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
On second thought . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it might have," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
In Witt's mind, if not in the record book, the shutout would be his. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Doug Rader isn't the only Angel working on a new image. Last year, Chili Davis 
blasted a few American League umpires early on and believes he paid for it on 
ball-and-strike calls the rest of the season. Thus, he discussed Mike 
Pagliarulo's controversial home run with care. "I'm trying to establish a 
rapport," Davis said, smiling. "I don't mess with you, you don't mess with me. 
Last year was tough enough." . . . Mike Witt has added a new pitch to his 
repertoire -- the forkball -- but admits its development remains in the 
embryonic stage. "I don't even know if you could call it breaking it in," Witt 
said. "It's more of an experiment. I've been throwing two pitches all my life. 
This is going to take some time." Saturday, Witt said he threw three forkballs. 
"I threw one to (Don) Mattingly and he lined to right," Witt said. "Then I 
threw a couple to Pagliarulo on that at-bat. I came back with a fastball and 
that's the pitch he hit." 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Jack Howell had his left hand examined by specialist Dr. Norman 
Zemel, who diagnosed the injury as a contusion, or deep bruise. The hand is 
still swollen, so Rader started Glenn Hoffman in Howell's place. "They taped 
him up and he could've played defense," Rader said. "But we're going to wait a 
few days on him. We want to be absolutely sure it's not broken." . . . Johnny 
Ray drove in half the Angels' runs with a first-inning ground-out and a two-run 
single in the third. Bill Schroeder, starting at first base in place of Wally 
Joyner, added a solo home run, his second of the season, with Davis and Dante 
Bichette contributing RBI singles. . . . Rader was discussing Witt's tendency 
to "bear down too much" and concluded, "I'd rather have that, someone who goes 
at it ultrahard, than someone who goes out there in a state of malaise, in a 
very placid way." One reporter stopped writing and told Rader he'd never heard 
the word malaise uttered in a baseball clubhouse. Rader shrugged. "Malaise," he 
repeated. "That's the stuff you put on bread, isn't it?"

DODGERS CONTINUE DOWNFALL; 
</P>
<P>
MCWILLIAMS STOPS FEEBLE HITTERS AS PHILLIES WIN, 2-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers continued to hit new lows and not much else. 
</P>
<P>
Larry McWilliams proved that again Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
A journeyman left-hander who had thrown only one shutout and two complete games 
in the previous four years, McWilliams shut out the Dodgers on five hits, 
pitching the Philadelphia Phillies to a 2-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have not scored for 24 consecutive innings and are threatening Orel 
Hershiser's streak of 59 straight shutout innings. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hershiser, who pitches today: "I prefer pitching on the day after we've 
been shut out because I figure we're going to score. I guess the odds are 
really in my favor now." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Belcher, the latest victim of the Dodgers' feeble offense, refused to 
comment after drawing his fourth loss in six decisions despite allowing only 
three hits and one run in six innings Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
As for the new lows, the Dodgers' team batting average, the major leagues' 
worst, is .224, the lowest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
And if it continues, the Dodgers may establish their lowest team average since 
the move from Brooklyn. The 1968 Dodgers hit .230, the current Los Angeles low. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned, you've got to be concerned," said Fred Claire, executive vice 
president. "But I still feel that a large part of the answer remains within the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel that when Kirk Gibson is back in the lineup with Mike (Marshall) 
and Eddie (Murray), we're as strong as anyone in the league. Without him, the 
focus has been on the parts of the lineup that are not there to supply the bulk 
of the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Supporting that theme, Mickey Hatcher said: 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the Dodger lineup out there. The team is built around the 
chemistry that Gibby produces when he's in there. But we need him 100%. It 
would be wrong to rush him. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all amazed that we're not farther back, but we've got to keep it close 
so when Gibby comes back we can take off like we know we will." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, at 15-18, are only 3 1/2 games behind first-place Cincinnati in 
the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no accurate gauge as to when Gibson will be back. He said Saturday 
night it could still be two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a frustration watching the club struggle," he said. "It's a fight knowing 
what to do. One second I'm saying, 'Maybe I'll rush back.' The next I'm saying, 
'Don't be an idiot.' I want to help, but I don't want to blow the progress I've 
made. I don't want another setback now." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have scored 28 runs in 14 games since Gibson went out. They have 
lost nine of their last 13 games, five via shutouts. They are 5-11 on the road, 
four of their last six losses being shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel changes? 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we'd have to get rid of half the team," coach Bill Russell said. "I 
don't ever remember anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got good hitters," he said heatedly. "We've got guys capable of putting 
up better numbers than they are now. They're going to hit, it's just a question 
of when. We had two guys on base in three different innings tonight and 
couldn't get the two-out hit. It's amazing. I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
If hitting is contagious, lack of it is, too. Now even Murray has only one hit 
in his last 18 at-bats, and Marshall has driven in only two runs in his last 14 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff man Willie Randolph is at .230 with one stolen base and no RBIs since 
April 11. Third baseman Jeff Hamilton is batting .198 with two hits in his last 
19 at-bats and no home runs since 1988. Center fielder John Shelby is batting 
.179, and Dave Anderson, replacing injured shortstop Alfredo Griffin, has a 
season average of .154. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," said the catalytic Hatcher, currently restricted to 
pinch-hitting because of a pulled groin. 
</P>
<P>
Added Claire: "The frustrating part is that we're not taking advantage of the 
good pitching we've continued to get. I mean, we're losing tough games, not 
getting blown out. It's not a lack of total offense, but rather one hit at the 
right time." 
</P>
<P>
They were prevented from getting it Saturday night by a 35-year-old veteran of 
eight major league seasons spent with four organizations. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams, recently shifted from the bullpen because of injuries that have cut 
into the Philadelphia rotation, has a 76-78 career record but is 6-3 against 
the Dodgers. He walked four, struck out six and only once allowed two hits in 
an inning. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher, with seven days off between starts, walked five. Two walks and Chris 
James' single cost him a run and the game in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lasorda, shaking his head: 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the best earned-run average in baseball, but I bet the ERA against 
us is even better." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda made a long walk from behind the batting cage before 
Saturday's game and held an animated discussion with Mike Davis in center 
field. . . . Neither would comment on it, but there was speculation that 
Lasorda reprimanded Davis for throwing balls into the center-field seats and 
that Davis expressed unhappiness again -- first by his bleacher pegs and then 
orally during the talk with Lasorda -- over being removed from the lineup in 
favor of Chris Gwynn. . . . With a roster move necessary when Kirk Gibson comes 
off the disabled list, there is speculation that the Dodgers may keep Gwynn and 
release Davis, swallowing the remainder of his $987,500 salary. Davis, his 
recent base running mistakes only part of the club's dissatisfaction with his 
performance, apparently is not going to return to the lineup soon. "We're going 
to find out what Gwynn can do," coach Bill Russell said. "We know he can hit 
right-handers. We want to find out if he can hit left-handers, too." . . . Has 
Davis' desire to be traded affected his play? Can the situation be compared to 
Bill Madlock's in 1987? "This is a different case," said Fred Claire, executive 
vice president. "Madlock said flatly that he wouldn't play for the Dodgers. I 
haven't seen Mike's attitude hurting the club. He's frustrated that he hasn't 
played more and that he hasn't played better when he has.

And so, slouched on his stool, he sank his head into his hands and called it 
quits. 
</P>
<P>
Mayweather-Chavez II had become No Mas II. 
</P>
<P>
And Julio Cesar Chavez had become the World Boxing Council super-lightweight 
champion Saturday night at the Forum before an estimated crowd of 14,000. 
Chavez was declared the winner on a 10th-round technical knockout because of 
Mayweather's inability to continue. 
</P>
<P>
The cramps began in the seventh round, according to Mayweather. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't hurt bad," Mayweather said, "but once the cramps took effect, I 
couldn't do much. The pain got down to my liver and it got to the point where I 
couldn't move. I would rather sit than stand there and be a target. Without 
legs, it's pretty hard to move." 
</P>
<P>
Mayweather was behind on all three judges' scorecards, 98-92 on two and 99-92 
on the other. The Times had Chavez ahead, 97-92. Figured in were two points 
deducted from Mayweather by referee Henry Elespuru, one for a low blow in the 
third round and one for holding in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
But when Mayweather made the decision to call it a night two rounds early, his 
manager, Billy Baxter, wasn't in total agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I urged him to get up," Baxter said. "I didn't see him winning the fight. I 
wasn't sending him out to win. But I told him, 'I want you to finish this for 
yourself. I want you to end this fight on your feet, not on the stool.' 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Roger had already had two points deducted and I figured he was down two 
rounds anyway. That's four points, where I come from." 
</P>
<P>
When Elespuru came over to the corner, the dialogue went as follows: 
</P>
<P>
Elespuru: "What's wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
Mayweather: "Cramps". 
</P>
<P>
Elespuru: "What do you think about continuing?" 
</P>
<P>
Mayweather: "I'm having a hard time standing up." 
</P>
<P>
End of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
End of fight. 
</P>
<P>
It proved to be a lot longer, however, than Mayweather-Chavez I. That was four 
years ago in Las Vegas when both Chavez and Mayweather were 130-pounders. That 
one ended on a Chavez knockout in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
This time, both men weighed 140. At least, Chavez did -- on the nose. 
</P>
<P>
Mayweather came in at 138 3/4, and that might explain his cramps. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I came in so light," Mayweather said, "I took a lot of liquids during 
the day, and that may have caused my problem." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez caused a few problems of his own in improving to 63-0 with 51 knockouts. 
The 26-year-old native of Sonora, Mexico, is a four-time world champion. He 
previously won the WBC super-featherweight title and currently holds both the 
WBC and World Boxing Assn. lightweight titles in addition to the one he took 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
And he says he plans to hang on to the lightweight titles. 
</P>
<P>
"I can fight at both 135 pounds and 140," Chavez said through an interpreter. 
"I want to lose both my titles in the ring." 
</P>
<P>
However, it was not vintage Chavez on display Saturday. He missed a lot of 
punches and didn't look nearly as sharp as he has in previous bouts. There were 
no knockdowns, but Chavez seemed to hurt Mayweather several times. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't 100% for this fight," Chavez acknowledged. "Psychologically I was not 
into this fight." 
</P>
<P>
He blamed his lack of concentration on the lawsuit filed a week ago by Azteca 
Promotions against Chavez and promoter Don King. The suit asks for $1.2 
million, claiming that Azecta, not King, had the valid contract to stage this 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Each fighter received $750,000 plus 37 1/2% of the live gate after expenses. 
</P>
<P>
It was an emotional crowd, one of the largest for boxing in recent years at the 
Forum. But that emotion peaked after the seventh round, when the two fighters 
continued to throw blows after the bell, a common occurrence Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, Mayweather's corner got into the action. Trainer Jesse 
Reid, a former quarterback at Cal State Los Angeles, showed he had learned a 
thing or two from the defensive linemen who used to sack him, flying through 
the ropes to grab Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger's head was still up," Reid said, "and Chavez was ready to hit him. I was 
not trying to hurt Chavez, but my fighter was pinned by the referee. I didn't 
throw no punches or nothing. I was just trying to protect my fighter." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Elespuru walked over and told a ringside official, "I want him 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Reid was subsequently ejected and watched the rest of the fight on television 
in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd showered the ring with cups of beer and anything else available. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Chavez declared he was ready to take on either Hector Camacho 
or Meldrick Taylor, the International Boxing Federation 140-pound champion. 
King said a fight with one of them is in the works for late summer. 
</P>
<P>
As for the 28-year-old Mayweather, who is 34-6 with 23 knockouts, he will go 
home to Las Vegas to ponder his future. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got heart," Baxter said. "It's not easy to go out there and fight. 
There's only a few guys who can do that." 
</P>
<P>
But sooner or later, even for those few, the time comes to call it quits. 
</P>
<P>
For Mayweather, that time came on a stool in his corner Saturday night.

EDDIE JOHNSON POWERS SUNS PAST WARRIORS WITH 34 POINTS, 135-99 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
No one is supposed to be able to work the corners like this without being 
arrested. The Phoenix Suns' Eddie Johnson got away without so much as a hand in 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting from deep along the baseline, Johnson made six of eight three-point 
shots and 13 of 20 overall. He scored a game-high 34 points as the Suns beat 
the Golden State Warriors, 135-99, Saturday before a crowd of 15,025 at the 
Oakland Coliseum Arena. The Suns have a three games-to-one lead in the 
best-of-seven NBA Western Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
Right side or left, Johnson slipped away from his defender to launch a 
wide-open jumper. No Warrior could stop him. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes it that much harder to beat them (the Suns) when he shoots the ball 
like that," said Golden State Coach Don Nelson, whose club faces possible 
elimination Tuesday night at Phoenix. "We left him open on some of our traps, 
and when we went back to man-to-man, it didn't matter. He was in a rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
It's not something the Suns took for granted. Chosen last week as the National 
Basketball Assn.'s best sixth man, Johnson was the leading scorer among 
non-starters, averaging 21.5 points. He had averaged 20.2 in the Suns' first 
six playoff games, but, hampered by a calf injury, was shooting only 41.6%, 
including 22.7% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
In the first three games against Golden State, he was two of 10 on three 
pointers and shot 42.4% overall. Saturday, he missed a pair of two-point 
attempts to open the game, but then made seven of the next nine to close the 
first half with 20 points as Phoenix led, 67-61. 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson continued his hot shooting in the second half -- and the Suns went 
on a 19-9 run to open the third quarter -- the Warriors were done. 
</P>
<P>
"This is it," Johnson said, smiling. "I couldn't get frustrated. I've never 
been in this position before, never been in the semifinals, so I didn't want to 
take up my time being frustrated. I was doing the other things all along, like 
rebounding and playing defense, but it is nice to get going offensively." 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, who also got 27 points from Tom Chambers, 19 from Kevin Johnson and 
16 points and a game-high 13 rebounds from Tyrone Corbin, had a return to form 
themselves after winning Game 3 despite shooting 39%. They made 51.5% of their 
attempts Saturday, with Corbin making eight of 12 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We did OK on offense, but they made us look like a high school team," Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if anyone could have beaten them tonight. We weren't that bad." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors weren't that good either. They were outrebounded, 74-51, and shot 
26.4% (14 of 53) in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The only drama that remained by the start of the fourth quarter, with Phoenix 
leading 102-83, was whether Ralph Sampson, the most invisible 7-foot-4, 
$1.96-million-a-year person in the world, would play. The crowd got into the 
moment, no doubt realizing it was all they had left. 
</P>
<P>
They chanted, "Ralph, Ralph, Ralph," in hopes that Nelson, his team having been 
outrebounded in this series, 235-179, would insert Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a pretty good idea they had," Nelson said afterward, "and I 
needed some ideas." 
</P>
<P>
So in went Sampson, who did not play at all in the first-round, three-game 
sweep of Utah and had only a 10-minute appearance against Phoenix in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
A victim of the Warriors' turn toward a small lineup, he had four points, four 
rebounds, three turnovers and two fouls in 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know until you get into the game," Sampson said. "I would like to 
try to find out (how he would have fared), but I don't have the ability to put 
myself in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Nelson: "I knew Ralph was sitting there and that he had been playing well, 
especially toward the end of the season. I've made a statement that next year 
will be Ralph's year, not this year, because the team has sort of established 
the way it plays." 
</P>
<P>
Next year appears to be bearing down fast on Golden State, thanks to the Suns 
and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Playoff Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chris Mullin had 28 points and Mitch Richmond 23 for Golden State. No Warrior 
had more than seven rebounds. . . . Phoenix has won nine consecutive on the 
road. If they play the Lakers in the conference final, the series would open at 
the Forum. . . . Warrior center Larry Smith wore a protective mask during the 
first half after suffering a broken nose Thursday in Game 3. He did not use the 
mask in the second half. . . . Don Nelson has twice coached teams back from 3-1 
deficits in the playoffs to at least force a Game 7. Both times, however, the 
Milwaukee Bucks ended up losing, in the 1978 Western Conference semifinals and 
in the 1987 Eastern semifinals.

HERR MAKING DODGERS' CLAIRE LOOK GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Claire, executive vice president of the Dodgers and baseball's executive 
of the year in 1988, apparently was right again when he tabbed Tom Herr to 
replace Steve Sax as the club's second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Herr is batting .341, second in the National League to Will Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Claire and the Dodgers, though, Herr is doing it with the 
Philadelphia Phillies. He rejected the Dodgers' offers to sign with the team 
closest to his hometown, Lancaster, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Claire had been so convinced that he was about to sign Herr that he had the 
publicity department prepare a news release. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred did everything he could to sign me," Herr said the other day. "At one 
point he even said, 'What will it take to get you to come here?' In essence, he 
was saying I could write my own contract. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to pass up and my wife and I spent a lot of time talking about it. 
I'd have probably gone if I was younger, but at this point in my career we felt 
that a major family move like that wasn't in our best interest." 
</P>
<P>
Herr, 33, signed a two-year contract at $825,000 a year with the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Claire then made a futile offer to Ron Oester, who remained with the Cincinnati 
Reds; tried in vain to trade for Wally Backman, whom the New York Mets later 
traded to the Minnesota Twins, and finally signed New York Yankee free agent 
Willie Randolph, now hitting .226. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything about the Dodger offer was better than the Phillies' offer," Herr 
said. "From a pure business standpoint, I was foolish to pass it up. And from a 
professional standpoint, I was rejecting a club that had a chance to win again. 
But those considerations just weren't at the top of my priority list when 
weighed against the value I placed on playing at home." 
</P>
<P>
Herr is a .273 lifetime hitter who spent eight-plus seasons with the St. Louis 
Cardinals, contributing to three pennant winners with bat, glove and a quiet 
intensity that is now said to have contributed to a new attitude in the 
Philadelphia clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody expects him to keep hitting what he's hitting now, but even if he hits 
.300 it won't be close to the No. 1 thing he's brought to this team," pitcher 
Don Carman said. "What he's brought to this team is the idea of what it takes 
to be a winning club." 
</P>
<P>
Defined by Carman: A strengthening of relationships on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
Herr has his personal goals as well. Traded to Minnesota for Tom Brunansky last 
year, then sidelined twice by a leg injury, he wants to erase the memory of a 
.263 average with the Twins and the negativity that accompanied it. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here feeling I was on a personal mission," Herr said. "I read a lot of 
reports that I was slowing down, that I wasn't the player I once was. There was 
a lot of negative press in Minnesota. I wanted to reverse that sentiment and I 
worked harder than I ever have during the winter." 
</P>
<P>
Can he keep it up? Can he continue to hit .341? That might have been easier 
with a defending World Series winner like the Dodgers, who figure to be more of 
a pennant threat than the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
"There's excitement every day when your team's in the race," Herr said. "It's 
harder to get up when it's not. It's harder to go out there with the same 
intensity. My off years have coincided with my team's off years and I can't 
ignore that." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schmidt also rejected the Dodgers to stay with the Phillies. He has talked 
about how he was romanced by Tom Lasorda at a time when he was coming off 
shoulder surgery for a torn rotator cuff and it appeared he might have to play 
first base rather than third. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers eventually traded for Eddie Murray, and Schmidt, saluting the 
acquisition of a younger, switch-hitting superstar willing to move, returned to 
third base at Veterans Stadium, removing the cynics' doubts in the process. 
</P>
<P>
At 39, Schmidt has driven in 24 runs and hit six homers for a career total of 
548. 
</P>
<P>
He says he is 99.9% sure that this will be his last year, that the lure of 
joining Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays as the only players to have hit 
600 homers is not strong enough to make him continue. 
</P>
<P>
"If everything broke right I might, but I'm ready to move on, to get the ball 
rolling in another direction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a great run and I'm grateful for that and the money I've made, but 
it's time to start leading a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still a damn good hitter but only an adequate player and I don't have the 
get up and go I once had. I've had four knee operations and several other 
operations. There's been a lot of wear and tear. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I'll be 40 when the season is over and, God willing, I'll have another 
40 years. Hopefully, there's another position for me in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt mentioned managing, broadcasting, the front office. 
</P>
<P>
His ultimate choice? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to move to Florida and run an expansion club," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If, indeed, this is Schmidt's last year, he will leave with the satisfaction of 
having come back from the shoulder injury but the frustration of having been 
caught in a rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
So close, but yet so far, he said of the Phillies, who have won only one game 
in which they scored fewer than five runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have a great offensive team," he said. "If we had a pitching staff with 
the horses that the Dodgers do, we might walk away with it. Pitchers win the 
games, the pennants, the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
Two veteran members of the Kansas City Royals are also weighing their futures. 
</P>
<P>
George Brett, recovering from torn knee ligaments, isn't sure he wants to risk 
another injury on what he perceives to be a dangerous carpet at Royals Stadium. 
He may ask to become a designated hitter or to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Wilson, 33, batting .180 with an on-base percentage of .255 before a 
weekend series with the Texas Rangers, isn't sure he still has a baseball 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm totally frustrated now," the center fielder said. "I feel lousy before, 
during and after the game. If this continues I don't know what the answer is. I 
don't know whether I'm just losing some skills or am too old, period." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brett: "I remember the first words I said to (Royal management after his 
latest injury). I told them they could take this turf and stick it. I'll never 
play on it for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
He may not have a choice, however. 
</P>
<P>
"How can I get off the stuff when I have four years left on my contract?" he 
said. "I have a lot of thinking to do. We'll see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
One of baseball's procedural rules will be satisfied by the May 25 hearing that 
Pete Rose and his attorneys have been invited to by commissioner Bart Giammati. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another rule, if violated, that could form the basis for a 
due-process suit that Rose is believed to be considering if he is suspended for 
gambling activities. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has the right to cross-examine witnesses, but most of the testimony 
against him is believed to come from several men who are serving prison 
sentences, or soon will be, for felonies such as drug trafficking and income 
tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
Will those witnesses be called to the hearing? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a possibility," deputy commissioner Fay Vincent said. "The decision will 
be made on what happens between now and then." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Padres' spring optimism has faded amid the futility of their 
offense. The Padres need that one more hitter they keep pursuing -- Jim 
Presley, Wade Boggs, Dale Murphy, Lenny Dykstra -- but can't land. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark, the one hitter they did land, was batting .200 before a weekend 
series in New York, but the more telling statistic is that he led the National 
League in walks. The hitters who were asked to protect Clark, batting behind 
him, were hitting a combined .179. 
</P>
<P>
All-Star catcher Benito Santiago was hitting .204, John Kruk was on the 
disabled list and, as a team, the Padres were 11th in the league, leading only 
the Dodgers, with a batting average of .231. 
</P>
<P>
"We went into the season telling our pitchers to hold teams to three runs and 
we'd win," Manager Jack McKeon said. "The way we're going, we better hold them 
to one." 
</P>
<P>
Added Clark: "Now we know why (former manager) Larry Bowa made out 96 different 
lineups." 
</P>
<P>
Despite denials, the New York Mets are apparently still tantalized by the 
potential availability of Seattle Mariner left-hander Mark Langston but 
concerned that Langston would want a larger contract than Dwight Gooden, who 
received $6.7 million for three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't care, give it to him," said Gooden. "The $6.7 million is what I 
asked for. In a couple years, I'll be knocking on the door again anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Ozzie Smith of the St. Louis Cardinals is in the final year of a 
four-year, $8 million contract, a $2-million average, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals have offered the same average in a two-year, $4-million 
extension. Smith, however, contends that he is being asked to take a cut based 
on his actual 1989 salary of $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
He also wants a three-year deal and says he will need more money to accept a 
two. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've done anything to warrant being cut," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The challenging position resulting from the Chicago Cubs' strong start is 
likely to prove temporary while right fielder Andre Dawson recovers from knee 
surgery and center fielder Jerome Walton rehabilitates a torn hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson and Walton went down on successive days last week, leaving the Cubs a 
powerless outfield of Mitch Webster, Dwight Smith and Doug Dascenzo, and 
leaving General Manager Jim Frey convinced that estimates of the farm system's 
rebirth under predecessor Dallas Green have been significantly overstated. 
</P>
<P>
Frey's view is that the cupboard is bare except for a few pitchers and position 
players, all built along the lines of the 5-foot-8 Dascenzo and 5-11 Smith. 
</P>
<P>
When Cardinal reliever Dan Quisenberry batted for only the third time in his 
career the other day against San Francisco, he picked up his front foot while 
swinging. 
</P>
<P>
"Mel Ott did it and it worked for him," Quisenberry said. "Of course, I wasn't 
sure I was picking up the right foot."

How Do You Figure?: Dave Stewart of the Oakland Athletics was 8-0 when he lost 
his first game to the Baltimore Orioles last season and 6-0 when he lost his 
first to the Orioles this season. He is 47-21 against the rest of the league 
since the start of the 1987 season and 0-5 against the Orioles.

<P>
No Jose: In Jose Canseco's absence, A's right fielders began a weekend series 
with the Milwaukee Brewers with no home runs, 14 runs batted in and a .256 
average. Then there's designated hitter Dave Parker, who had 11 RBIs in the 
first 10 games of the season but has had only one since April 13. 
</P>
<P>
Home Sweet Home?The Houston Astros, who have not had a losing season in the

Janet Evans ended her high school career with a national high school record, 
but a Southern Section team championship eluded her for the fourth consecutive 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos High School won its second consecutive 3-A division title Saturday 
night at the Belmont Plaza pool in Long Beach. San Marino also repeated as 
boys' champion. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who won three gold medals in the 1988 Olympics, broke her own mark in 
the 200-yard individual medley with a time of 1 minute 59.96 seconds. Evans set 
the record of 2:00.72 last season during the 3-A meet. 
</P>
<P>
Evans also won the 500 freestyle in 4:38.34, which was a second off her 
national high school record of 4:37.30, which she set last year. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos' depth proved to be too much in the team competition as it 
finished with 195 points. Evans' El Dorado team was second with 104 points. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino rallied late in the meet to retain its title. The Titans won the 
last two individual events -- the 100 backstroke and 100 breaststroke -- and 
finished with 179 points. Damien was second with 132 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A boys' meet, Woodbridge and San Luis Obispo tied for first with 82 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Hundeby of Woodbridge won the 200 freestyle (1:38.45) and 500 freestyle 
(4:25.29). 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills won the girls' competition with 173 points. Amy Ward of Trabuco 
Hills won the 200 freestyle with a time of 1:50.

St. Louis County police arrested James Wilder, Tampa Bay Buccaneers running 
back, and booked him on a misdemeanor drug offense after stopping his car on 
Interstate 270 early Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder, 31, a former Missouri star who is Tampa Bay's career rushing leader, 
was later released, officer Linda Guccione said, but his 1989 Mercedes was 
confiscated pending laboratory tests on a substance taken from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"Since it was not a felony, I'm sure the substance was marijuana," said 
Guccione, who added that two passengers in Wilder's car, neither of them 
identified, were also booked.

U.S. GETS TIED UP ON WAY TO WORLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Goalie David Vanole of the U.S. national soccer team fell to his knees and 
pounded his head against the ground after giving up the tying goal in a World 
Cup qualifying match against Trinidad and Tobago Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Vanole had good reason to feel frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
Only two minutes away from defeating Trinidad and Tobago, the United States 
allowed a goal that not only tied the game but jeopardized its chances of 
advancing to the 1990 World Cup in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Hutson Charles scored in the 88th minute as Trinidad and Tobago tied 
the United States, 1-1, before an estimated 10,000 fans at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
Charles' goal was the result of a cleaver play by teammates Marlon Morris and 
Brian Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Williams headed the ball to Morris, who drew two U.S. defenders to him with a 
fake that left Charles to face Vanole alone. 
</P>
<P>
Charles slid a left-footed kick past Vanole's outstretched arms to touch off a 
wild celebration among Trinidad and Tobago's fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I just blew it," Vanole said. "It happened so fast. I don't know how they got 
the ball to him so fast." 
</P>
<P>
Vanole, who preserved a 1-0 victory over Costa Rica when he blocked a penalty 
kick in a World Cup qualifying match last month at St. Louis, thinks he could 
have stopped Charles' shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It was savable," Vanole said. "It should have been saved. I didn't think it 
was an extraordinary shot." 
</P>
<P>
Defender Steve Trittschuh, who was out of position on the play, said the goal 
was the result of a defensive lapse. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a letdown," Trittschuh said. "We weren't tired but I could feel us 
letting down. I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
After the United States was unable to score in the final two minutes, Trinidad 
and Tobago, which had not beaten the United States in five previous matches, 
celebrated as if it had won. The tie hurts the United States' chances of 
qualifying for the World Cup for the first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has three points in three World Cup qualifying games, 
has the difficult task of making up points on the road in its remaining 
matches. A victory is worth two points and a tie is worth one point. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like a loss," said midfielder Tab Ramos, who retired with 30 
minutes left because of a sore knee. "We got one point but we should have 
gotten two. Now we have to go out on the road and get points." 
</P>
<P>
Trittschuh gave the United States a 1-0 lead only three minutes into the second 
half when he scored on a brilliant effort. 
</P>
<P>
Trittschuh controlled a crossing pass from Ramos with his chest, then turned 
and beat goalie Earl Carter with a 12-yard volley into the roof of the net. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States seemed to go into a shell after the goal. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attack seemed to falter after Jim Gabarra replaced Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
"Tab is a key for us," U.S. Coach Bob Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which outshot Trinidad and Tobago, 16-13, failed to 
capitalize on several scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Bruce Murray had the best chance. He missed a 1 1/2-foot shot in the 
31st minute, kicking it wide of the net.

CARPENTER AND GORSKI UPSTAGED BY CANADIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Curt Harnett of Thunder Bay, Canada, upstaged U.S. Olympians Ken Carpenter and 
Mark Gorski Saturday to win the men's match sprints in the Sundance Grand Prix 
of Cycling at the Olympic Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Harnett, a former hockey player who originally took up cycling to keep in shape 
in the summer, defeated Carpenter in the best-of-three final, overtaking the 
reigning U.S. champion in the final 50 meters of the third race. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter set the pace in the decisive race, pulling ahead of the Canadian 
champion with about 1 1/2 laps remaining in the three-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
"I was attacking him from behind, trying to get underneath him and get in front 
of him with about half a lap to go," Harnett said of Carpenter, who was 
eliminated from the competition by Harnett last year at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Harnett, who will be 24 today, never did get underneath Carpenter, instead 
passing on the outside as the riders came off the last turn. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had a little bit more than him," Harnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorski, who was beaten by Carpenter in the semifinals, finished fourth, losing 
in the third-place match to Paul Swift of Kenosha, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
In other finals: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Connie Paraskevin Young of Indianapolis, a three-time world champion in the 
event and a bronze medalist last year in the Seoul Olympics, won the women's 
match sprints, beating Carpenter's fiance, Renee Duprel of Bellevue, Wash., in 
the best-of-three final, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dan Frost of Denmark, gold medalist in the points race at Seoul, won the 
men's individual pursuit, essentially a race against the clock in which the 
competitors start at opposite ends of the track and attempt to catch one 
another. Frost, 27, was the only track cycling gold medalist at Seoul who was 
not from an Eastern-bloc country. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Madonna Harris of Park City, Utah, who competed last year for her native 
New Zealand in the women's road race at Seoul and in cross-country skiing at 
the Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, won the women's pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shaun Wallace of England, a former world-record holder in the flying 
one-kilometer time trial, won the men's miss and out, a race of attrition in 
which the last rider across the line at the end of each lap is eliminated from 
the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Swift won the men's keirin, a six-lap race in which the riders are led 
around the track for all but the last 400 meters of the competition by a pace 
vehicle, in this case a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Swift finished about half a bike length in front of Nelson Vails, who was the 
silver medalist in the match sprints at the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Duprel won the women's 10-kilometer points race. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing second in the points race was Janie Eickhoff, 18, of Los Alamitos, 
who was third in the sprints, third in the pursuit and, on Thursday night, won 
the miss and out. 
</P>
<P>
More than two hours after the event was completed Friday night, race officials 
determined that Frost, who won the event at a longer distance at Seoul, was the 
winner of the 30-kilometer men's point race.

NEWSWIRE: PHINNEY WINS SECOND CONSECUTIVE TOUR RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Davis Phinney won his second consecutive race, and Belgium's Eric Vanderaerden 
narrowed the lead of Norway's Dag Otto Lauritzen to less than a minute Saturday 
during the ninth stage of the Tour de Trump bicycle race in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Phinney, of Boulder, Colo., who won the Arlington Circuit Race Friday -- the 
first victory by an American -- came out of a pack with 300 meters remaining to 
win the 51-mile Baltimore Criterium in 1 hour 42 minutes 35 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Phinney's margin of victory was announced as one inch in a photo finish. He and 
Vanderaerden crossed the line on opposite sides of the street. West German 
amateur Rolf Aldag was third in the same time as the winner. 
</P>
<P>
"(Vanderaerden) really surged at the end," said Phinney, who was beaten four 
times earlier in the race by the Belgian star. "I wasn't sure if I got it. Now 
I am sure because I saw the photo." 
</P>
<P>
Vanderaerden, who has won four stages and has twice finished second, trails 
Lauritzen by 50 seconds entering today's final time trial stage in Atlantic 
City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderaerden's teammate, Henk Lubberding of the Netherlands, is second, 28 
seconds back.

Pete Rose be suspended for gambling.

"I saw it as a slap in the face," said coach Tommy Helms, who has managed the

Schott told the Cincinnati Enquirer: "To be frank, I don't think we have any

BLUSHING JOHN KEEPS ALL OF HIS SHOES ON, BEATS PROPER REALITY 
</P>

<P>
In his last race, the Oaklawn Handicap in Arkansas a month ago, Blushing John 
lost a shoe leaving the gate and still finished fourth, beaten by only two 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at Pimlico, Blushing John took better care of his footwear and through 
the stretch he was a study in footwork. He shook off a familiar rival, Proper 
Reality, near the sixteenth pole and rolled to a two-length victory in 
track-record time in the $700,000 Pimlico Special before 16,211 fans in cool, 
overcast weather. 
</P>
<P>
While winning $420,000 for his owner, Allen Paulson, the 4-year-old colt ran 1 
3/16 miles in 1:53 1/5, breaking by a fifth of a second the official record 
that Tank's Prospect set in winning the Preakness in 1985. The Daily Racing 
Form also credited Secretariat with a 1:53 2/5 when he won the Preakness in 
1973. A suspect track timer clocked the eventual Triple Crown winner in only 
1:55. 
</P>
<P>
By finishing ahead of Proper Reality for the third time in less than two 
months, Blushing John sent Pat Day to a winner's circle that the red-haired 
jockey would like to return to next Saturday, after he rides Easy Goer in the 
Preakness. Easy Goer and Day were upset by Sunday Silence in the Kentucky Derby 
and have a rematch coming up at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is a prelude to next week," Day said Saturday, before catching a 
plane to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Blushing John's record came on a track that was wet earlier in the week and 
then dried out to become lightning-fast Saturday. Cheaper horses were routinely 
running six furlongs in times under 1:11, on a track where the record of 1:09 
1/5 has stood for almost 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Blushing John carried 117 pounds, one less than Proper Reality, who went off at 
a surprising 13-1. After Proper Reality, it was 1 1/4 lengths back to Granacus, 
an 80-1 shot who finished a half-length ahead of Cryptoclearance. Top-weighted 
at 123 pounds, Cryptoclearance and his stablemate, Lustra, were the 8-5 
favorites. Cryptoclearance was typically sluggish in the early going, trailing 
the pace-setting Slew City Slew by about 20 lengths going down the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
Following Cryptoclearance to the finish line, in order, were Brian's Time, 
Saratoga Passage, Stalwars, Slew City Slew, Templar Hill, Lively One and Little 
Bold John. Lustra, running in the race solely to make sure that Slew City Slew 
didn't run off to an uncontested early lead, broke poorly and after running 
with Slew City Slew for three-quarters of a mile was eased by jockey Tony 
Graell. 
</P>
<P>
Blushing John paid $16.20, $11 and $8.40. Proper Reality paid $13.40 and $10 
and Granacus returned $15.40. 
</P>
<P>
Paulson, an aerospace executive who has farms in California, Kentucky and 
Georgia, privately bought Blushing John, a son of Blushing Groom and La Griffe, 
for $850,000 as a yearling. The horse was bred in Kentucky, but began his 
racing career in 1987 in Europe. There he won two of six starts, including a 
major race in France as a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Blushing John's first American appearance was a 10th-place finish in the 
Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs last November. This spring, trainer Dick 
Lundy took Blushing John to Arkansas and raced him on dirt for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"He had trained so well on dirt," Lundy said. "He had a good foot for it, and 
the first time we ever breezed him, at our training center in California, he 
handled the dirt super." 
</P>
<P>
Blushing John won an allowance race at Oaklawn Park, then moved into stakes 
competition there. He won the Razorback Handicap, finishing 4 1/2 lengths ahead 
of Proper Reality, who ran third as the 1-5 favorite. Slew City Slew beat both 
of those horses with a wire-to-wire performance in the roughly run Oaklawn 
Handicap, with Blushing John finishing fourth and Proper Reality fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"He blew a shoe in the first jump that day," Day said of Blushing John on 
Saturday. "He over-reached and lost it. So he had to run the race with three 
shoes. Today he had a faultless trip and he responded big when I asked him."

Blushing John and Proper Reality were close to each other throughout the race 
Saturday. "We couldn't have been more than three or four feet away from each 
other all the way, until the other horse pulled away," said Jerry Bailey, 
Proper Reality's jockey. "We didn't plan it that way, that's just the way it 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
There were fast fractions of 1:10 for six furlongs and 1:34 2/5 for a mile. 
Slew City Slew held the lead over Lustra and Little Bold John starting down the 
backstretch, with Blushing John and Proper Reality in close pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
Turning for home, Slew City Slew started to weaken, and from the eighth pole 
home, it was a two-horse race. Proper Reality, on the inside but well away from 
the rail, drifted out slightly and brushed with Blushing John as they neared 
the sixteenth pole. However, the contact didn't faze the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Blushing John has a bright future on both dirt and grass, especially since he 
now knows how to run with all of his shoes on his feet. 
</P>

Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Dick Lundy said there are no immediate plans for Blushing John, but the 
next objective is the Arlington Million, on the grass, on Sept. 3. . . . 
Imbibe, who finished second to Fire Maker in the Withers at Belmont Park last 
Wednesday, was in but is now out of next Saturday's Preakness. Imbibe's next 
race probably will be the Peter Pan at Belmont on May 28. . . . Northern Wolf 
is now a Preakness starter and Jo Jo Ladner, who rode him to a sixth-place 
finish in the Kentucky Derby, retains the mount. Ladner is currently serving a 
five- day suspension from the stewards at Churchill Downs for what they called 
a "careless" ride in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Other Preakness starters are expected to be Sunday Silence, Easy Goer, Dansil, 
Hawkster, Houston, Pulverizing and Rock Point. . . . Sunday Silence, the Derby 
winner, might work five furlongs at Pimlico on Tuesday. . . . In other stakes 
at Pimlico Saturday, Kent Desormeaux rode Thirty Eight Go Go, at 2-5, to a 
three-length victory over Double Bunctious in the $100,000 Geisha Handicap and 
Montoya, under Laffit Pincay, paid $4 for winning the $37,450 Miss Preakness by 
2 1/2 lengths over Another Boom and Cojinx, who dead-heated for second.

<P>
By a vote of 174 to 231, the House defeated legislation (HR 1149) allowing 
members of Congress to mail copies of the Constitution bearing their name to 
all households back home. The bill sought to ease franking, or free-mail, rules 
to permit the one-time mass mailing at a projected cost of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Lindy Boggs (D-La.) said the mailing would be "a great service to all 
of the people of the United States" in this bicentennial year of the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) called the bill "another congressional 
boondoggle . . . another chance to make ourselves look good at our 
constituents' expense." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

The 1990 Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 263 to 157, the House approved a fiscal 1990 congressional budget 
resolution that envisions $1.17 trillion in spending, $1.07 trillion in 
revenues and a deficit of about $99.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The measure (HR 106) will guide House and Senate action on individual spending 
bills for the year beginning Oct. 1, and prod Congress toward 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction goals. It also states congressional and 
presidential priorities for defense, foreign and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking major tax increases or spending cuts, the House budget was widely 
viewed as a status quo plan that repeats the congressional pattern of pushing 
tough fiscal decisions into the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) voiced support of the measure even though "we lacked 
the political will on both sides of the aisle to bite the bullet." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Schuette (R-Mich.) called the plan "a coverup for inaction, 
postponing for tomorrow . . . real deficit reduction." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the fiscal 1990 budget plan.

Budget Freeze 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 30 to 393, the House rejected a budget substitute seeking greater 
deficit reduction primarily at the expense of domestic programs. The amendment 
by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) sought a 1990 deficit of $91.1 billion rather than 
the $99.7 billion targeted by the congressional budget resolution (above). It 
sought to curb Medicare outlays and block inflation-adjusted increases in 
certain non-entitlement domestic programs, and reaffirmed the defense spending 
freeze already a part of the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the substitute.

Oil Import Fee 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 49 to 373 to reject an alternative fiscal 1990 budget, proposed 
by Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) that sought to increase federal revenue by $9 
billion annually by levying a fee on imported oil. About $3.2 billion of the 
yield was to have been applied to deficit reduction and the remainder to 
domestic initiatives such as anti-drug and anti-poverty programs. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported a federal fee on imported oil.

SHOULD WOOD ROOFS BE BANNED?; 
</P>
<P>
YES; 
</P>
<P>
MOST HOMES LOST TO FIRE SINCE 1961 HAD THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAL BERNSON, Los Angeles Councilman Hal Bernson, a member of the council's 
Police, Fire and Public Safety Committee, is the author of the proposed 
wood-roof ban. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City of Los Angeles has taken progressive steps to protect its citizens and 
their property from brush and structure fires, especially in areas of high 
winds, dense brush and native vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
Of continuing concern in these areas are wood roofs, which have been identified 
as being a major contributing factor in fires. Most of the 931 homes damaged or 
destroyed in the City of Los Angeles during major brush fires since 1961 had 
wood roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Examples of fires involving wood roofs include Santa Barbara, 1977 -- 234 homes 
destroyed; Anaheim, 1982 -- 362 apartment units; San Diego, 1985 -- 87 homes; 
Pebble Beach, 1987 -- 31 homes, and Houston, 1979 -- 26 apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Further, during last December's Porter Ranch-Granada Hills brush fire, 16 of 17 
wood roof homes on one street alone were damaged or destroyed. In every 
instance, the wood roof surface was the first to ignite and in many cases 
contributed to the fire exposure of other homes through radiated heat or flying 
brands. 
</P>
<P>
Although these roofs were not pressure-impregnated as required by the present 
building code, adopted in 1982, they were treated by the hand-dip process, 
which at one time was accepted by the city of Los Angeles in conformance with 
the 1970 building code. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of these roofs, which were less than 20 years old, raised a serious 
question: 
</P>
<P>
Will the pressure-impregnated wood roof provide an adequate level of fire 
protection throughout the life of the roof? 
</P>
<P>
The wood shake and shingle industry has developed several methods that have 
improved the fire retardancy of wood roofs. However, the dry Santa Ana winds 
subject even the new pressure-treated shakes and shingles to adverse conditions 
not experienced during tests. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the test requires only a 10-year natural weathering test for wood 
shakes or shingles. This is not an adequate testing period, because most wood 
roofs in Southern California will last between 20 to 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
So far, approved pressure-impregnated wood roofs have passed only the five-year 
natural weathering test; the 10-year test is scheduled for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
There is existing residential development in the mountains and 
high-wind-velocity areas in the city that interface with brush, and there will 
be development there in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The effectiveness of the Fire Department is extremely compromised in these 
areas, which typically have a limited water supply and limited access. 
</P>
<P>
Fires that ignite roof brands and winds that propel these burning roof 
fragments ignite spot fires several blocks away from the original source. 
</P>
<P>
Because of these conditions, wood shake or shingle roofs should be banned in 
the mountain fire districts, fire buffer zones and restricted roof zones of Los 
Angeles, which cover those parts of the city that experience increased fire 
danger due to climate, geography and topography. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, when more than 10% of a roof in these restricted areas is 
replaced, the entire roof would be required to be brought up to code. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, wood shake or shingle roof covering systems in use in all other areas 
of the city must undergo and satisfactorily pass fire-retardancy tests for a 
period of 20 years to retain approved status as a roof covering. 
</P>
<P>
This potential of igniting roof surfaces and producing flying brands will 
continue to be a major contributing factor in the spread of fires unless a ban 
on new wood roofs is passed. The citizens can no longer afford the risk that 
wood roofs in mountainous, windy areas impose.

CEDAR SHINGLES CAN BE AS SAFE AS ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL FAVRO, Phil Favro was California state fire marshal from 1975 to 1983, 
when he led the fight to ban standard wood roofs in hazardous areas. He is now 
a fire safety consultant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shipbuilders in the mid-19th century scoffed at the notion that vessels could 
be made of steel. Everybody knew steel was heavier than water; steel boats 
would sink like stones. 
</P>
<P>
Today we are seeing this same logic being applied by some public officials to 
the subject of wood roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Because everybody "knows" wood burns, these officials reject overwhelming 
evidence that pressure-impregnated cedar shakes are as safe for homes in Los 
Angeles as any other fire-retardant roofing material. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson and others cite last year's fires in Granada Hills as 
"proof" that wood roofs are unsafe. Actually the roofs involved in those -- and 
other major Southern California fires -- were not composed of 
pressure-impregnated fire-retardant shakes and are not permitted under the 
current building codes. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the City Council is now considering a ban on all wood roofs in 
hillside areas, despite the fact that Los Angeles already has one of the most 
restrictive ordinances in the nation, one that bans standard wood roofing 
materials everywhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
As a former state fire marshal and current fire safety consultant to the shake 
and shingle industry, I oppose this proposed ban and I support existing codes 
that allow pressure-impregnated fire-retardant cedar shakes and shingles. 
</P>
<P>
These materials, after undergoing a series of rigorous tests developed by 
Underwriter's Laboratories, have been certified to meet all current 
requirements for fire-retardant roofs. Since passage of this ordinance in 1982, 
not one fire involving a fire-retardant wood roof has been reported. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in the 25 years that such materials have been available, I am aware of 
no pressure-impregnated fire-retardant wood roof anywhere in the United States 
that has either caught fire from external causes such as flying embers or 
thrown off burning embers to ignite other roofs. 
</P>
<P>
But how can this be? Everybody "knows" wood burns. The answer is that modern 
science has found a way to block the process that permits wood to burn. 
</P>
<P>
Wood is made up of microscopic cellulose straws held together by lignin, a 
polymer that acts as a glue and binder. When wood grows, small spaces called 
lumens are formed, creating a kind of honeycomb in the wood's cellular 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
To make wood shakes fire retardant, they are put into a vacuum chamber that 
pulls all air from the lumens. Then they're immersed in a fire-retardant 
substance and put under pressure, forcing the fire-retardant into the lumens at 
the very core of the wood. The shakes are then heated in a kiln and cured for 
several days, locking in the retardant. Once there, there is virtually no way 
to remove the fire-retardant substance. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Forest Service has been testing pressure-impregnated shakes and 
shingles at its Wisconsin laboratories since 1976, exposing them to flames and 
burning embers in simulated wind conditions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they have exposed the shakes to more than 10 years of weathering 
in the harsh Wisconsin climate. Yet the shakes retain their fire-retardancy and 
all evidence indicates the retardancy will last for the life of the wood. 
</P>
<P>
Cedar shakes have long been the roofing materials of choice for thousands of 
hillside homeowners who appreciate their blend of durability, insulation 
qualities and rustic attractiveness. Recognizing the public's concern over fire 
safety, the industry has spent millions of dollars to develop a product that 
would meet more stringent fire codes in areas like Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed City Council ban is heedless of this effort and oblivious to hard 
scientific evidence. The council is right to be concerned about fire safety in 
the hillsides, but supporters of the ban on fire-retardant wood roofs have 
picked the wrong target.

IN THE GARDEN: GARDENING;

<P>
SPLASHING SOME COLOR ON THOSE SHADY SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, Times Garden Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California gardens are growing up and, as a result, are getting 
shadier and shadier as trees (and some houses with their second story 
additions) cast longer or deeper shadows. What do you plant in these shady 
gardens? You begin with shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
Camellias can be the backbone of any shady garden, excelling on the north side 
of the house or under trees that are not too dense. 
</P>
<P>
A shrub called yesterday-today-and-tomorrow, Brunfelsia pauciflora 
'Floribunda,' looks somewhat like a camellia and grows to about the same size 
but has flowers that turn purple, then fade to lavender and finally white 
(hence the common name). 
</P>
<P>
It grows in shade too but does best where it gets some sun. It flowers a little 
later in spring than the camellias. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrangeas are another candidate for a shady garden and they are especially 
valuable because they flower well after the camellias and azaleas, carrying the 
show into summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Color Depends on Soil 
</P>
<P>
But, if you want a blue hydrangea, you had better buy it in flower. Hydrangeas 
must be forced to turn blue in California because the color is dependant on an 
acid soil, and ours is at best neutral and at worst alkaline. In New Zealand 
and in Seattle, where the soils are quite acid, they naturally turn a bright, 
even brilliant blue. 
</P>
<P>
If you scatter aluminum sulfate (sold at nurseries) around the base of a 
hydrangea before it makes buds and then once again when the buds are about 
half-size, you may turn the flowers blue. 
</P>
<P>
In my experience, not all hydrangeas will turn blue so that is why it is best 
to buy one that is blue to begin with. Otherwise, you will have pink hydrangeas 
and, unfortunately, it is not a soft baby-pink but a slightly unpleasant shade 
of the color. You can also take the safe route and plant a white-flowered 
hydrangea. White flowers are particularly visible in the shade. 
</P>
<P>
Camellias, azaleas, brunfelsia and hydrangeas like a rich, porous soil such as 
you might find on a forest floor. Before planting, mix in bags of organic soil 
amendment such as redwood or ground bark. I usually till in a 6-inch layer of 
amendment, that has been spread on top, to a depth of about a foot. This is a 
lot of bags-full. 
</P>
<P>
Abutilons are nearly perfect shrubs for a shady situation, and unlike the 
hydrangeas, they will also take a direct blast of sun during the day without 
wilting. They broaden the palette by blooming primarily in winter and early 
spring. No other plant in my garden flowers as long -- 10 months by my count -- 
and it is one of the few plants that grows quickly to its appointed size and 
then seems to stop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Colors Available 
</P>
<P>
Mine grow to about 6 or 8 feet and then stay there, and they get to that size 
in about a year, with lots of water and fertilizer. The best have large, 
bell-like flowers but smallish leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Others have small flowers and some very large leaves -- they are a varied lot. 
They come in many colors, from pink, through red, to yellow and orange. They 
are not common at nurseries so you must hunt a little to find a good one. 
</P>
<P>
Another champion shrub for the shade, even deep shade, is the dark, 
glossy-green Japanese aucuba. The gold-splattered variegated varieties are the 
most popular but I have always found them difficult to grow. Not so the plain 
green variety named 'Serratifolia.' Aucubas are as slow as a freight train, so 
don't expect a big shrub for many years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough as Nails 
</P>
<P>
If you need one more big shrub to round out your shade planting, try 
Pittosporum tobira 'Variegata,' a two-toned shrub that is tough as nails though 
in two years it will grow to 6 feet across and they can grow to 15 feet. They 
don't grow too tall, however, and pruning can keep them smaller. 
</P>
<P>
The cream-splashed leaves look like shafts of sunlight in the shade. If you 
want something smaller, try 'Turner's Variegated Dwarf' (from Hines wholesale 
nursery), a new dwarf variegated pittosporum that should grow to about 4 feet 
tall by 6 feet wide. It is a cream-splattered version of 'Wheeler's Dwarf,' a 
plain, green-leaved pittosporum that also takes shade and grows to about 6 or 8 
feet across, but only 4 or 5 feet tall. It does fine on the north side of the 
house and can stand sun, so it is a good bet to plant farther away from the 
house where the ground is in shadow all winter, but is sunny in summer as it 
climbs higher in the sky.

VACATIONS TAKE A TOLL ON HOUSE PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House plants can sicken when their owners are away on vacation if some special 
provisions aren't made for them. 
</P>
<P>
Plants can suffer from just a few days of neglect and adverse indoor 
conditions. Follow these simple prescriptions from Decorating magazine on how 
to keep a green thumb when vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If plant owners are leaving for only a weekend, they should water 
everything thoroughly before they go, and let it drain. Standing water will 
invite rot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To reduce water requirements, raise the humidity level around plants by 
grouping them in shallow trays lined with an inch of pebbles and a half-inch of 
water. Don't let the bottoms of the pots touch the water. 
</P>
<P>
 -- People leaving for several days should gather plants in a bright place but 
out of direct sunlight. Set up grow lights and, with an automatic timer, give 
plants 14 hours of light each day. Setting the timer to turn lights on at night 
will help the house look occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avoid feeding plants before leaving home. Fertilizing stimulates growth and 
requires high levels of plant energy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To minimize plant stress, remove any dead or dying foliage and flower buds, 
as well as any buds that would open. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In winter, set the thermostat no lower than 60 degrees to prevent freezing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the summer, many tropical house plants will take care of themselves and 
even benefit from being placed outdoors in a shady, protected spot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Indoor self-watering devices can be purchased in garden supply stores, or 
automatic watering systems can be easily made. For best results, set a pail of 
water in the center of a circle of pots. For each pot, cut a length of nylon 
wicking or old nylon stockings; bury one end in the soil and extend the other 
to the bottom of the pail of water. The nylon will act as a wick, slowly 
transferring water from the pail to the pot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Plastic tents can drastically reduce the water needs of plants. Place 
several small pots in a dry-cleaning bag, and hold the plastic away from plant 
foliage with sticks or bent hangers. For a large plant, use a painter's plastic 
drop cloth. 
</P>
<P>
Secure the plastic around the top of the container with masking or 
electrician's tape. Make a few slits for air circulation. Most plants can 
survive in a tent for a few weeks without additional water.

SHEDDING LIGHT ON REPLACING ELECTRIC PLUGS; 
</P>
<P>
SOONER OR LATER, CHANCES ARE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REPAIR ONE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Generally, electric plugs last a long time, but even they have to be replaced 
sooner or later. Fortunately, plug replacement is probably the easiest 
electrical job you can tackle, next to changing a light bulb. 
</P>
<P>
Zip cord, that lightweight lamp cord that looks like two wires running side by 
side, will take a clamp-on replacement plug you can install in about a minute. 
You can get one of these plugs at any hardware store. While you are there, get 
two or three. They're handy to have around. 
</P>
<P>
To use a clamp-on plug, start by cutting the cord off square across the end. 
There's no need to strip the wire, and in fact, no conductor should stick out 
beyond the insulation. 
</P>
<P>
Next, slit the wire between the two cords for a distance of one-quarter inch. 
You can do this with a knife, or, if you have strong fingers, just peel the two 
wires apart. 
</P>
<P>
Now open the plug's clamping lever, slip the end of the cord into the opening 
in the side of the plug, push it as far as it will go and snap the clamping 
lever shut. 
</P>
<P>
That's it. Test your handiwork to make sure it functions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
If It Doesn't Work 
</P>
<P>
These clamp-on plugs have little pins inside that are meant to pierce the 
insulation and make electrical contact. Every now and then, they don't. This is 
usually because you didn't insert both conductors all the way into the plug. 
</P>
<P>
If this happens to you, open the clamping lever, pull the cord out and examine 
the ends. If they appear mangled, cut them off and start over. If the ends seem 
OK, just reinsert and try again. If the plug still doesn't work, try another 
one. The pins inside may be bent. 
</P>
<P>
Clamp-on plugs should only be used with lightweight cords. Usually, 18-gauge is 
the heaviest they will handle. If your cord is heavier than that, it probably 
won't fit a clamp-on plug. In that case, you'll need something heavier. 
</P>
<P>
If you are replacing a grounded "three-prong" plug, be sure to buy another 
grounded plug. If you are replacing a two-prong plug, get a two-prong 
replacement, preferably a polarized type. A polarized plug will have one prong 
or blade wider than the other and it does a better job of protecting you from 
electrical shock than an unpolarized plug does. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, if your house is wired with old-fashioned, unpolarized, two-hole 
receptacles, you won't be able to use polarized plugs. In that case, it would 
be a good idea to have an electrician come in and replace all your old 
receptacles with modern grounded outlets. 
</P>
<P>
OK, if the end of your cord is still in good shape, go ahead and connect it as 
described below. But if the end of the cord is shot, first you'll have to cut 
back to sound wire, then strip the wire. Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tie Underwriters' Knot 
</P>
<P>
If the wire has an outer jacket, remove about 3 inches of it. Use a knife but 
be careful not to cut the insulation around the conductors. 
</P>
<P>
Next, remove the fiber cover from the business end of your plug, slip the cord 
into the back of the plug, and tie the Underwriters' knot shown in the sketch. 
This knot forms a "gob" of wire that prevents you from straining your 
connections the next time your kids yank on the cord. Tie the knot loosely as 
shown, then pull the conductors to tighten the knot up, right against the point 
where the conductors separate from each other. When the knot is tight, pull on 
the cord to seat the knot firmly in the body of the plug. 
</P>
<P>
Next, run the wires to their respective screws to see how much insulation 
you'll need to remove from each wire. Which wire goes to which screw? 
</P>
<P>
If you are using an unpolarized two-prong plug, it doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
If you are using a two-prong polarized plug, the black wire goes to the brass 
screw or to the narrow prong, and the white wire goes to the silver screw or 
wide prong. 
</P>
<P>
If you are connecting a zip-cord without color-coded wires, examine the 
insulation. One wire should have ribbed insulation. Connect this wire to the 
wide blade and the smooth wire to the narrow blade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stripping the Wire 
</P>
<P>
If you are installing a three-prong plug, the black wire goes to the brass 
screw, the white wire to the silver screw and the green grounding wire to the 
green screw. 
</P>
<P>
After running each unstripped wire to its screw, you are ready to strip. How 
much insulation should you remove? You want each wire insulated right up to the 
point where it reaches the screw. Beyond that point, strip the wire bare. This 
is easiest with a wire stripper but you can also use a knife. Just be careful 
not to cut the conductor. 
</P>
<P>
Next, bend the stripped end of each conductor into a little clockwise loop. If 
the conductors are stranded rather than solid wire, twist the strands tightly 
together before forming the loops. 
</P>
<P>
Now slip each loop around its proper screw -- making sure the loop wraps 
clockwise -- and tighten each screw down snug. Replace the fiber cover plate 
that you removed earlier and the repair is complete.

FOR A HEAVY-DUTY JOB, REACH FOR A BELT SANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doing heavy-duty sanding with an orbital or other kind of finishing sander is 
likely to put too much strain on that type of machine. That's when the 
workhorse of the power-sanding field, the belt sander, is required. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy-duty sanding includes such things as removing paint and rough sanding on 
large surfaces. If you are likely to engage in this kind of sanding only a 
couple of times a year, you can rent a belt sander. 
</P>
<P>
A belt sander is a powerful machine. Its belt runs over pulleys, drums or 
cylinders and usually utilizes a coarse belt, but medium and fine belts can be 
attached to get a very smooth finish. Because the belt sander is such a rugged 
machine, it usually has two handles so it can be gripped with both hands. Even 
so, only a moderate amount of pressure should be applied. It should be guided 
back and forth in a kind of stroking action. 
</P>
<P>
How much you pay for a belt sander depends on its capacity, power and ability 
to handle supplementary movements. It's a good idea to select a sander with a 
dust bag attachment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First-Time Caution 
</P>
<P>
By its very nature, a belt sander stirs up a lot of dust particles and can be 
very messy without a bag to collect the dust. 
</P>
<P>
For the average householder with a home workshop, a sander that takes 3-inch 
sandpaper is a good choice, but you may do enough heavy-duty sanding to justify 
a slightly larger one. 
</P>
<P>
If you are working with a belt sander for the first time, be sure it does not 
touch the work until the motor is in operation. Lower it slowly so the back 
part of the belt touches the wood, after which the belt is quickly brought to a 
horizontal position as it is moved forward. 
</P>
<P>
Do not stop the machine while sanding. The belt should always be moving forward 
or backward. When you are ready to stop, lift the sander from the surface and 
then, only then, turn off the motor. If the machine is kept in one place, even 
for the shortest possible time, it will take off too much wood at that spot. 
Because of this, lift the machine a bit as you come to edges and corners, thus 
preventing it from tilting. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the kind of sanding you will be doing with a belt machine usually 
involves only rough work, make it a habit to sand with the grain all the time. 
It's a habit that will stand you in good stead when using the finishing types 
of sanders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow Instructions 
</P>
<P>
Whatever knack there is to using a belt sander can be learned easily by 
starting out on scrap wood. The machine you buy will have instructions on how 
to change the belt. It will include information on the necessity of following 
the designations on which way the belts should be installed. By following these 
directions, you will avoid the possibility that the splices in the belt might 
come apart. 
</P>
<P>
A belt sander is activated in different ways; the most common being with a 
trigger switch. If you buy a model that has a device that locks the switch 
trigger while you are sanding and releases it when you press the trigger, so 
much the better. 
</P>
<P>
As with all power machines, don't make any adjustments before unplugging it 
from the electrical from the outlet. Power machines have a nasty habit of 
starting up accidentally while they are being handled, even when you think the 
switch is off. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever possible, the work being sanded should be clamped down. This is more 
important when using an electric sander than when sanding by hand.

FOG TRIGGERS S.D. PILEUPS, CLOSES I-8 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty vehicles collided in dense fog on Interstate 8 in eastern San Diego 
County on Saturday, closing all eight lanes for 20 miles, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one people were injured in four chain-reaction accidents in three hours 
and were taken to seven hospitals after the accidents, which halted traffic in 
both directions, said Dave Robertson, a spokesman for the California Highway 
Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Both eastbound and westbound lanes were reopened at 9 p.m. under still-heavy 
fog. The westbound lanes were closed for eight hours and the eastbound lanes 
were closed for six hours. Four adults and a child were seriously injured and 
air lifted by Life Flight after they were transported by ambulance west to 
Alpine, which wasn't hampered by the fog. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the injured were expected to be treated and released, but some were 
kept overnight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Fair Condition 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified 6-year-old boy was listed in fair condition with cuts at 
Children's Hospital, a spokesman there said. 
</P>
<P>
A unidentified 17-year-old boy also suffered chest injuries, a concussion and a 
broken sternum and was listed in fair condition at Sharp Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Near-zero visibility throughout the day made efforts to clear debris and 
smashed vehicles from the freeway difficult, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers at the scene told Robertson they saw "motorcycles sliding under cars 
and people being ejected and flying through the air" as the officers attempted 
to aid motorists on the westbound lanes of I-8 in the first wreck just after 1 
p.m., Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worst Crash' 
</P>
<P>
"One of the veteran officers said it was the worst crash he'd seen in his 
career," Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
The first accident happened just after 1 p.m. as 25 cars careened into each 
other while westbound on I-8 over the Pine Valley bridge in a mountainous area 
about 40 miles east of San Diego, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
That accident prompted the CHP to close the westbound lanes and set up a 
roadblock at Buckman Springs Road, diverting all traffic back eastbound, 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Collisions 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, as officers attempted to clear the westbound lanes on the 
bridge, 21 more vehicles plowed into one another as officers and motorists 
watched in horror, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
"All the officers could do was sit there and watch as the cars were sliding and 
smashing into each other," Robertson said. "It was eerie." 
</P>
<P>
CHP officials then closed eastbound I-8, setting up a roadblock at The Willows, 
sending all vehicles back westbound, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
And then about a half hour, later two more cars collided in the eastbound lanes 
of I-8 east of California 79 and two others crashed near the same area about 20 
minutes after that, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
After reopening the road, six CHP officers escorted more than 1,000 motorists 
lined up in their cars for more than five miles on each side of the two earlier 
roadblocks. Robertson said low-visibility prompted the need for escorts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extra Help 
</P>
<P>
Crews from the California Department of Transportation, volunteer fire 
departments, the state Department of Forestry and sheriff's deputies from 
substations in nearby Jacumba and Boulevard also aided. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-mile stretch of the freeway had been expected to be reopened by 5 p.m., 
but the weather hampered efforts, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so foggy some of the motorists said they couldn't see the cars in front 
of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not raining at the time of the accidents, but the freeway was "slick and 
damp," Robertson said.

ANAHEIM MAN FLED TO WILDS TO 'DISAPPEAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SUPERIOR, MONT. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most visitors are drawn to this mountain hamlet for its lush forests, cascading 
streams and towering, snow-capped peaks. David L. Schoenecker came to escape. 
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old chemical engineer from Anaheim Hills fled here after mailing a 
letter to an Orange County newspaper columnist saying he had killed his own 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker pitched camp in remote, wind-swept areas so cold that ice formed on 
the inside of his tent. He was captured Friday by an Old West-style posse a day 
after the body of his wife, Gail, 40, was found by Anaheim police. She had been 
shot through the head with a .357-magnum handgun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disappearance Planned 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrest, Schoenecker said he had planned to "disappear into the 
mountains of Idaho," police said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker was transferred Saturday from custody in Superior, where he was 
held in Mineral County's 69-year-old brick jail, to the Missoula jail, where he 
faces an extradition hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Detective Dave Tuttle said Schoenecker was moved so he could be closer 
to a lawyer of his choosing and because it would be more convenient for Anaheim 
police, who are questioning him. Before his transfer, Tuttle and a second 
Anaheim police detective questioned Schoenecker for 1 1/2 hours. Tuttle 
declined comment on whether Schoenecker had given a statement. Schoenecker was 
led back to jail in handcuffs afterward. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, however, Schoenecker was overheard telling another reporter 
in a jailhouse interview that "my mind is very confused" and "I'm afraid." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Schoenecker provided some explanation for including certain 
people on a list of 54 acquaintances and relatives whom police say he wanted 
"punished." Police found the list in Schoenecker's home and notified those 
named on it to take precautionary measures. Most live in his home state of 
Wisconsin, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker said Saturday he had harbored grievances against some of his 
classmates in grade school. He said one girl "just slapped me as hard as she 
could and threw a book at me, and I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
That girl's name was on the list, he said. Schoenecker also referred to grudges 
he had against two boys from his youth. "We weren't necessarily the best of 
friends and not the worst of friends." 
</P>
<P>
When asked what he had planned to do to the 54 people named on the list, 
Schoenecker said, "I don't see myself as hurting everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker said he mailed a letter to the newspaper columnist Monday, although 
he thought at the time "it was foolish." Afterward, he said, he considered 
fleeing toward Mexico, traveling through Utah and Nevada. But he disliked that 
option because it would necessitate putting stolen license plates on his car, 
Schoenecker said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mineral County Sheriff Wade Van Gilder, Schoenecker bought a lot 
of camping gear at a Missoula sporting goods store and drove an hour west to 
Cedar Creek Road, near Superior. His car was discovered abandoned there with a 
flat tire. Van Gilder said the car was headed toward Hoodoo Pass, which crosses 
over the 7,000-foot Bitterroot Range into Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker said he had planned to abandon his car "in a location that seemed 
ideal, according to the map." He said he carried with him topographical maps of 
the area, as well as for much of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
With snowdrifts of up to 4 feet deep pressing in on both sides of Cedar Creek 
Road, Schoenecker was forced to hike along the road, which was covered with 
about 3 feet of packed snow, Van Gilder said. 
</P>
<P>
While Schoenecker headed for Idaho, news that a wanted killer was in the area 
spread in tiny Superior (population, 1,000). Schoenecker was described in law 
enforcement bulletins as armed and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Although residents have grown accustomed to fugitives occasionally passing by 
on Interstate 90, George Howell, editor and publisher of the Mineral 
Independent, said this was something different. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought, 'Here's some nut running around with a gun,' " Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior is a rough-and-ready logging town, where men cruise around in 
pickup trucks with gun racks. The guns are kept primarily for hunting the large 
numbers of elk, deer, moose and bear in the surrounding wilderness. So it was 
with no trouble that Sheriff Van Gilder called out reinforcements to his staff 
of two deputies and two reserve deputies. Two snowmobile riders reported a man 
of Schoenecker's description backpacking up Cedar Creek Road. The posse tracked 
Schoenecker from where the dust-covered Bonneville had been found abandoned 
earlier in the week halfway up the mountain pass. 
</P>
<P>
Answering Van Gilder's call were seven members of the Mineral County Search and 
Rescue Team, a group of volunteers frequently called out to find lost hunters 
or to retrieve boaters from the swollen Clark Fork River. The group has little 
experience, however, in tracking armed fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous. You never know, he could have been waiting for us," said 
volunteer Steve Unruh. Two men on horseback bogged down in drifts of snow and 
had difficulty going on. 
</P>
<P>
The seven men continued hiking up the road at a rapid pace, picking up 
Schoenecker's tracks when they reached the snow level at about 5,000 feet. 
Harvey Vincent, a search team member and local newspaper printer, said the 
tracks were easy to follow because Schoenecker was heavily laden with supplies 
and his steps sank deeply into the snow. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Hendricks, president of the search and rescue team, said the posse 
members could see from the tracks that Schoenecker was slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
"His steps were so short that you could tell he was packing a lot," Hendricks 
said. "We found out later his pack must have weighed 100 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the tracks, Schoenecker left a trail of empty soda cans, a towel from a 
Missoula motel and chewing gum wrappers, Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gilder said it was apparent that Schoenecker didn't know he was being 
followed "until we caught him." 
</P>
<P>
As they closed in, Van Gilder said, he dispatched three helicopters from 
Missoula to fly ahead and try for a better fix on Schoenecker. One helicopter 
spotted Schoenecker trudging ahead up the road, the sheriff said. Schoenecker 
even paused to wave at it. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gilder summoned the helicopter back to pick up him and Tim Coleman, a 
reserve member of the posse. The copter flew ahead of Schoenecker and dropped 
down onto the road. The sheriff and Coleman jumped out, pistols in hand. 
Coleman set up position behind a fir tree on one side of the road while the 
sheriff got behind a tree on the other. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, Schoenecker had hiked about 20 minutes and came into view. Van 
Gilder said he allowed him to walk another 25 yards down the road before he and 
Coleman emerged from their hiding positions, guns trained on him. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told him, 'Halt!' and that if he moved I would shoot him dead," said 
Van Gilder, 38. "I had a .357 magnum and I was going to use it. I told him to 
lie down on the road. He did. He was tired and cold and wet." 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker was wearing a Windbreaker, leather hiking boots and a baseball cap. 
He had a loaded .357 magnum pistol within reach. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker said he had spent three nights sleeping in the wilderness and had 
packed ample supplies, including "canned beef, cereal, water, toothbrush, some 
meat, raisins, cooking (utensils), sleeping bag and tent." 
</P>
<P>
In questioning the man afterward, Van Gilder said Schoenecker used an alias at 
first but later admitted his identity. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker easily could have lost himself in the wilderness, local residents 
said, because the forest is so vast that even expert hunters can lose their 
bearings in it. Had he made it into Idaho, residents said, he might have 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gilder said Schoenecker was not far from eluding the posse. If he had 
reached bare earth again where his tracks would not have shown, the sheriff 
said, the posse probably would not have picked up his trail. 
</P>
<P>
"What it boils down to," said Grant Stelling, a Superior grocer, "is that 
there's a lot of wilderness out there."

RANDY KRAFT'S TRIPLE LIFE BAFFLES OLD-TIME FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were such close pals at Westminster High School that classmates 
good-naturedly called them the Three Musketeers. 
</P>
<P>
One moved to Canada during the Vietnam War. One became a research chemist in 
Florida. One stayed in Southern California and became a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Steven Kraft's arrest 6 years ago stunned his friends and co-workers. His 
conviction Friday in Orange County for 16 murders saddened Paul E. Whitson. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, second in the class of '63 at Westminster High, is the research 
chemist. Whitson, Kraft and the third student who later went to Canada were 
always together. They were among the brightest students; their interest in 
learning was their most common bond. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson remembers Kraft as "a normal kid, just like everybody else." Twenty 
years later, Kraft would lead what law enforcement officials describe as 
secret, multiple lives -- as a devoted family member, skilled computer 
programmer and mass murderer. 
</P>
<P>
"People do change. But it is incongruous that the Randy Kraft I knew could ever 
commit such crimes," Whitson said. "Time and distance ended my friendship with 
Randy long ago. But there is a sadness, a remembrance of times past." 
</P>
<P>
Were there signs, Whitson has wondered, of the dark streak in Kraft's 
personality, of whatever made him capable of disabling young men with drugs or 
alcohol, sexually mutilating them and dumping their bodies along freeways? 
</P>
<P>
The signs didn't exist, Whitson decided. 
</P>
<P>
Many from Kraft's class recall his arrest on May 14, 1983. News spread quickly 
that he might be responsible for dozens of murders. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl and Clarence E. Haynes discussed how incredulous it all seemed. The 
couple had been Kraft's classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that if we had to pick five people in our class who would never, 
ever be accused as some type of mass murderer, Randy would be one of the five," 
said Clarence Haynes, a Santa Ana lawyer who had been student body president. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, now 44, was a former Student for Nixon, Boy Scout and member of his high 
school debate team. He was known as quiet but friendly. He played in the band 
for 1 year and was on the school's tennis team for 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody liked Randy," said Kay Frazell, a former classmate who said she once 
had a crush on him. 
</P>
<P>
The Musketeers were typical kids, Whitson said. "The things we liked to do were 
very normal kinds of things: go to the beach, grab a hamburger." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, an honors student, and another Musketeer shared a keen interest in 
politics. Whitson and Kraft shared an interest in technical subjects at school. 
They enjoyed solving problems. Discussing their classes was a favorite pastime. 
</P>
<P>
After high school, Kraft attended prestigious Claremont Men's College, 
graduating in 1967 with an economics degree. He entered the U.S. Air Force on 
June 14, 1968. But 13 months later, the Air Force gave him a general discharge 
after he admitted to military officials that he was gay, according to several 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, now living in Clearwater, Fla., remembers returning to Southern 
California with his wife a year or so after that and going out for drinks with 
Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft took them to the Buoys Shed in Sunset Beach, where he worked part time as 
a bartender. Whitson recalls that it took him a few moments to realize it was a 
gay bar. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy told me, for the first time, that he was gay, and said in effect that 
this was his new life style," Whitson said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson said it surprised him. Kraft had given no hint in high school that he 
was gay. Whitson was certain this revelation would not affect their friendship. 
But time and distance did.

The Buoys Shed, which no longer exists, was near the Stables, another gay bar 
also gone. Law enforcement officials say Kraft was a regular at both places. A 
bartender at the Stables, 30-year-old Wayne Joseph Dukette, was found dead at 
the bottom of a ravine next to Ortega Highway on Oct. 5, 1971. Although Dukette 
was not listed in the charges filed against Kraft, prosecutors claim he was 
Kraft's first victim. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft went on to work in a series of jobs that appeared to be below both his 
intelligence and his education. He had an entry-level job at the Arrowhead 
Water Co. after his days as a bartender, and his work file there showed he 
tested at an IQ level of 129. He also served a brief stint as a teacher's aide 
in the Long Beach Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Kraft became a dispatcher for the Aztec Aircraft Co. in Long Beach. He 
was working there when Long Beach police questioned him about the 1975 death of 
Keith Daven Crotwell, 19. It was the only time, until his arrest 8 years later, 
that he ever came close to being arrested for the murders he was convicted of 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Also while at Aztec, Kraft took courses at Cal State Long Beach, working toward 
teaching credentials. But he never pursued a teaching career. Instead, he began 
to take training in computers. 
</P>
<P>
He worked primarily at J. El Products in Gardena, with a stint at Pacific 
Computer Systems in Long Beach in 1977. Kraft was a free-lance consultant until 
he joined Lear Siegler Inc., based in Santa Monica, in 1980. When the economy 
slowed, he was one of many white-collar workers laid off by the company in 
early 1983. 
</P>
<P>
After Lear Siegler, Kraft was inundated with offers for free-lance computer 
work, according to Kraft's former roommate, Jeff Selig. Work records produced 
in court showed he often worked two jobs at once. 
</P>
<P>
It was during these computer years, law enforcement officials say, that Kraft 
essentially led three different lives. 
</P>
<P>
By day, he was the busy executive, working out computer plans for companies. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Sheahan, a swim wear distributor who hired Kraft to set up a computer 
program for his company in Torrance, said Kraft was such a good worker he gave 
him the keys to the place and let him work his own hours late at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I had total trust in him," Sheahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft would spend evenings with his roommate Selig, a candy maker, either at 
quiet dinners at the Long Beach house they bought together or at their favorite 
gay bars. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Saavedra, manager at the Ripple's gay bar on Ocean Boulevard in Long 
Beach, remembers them well. 
</P>
<P>
"They would sit quietly at a table with friends or go upstairs and dance," 
Saavedra said. "But their favorite bar was the Silver Fox, at 4th and Redondo" 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft usually entered his secret life on weekends. With his roommate often 
working or away, Kraft would spend the nights roaming Southern California 
freeways, always gravitating to Orange County, where he was raised. It was on 
these excursions, prosecutors say, that Kraft picked up hitchhikers, drugged 
them, killed them and then mutilated their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"Kraft had an incredible ability to keep these three lives totally separate," 
said one law enforcement official who has spent much of the past 6 years on the 
Kraft case. 
</P>
<P>
If the theory is true, Kraft also had an amazing ability to slip from one life 
style to the next. The weekend when Geoffrey Alan Nelson and Rodger James 
DeVaul Jr. were murdered is an eerie example. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft was playing bridge with gay friends in Huntington Beach on the Friday 
night that Nelson and DeVaul were last seen in 1983. Prosecutors say Kraft 
picked them up, perhaps hitchhiking, after the party ended, killed them, 
emasculated Nelson and sodomized DeVaul, and dumped their bodies 40 miles 
apart. He returned home to Long Beach, cleaned up and arrived in time for work 
at St. Ives Laboratories on the Palos Verdes Peninsula at 9 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, he spent time on the telephone with his niece, Mindi Lane. They 
made plans to pick up the cake for Kraft's father's 75th birthday the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, cake in hand, they joined the family gathered at a sister's 
home. While the Krafts celebrated, law enforcement officials at Angeles 
National Forest north of Claremont were hauling the newly discovered body of 
Rodger DeVaul up a steep cliff where he had been dumped. 
</P>
<P>
At the party, Kraft's sister, Marlene Kay Plunkett, asked him if he would mind 
speaking to her class of students about the computer business. He said he would 
love to. 
</P>
<P>
During his trial, Plunkett smiled at her brother as she described to the jury 
what an excellent presentation he gave and how inspired her students were. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, Kraft's mysterious obsession with roaming the freeways 
again came at a time when everything else about his life appeared normal. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence at his trial showed that on May 13, a Friday, he set up computer 
programs at two places, one in Downey and the other on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. When he arrived home in Long Beach, workers were busy installing an 
outdoor hot tub with a wood patio deck around it. 
</P>
<P>
In the kitchen, Selig and a co-worker were preparing for that weekend's 
chocolate convention at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Kraft helped them 
box the chocolate candy they were taking. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before dark, Selig and his friend left. So did the hot tub workers. 
Kraft was left alone. He was arrested a few hours later, 30 miles south of Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Two California Highway Patrol officers had stopped him on Interstate 5, 
northbound in Mission Viejo, for erratic driving. A Marine, 25-year-old Terry 
Lee Gambrel from the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, was found dead in the 
front seat of Kraft's car. He had been drugged and strangled, and his wrists 
were tied with a shoelace. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were shocked to find numerous color photographs of other known 
victims, most appearing either dead or unconscious, in lewd poses, under the 
floor mat on the driver's side. 
</P>
<P>
The sensational news about Kraft's arrest sent his family into hiding from news 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been devastating for them," said Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald. 
"But they love Randy, and they have been very devoted to him since his arrest." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Kraft and Selig have sold their house. Selig became involved in a 
different relationship. While many wondered if he would testify at the trial, 
he was not called by either side. 
</P>
<P>
Other friends did testify and appeared to support their old colleague. But Paul 
Whitson wonders. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have a just system," he said. "If Randy was found guilty, perhaps 
he really did kill these people." 
</P>
<P>
Even if he could see his old friend now, Whitson said, "I suppose I would 
probably have to spend a lot of time thinking whether I really would want to 
see him."

'DEVIOUS WORLD. . .WHERE I NOW TOTALLY EXIST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the text of the letter written by David L. Schoenecker to newspaper 
columnist Bob Emmers. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Mr. Emmers, 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday night I shot and killed my wife. There is a very strong possibility 
that no one has discovered her body so I suggest you have the police check 7871 
E. Amanda Circle in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
There was no hatred -- I loved her -- but the action was necessary because I 
have a purpose and one that can not have an interruption or interference. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years I have had this sense, images, that I know exactly what 
is going to happen well before it actually occurs. At first I simply dismissed 
these -- sensations -- or whatever, but when I started to see certain events, 
very clearly I knew there was more to this than just daydreams or dreams or 
nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
What I was seeing, and seeing more than once, were events and occurances in my 
life involving people that -- I not sure of a good word -- had done wrong or 
evil against me. The sensation I was . . . and feeling is that all will be made 
right and I will be the force to make it right. 
</P>
<P>
Several times I tried to explain these "happenings" to gail (my wife) but she 
dismissed them. I was never understood. I knew that as these feelings and 
"pictures" continued to occur and repeat that I had to prepare a way, develope 
a plan, make arrangements. And I have done so. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I had to eliminate my wife. She wouldn't believe me. She wouldn't even 
listen. So in order to keep her from finding out, I developed a seperate plan 
or storyline that totally misled her, but it did make her happy. She was very 
happy on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
gail suspected that we were missing a great deal of money. She also was upset 
about several of my trips. Recently she started to figure that I must be doing 
something else with my time and our money. 
</P>
<P>
gail reasoned only in black and white -- good and bad. She never dealt in the 
grey or devious world. A world where I now totally exist. 
</P>
<P>
I've left a list -- a partial list. Not everyone on the list will receive total 
punishment -- but they will be punished. The images in my mind shows me exactly 
how and when and where the punishment will be delivered. It has to be done. 
</P>
<P>
All my life I've kept a diary like all of my famous generals. Well, now I am 
going to open that diary and rediscover exactly what occured. The evil-doers 
that have been shown to me and those in my diary will direct my actions. 
</P>
<P>
Now you're asking why I am writing to you. Well, I've been alone all of my 
life. Except for the companionship of my dogs, I have never been close enough 
to anyone to really discuss my feelings. When I tried, as with gail, I was 
laughed at or not understood. gail failed to comprehend how deep the hurt 
inside my heart is for all the lost opportunities. So I've chosen you to talk 
to and through you to the people on the list. 
</P>
<P>
I will strike without warning against some of the people on the list. These are 
the ones for whom the images and pictures are the strongest and repeated the 
most frequent. These are the ones who were . . . the ones were failed to act 
properly. These are people who should suffer great pain in their punishment and 
the pictures in my mind indicate they will. 
</P>
<P>
As for some others, I think I will let them know that their day is coming, so I 
will write and give you a name or two -- so you can do as you chose. I think I 
can trust you and I know you have connections which will allow you to contact 
the list members better than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Evil is not Evil. Death is not Evil. It is the intent, the word, the failed 
duty that is the real evil. This is now so clear. I see the words, I see the 
deeds, but I can not turn away. 
</P>
<P>
I'll write again. 
</P>
<P>
Please contact gails parents Earl and June Borchardt. They'll never understand, 
but it won't matter anymore.

TESLA: LOW-KEY MAGNETIC METAL; 
</P>
<P>
SUCCESS IS BORN OF SOUND, NOT FLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While making a point about fame, Brian Wheat, bassist of the hard-rock/metal 
band Tesla, told a story about having dinner with Axl Rose, the notorious 
leader of Guns N' Roses, at an infamous hangout on the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat, who hates to fly, had driven into town from Sacramento the previous day. 
On his first night in town, he was dining with Rose, whose band is a label-mate 
of Tesla at Geffen Records. 
</P>
<P>
"The poor guy couldn't eat," Wheat said about Rose. "People kept coming up to 
him asking for his autograph -- shoving pieces of paper at him, hounding him. 
That got me to thinking -- is that what I want? I can sit here and nobody knows 
me. I like success, But I don't know if I want to be that famous, where I 
couldn't eat a meal without being bothered." 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, nobody was bothering Wheat, who was lunching in another Sunset 
Strip restaurant the day after the dinner with Rose. The only thing that was 
bothering Wheat was a bland Caesar salad he wished he'd never ordered. 
</P>
<P>
A low-key, casual sort, Wheat, 26, was trying to imagine himself a big star. 
That's not a pipe dream. After two albums, this band is one of metal's new 
shining lights. Its first, "Mechanical Resonance," has sold more than 800,000 
copies. The follow-up, "The Great Radio Controversy," is over the 500,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of this fame business is OK, but I don't think all of it is really for 
me," said Wheat. "I'm not like Axl. I'm not Hollywood or glitter. I'm a 
Sacramento guy. I prefer that quiet, simple life style." 
</P>
<P>
Wheat's hardly your typical hard-rocker, despite his long hair and those ripped 
jeans. At least, he certainly doesn't sound like one. 
</P>
<P>
In this interview he didn't brag; he didn't tell how many "chicks" he'd scored 
with on tour. And though he boasted about how great Tesla is in every other 
sentence, when it came to talking about himself, he seemed intent on stressing 
how grand he isn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sort of nondescript -- not a pretty boy, not the kind of guy who sticks 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tesla is made up of five guys like that. The others are singer Jeff Keith, who 
writes all the lyrics; guitarists Frank Hannon and Tommy Skeoch, and drummer 
Troy Luccketta. 
</P>
<P>
Humility, honesty and a down-to-earth attitude are admirable in real life, but 
they can be liabilities in the glossy, macho world of metal. 
</P>
<P>
Who is Tesla anyway? Hard-core metal and hard-rock fans know of them but don't 
know much about them. They're not on the cover of every metal magazine. You 
don't read about their bad-boy exploits in the music columns because they 
probably don't have any bad-boy exploits. Hanging out with the notorious Axl 
Rose is as notorious as Wheat gets. 
</P>
<P>
The big story about Tesla is its lack of image. "We hear about that all the 
time," Wheat pointed out. "People wonder how we survive in this hard-rock 
business with no image when all the other bands are blinding you with flash. 
Can normal guys do that in this day and age? I think so. 
</P>
<P>
"We're five guys from Sacramento, ages 22 to 30. We do it with music. The front 
man in these kinds of bands is usually the guy who gets all the media. Our 
front man (Keith) isn't flashy. He's not pretentious. He's a good citizen -- a 
concerned, caring kind of guy." 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, Wheat is saying there's room in the sordid, image-conscious world 
of hard rock for a band of Boy Scouts from Sacramento. Musically, though, these 
guys aren't wimps. Fans love their ferociously rocking, blues-based music that 
echoes Humble Pie, Led Zeppelin and AC/DC. Those two lead guitarists generate a 
lot of thunder, blasting head-bangers into a state of ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of bands around with flashy images that can't play as well as 
Tesla," Wheat said. 
</P>
<P>
That's as boastful as he got. 
</P>
<P>
Tesla will begin a headlining tour in July. Meanwhile, the band is opening for 
Poison -- one of the strangest touring match-ups of the year. Why would Tesla, 
which has no real image, hook up with Poison -- flashy, heavily made-up pretty 
boys who have been following that glittery trail blazed by Kiss and Motley 
Crue? 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of surprised too when I heard about us touring with Poison," Wheat 
explained. "We're at the opposite extremes. They're all flash. We're not like 
them. We don't wear makeup or rat our hair or wear Spandex trousers." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the reason for this weird pairing is that each band wants exposure 
to the other's audience. Tesla attracts an older, blue-collar crowd -- the 
opposite of Poison's. 
</P>
<P>
"Poison draws a young crowd, lots of pretty young girls," Wheat said. "It's 
that real wild crowd. It's nothing to see 12-year-old kids smoking in their 
audience. Our audience comes for the music, not the flash." 
</P>
<P>
Tesla was originally formed by Wheat -- whose reverence for Paul McCartney 
inspired him to take up the bass -- and guitarist Hannon in 1981. But the band 
went through a series of personnel changes before settling on the current 
lineup in 1984. Tesla's first album, "Mechanical Resonance" came out on Geffen 
in 1986. The album was progressing slowly -- just 20,000 sales -- when the band 
got its big break in January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"David Lee Roth added us to his tour," Wheat recalled. "Cinderella had dropped 
out and he needed a band. He liked our video and hired us. We owe him 
everything. But we haven't even spoken to him since that tour." 
</P>
<P>
Following a stint as Alice Cooper's opening act, Tesla got an even bigger break 
-- touring for nine months with Def Leppard. "That was a good match-up," Wheat 
said. "People always told us we sound like Leppard. That tour gave us great 
exposure and really boosted our career." 
</P>
<P>
It also boosted sales of the second album. "A lot of fans who saw us on the 
Leppard tour last year bought our new album when it came out," said Wheat, 
explaining why "The Great Radio Controversy" rocketed up the Billboard pop 
chart. The Poison tour exposure has helped sales too. 
</P>
<P>
"For a new band, it's important to get on the right tour," Wheat said. "That 
helps more than an image. Right now, because of all this great tour exposure, 
we're the most popular no-image band around."

TAKING THE BATON (AWAY FROM CLARK); 
</P>
<P>
ALONE AT THE TOP OF PACIFIC SYMPHONY, LOUIS SPISTO FACES BUDGETARY CHALLENGES 
AND CRITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly 2 years, Music Director Keith Clark and Executive Director Louis G. 
Spisto battled for control of Orange County's Pacific Symphony orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the battle ended. Clark took his final bow Thursday night from the 
podium, leaving Spisto victorious in a bout which had been characterized by 
some as a struggle between art and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
At 32, Spisto has staked his reputation as boy wonder of arts management on the 
emergence of the Pacific Symphony as a major regional orchestra. He believes 
the organization's fiscal health, as much as its artistic reputation, will be 
the measure of his success. 
</P>
<P>
He has been described by one critic as a "dictator," but his approach 
apparently works for him: The tall, slender Spisto already has succeeded in the 
bitter fight for primacy over the organization, which employs more than 90 
musicians and operates on an annual budget of nearly $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
His steady rise has coincided almost precisely with Clark's decline and fall. 
In October of 1987 -- five months after Spisto's appointment -- the symphony's 
board voted to offer Clark a 1-year contract, a strong suggestion that he was 
on his way out. In February, 1988, in a close and controversial vote, the board 
decided not to extend the contract beyond May 31, 1989, and Clark announced his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1988, the board voted to change its by-laws, in effect removing Clark 
as a member. Three months later, the symphony signed a 3-year contract with the 
American Federation of Musicians that took significant personnel and 
decision-making prerogatives from Clark -- and his successors. 
</P>
<P>
Although Spisto and Clark declined last week to discuss the circumstances of 
Clark's departure, Spisto's critics say the two career trajectories are no 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Spisto says he did not come here to get rid of Clark -- who supported his 
selection -- nor did he ever directly ask the orchestra's board to choose 
between himself and the conductor. But Bob Peterson, the orchestra's personnel 
director and a Clark ally, who resigned in September of 1988, said "The minute 
this guy (Spisto) came into his office, his mission began." 
</P>
<P>
Spisto did say that his and Clark's working relationship deteriorated after his 
arrival, and that if Clark had been retained, he would have left. 
</P>
<P>
But two former board members, who requested anonymity, insisted last week that 
within two months of his appointment, Spisto was telling board members that he 
could not work with Clark, who already had gone through four other chief 
executives whose tenures ranged from six weeks to just over one year. 
</P>
<P>
Those directors "felt enough was enough," said one of them, Geoffrey R. Brooks, 
citing the difficulties of working for the sometimes-imperious Clark. "Somebody 
had to make a stand," Brooks said. "Lou was the one." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Spisto's assumptions of power have been subtle and barely noticeable. 
For example, the current musicians' union contract ostensibly shifts artistic 
control from the music director to the orchestra members, while at the same 
time greatly liberalizing rehearsal and performance requirements. But one 
provision also gives the executive director veto power over orchestra members' 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Questions have been raised about Spisto's leadership. They focus on the 
financial status and future of the symphony and the impact of the new contract 
on performances, as well as the role of Clark's as-yet-unnamed replacement, who 
is scheduled to begin conducting during the 1990-91 season (see accompanying 
story). 
</P>
<P>
The grandson of Italian immigrants, Spisto grew up in Brooklyn and Staten 
Island attending parochial schools, playing the trumpet in the high school 
marching band and studying voice. At the age of 11, he recalls, he attended a 
Broadway production of "George M" and "fell in love with the theater." 
</P>
<P>
A business major at the University of Notre Dame, he found time to direct and 
act in various musical and dramatic productions, including summer stock. "It 
was at that time that I began being interested in the production of arts events 
and seeking the funding and marketing," he said last week during an interview 
at the Pacific Symphony office in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Spisto acknowledges that his background in classical music is not a strong one. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't consider myself a musician," he said, adding that he would still like 
to learn piano. "I had a good singing voice." At one point during his college 
years, he sang the bass-baritone title role in Gilbert and Sullivan's light 
opera "The Mikado." 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, rather than taking a job in marketing -- his specialty at 
Notre Dame -- Spisto applied to the master's program in arts management at the 
University of Wisconsin at Madison. "I liked working with artistic people," he 
recalls. "I like working with musicians and performers." 
</P>
<P>
At Madison, he impressed E. Arthur Prieve, director of the arts administration 
program. "From the time he applied, the selection committee was very impressed 
with this guy," Prieve said. 
</P>
<P>
He also impressed Willoughby Newton, for whom he interned at WNET Channel 13 in 
New York, one of the best-known public television stations in the country. 
Newton, now vice president for external affairs of General Theological Seminary 
in New York, remembers Spisto as "a vibrant and aggressive and charming young 
man. He learned very quickly, and was a tremendous help." 
</P>
<P>
Spisto's first major job after earning his master of arts degree was director 
of operations and development for Cal Performances, overseeing major 
performance series at UC Berkeley on a $4.5-million budget, from 1981 to 1984. 
There, he began what was to become a career pattern of early, dramatic success 
and rapid acquisition of additional responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"He came at a time when we were having some serious accounting and cash 
management problems," said his boss at Cal Performances, Susan Farr, now 
executive director of the Assn. of Performing Arts Presenters in Washington. 
"He cleared them up in the first year he was there. 
</P>
<P>
"He expanded his work to overhaul management of the box office. . . . We had a 
sizeable deficit when he came: $700,000. We retired the deficit 3 years later 
and the program has run in black ever since. . . . Lou grew tremendously the 
first year he was there. He was very quick to pick things up. He understood 
financial management very clearly. . . . He left a much more serious and mature 
manager than he had arrived." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Borda, general manager of the San Francisco Symphony at the time, 
observed him as "a very highly organized, very energetic young man." Borda, now 
executive director of the Detroit Symphony, said, "I knew he was going to have 
a career in the arts if he wished to" and tried to "entice" him into working 
for her, without success. 
</P>
<P>
Spisto's next rung up the ladder was Pittsburgh, where the symphony -- between 
music directors and in financial doldrums -- was looking for a marketing 
director. Prieve, from Madison, was happy to recommend him. "People thought he 
was a little young," Prieve recalls, but "when he interviewed he said he was up 
to the challenge, and he was." 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, including one in the New York Times and another on National 
Public Radio's "All Things Considered," Spisto's 3 years in Pittsburgh were a 
resounding success. Supervising a full-time staff of 22, he started new series 
packages for singles, aiming to build a new audience of younger symphony-goers, 
and he piped the symphony's music into the subways. He increased the 
subscription base for the core symphonic series and created a corporate sales 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the best in his job that we ever had here by far," said Robert Croan, 
music critic of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. "He managed to sell out concerts 
without a (permanent) conductor. That had very much to do with his creativity 
and good taste. We haven't been able to do that with Loren Maazel as director." 
</P>
<P>
Spisto's decision to apply for the opening in Orange County in 1987 did not 
surprise his co-workers in Pittsburgh. Marshall Turkin, now retired executive 
director of the Pittsburgh Symphony, recalls Spisto as "a first-class guy, very 
talented." Although Turkin was sorry to see him leave, he understood that 
Spisto "wanted a grander career than being a staff person." 
</P>
<P>
Moving on was "just a matter of growth for him," said Sylvia Turner, head of 
public relations for the symphony. "I expected that his horizon would broaden." 
</P>
<P>
Spisto's first 2 years at the Pacific Symphony, though arguably because of 
factors beyond his control, have been rocky. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived, the organization had a surplus of more than $100,000. Within a 
year, the surplus was gone and the symphony was in debt by another $250,000. 
According to Spisto, the deficit for this year will be $350,000, although 
former employees and board members and several orchestra members believe the 
actual deficit may be far greater than the announced figure. This past season, 
financial pressures forced the symphony to cancel its 10th anniversary concert. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the symphony's financial state are in dispute. Spisto and 
symphony President Stewart C. Woodard say the first year's deficit should not 
be blamed on Spisto, because he did not prepare the budget on which it was 
based. 
</P>
<P>
In a May 3 memo to the California Arts Council, Spisto said the deficits of the 
past 2 years were "technically" the result of "mistakes in budgeting (by a 
former administration) . . . an increase in marketing costs . . . a shortfall 
in contributed income . . . the downturn in subscription renewals . . . 
additional marketing programs" and "a lack of major gifts." 
</P>
<P>
"During fiscal year 1987-88, the board devoted most of its energy to dealing 
with the artistic transition and was severely weakened in its attempt to raise 
funds as a result," Spisto wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But former employees and board members claim that Spisto spent excessively on 
staff, program and advertising expansion when he arrived in Orange County. One 
member of the executive committee, who asked for anonymity, was so concerned 
about the spending that he sought, unsuccessfully, to get Spisto to draft his 
own budget for the second 6 months of his tenure, one for which he would have 
to be accountable. 
</P>
<P>
Within the symphony's staff, there was also turmoil and intrigue of near 
operatic proportions, much of it surrounding the battle between Spisto and 
Clark. Spisto's supporters openly charged that the orchestra had outgrown 
Clark's artistic capabilities; Clark's supporters maintained that Spisto and 
some of his supporters on the board were so musically unsophisticated that they 
could not even pronounce the names of major European composers. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the controversy, Spisto said during an interview -- a remark 
he says he now regrets -- "the point is that Keith Clark was a bad conductor, 
and that's why he's not going to conduct this orchestra anymore and we are 
going to find a conductor who will. That is all that matters. None of the rest 
of it. None of it . . . Keith Clark is a dead fish in the water." 
</P>
<P>
Departures from the staff began within the first month of Spisto's arrival; so 
far, 12 of the orchestra's 14 full-time employees either have quit or been 
fired -- secretaries, box office and development personnel and the symphony's 
bookkeeper, Millicent Alexander. Few would speak on the record about Spisto, 
and those who would were terse. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a fan of Lou Spisto," said Alexander. "I have nothing positive to say 
about him," she said, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came, things fell apart," said Dorothy Smith, a former executive 
secretary. "I don't think he knows what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Off the record, some describe Spisto as emotional and explosive, verbally 
abusive and prone to tantrums. 
</P>
<P>
But others, like Larry Duckles, the symphony's artistic administrator who is 
also assistant principal flute in the orchestra, say Spisto is bright and that 
they have enjoyed working with him. 
</P>
<P>
"You're never going to find the perfect boss," Duckles said. "There's always 
going to be flaws. I respect his acuity, his intelligence and his sense of the 
market. I don't find it that difficult to work with him. Some say he's 
high-strung." 
</P>
<P>
"Lou is the most intelligent person I've worked for," said W. Andrew Powell, 
director of marketing and public relations for the symphony, who has worked for 
several advertising companies, including Chiat/Day in Los Angeles. "He has 
become noticeably stronger as executive director in the two years I've been 
here, and more inclined to delegate." 
</P>
<P>
Spisto acknowledged that he has "rubbed a few people the wrong way. You don't 
take these jobs to be liked by everybody. You always strive to get people who 
will stay, and in arts organizations that's very often difficult to do because 
of salary. And, because there is so little growth, people have to move on to 
move up." The average tenure for people in arts organizations, Spisto said, is 
about 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
However, there has also been turnover in board membership. At least two former 
members, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they left when the board 
gave Spisto a new, 2-year contract at $67,000 per year. A former member of the 
executive committee said that Spisto is "singly responsible for the slow demise 
of the musical ability of the orchestra. The man is a dictator." 
</P>
<P>
But Spisto retains the support of the board and its president, Woodard. 
"Considering all the challenges before him and the pressures of adjusting to a 
new community, he's doing a remarkably good job," Woodard said. "He came in 
with a budget established by people other than himself, a budget that was not 
realistic. . . . He's knowledgeable. He has tremendous dedication and 
tremendous energy. He's a quick learner. He works well with other cultural 
organizations and he has proven to be extremely effective dealing with leaders 
of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Most observers agree that the day of the music director -- the maestro who puts 
his stamp on a musical institution for decades, men like Eugene Ormandy in 
Philadelphia or George Szell in Cleveland who lived in the area year-round with 
no other major commitments, and had nearly unquestioned power to hire and fire 
-- is over. 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. orchestras in the '80s and '90s are not going to be like the '40s, '50s, 
'60s. "It's an evolving institution," said Detroit Symphony director Borda. 
</P>
<P>
Top symphony conductors are more likely to take as many as three conducting 
assignments, some of which are thousands of miles apart, living out of a 
suitcase or a hotel suite. When a music director has multiple posts, he or she 
"just doesn't have the time to give to an institution," Prieve said from 
Spisto's alma mater. "Somebody, something is going to get shortchanged." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Symphony "more than likely" will be sharing its next music director 
with "at least one other orchestra," according to Preston Stedman of Cal State 
Fullerton, who is chairman of the search committee. In such cases the resident 
executive director assumes day-to-day authority. In that sense, the rise of 
Louis Spisto at the Pacific Symphony is reflective of a national trend. 
</P>
<P>
Another key factor is contracts like that signed last fall by the Pacific 
Symphony, which provided tenure for most members and gave them an equal say 
with the music director in filling new vacancies. Such provisions are becoming 
standard across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is that the work is being shared differently than it was, say, 20 
years ago," Spisto said. "In fact, many music directors of major orchestras are 
spending less and less time with the community and therefore the executive 
director is the year-round presence. . . . Twenty years ago it was much more 
realistic for a music director to have complete control over everything that 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Clark, for one, is not pleased with this turn of events, which he says is 
"becoming more widespread and very much of concern to music directors. . . . 
Musical vision should embody any orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent and, some say, extreme example of this shift is the recent 
resignation of Andre Previn as artistic director of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic in a power struggle with Ernest Fleischman, the executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Spisto is quick to emphasize that his musical background is not at the same 
level as Fleischman's. 
</P>
<P>
"Lou Spisto does not have background to decide what the musical life of this 
orchestra should be," Spisto said, "but I do have the marketing ability to 
understand what the needs of Orange County are and I do have musical knowledge 
to . . . help the board make some decisions about matching the kind of music 
director to this kind of community. . . . I think the board should set the 
financial parameters, and the music director should actually go and develop the 
kind of programming he wants. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If the Pacific Symphony can get through the next few years and prosper, as I 
hope we will and as I think we will, we can stabilize it and hopefully grow it 
(and) I will be very, very proud."

'BY THE END OF '89-'90 WE'LL HAVE A MUSIC DIRECTOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
For a marketing whiz like Louis Spisto, the Pacific Symphony's new music 
director "is as much the product as anyone else, as the orchestra or as the 
music performed." A committee of musicians, symphony staff and board members, 
headed by Cal State Fullerton music professor Preston Stedman, has been 
searching for a successor to outgoing director Keith Clark, primarily through 
guest performances with the symphony. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen four conductors this season," Spisto said last week, "one of whom 
did a short stint with us. We have six more coming in. The search committee has 
met several times this year and has developed a profile. 
</P>
<P>
"(We) have had an opportunity, obviously, to listen, visit and work with the 
conductors who have been here. I think it's through those experiences that 
we've really refined the profile. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is going to be very important to this board that the conductor, the 
music director, takes a very active role in the community. Ideally the 
individual would live here, not all year, but have a home here and (it) would 
be also ideal if this were a major part of this individual's artistic 
endeavors. I don't think that at this point that is going to preclude any of 
the people we are looking at next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing we'll do is hone in as we go through the fall. We're going to 
zero in on two or three top candidates and start visiting them at their current 
place of employment, getting to know even more about them, talking to people 
they work with, looking at their programming over the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"We would hope that by the end of next season to be able to announce the music 
director who would start in 1990-91 in some capacity. The question is, how 
quickly and how many weeks that individual could give in '90-'91. 
</P>
<P>
"But there will be a music director in place in '90-'91. By the end of '89-'90 
we'll have a music director announced." 
</P>
<P>
The field looks like this: 
</P>
<P>
The Front-Runners 
</P>
<P>
 Eight guest conductors actively being considered by the search committee. 
</P>
<P>
 A) Neal Stulberg, music director of the New Mexico Symphony, conducted the 
Pacific on Nov. 1 and 3, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
B) Geoffrey Simon, music director of the Albany Symphony, conducted the 
orchestra in two pairs of subscription concerts, Feb. 28 and March 1, and Dec. 
14 and 15, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
C) Vakhtang Jordania, artistic director of the Chattanooga Symphony and Opera 
Assn., led the orchestra on March 1 and 2, 1989, will conduct again Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
D) Upcoming: 
</P>
<P>
1) Lawrence Foster, music director of the Monte Carlo Philharmonic, will 
conduct the Pacific Oct. 10 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
2) Christopher Seaman, director of the BBC Scottish Symphony, will conduct Nov. 
21 and 22. 
</P>
<P>
3) Carl St. Clair, assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony, will conduct 
Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
4) Richard Buckley, former director of the Oakland Symphony, will conduct March 
28 and 29. 
</P>
<P>
5) Sergiu Comissiona, former music director of the New York City Opera, will 
conduct May 23 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Shots 
</P>
<P>
 Three conductors, while not "announced candidates," will conduct the orchestra 
this summer and may be considered for music director "if there is a strong 
chemistry," Spisto said. 
</P>
<P>
 A) Jorge Mester, music director of the Pasadena Symphony, will conduct July 4 
and 22. 
</P>
<P>
B) Kate Tamarkin, associate conductor of the Dallas Symphony, will conduct Aug. 
12. 
</P>
<P>
C) Toshiyuki Shimada, music director of the Portland (Me.) Symphony, will 
conduct Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Warsaw Philharmonic music director Kazimierz Kord will be principal guest 
conductor and music adviser for the 1989-90 season, but is not available beyond 
that and is not considered a candidate at this time.

VIETNAMESE WAR PASSIONS AT HEART OF ATTACK TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU and DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To an outsider who had not seen firsthand the brutalities of the Vietnam War, 
the remarks quoted in the 1986 magazine piece may have sounded reasonable 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to change Vietnam's repressive Marxism," Tran Khanh Van of 
Westminster said in the article, "is to work with those who will become the 
next generation of leaders." 
</P>
<P>
But to fellow refugee Be Tu Van Tran -- a one-time English teacher in Vietnam 
who saw family members jailed by the Marxist regime and who was forced to flee 
the country after the fall of Saigon in 1975 -- the words were nothing short of 
blasphemy. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion of normalized relations with Communist Hanoi so infuriated the 
Costa Mesa immigrant that he was driven to try to kill the man who had dared to 
write the words, according to Orange County prosecutors and Tran's own disputed 
statements to police. 
</P>
<P>
Tran, seen by some as an anti-Communist hero and by others as a political 
extremist from a shadowy terrorist group, will soon be tried in Santa Ana 
Superior Court for the attempted murder of Van. 
</P>
<P>
The case has already been presented to one jury. In 1986, a mistrial occurred 
just as the panel reportedly was leaning 9 to 3 in favor of acquitting Tran. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers are scheduled to seek a date for the second trial at a hearing on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It is a potentially explosive case which, at its root, centers on the intense 
and sometimes clashing views held by some members of the U.S. Vietnamese 
community toward their homeland. Tran, 33, a truck driver, stands accused of 
stalking Van for weeks and then trying to assassinate the former Saigon housing 
minister because of what Tran perceived to be Van's pro-Communist views. Van, a 
local real estate businessman, was shot twice in the stomach and the shoulder 
in a March 18, 1986, attack near his Westminster real estate office. But he 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
Tran's defense attorney contends that Tran had nothing to do with the shooting 
and only claimed responsibility to police as a "badge of honor" to demonstrate 
his commitment to fighting communism. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the defense attorney acknowledged, the implications of the Tran case 
extend far beyond the guilt or innocence of his client. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is much bigger than a few gunshot wounds; it has clear overtones of 
international terrorism," said attorney Robert K. Weinberg of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think that for better or worse, (the upcoming trial) will put in the 
spotlight the crossroads that Vietnam, and its people who have come to this 
country, are at right now," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, defense attorneys and Vietnamese community leaders agree that the 
Tran trial and its surrounding issues of nationalistic pride make the case 
significant for thousands of Southeast Asians living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the biggest and most delicate cases in our community," 
Vietnamese writer Nhat Tien said. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after his arrest, the name of Be Tu Van Tran still elicits strong 
emotions both pro and con from those in the Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
Virulent anti-Communist feelings have not softened, although 14 years have 
passed since Saigon fell to the Communists. And while some Vietnamese 
shopkeepers and restaurant owners denounced Tran, they did not want to be 
identified for fear of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Strong nationalists like Chuen V. Nguyen, a former fighter pilot in the South 
Vietnamese air force, maintain Tran's innocence and consider his motivations 
"heroic." 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot measure the emotions of someone like Be Tu Van Tran, who lost 
relatives and property during the war," Nguyen said. "You don't understand when 
somebody comes into your village and kills your wife and your children. Are you 
going to ask yourself, 'Do I have a right to shoot them?' 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of it happening 14 years ago or 20 years ago, this image, this 
picture of what they did to your relatives is still there," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
Those close to the Vietnamese community say most people rallied in support of 
Tran after news broke of his alleged attack. Some went so far as to raise money 
for his defense and publish a laudatory book about him. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some Vietnamese regard Tran's alleged actions as objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to learn to compromise. We have to come up with different answers than 
violent answers, and (to learn) that not all things are black and white. There 
are shades of gray," said a Vietnamese businessman who asked not to be 
identified for fear of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
While the subject of Vietnamese nationalism has long stirred intense feelings 
among the refugee community, the Tran trial is also likely to attract a broader 
interest as well. 
</P>
<P>
The trial comes at a time of a warming trend between the United States and 
Hanoi, after years of roadblocks largely over the issues of Vietnam's invasion 
of Cambodia and Americans who are missing in action. And the success of the 
Vietnamese refugees in their transition to this country seems to have 
intensified questions surrounding the Vietnamese community and its attitudes 
toward the Asian homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, for instance, Vietnamese in Orange County were angered when 
Westminster Councilman Frank Fry Jr. told a Vietnamese military veterans' group 
to "go back to South Vietnam" if they were unwilling to recognize traditional 
American military holidays. Vietnamese leaders launched a recall effort against 
Fry but called it off after he apologized. 
</P>
<P>
Violence has also erupted in Little Saigon, the commercial hub of the 
Vietnamese community. In February, angry anti-Communists allegedly firebombed a 
travel agency that booked tours to Vietnam. A few weeks ago, the group also 
allegedly set fire to a truck belonging to a television studio that showed 
pro-Communist symbols -- Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum and an old Vietnamese 
liberation flag -- on a television program. 
</P>
<P>
And within and beyond the confines of Orange County, the Vietnamese Party to 
Exterminate Communists and Restore the Nation -- a right-wing group in which Be 
Tu Van Tran is a cadet, local prosecutors say -- has been linked by law 
enforcement officials to at least 11 terrorist incidents ranging from arson to 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the district attorney's staff, while declining to specify what 
security precautions will be taken during the trial, say they are worried about 
reprisals against both the defendant and the victim, Van. 
</P>
<P>
Van moved to Thailand after the attack out of fear for his safety, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Chris Evans. But he is expected to return to Orange County to 
testify, as he did in the first trial. 
</P>
<P>
Highlighting its political overtones, that first trial featured the unusual 
sight of Tran, his then-co-defendant in the shooting, a defense investigator 
and their former attorney all sporting emblems on their coats that read "Viet 
Cong Hunting Club." 
</P>
<P>
This time around, prosecutors have granted immunity from prosecution to Tran's 
former co-defendant, Cu Ngoc Duong, who was allegedly the "wheelman" -- driver 
of the getaway car -- in the attack on Van. That sets up the prospect that 
prosecutors may try to get him to testify against Tran. 
</P>
<P>
Duong's attorney, Roger S. Hanson of Santa Ana, said it is unclear whether his 
client would oppose an order compelling his testimony. He said it is also 
unclear what Duong would say if he was to take the stand against Tran. 
</P>
<P>
But the single most damning piece of evidence against Tran may be his own 
statements to police after his arrest in 1986: "I shoot him; I accept 
responsibility," Tran reportedly told police. 
</P>
<P>
Tran also claimed authorship of a "death sentence" order that was sent to 
Vietnamese newspapers across the state on behalf of the extermination party. 
</P>
<P>
The order labelled Tran Khanh Van a "traitor, lackey of Vietnamese Communists" 
and said he must be killed for opposing the "struggle for the liberation of our 
Fatherland." 
</P>
<P>
While prosecutors link Van's comments as quoted in a January, 1986, Los Angeles 
Times Magazine article to the attack, the victim himself offered a different 
explanation in filing a $50-million lawsuit in 1987 against Tran, Duong, and 
members of the United Front for the Liberation of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Van claimed in the suit that members of the Front were extorting money from the 
local Vietnamese community in the name of fighting communism, and he said that 
his refusal to give a demanded $10,000 resulted in threats and the eventual 
assault against him. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg, defense attorney for Tran, acknowledged that his client kept Van 
under surveillance in the weeks after his remarks appeared in the magazine 
article, saying he was interested in finding out who associated with Van. 
</P>
<P>
But the attorney and William Cassidy, an investigator who has worked on Tran's 
behalf since the outset of the case, deny that Tran had any role in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg and Cassidy assert that Van's initial description of his assailant 
does not match that of Tran. And they maintain that the victim's political 
leanings prompted him to later identify Tran as the shooter once Tran had 
claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of anti-communism. 
</P>
<P>
"The victim was predisposed to blame his misfortunes on the opponents of 
communism," Cassidy contends. 
</P>
<P>
Van has denied favoring the Communist regime in Hanoi, but Weinberg said he 
will try at Tran's trial to expose the victim's "disinformation artistry" and 
to show that "Van is not who he says he is." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Weinberg will try to prove that Tran was lying when he 
admitted responsibility for the attack. He said he will not put Tran on the 
stand at trial for fear that the defendant would again lie about his role. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney said he may go so far as to inject the teachings of 
Confucius into the trial as a way of dramatizing the code of honor and 
self-sacrifice to which he says Tran adheres.

Terns Return -- The endangered California least tern has come back to the Bolsa 
Chica wetlands, with 13 nests spotted May 8 on the estuary's south island by 
state Fish and Game biologists. That compares to 36 nests counted on May 6, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little slow compared to last year," said Esther Burkett, Fish and Game 
unit biologist for north Orange County. But Burkett and her colleagues counted 
at least 40 adult least terns in the wetland reserve, which means there should 
be more nesting activity soon. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming week, "the least terns should be in full fling," Burkett said. In 
addition, nesting activity by elegant and Caspian terns was viewed on Bolsa 
Chica's north island. Elegant and Caspian are among several species of tern -- 
and the closely related black skimmer -- that have been expanding their 
breeding range northward in recent years, to the surprise and delight of 
biologists, ornithologists and birding hobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
Also nesting in Bolsa Chica are endangered Belding's savannah sparrows. The 
tiny bird hides its eggs in the pickleweed, so Burkett urges visitors to the 
Bolsa Chica to stay on the boardwalk and trails to avoid accidentally crushing 
a nest. Dogs, which can spell disaster for the ground-nesting birds of the 
reserve, are strictly forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming weeks, visitors should be able to spot chicks of such shore bird 
species as the black-necked stilt and the American avocet. "It's a pretty neat 
time to be out," Burkett said. "There's a lot happening right now."

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;

JUDGE PRESIDING AT KRAFT TRIAL WAS ALSO THE COURT JESTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When word spread through the courthouse in Santa Ana that Superior Court Judge 
Donald A. McCartin would preside over the Randy Steven Kraft serial murder 
trial, both prosecutors and defense lawyers were delighted. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believed that McCartin would insist that the case, stalled in years 
of delays, finally get moving. Defense lawyers simply thought he would liven up 
the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
They haven't been disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old judge, who has specialized in death penalty cases in recent 
years, scattered a mixture of humor, wit, anger and friendliness at both sides 
of the counsel table during the 9-month trial, the first phase of which ended 
Friday. Kraft's lawyers can burn at the judge's decisions one minute and then 
join the laughter at his one-liners the next. 
</P>
<P>
A few McCartin gems during the trial: 
</P>
<P>
On a day when television news crews showed up: "Would you guys please get my 
name right? It's McCartin, not McMartin. I don't go around molesting little 
children." 
</P>
<P>
The judge deadpanned to the jurors that during their deliberations they would 
be sequestered at the "Bates Motel," which brought laughter from all except the 
one or two who had never watched any of the "Psycho" movies. 
</P>
<P>
During closing arguments, Kraft lawyer James G. Merwin told jurors that "MC HB 
Tattoo" on a list found in Kraft's car did not refer to one of the victims, a 
Marine. "MC" did not have to mean Marine Corps, Merwin said, adding, "How about 
'Midway City'?" 
</P>
<P>
"How about 'McCartin'?" the judge interjected. The interruption surprised 
everyone, but even the lawyers joined the jurors' laughter. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite McCartin target during the trial was Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. 
Brown. During one heated debate between Brown and defense lawyers, McCartin 
quipped: "I have to be fair to the defense. But I don't have to be fair to you, 
Mr. Brown." 
</P>
<P>
The judge had fun with the defense too. When he complained how slow the defense 
was moving along, Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald responded that he was at 
work most mornings at 5 a.m. during the trial. One day after that, when 
McCartin came into the courtroom and McDonald was not yet there, the judge 
wryly told the others: "I know he's here somewhere. He's been here since 5 
a.m." 
</P>
<P>
McCartin readily admits he wants cases to move quickly, and he has shown 
irritation with both sides about the slow pace. 
</P>
<P>
When Brown told jurors in closing arguments that he wanted to mention something 
that might be only marginally important, McCartin interjected: "Then let's move 
on to something else, Mr. Brown." 
</P>
<P>
The judge early in the trial did not enjoy having Brown itemize for jurors all 
the contents of the glove box of Kraft's car. The judge called it "a pile of 
garbage" and warned the lawyers not to waste the court's time like that again. 
</P>
<P>
In a lighter tone, when Brown ran out of witnesses 30 minutes early one day, 
the judge told the lawyers: "I want those witnesses lined up out there three 
deep from now on, gentlemen." 
</P>
<P>
But it was the defense with whom the judge had argued the most over the slow 
pace. When Merwin was out sick and McDonald did not want to cross-examine a 
witness Merwin was supposed to handle, the judge said angrily: "This is 
ridiculous. I could cross-examine this witness. . . . A freshman law student 
could cross-examine this witness." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers were not sure if he was only half-kidding when the judge refused to 
interrupt closing arguments for a brief hearing requested by the defense and 
said: "I hate all lawyers. I don't have a friend among any one of you. Now 
let's get on with it, gentlemen, and bring the jurors back in." 
</P>
<P>
Whether they agree with the judge's rulings, most people in his courtroom 
during the trial have come to admire many qualities about him. For example, he 
has sat through most of the trial in excruciating pain, wearing a brace because 
of a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
And when the lawyers needed a brief break in the trial to schedule witnesses, 
McCartin asked court officials to send him a short trial to hear. The judge 
could have sat in his chambers during the break and drawn no criticism. The 
same thing happened after Kraft's jury began deliberating: The judge has since 
heard two other cases when no one expected it. 
</P>
<P>
He showed compassion for the defense by allowing Kraft's father, confined to a 
wheelchair, to visit his son in the holding cell just outside the courtroom. 
And while McCartin likes to pick on the prosecutor, Brown is aware that most of 
the judge's decisions have allowed him to put on the case he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
If the length of the trial, which began last July, has been a strain on the 
judge, he doesn't let it show. When the jurors were deliberating on a Saturday, 
a Times reporter called the courtroom to ask how things were going. The judge 
got on the phone and complained: 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go in the jury room and help them out, but Mitch (the bailiff) won't 
let me."

'WHEN YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMEONE WHO CARES ABOUT YOU, IT HELPS YOU TO FEEL

<P>
HUGS AND SMILES FROM ELDER -- AND SPECIAL -- FRIENDS 
</P>

<P>
Though he was neatly dressed with short, blond hair trimmed carefully around 
his face, there was something so gloomy about the 9-year-old who stood before 
Les Gottlieb that he was tempted to turn and walk away. 
</P>
<P>
"What am I getting into here?" the 66-year-old retired pharmacist remembered 
asking himself as he stood at the door of the fourth-grade classroom at Ruby 
Drive School in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
Staring down at the slight, pale boy who cowered, with eyes downcast, Gottlieb 
thought: "I'm not prepared to handle something like this." 
</P>
<P>
But now, 3 years after his first experience, Gottlieb fondly recalls a task he 
not only handled, but stuck with. 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb is one of 17 senior citizen volunteers with Placentia Unified School 
District's Project Love a Little &amp; SEE (Seniors Enriching Education). 
</P>
<P>
For rewards as simple as a funny story, a smile or a hug, he and other 
volunteers try to help elementary schoolchildren develop a better image of 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
For Gottlieb and his young friend, progress came quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"In 2 or 3 weeks he came out of his shell," Gottlieb said. After a few games of 
handball, which he suggested the youngster teach him to play, the boy began to 
open up. "I let him know he was a good teacher, and I imagined that would 
really build self-esteem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the boy even initiated their conversations and "when I finally got that 
smile," Gottlieb said, "I thought, 'This is a great reward.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ann Donaldson, project coordinator, would like to see more seniors get such 
rewards by volunteering to work at Ruby and the three other district elementary 
schools that now participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson talked about the program in a recent interview, and about the need 
for more supportive seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"Special friends," as volunteers are called, provide a non-judgmental 
relationship where children are free to be themselves, and learn to like 
themselves, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you know there's someone who cares about you, it helps you to feel 
stronger as a person," Donaldson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruby Drive School started pairing seniors with students 8 years ago, to give 
children who were not meeting their potential some extra attention from "very 
special one-on-one friendships," Donaldson said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, a bill introduced by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D -- Los Angeles) 
and approved by the Legislature appropriated $165,000 for administrative costs 
for 11 programs, like Ruby Drive's, statewide to encourage interaction between 
students and seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Also at that time, three more of the district's 15 elementary schools -- Topaz, 
Golden and Warner -- were added. 
</P>
<P>
The district now divides $15,000 a year in state funds between the four schools 
to pay for supplies and field trips, Donaldson said. Volunteers also receive a 
$5 stipend per visit to cover transportation costs. 
</P>
<P>
But nearly 5 years after the three new schools were added in the Placentia 
district, officials at all four schools say the number of senior volunteers is 
decreasing -- down to 17 from more than 20 last year for the four programs. 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson said she is hoping for increases mainly at Topaz, Warner and Golden 
-- which have a total of seven volunteers -- but would like to have more 
volunteers at Ruby as well. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 2,100 senior volunteers working with 79,223 preschool 
through 12th-graders in at least 65 school districts throughout the state, said 
Carol Monroe, a consultant in parenting and community education with the state 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe said the Education Department started a recruitment drive last December 
to increase the number of senior volunteers. "We would like to have (similar 
programs) in every school in the state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not looking for people with any specific training," she said. "We're 
interested in people who want to share themselves with children, even if it's 
just a hug." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe said the volunteers in the programs are not only role models, but expose 
children to information about different crafts, hobbies and occupations. 
</P>
<P>
While the Placentia program began as a way of exposing children to seniors and 
helping to build the children's self-confidence, teachers also now recommend 
students who they believe would do better academically with some special 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases there are problems at home that interfere with concentration, 
Donaldson said. "We're talking kids who have things happening at home that are 
a little distressing," she said. "We hope that with a little attention they are 
going to produce more." 
</P>
<P>
One sixth-grade girl who has been in the program for several months because of 
family problems said she enjoys the meetings. Talking with her friend has 
helped her do better in school, she said. "I can get my mind off my problems." 
</P>
<P>
Two boys, one in third grade, the other in fourth, said they enjoy playing the 
board game Monopoly with their special friend, Lyle Lawrence, 82. "Except he 
doesn't let us win," the fourth grader said. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't cheat either," chuckled Lawrence, who proudly admits that he plays 
to win and shows no mercy to his younger, less-experienced opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Janis Burndahl, a fourth-grade teacher at the Ruby Drive School, has 
recommended several students for the program: some who disrupted class because 
they wanted attention, some who have had trouble concentrating or finishing 
schoolwork, and others who just seemed sad or lonely. 
</P>
<P>
Though no official statistics are kept, she says she has noticed better 
attitudes and better grades among the participants. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is an excellent program," Burndahl said. "So many of these kids 
come with either a negative role model or no role model at all." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the children she recommends have problems at home that affect their 
schoolwork, she said. And while she doesn't see the friendships as a long-term 
solution to the problems, just getting some encouragement and having someone to 
talk to helps, she said. 
</P>
<P>
While officials seemed to emphasize benefits for the children, volunteers said 
they, too, grow from the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I get uplifted by the children and I learn a lot," said Vivian Sangston, 
another program volunteer. "There are different ways of doing things since I 
was a kid, so I learn too," said the 74-year-old who has "adopted" a 
third-grade class at Ruby Drive. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said she has learned some Spanish from two youngsters she is 
helping to learn English. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know Spanish, so we kind of learn together," she said, noting that her 
efforts to speak Spanish are not very good either. "So we laugh at each other." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers concentrate on friendship and activities with the children rather 
than counseling, Donaldson said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we come, we give them love," said 78-year-old Joseph Peterson, a 
volunteer of 5 months. Peterson said he "didn't get too much attention when I 
was a child," so he often can understand what the two boys he has befriended 
are going through. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to tutoring one of his boys in math, Gottlieb said he modifies 
games so they're not competitive. He said he usually just tries to keep the 
games going rather than see who makes the first mistake. "This builds their 
self-esteem in a constructive way rather than at the expense of another 
person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents said they were happy with the results of the program for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter was a very hyper child and it taught her how to act in the 
classroom," one mother said of her 10-year-old daughter who was enrolled in the 
program as a preschooler. "I really think it helped her, it showed her how to 
behave in school." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the seniors say they do several types of volunteer work to keep busy. 
But they enjoy being with the children most of all.

MOBILE FREE CLINIC, HEALTH CARE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again we read (May 3) the news of another part of our health care system 
that is suffering from a lack of funds. This time it is the community 
development council's mobile free clinic. 
</P>
<P>
America, America, where are our values? We hear and read that health care -- 
something that is so necessary to the whole community -- must pay for itself in 
order to survive. I ask this question: why do the Stealth and B-1 bombers not 
have to pay for themselves? Why doesn't the cruise missile pay for itself? 
</P>
<P>
Something is terribly wrong here.

TEACHERS DESCRIBE A YOUNG MAN WHO ALWAYS KNEW WHO HE WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As former teachers of Julian Cummings, we read with great pleasure and pride 
your account (May 3) of his achievements at UC Berkeley. Even as a junior high 
school student, Julian knew who he was and what he wanted in a remarkably 
mature sense, so all that he has accomplished in the years after he left us 
comes as little surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the wording of the article's title, "Honors Graduate Had an Uphill 
Fight," revived one of our fondest memories of Julian. As an eighth-grader 
participating in a study trip to Yosemite, Julian wanted to have the same 
experiences as anyone else visiting the park. To realize this desire, he 
selected many activities that would challenge his physical abilities, one of 
which was a hike to the top of Yosemite Falls. Although we all admired his 
determination, we doubted such an arduous undertaking fell within the range of 
his ability. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, however, Julian knew himself better than we did. When he and his 
father finally returned from their successful climb -- long after everyone else 
had come back to camp and well past the time we had begun to become concerned 
-- we were privileged to share a triumph with him and his parents that is 
unique in all our years of Yosemite experiences. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, we've known all along that "uphill battles" are challenges that 
Julian meets with purpose and effectiveness. We congratulate him on his 
outstanding achievements and wish him every happiness and success in the 
future. Julian Cummings will always have a special place in our teaching 
memories.

GIFTS AND TRIPS FOR SEN. BERGESON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Sen. Marian Bergeson's candidacy for lieutenant governor: Is this not 
the Bergeson who cannot say "no" when gifts and trips are offered, as related 
in The Times on March 27? The gifts totaled $21,148, including two trips, one 
to New Zealand and another to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
There is no "free lunch!" If Bergeson does not know this, I don't want her 
representing me as a lieutenant governor. Under these circumstances, I do not 
like her actions as my state senator. Is this not the bone of contention going 
on now in Washington?

JUDGE'S DECISION ON REMOVING FOXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judge Robert Kelleher's decision to sanction the "murder" of the foxes at the 
Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station (May 2) is a small example of the type of 
narrow-minded idiotic decision made by a man who does not have any 
understanding of ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Even after animal organizations have offered to trap the foxes, he renders such 
an unwarranted decision. It's frightening to have such men as Judge Kelleher in 
positions of power!

IRVINE'S RIGHTS LAW AND THE ATTEMPT TO AMEND IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been reading the diatribe from Scott Peotter and the Irvine Values 
Coalition concerning the Irvine human rights ordinance for months now. I have 
even had the opportunity to speak with Peotter personally in a class at UCI at 
which he was a guest speaker. After reading the latest article to appear in The 
Times ("A Matter of Values, Political Semantics," Orange County Life, May 4), I 
felt compelled to write. 
</P>
<P>
He (Peotter) states: "What two people do in their bedroom is their own 
business. But when it comes out of the bedroom and is legislated over the rest 
of the citizens, that's where I have problems with it." This comment is based 
on one of the most common homophobic beliefs that homosexuality is merely a 
behavior. The only bedroom issue the rights ordinance is concerned with is that 
everyone in the city of Irvine has a bedroom without the fear of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
One point of the coalition's propaganda most frequently made is that the rights 
ordinance establishes special privileges and protections for gays and lesbians. 
If they believe this, then they must believe that it also establishes special 
protections for blacks, Mexicans, Asians, women, single people and those 
physically handicapped, for there are no distinctions made between any of the 
groups covered by the ordinance. Excuse me; there are some distinctions made. 
Section III.I-103 (b) of the ordinance specifically exempts religious 
organizations from upholding the provisions of the ordinance -- they are 
permitted to discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most personally irritating points made by Peotter and his coalition 
is their belief that gays and lesbians are a threat to the "traditional" 
family. An ever-increasing number of gay and lesbian couples are having or 
adopting children. Many "undesirable" children who have been rejected by 
"traditional" families have found love, security and a home as adopted or 
foster children to homosexual couples. Though a family of a mommy and a mommy, 
or a daddy and a daddy and 2.5 kids is not traditional, it is not a threat. 
Drugs, alcohol, divorce -- these are the real threats to the "traditional" 
family. 
</P>
<P>
It is time that people like Scott Peotter get over themselves and let us get on 
with life. Rather than creating communities and a society that are accepting of 
their diversity, they are promoting anger and hatred and division. As the 
coalition has garnered support from the likes of (Rep. William E.) Dannemeyer 
and (Rep. Robert K.) Dornan, I encourage everyone who supports human rights, 
especially those in Irvine, to support the Irvine City Council. Vote against a 
small but vocal minority who have allowed their prejudices to threaten the 
rights of all minorities.

IRVINE'S RIGHTS LAW AND THE ATTEMPT TO AMEND IT

<TEXT>
<P>
Herman Wong's article (May 4) is a wonderful example of how good reporting of 
the facts can break through the lies, distortions and myths so frequently 
perpetrated about homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Jim Boone and Joe Bucuzzo are "just like any couple" in Irvine, and, 
indeed, in Orange County. And they are just two of the many thousands of 
committed lesbian and gay couples who live in all parts of our county. 
</P>
<P>
They are also concerned about and assaulted by that small number of virulent 
homophobic people, like (Rep. William E.) Dannemeyer, who would actively deny 
Orange County's lesbians and gay men their full civil and human rights and 
subject them to unfettered discrimination. These people argue that lesbians and 
gay men should be subject to loss of employment or residence due only to the 
whim of a bigoted person. 
</P>
<P>
I am confident that the voters of the city of Irvine will overwhelmingly vote 
for human decency and equal civil rights for all Irvine residents, irrespective 
of their sexual orientation or any other irrelevant factor.

LOTTERY MILLIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Tuesday we went to the polls for a special school district election on a 
bond issue for more school capacity. We have no argument with the need for 
adequate school availability, nor for the overriding need for education of 
young and old. 
</P>
<P>
We do wonder what has been done with that money that was to flow into 
California's educational program -- from the devious promises made by the 
backers of the lottery in order to give the lottery a semblance of 
respectability. We have yet to see any detailed accounting of how many of those 
millions have gone to schools, or of how the money is being spent. 
</P>
<P>
We believe some kind of detailed report on the amounts and uses of this 
"windfall" is long overdue.

IRVINE'S RIGHTS LAW AND THE ATTEMPT TO AMEND IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading "A Matter of Values, Political Semantics" (May 4) I wonder: What 
other "behaviors" disturb Scott Peotter's "traditional values" system? And I 
have pondered what group, included in the Irvine human rights ordinance, will 
be the next target of his coalition on account of their "behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Peotter tells us that his set of values came from the "Founding Fathers"; 
however, he fails to realize they were a great group of activists -- perhaps 
even radicals -- who, in their own time, overthrew a government! And while I 
don't know if any were gay, some were quite noteworthy for their womanizing and 
boozing. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout history, a few so-called traditionists have excluded many with their 
one-dimensional view of what society should be. Now that the initiative to 
discriminate against sexual orientation will appear on the November ballot, I 
feel certain that a majority of the people of Irvine will use three-dimensional 
vision and vote it down.

RANCHO SANTIAGO PITCHERS FEEL CHIPPER; 
</P>
<P>
HARD-WORKING NAVARRETTE STRIKES OUT NINE, BEATS ORANGE COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Much has been made about the number of innings Rancho Santiago College starting 
pitchers Jack Bailey and Willie Navarrette have worked this season. 
</P>
<P>
Both had pitched more than 130 innings before the Southern California Regional 
playoffs started Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But at least for now, the Tired Theory can be put to rest. Saturday, Navarrette 
pitched a complete-game seven-hitter to lead Rancho Santiago to a 2-1 victory 
over Orange Coast in a second-round playoff game in front of about 350 
spectators at Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey pitched six strong innings as the Dons pounded East Los Angeles, 15-3, 
in the first round Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Navarrette, who had pitched poorly in his past two starts, was working on eight 
days rest Saturday and was sharp. He struck out nine and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
The extra rest came because of the built-in four-day break between the end of 
the conference season and the beginning of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to come out here and prove I wasn't tired," said Navarrette, a 
sophomore left-hander. "We didn't throw at all for four days, and I felt strong 
after that." 
</P>
<P>
Although OCC hit several balls hard, a second-inning home run by Scott Talanoa 
accounted for the Pirates' only run. It was Talanoa's state-leading 17th home 
run this season but also his last. The loss ends the season for OCC (31-11-1). 
</P>
<P>
"We hit a lot of 'at-em' balls," OCC Coach Mike Mayne said. "We hit the ball 
better than one run, but Willie did a good job. He's tough to score on." 
</P>
<P>
It was the 18th home run Navarrette (11-4) has given up this season and the 
seventh in his past three starts for Rancho Santiago (29-15). 
</P>
<P>
"I throw the split finger (fastball) a lot, and when you make a mistake with 
it, it just hangs there," Navarrette said. "What I can I say? I've been the 
victim of the home-run ball this season." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago will now advance to the double-elimination third round and play 
Cypress at 11 a.m. at Rancho Santiago Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago tied it, 1-1, in the third with some help from the OCC defense. 
Joey Townsend lined a single into left center and went to second when OCC left 
fielder Craig Nixon and center fielder Jason Young collided. Nixon was charged 
with an error. 
</P>
<P>
Louie Maldonado then bunted for a single. 
</P>
<P>
With runners on first and third, Danny Ontiveros grounded into a double play, 
but Townsend scored. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago got the final run on a solo home run by John McTaggart in the 
fourth. OCC pitcher John Douris (7-4) had gotten ahead in the count, no balls 
and two strikes. But after a ball, Douris got a pitch in the middle of the 
plate, and McTaggart rammed it over the left-field wall for his 11th home run 
of the season and second of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
OCC's top three hitters -- Hector Santa Cruz, Nixon and Young -- had only one 
hit among them in 16 at-bats. Young hit a two-out single in the eighth. 
Navarrette then walked Talanoa on four pitches but got Marty Cordova to ground 
into a force play to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Navarrette hit Darrell Conner with one out in the ninth and fell behind 
pinch-hitter Pete McKeller, three balls and no strikes, but came back to get a 
strikeout. Mike Kelly then hit a fly ball into right-center field, but 
Ontiveros made a sliding catch for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
"Willie was close to coming out (in the ninth)," Rancho Santiago Coach Don 
Sneddon said. "We had (Jack) Bailey ready. It would have been a real tough 
decision but Willie hung in there like he has all season."

SOUTHERN SECTION 2-A SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
WOODBRIDGE BOYS MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN FINAL RELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Woodbridge High School boys' swim team got a second chance Saturday and was 
able to redeem itself. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Warriors were oh-so-close to the Southern Section 2-A 
championship. All they needed to do was win the 400-yard freestyle relay, the 
last event of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors led through much of that race, but Brea-Olinda came from behind on 
the last lap. The Wildcats won the title, and Woodbridge finished third. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at Belmont Plaza pool, the Warriors again needed a victory in the 400 
freestyle relay and again took an early lead. But this time Coleman Hundeby 
pulled away on the last lap to win for Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
It gave the Warriors the co-championship with San Luis Obispo, both with 82 
points. Laguna Hills, which chased Woodbridge throughout the relay, finished 
third with 81 points. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills won the girls' title convincingly. The Mustangs had 173 points, 
more than double their nearest competitor. Mater Dei was second with 79 and 
Bellflower third with 67.5. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge Coach Dan Gaines said he couldn't help but remember last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We were winning, and things were looking good, but in the back of my mind I 
kept thinking about last year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He need not have worried. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Hundeby, who had already won the 200 and 500 freestyles, gave the Warriors 
the lead on the first lap -- as he had done in 1988. But this time, when he 
handed over the lead to his teammates, they kept it. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bisheff and Jason Steinhouser swam the second and third legs and increased 
the lead to 10 yards. Then came Coleman Hundeby, Chad's younger brother, who 
swam the anchor last year. 
</P>
<P>
Hundeby held off Bryan Stoeckel of Laguna Hills and recorded his best split 
time ever, 46.8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the race, I was thinking about last year, how we had the lead all the 
way until the end," Coleman Hundeby said. "But I knew we were better this year. 
I knew we were great." 
</P>
<P>
All four swimmers recorded their best times and Woodbridge swam a 3:14.32. 
Laguna Hills was more than a second behind, at 3:15.79. 
</P>
<P>
The race ended a close battle for the championship. Six teams finished within 
10 points of first. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge's victory came on the strength of the Hundebys, who were the the 
team's only individual qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Hundeby, considered one of the top senior national swimmers, won the 200 
freestyle (1:38.45) and 500 freestyle (4:25.29). Coleman Hundeby finished fifth 
in the 200 freestyle (1:43.68) and was seventh in the 500 (4:42.22). 
</P>
<P>
Because they had only the Hundebys in the individual events, the Warriors were 
well back in the pack before the final event. Woodbridge was seventh with 50 
points before the 400 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
But with so many teams in the running, the points were spread out. And that 
kept the Warriors in contention. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew our stronger events with Chad and Coleman came later in the meet, so I 
felt we had a chance," Gaines said. "But San Luis Obispo had 30 points from the 
diving competition, and we didn't have any divers. It gave them a lead that 
looked insurmountable." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Troy of San Luis Obispo finished third in diving with 374.10 points. San 
Luis Obispo's Ben King was sixth (333.05) and teammate Kyle Griffin eighth 
(292.90). 
</P>
<P>
But the Tigers did not have any winners in the individual events, and their 
relay teams faired poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura, led by Jason Stelle, was ahead for most of the meet. Stelle set a 2-A 
record in the backstroke with a time of 51.93. The previous mark of 52.10 was 
held by Kevin Nash of Canyon Country Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers were in first with 79 points going into the last event, but their 
400 relay team didn't qualify for the finals. That left Agoura in fourth at the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills was led by Brian Fisher, who finished second in the 200 and 500 
freestyles. He also swam the first leg of the 400 freestyle but again trailed 
Hundeby. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Trabuco Hills took an early lead and increased it 
throughout the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Amy Ward led the Mustangs, winning the 200 freestyle (1:50.80) and 
finishing third in the 500 (4:58.96). As a freshman, Ward had finished second 
in both events. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy with my times, but next year I want to win the 500, too," Ward 
said. "That would be great." 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs' Cindy Wold won the 100 freestyle (53.04). Trabuco Hills also won 
the 400 freestyle relay. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills showed the same dominance it did in the Pacific Coast League 
final, where the Mustangs ended Woodbridge's four-year reign as champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept looking for the teams that were going to challenge us, but nobody did," 
Trabuco Hills Coach Ken Pappas said. "We have a very young team, so I think 
we'll be strong for the next couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ward: "Even after we beat Woodbridge (in the league finals), we weren't 
sure whether we could win the Southern Section meet. But after the 
preliminaries yesterday (Friday), we knew we had it won. We just swam so well, 
we knew no one could beat us." 
</P>
<P>
Natashe Kohne of Rancho Alamitos was the only double-winner in the girls' meet. 
Kohne won the 200 individual medley (2:07.02) and 100 backstroke (59.61).

<P>
LOS ALAMITOS GIRLS WIN SECOND TITLE IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the start of the season, Los Alamitos High School girls' swim Coach Debbie 
Flemming thought her team was good enough to repeat as 3-A champions. 
</P>
<P>
She was right. 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins made fast work of the competition Saturday in the finals at 
Belmont Plaza pool. By the time the first individual event was over, there was 
little doubt who was in charge. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos not only had the winner in the 200-yard freestyle, it had the 
third- and fourth-place finishers as well. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy St. Martin won the event with a time of 1 minute 51.27 seconds. Marci 
Herron was third (1:54.78) and Kim Rubino fourth (1:56.12). 
</P>
<P>
Only Natalie Norberg of San Marino kept it from being a clean sweep, finishing 
second (1:52.24). 
</P>
<P>
With that kind of depth, the Griffins were unstoppable. They finished with 195 
points, well ahead of second-place El Dorado, which had 104. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked really strong in the preliminaries, so I didn't think anyone would 
challenge us," Flemming said. "And everybody, I mean everybody, swam their best 
times in the finals." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos has always had a strong girls' swim team. The Griffins have won 
six consecutive Empire League championships. 
</P>
<P>
But, until last season, they had never won a Southern Section title. 
</P>
<P>
"It was getting old just winning league championships," Flemming said. "Our 
goal last season was to win the Southern Section title. We did, and we made our 
goal to repeat this year. I felt with the talent we had coming back, we should 
win it again." 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins lost only one swimmer from last year's team. They qualified 12 
swimmers for the finals as well as two relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Flemming said, everyone was at their best. 
</P>
<P>
Besides St. Martin's victory in the 200 freestyle, the Griffins received a 
first-place finish from Marci Herron. 
</P>
<P>
Herron won the 100 freestyle with a time of 53.11. Rubino was fifth in that 
event. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos also won the 400 freestyle relay with time of 3:35.40. It was 
eight seconds faster than San Marino, which finished second in the event. 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins also received a strong performance from Nicole Williamson, who 
finished second in the 200 individual medley and 500 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Second was no disgrace as both those events were won by three-time Olympic 
gold-medalist Janet Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Evans set a national high school record in the 200 individual medley with a 
time of 1:59.96. She also just missed the record in the 500 freestyle with a 
time of 4:38.34. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being used to international competition, Evans, a senior, has found 
plenty of motivation on the high school level. 
</P>
<P>
"My coach has found ways to get me motivated," said Evans, who will attend 
Stanford next year. "Stuff like setting goals for times and trying to lap the 
other swimmers. It's helped me get ready for these meets." 
</P>
<P>
Williamson swam strong times in both events. She went 2:05.54 in the 200 
individual medley and 4:53.60 in the 500 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really happy for Nicole and Janet," Flemming said. "They have been very 
good friends for a long time. Nicole will be back next year, so it will be hers 
to win." 
</P>
<P>
San Marino won the boys' meet for the second consecutive year. The Titans 
finished with 179 points. Damien was second with 132 and Santa Monica third 
with 98. 
</P>
<P>
Servite was the top Orange County team at the meet. The Friars scored 55 
points, good enough for 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Deborah Kory of Rolling Hills broke the 3-A record 
in the 100 backstroke with a time of 1:05.87. The previous mark was 1:06.23, 
set by Shannon Breese of Thousand Oaks in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
With Evans swimming the opening leg, El Dorado's 200 medley relay team finished 
first with a time of 1:53.13. 
</P>
<P>
But the night, again, belonged to Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey we have everyone returning next year," Flemming said. "This could be a 
dynasty."

NATIONAL EDUCATION'S CHIEF TOP O.C. EARNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerome Cwiertnia earned a nifty $1.8 million in 1988 as president of National 
Education Corp., the nation's largest operator of vocational training schools. 
</P>
<P>
But Cwiertnia is living proof that money -- even lots of it -- doesn't always 
buy happiness in the executive suite. He quit his job with the Irvine firm last 
March to look for a position that would give him "more managerial 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Cwiertnia's pay of $1.8 million made him the highest-paid manager among Orange 
County-based, publicly held corporations, according to The Times annual survey 
of executive compensation. Counting salary and stock options, Cwiertnia earned 
$360,000 more than his boss, H. David Bright, National Education's chairman. 
Bright was the county's second highest-paid executive, making nearly $1.5 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the pair of National Education executives earned far less than 
1987's top-earning corporate chiefs. James Conte, president of Community 
Psychiatric Centers in Laguna Hills, earned a whopping $8.5 million in 1987 -- 
with $7.6 million of that total coming from stock options. His boss, Community 
Psychiatric Chairman Robert L. Green, earned $6.8 million in 1987, including 
$6.3 million in stock options. 
</P>
<P>
Conte and Green do not appear on the 1988 list. The company declined to supply 
information on executive pay for the latest survey because it had not yet been 
disclosed in the company's proxy. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of about 2 dozen of Orange County's largest publicly traded 
companies, conducted by Mercer Meidinger Hansen for The Times, showed that pay 
for the county's top 10 executives averaged $998,000 in 1988, down from $2.4 
million in 1987. The large difference primarily reflects a big decline in 
profits taken by executives exercising stock options. 
</P>
<P>
The Top 25 list was dominated by the county's largest companies: National 
Education and home builder J.M. Peters each claimed four of the top-paid 
executives; Bergen Brunswig, a pharmaceutical distributor, placed three 
executives on the list, and five companies claimed two each. 
</P>
<P>
No female executives made the Top 25 list. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Orange County's reputation as a high-technology center, Western Digital 
Chairman Roger W. Johnson was the only high-tech executive to place in the top 
25. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson earned $565,578 in 1988, placing 12th on the list. But Western 
Digital's proxy also listed nearly $1.8 million in stock options. In Johnson's 
case, the stock-option earnings are not included in the compensation totals 
because it was believed that the options were paid out over a 3-year period 
ending in September, 1988. Western Digital would not say when the payments were 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Many top managers enjoyed big gains in 1987 by selling those options before the 
October, 1987, stock market crash. Stock prices were depressed throughout much 
of 1988, reducing the incentive for executives to trade their options for cash. 
</P>
<P>
While 1988 was not a big year for stock profits, National Education's Cwiertnia 
gained the top spot by exercising stock options worth $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Stock options are a commonly used method of motivating and rewarding corporate 
executives. Typically, a stock-option program gives an employee the right to 
periodically purchase the company's shares at a fixed price -- at or below the 
market price -- for a certain number of years. 
</P>
<P>
If the stock's market price rises above the option price, the option may be 
exercised. The executive's profit is the difference between the option price 
and the market price. 
</P>
<P>
Compensation specialists say that stock options, while used widely at 
corporations nationwide, are becoming less attractive as a form of executive 
compensation for the smaller, fast-growing companies that are common in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"If an emerging company goes public and has widely dispersed stock options, 
then the higher the stock goes the more the company pays out in compensation," 
said David Thomsen, managing director of the Economic Research Institute in 
Newport Beach. "In some extreme cases, the stock price has gone so high that it 
has wiped out a firm's earnings per share." 
</P>
<P>
Thomsen said some Orange County companies are turning to 
alternative-compensation programs such as deferred or supplemental-compensation 
plans, which involve tax-free, interest-bearing accounts that the company 
typically contributes to. These programs are less risky than stock options, 
which often depend entirely on a company's stock performance. 
</P>
<P>
At companies where executives' pay was tied to the firm's performance, 
individuals reaped handsome rewards as profits soared. 
</P>
<P>
J.M. Peters Co., a Newport Beach home builder, enjoyed a strong 1988 thanks to 
the soaring county housing market. 
</P>
<P>
Company Chairman James M. Peters likes to reward people "not only by salary, 
but also with an incentive to perform," said Brian Teriot, a company spokesman. 
He said executives' salaries are often tied to the company's earnings or the 
number of house closings. 
</P>
<P>
Several J.M. Peters executives made out handsomely in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Those executives included: J. Karl Kruetzer, president of the company's San 
Diego division, $531,804; Frank E. Fullerton, vice president, $512,550; Robert 
J. Trapp, vice president, $509,089, and Richard D. Bradshaw, vice president, 
$479,897. 
</P>
<P>
The two co-founders of Newport Beach-based Downey Savings &amp; Loan Assn. were 
generously rewarded. Company President Maurice L. McAlister made more than $1.1 
million in 1988, while Chief Executive Officer Gerald H. McQuarrie earned 
$820,947. 
</P>
<P>
Downey, one of the county's most profitable thrifts, had earnings of $29 
million on revenue of $330.8 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
McAlister and McQuarrie, neither of whom made 1987's list of highest-paid 
executives, made the 1988 list because of large bonuses. McAlister received a 
$750,000 bonus, McQuarrie a $500,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"The board voted to give us the bonuses because we had excellent earnings for 
several years," McQuarrie said. "The two of us started the company (in 1957) 
and took no salaries for the first 3 or 4 years, and then took only $800 a 
month for about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This was our first bonus in 30 years," he added. "And I'm not going to give it 
back to them." 
</P>
