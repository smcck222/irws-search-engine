LEBANON HOSTAGE SURFACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A West German relief worker surfaced in Lebanon after his abduction 10 days 
earlier. Markus Quint offered few clues about his disappearance when he spoke 
with reporters in the southern city of Zahrani, headquarters of the 
ASME-Humanitas relief group for which he works. He appeared with Nabih Berri, 
head of the Shiite Muslim militia Amal, who said his organization obtained 
Quint's release without paying a ransom. He did not name the kidnapers but said 
"we exerted a lot of pressure and carried out raids." Meanwhile, Syrian forces 
joined the search for an elderly Briton, Jack Mann, who disappeared last week. 
A group calling itself the Cells of Armed Struggle claimed Friday that it had 
taken a hostage, but it did not provide an identification.

A stock clerk who was believed to be among the hostages held by a gunman at a K 
mart store in San Leandro was arrested for investigation of stealing electronic 
equipment from the store, police said. Darnell Marshall Oliver, 28, was 
arrested after police went to his apartment in their investigation of the 
hostage drama and found several items -- including a video camera and a 
telephone answering machine -- with serial numbers of goods stolen from the K 
mart, said Lt. Tom Hull. A masked gunman hid in the store, shot one employee 
and tied and gagged the manager before police arrived and foiled the robbery 
attempt. The gunman fled and is still at large, police said.

Eight explorers reached the North Pole after 600 miles on skis, but an 
expedition spokeswoman said the team could be in peril because of thin ice and 
low visibility. "They've reached the pole," Tracy Carpenter of the Icewalk 
Expedition said in Ottawa, the Canadian capital. "Now the next job is getting 
them out. The visibility is bad and the ice is rough and thin." She said there 
was concern about when a Twin Otter aircraft could reach the explorers. The 
eight-member team, led by British adventurer Robert Swan, is seeking to draw 
attention to global pollution but has run into rougher conditions than 
expected.

Rain dwindled and rivers began receding in Maine after flooding forced some 
evacuations, the National Weather Service said. A flood watch continued for the 
Androscoggin and Kennebec rivers -- both more than four feet above flood stage 
-- but officials said they should fall back inside their banks. In Auburn, many 
of about 50 residents who had been evacuated were allowed to return home. 
Several homes and businesses were flooded in that city and in Lewiston and 
Augusta. No damage or injuries were reported, police said. In Texas, residents 
cleaned up from storms that demolished three apartment complexes and blew over 
10 helicopters at Ft. Hood.

A federal judge has sentenced two former Oakland police officers to 120 days of 
electronic "home detention" for lying about their sick leave and dictated an 
apology they must make to the Police Department and the public. U.S. District 
Judge John Vukasin issued the unusual sentence rather than send Johnnie F. 
Clark and Theresa Jeffery to prison for perjury. They were convicted of lying 
in connection with a discrimination suit they and seven other black officers 
filed in 1985, accusing the city of racial bias in hiring and promotions. The 
suit was later dismissed for unrelated reasons. Clark and Jeffery, who are now 
married, were fired from the force in 1987.

A British-backed consortium is planning to build the largest toxic waste plant 
in the world in Morocco's section of the Sahara, the Guardian newspaper 
reported. The British newspaper said the consortium's plan is to export 2,000 
tons of toxic waste a day to Morocco from Europe and North America and burn it 
to produce electricity. This plan has been presented to King Hassan, Morocco's 
ruler, as a way of bringing industrialization to his country. However, the 
newspaper said, only waste oil products were mentioned in the plan presented to 
Hassan. The newspaper said a copy of the plan was passed on to it because of 
fears the operation will not be properly controlled.

BABY SNATCHED FROM HOSPITAL

Sacramento police are seeking a 200-pound woman with streaked orange and black 
hair who kidnaped a 3-day-old boy from his mother's hospital room the day 
before Mother's Day. The "terribly distraught" mother went home from Sutter 
Memorial Hospital shortly after her new baby was stolen from his crib when she 
left her room briefly while getting ready to be discharged, authorities said. 
Police hunted for the missing infant and his abductor, who posed as a staff 
volunteer at the hospital in a white smock with a hospital badge and may have 
waited for the baby to be born to steal him. "In 52 years and 50,000 births, 
this kind of thing has never happened here," said a hospital spokeswoman. "It's 
a real sad incident."

Solidarity founder Lech Walesa raised the possibility that his union might 
support its longtime foe, Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, as a candidate for 
president in upcoming elections. Addressing a rally of about 3,000 people after 
a Mass in St. Brygida's Church in the seaport of Gdansk, Walesa said he 
believes Jaruzelski has changed since his government banned Solidarity in 
October, 1982. "I see Jaruzelski as a different man following our meeting on 
April 18," Walesa said. "I cannot be guided by emotions and I must be a cool 
politician now." The April 18 meeting, called to review the 
government-Solidarity accords restoring legal status to the union, was the 
first face-to-face session between the two since Jaruzelski imposed martial law 
in December, 1981.

TOXIC WASTE

<TEXT>
<P>
After several telephone calls to the appropriate city offices, and speaking to 
very nice personnel, it became quite apparent that toxic waste collection 
points are sadly missing. There are sporadic Saturday, 9-3, collection spots 
around the city. What is one to do with oil-base paint cans, car batteries, 
etc.? 
</P>
<P>
The environment and toxic waste are in the forefront in thought with only 
actual remedies (accessible collection points) lacking. Also, what about the 
collection of food cans, household plastic bottles other than soft drink 
bottles?

AGENDA FOR NEXT GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States is failing its children. The country has no cohesive policy 
for their health, education and safety. It is time for the federal and state 
government to draw up a children's agenda for the 1990s, especially to meet the 
needs of the youngest children before they suffer irreparable harm. There are 
already many programs that work. Today and tomorrow we shall discuss some of 
these programs that should be expanded, and how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
The President, Congress and state leaders should commit the resources to expand 
these programs so that families will have healthy babies and children will get 
a good start in school. These leaders must also provide direction to concerned 
citizens' groups, businesses, the medical profession and educators on how they 
can work together to help children. 
</P>
<P>
These are the programs that should be expanded: 
</P>
<P>
PRENATAL CARE: Every day in America 676 babies are born to women who have not 
had proper prenatal care. Every day 107 babies die before reaching their first 
birthday. Twelve of those babies die every day in California. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors who see women early and often during pregnancy can check for diet or 
health problems that may jeopardize their unborn children. They can reduce 
premature births or births of babies who weigh too little to thrive and who 
therefore die or are severely disabled for the rest of their lives. But many 
women have little or no health insurance to pay for this care. The federal 
government must commit more money to expanding Medicaid coverage for low-income 
pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
California is not even spending all the federal money it does receive for this 
care. The Legislature is considering a measure to correct that situation by 
trying to get the state Administration to anticipate its surpluses better and 
plan ahead on using them. That's a sound approach. 
</P>
<P>
NUTRITION: When pregnant women have proper nutrition, the odds are higher that 
they will have healthy babies. And those infants and children must eat right if 
they are to do well in school and in life. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest barrier to proper nutrition among poor families is the obvious one: 
They don't have the money to buy healthy food, says Armida Castellanos. She 
works for the federal Women, Infant and Children nutrition program at the 
Roybal Health Center in East Los Angeles, where in an average month counselors 
see 1,350 women and their children. These counselors distribute vouchers for 
food purchases. They also discuss with the women what they should buy with 
those vouchers and prepare for their families. But in California only 42% of 
the people who are eligible are served by WIC. 
</P>
<P>
IMMUNIZATION: Immunization of young children prevents deadly or debilitating 
diseases. It also averts millions of dollars in health costs. More money needs 
to be spent to make sure all children get these life-enhancing immunizations. 
</P>
<P>
HEAD START: If children get the best possible start in school, there should not 
be the enormous need for costly remedial programs that there is now. If 
children succeed in school, they stay in school. The evidence is clear: Federal 
Head Start programs work. They help young children develop the basic skills 
they will need to succeed in school. Yet there are not enough programs to serve 
even half the poor children who are eligible. Since 1978, Head Start in 
California has been falling behind in serving poor children. In 1978, 25.45% of 
poor children were enrolled; by 1987 that figure had fallen to 18.51% of the 
2.5 million disadvantaged youngsters who are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
DROPOUT PREVENTION: Every day in America, 1,375 teen-agers drop out of school. 
Dropping out is expensive. Male high school dropouts will earn $187,000 less 
during their lifetime than high school graduates; female dropouts earn $122,000 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Schools need shoring up across the board to excite children about learning. 
High school is too late; the efforts must begin in the early years and for the 
poorest children. But while the number of poor children has been increasing, 
support for the basic federal program for disadvantaged children, called 
Chapter One, has declined. 
</P>
<P>
Local school districts must also give far more support to counseling programs 
that help spot potential dropouts before they leave school. Each teacher can 
help by giving at least one student the kind of attention that could make all 
the difference in keeping a youngster in school. 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: Government effort, of course, is not the only answer. 
More business people need to get involved by adopting a school and paying 
attention to students, as they can do through the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, or in parent councils at their neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY: Every day in America almost 1,300 teen-agers have babies. 
Many of these young people, especially the youngest among them, lack the 
emotional and economic resources to care for a child. They often drop out of 
school. And their infants are at risk because these teen-age mothers-to-be 
often lack proper care while they are pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
One way to start helping these teen-agers is to assist them in delaying 
pregnancy through access to family planning services. Yet in the last 10 years 
federal money for the Title X Family Planning Program has been badly eroded. 
</P>
<P>
California has the second highest rate of teen-age pregnancy in the country, 
and yet it lags behind other states in dealing with the problem. It could soon 
be further behind if Gov. George Deukmejian succeeds in eliminating the state 
Office of Family Planning. For example, the Harbor Free Clinic in San Pedro 
gives counseling to teen-agers that helps them stay in school, set goals and 
develop a sense of themselves. That clinic's efforts to help teen-agers could 
be shut off July 1 if the governor kills the state program. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to remember how interrelated these programs are. If a youngster 
feels comfortable going to school, he is more likely to learn. If a teen-ager 
doesn't have a baby, she has a better chance of finishing school. If a young 
man succeeds in school, if he has some hope for the future and a chance at a 
good job, he has less incentive to deal drugs or run with a gang. That is why 
it is critical that the government and the public act on the whole range of 
problems facing children. Piecemeal solutions cannot do the job.

GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum has sunk to a new low. His answer to recent graffiti 
denouncing Los Angeles County's inadequate AIDS policies is to take the money 
to clean it up out of the already pathetic county AIDS budget (Metro, May 10). 
How clever! 
</P>
<P>
Along similar lines, a number of possibilities suggest themselves. Since, for 
example, much of the gang graffiti marring local buildings is the handiwork of 
people of low income and members of minorities, we could clean it up with funds 
from the programs that provide food, housing, etc. for the poor, or from 
job-training programs. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, take it out of Schabarum's salary. If he worried half as much about 
health care as he does about graffiti, there never would have been a problem in 
the first place.

LASORDA DRESSES UP OFFENSE AS HERSHISER DOES THE REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Tom Lasorda noted later, after Orel Hershiser had allowed only two hits and 
the Dodgers had broken away for a 9-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies 
Sunday, "When the snowball is rolling down the hill, you try anything to derail 
it." 
</P>
<P>
So among the things Lasorda tried Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A pregame meeting in which he promised a new suit to any player who drives 
in two runs in a game over the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray began collecting a new wardrobe by hammering two home runs and 
driving in five runs Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cancellation of batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we've been trying too hard, taking too much hitting," Murray said after 
the Sunday awakening. "Maybe by not taking batting practice we got our minds 
off it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Replacing Joe Amalfitano as the third base coach after the Dodgers' string 
of scoreless innings reached 25 when Phillie starter Alex Madrid shut them out 
in the first. 
</P>
<P>
"(Coach Bill) Russell came over and said, 'Why don't you go out to third base 
and maybe shake things up,' " explained Lasorda, who exhorted his hitters in a 
voice heard on Broad Street. About coaching third, he said: "I enjoyed it. It 
felt good to see those runs coming. I did it a few years ago and I think we won 
seven in a row. Poor Joey thought he was out of a job." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chris Gwynn was moved to the leadoff spot, with Willie Randolph dropped to 
No. 2 in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn doubled in a run in a four-run fourth and doubled and scored in a 
four-run seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn will remain at leadoff when the Dodgers open a three-game series in New 
York tonight, Lasorda said, adding that he will again cancel batting practice 
and again coach third base. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that if I didn't go out there, the players would make me after scoring 
this many runs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The nine runs were a season high for the Dodgers, who ripped four home runs 
after going 66 innings and 13 days without one. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton ended that streak and the 25-inning scoreless streak when he hit 
his first homer of the year in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Murray hit a two-run homer when the Dodgers chased Madrid in the fourth and 
cracked a three-run homer off Randy O'Neal in the seventh, when Mike Scioscia 
followed with his first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Madrid is a 25-year-old rookie who was recently recalled because of the injury 
siege that decimated the Phillies' rotation. 
</P>
<P>
The true test of the Dodgers' offensive rejuvenation will come during the next 
three days when they are scheduled to face Met pitchers Sid Fernandez, Ron 
Darling and Dwight Gooden at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have wasted a series of outstanding pitching performances, but 
Hershiser said: 
</P>
<P>
"This was nicer for the hitters than for me. I mean, winning 1-0 wouldn't have 
been enough because everyone would have been talking about the good pitching 
again. The hitters needed the confidence boost more than I did, and maybe this 
will give it to them." 
</P>
<P>
Said Murray: "The toughest thing has been to see the pitchers pitch the way 
they have and keep coming up with Ls. We're too good a club to keep playing the 
way we have. We were bound to turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
Murray has six home runs and 25 RBIs. He also leads the club in walks and has 
seen few good pitches as opposing pitchers try to take advantage of Kirk 
Gibson's absence and pitch around Murray, who had one hit in his last 19 
at-bats before homering in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter who you are or who's hitting behind you, that's something 
all hitters have to deal with at one time or another," Murray said of being 
pitched around. "You get hot and the other team says, 'We're not going to let 
this guy beat us.' I've also gotten some pitches and missed them." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't miss the fastball from Madrid or the breaking ball from O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn may not miss either. He is being given the chance to play regularly and 
force the Dodgers into a move with Mike Davis, perhaps, when Gibson leaves the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to be here," Gwynn said. "If I play, fine. If I don't, fine. 
"Right now I'm just trying to help the club any way I can. I've never hit 
leadoff as a pro before, but I like my name on the lineup card no matter where 
it is." 
</P>
<P>
Pitching with eight days' rest, Hershiser walked four but struck out seven and 
allowed only a third-inning single by Ricky Jordan and a bloop double by Steve 
Jeltz in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser is 5-3 after eight starts with a career low earned-run average of 
1.72, having allowed just 12 earned runs, 46 hits and 18 walks in 62 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say that I've picked up where I left off (last year)," he 
said. "But I feel like I'm pitching up to my capability. Two shutouts. ERA 
under two. It wasn't that good when I started last season 5-0." 
</P>
<P>
And maybe the Dodgers' offense is ready to perform up to its capability. Said 
Gwynn: "The pitchers have kept us in the game. It's time to repay the debt." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The four-hit, four-run fourth inning marked only the second time this year the 
Dodgers have gotten four hits in an inning. . . . Eddie Murray has 14 more runs 
batted in than Mike Marshall, who is second on the club with 11 and has only 
two in the last 15 games. . . . Marshall came out of the game in the seventh 
inning because of continuing stiffness in his lower back, but he said he will 
play tonight. "I don't want to jump ship right now," he said. "I'll get some 
rest for it when we're going better." . . . Of Tom Lasorda's bellowing from the 
third-base coach's box, Chris Gwynn said, "You could definitely hear him. There 
was no missed communication." . . . John Tudor said his rehabilitation from 
elbow surgery has reached the point where he expects to throw batting practice 
for the first time in New York.

ANOTHER HEAVENLY VICTORY -- ANGELS SHUT OUT YANKEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels' wonder year continues to press onward, defying expectation, 
explanation and the laws of gravity that were supposed to consign them to the 
depths of the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
Strange things are happening in Anaheim, again and again, and Sunday 
afternoon's 5-0 victory over the New York Yankees provided one more sensory 
overload at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Another Angel shutout was thrown, the club's eighth in 36 games, which is one 
short of the staff's total after 162 games in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Finley became a five-game winner, tying him with Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Minton earned his fourth save in six weeks, after blowing 10 of 17 save 
opportunities in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis made two outstanding defensive plays in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
And the Angels, 13-2 in their last 15 games, climbed 10 games above .500 at 
23-13. That's the second-best record in the major leagues. The only thing 
keeping the Angels out of first place is the fact that the best record (24-12) 
belongs to AL West rival Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hard thing to describe," said Finley, who has ridden the wave to a 5-2 
start, the winningest record on the Angel staff. "The defense has been so good, 
the hitting's been timely, the pitching staff's come together. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know, the guys are having a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
That's apparent. 
</P>
<P>
When's the last time, in a single game, Angel outfielders made a leaping catch 
against the wall, a running catch on a dying flare or a full-sprint, flat-out 
diving catch in the gap -- and Devon White was not involved? 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Angel outfield defense more closely resembled Yankee center fielder 
Bob Brower's guerrilla maneuvers in the fourth inning Sunday -- errors on 
back-to-back plays, paving the way for a four-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday, there was Davis, owner of a club-record 19 outfield errors in 1988, 
racing back to the fence to rob Tom Brookens in the second inning before racing 
in to take away a bloop single from Don Slaught in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Over in right field, Claudell Washington, back in the lineup for the first time 
since April 29, was denying Steve Sax of extra bases with a spectacular, 
parallel-to-the-ground diving catch to open the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
So impressive was Washington's play that Angel third baseman Jack Howell, 
caught up in the emotion, plunged into the home dugout on the next play to 
snare a pop foul off the bat of Don Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
"Back-to-back great plays," Angel Manager Doug Rader said, admiringly. 
"Sometimes good fielding, like good hitting, can be contagious." 
</P>
<P>
Finley was the benefactor, leaning on those plays to survive his own 
unsteadiness (seven hits and two walks) to complete six scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys were running through walls and jumping into dugouts," Finley said. 
"As long as I keep the ball in the park, guys are going to run it down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier to pitch when you have guys willing to run into walls for 
you. They didn't give up on nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who also delivered his fifth home run of the season against Yankee 
starter Andy Hawkins (3-5), was in rare form after the game -- spending most of 
his locker-side chat discussing fielding exploits. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine that. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem astonished whenever I catch a routine fly ball," Davis said, 
breaking into a grin. "That's OK. I know I played bad defense last year. But 
last year was a fluke. I'm sure I'm going to make another error some time, but 
I know I'm a better defensive player than people thought last year." 
</P>
<P>
Davis has unquestionably become a better defensive player since moving from 
right field to left. As a right fielder in 1988, Davis had 14 errors by early 
June. As a left fielder in 1989, Davis has but one error in 33 games. 
</P>
<P>
Rader believes the move has made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you can remove yourself from an unpleasant memory, it can't do 
anything but help," Rader said. "From a physics standpoint, there's not much 
difference between catching a ball in right field and catching a ball in left. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think (the switch) took an awful lot of pressure off him. Since then, 
the application has been there, Chili works on it daily and he's been 
aggressive all the time out there." 
</P>
<P>
On this day, tentativeness belonged to the Yankees. The Angels scored all the 
runs they needed in the fourth inning, a four-run outburst hinged around errors 
on successive plays by Brower. 
</P>
<P>
One run was already in when Angel shortstop Kent Anderson hit a single to 
center, prompting Howell to attempt to score from second base. There would be 
no play at the plate, however, because Brower misplayed the ball, enabling 
Howell to score and Bill Schroeder to advance from first base to third. 
</P>
<P>
The next Angel batter, Washington, also hit a single to center. Brower bobbled 
the ball again, sending both Schroeder and Anderson, all the way from first 
base, homeward-bound. 
</P>
<P>
"Brower looked like he has not played for a while," Yankee Manager Dallas Green 
dryly assessed. 
</P>
<P>
This much is true. Brower hadn't appeared in a game since May 5. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the rest of the Yankees? 
</P>
<P>
"They were not here today," Green suggested. "Some were at Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, meanwhile, continue to cavort in Fantasyland. It may only be May, 
but the Angels are enjoying the ride, hoping that the coupons hold out for the 
rest of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Sunday's game, the Angels announced they were activating 
outfielder Tony Armas from the disabled list and returning pitcher Rich 
Monteleone to their triple-A affiliate in Edmonton. Armas has been sidelined 
since April 10 with a second-degree left hamstring pull. Monteleone, recalled 
from Edmonton on May 1, made two appearances for the Angels, winning one game 
in Baltimore with two innings of scoreless relief. In his last outing, in 
Toronto on May 6, Monteleone pitched to two batters and allowed a hit and a 
walk to prolong a four-run inning for the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schofield, recently returned from the disabled list himself, was out of 
the lineup again, this time with a groin injury he sustained while sliding into 
second base on Saturday. "He probably could've played today," Angel Manager 
Doug Rader said. "Right before batting practice, I said, 'Schoey, what's the 
best thing? Remember, we're still in May." We decided it didn't make a whole 
lot of sense to push it. We're looking at it as the proverbial day-to-day 
thing." . . . Devon White's seventh-inning triple was his sixth three-base hit 
of the season, best in the major leagues. Before 1989, White had totaled eight 
triples in 331 games as a big leaguer. . . . Chili Davis's fifth-inning home 
run was his ninth career hit against Andy Hawkins. Four of them have been home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Angel owner Gene Autry was admitted to the Estelle Doheny Eye Clinic Hospital 
in Los Angels Sunday evening, where he is scheduled to undergo laser surgery 
today to place a new cornea in his right eye. Autry had cornea transplant 
surgery on his right eye in March of 1985, but the eye rejected the cornea 
after 14 months and Autry has since been left with 2,400 vision, which is 
considered legally blind. Autry is expected to be hospitalized for three days.

SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Had doctors performed an electrocardiogram on the Lakers early in the second 
quarter here Sunday, as doctors later did to a dizzy but eventually revived 
assistant coach Bill Bertka, the reading probably would have shown a straight, 
unbroken line. 
</P>
<P>
No signs of life at all. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were experiencing a dangerously feverish performance by the Seattle 
SuperSonics in Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers trailed the SuperSonics by 29 points after 14 minutes. Their hopes 
of attaining a second consecutive playoff series sweep seemed out of the 
question. Merely surviving the afternoon seemed a reasonable goal. 
</P>
<P>
But then, just when the crowd of 14,006 at the Coliseum was sensing the kill, 
the Lakers came to life. What followed was a massive revival unlike any those 
involved could remember, resulting in a 97-95 Laker victory over the 
SuperSonics, who had led, 43-14, at one point in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, by sweeping the best-of-seven series, advance to the conference 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
They did it by outscoring the SuperSonics 22-6 in the final 8:02 of the first 
half, and included in that surge was a 16-0 stretch in the final 5:20 that 
enabled the Lakers to cut Seattle's lead to 11 points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
From that point, the SuperSonics lead and confidence steadily eroded until the 
Lakers put together an 18-6 run in the fourth quarter to take their first lead 
with 6:14 to play. They never relinquished it, aided by a three-point basket 
from James Worthy, a successful baseline jump shot from A.C. Green, a series of 
clutch free throws and an assortment of important defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
Had the Lakers seen anything comparable with Sunday's stark turnaround? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't recall any in my time here," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "We've come 
back before, but not like this. And not in the playoffs. In the playoffs, when 
a team gets you down, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
And this from Magic Johnson, whose smile was as wide as the SuperSonics' 
first-half lead: 
</P>
<P>
"This has got to be the best one. Definitely, the one right here. The prime and 
heart (of the team) came out. We never panicked. We never pointed fingers at 
each other. We just never quit. That's the thing." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, who made 15-of-19 shots, led the Lakers with 33 points. Johnson, held 
in check by Seattle's swarming defense, had 17 points, nine rebounds and nine 
assists. Green had 12 points and 10 rebounds, while Mychal Thompson had 15 
points off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game was filled with moments that will find a place somewhere in Laker 
lore. 
</P>
<P>
There was the double-technical foul assessed to Bertka, the veteran assistant 
coach, after referee Jake O'Donnell ruled that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had stepped 
out of bounds near the Laker bench early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Bertka, who vehemently argued the call, went to one knee and later said he was 
overcome with dizziness. Having been ejected anyway, Bertka was escorted to the 
locker room by Stephen Lombardo, a Laker physician. He was given an EKG, which 
was said to be normal. 
</P>
<P>
Bertka accompanied the team back to Los Angeles Sunday night and will undergo 
more tests today. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, though, he joked with reporters and seemed in good health. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard of managers getting kicked out and coaches ejected to fire up their 
teams, but I've never seen this (fainting) act before," Laker center Mychal 
Thompson said. "He had a head rush. We knew he was OK, but we decided to win it 
for him, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
More common forms of motivation came earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers trailed 47-21 with 8:07 remaining in the second quarter when Riley 
was called for a technical foul for arguing with O'Donnell about a few 
perceived non-calls. 
</P>
<P>
Whether drawing the technical was a strategic move, or merely one made out of 
anger, didn't matter. The Lakers seemingly responded to it. 
</P>
<P>
If it wasn't that, then it was Johnson's impromptu pep talk after Dale Ellis 
sank the technical foul shot for a 48-21 Seattle lead. SuperSonic Coach Bernie 
Bickerstaff called a 20-second timeout, during which Johnson could be overheard 
telling teammates, "Let's just cut it to 15." 
</P>
<P>
That approach worked for the Lakers. Thompson made a short jump shot and, after 
an Ellis air ball, Worthy sank a turnaround jump shot to slice the SuperSonic 
lead to 23 with 7:03 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps fearing a letdown, Bickerstaff called a timeout. Temporarily, at least, 
that quelled the Laker threat. In the next 32 seconds, Seattle outscored the 
Lakers, 5-2 to regain a 54-27 lead on Derrick McKey's two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
That turned out to be the last Seattle points of the half. They went into a dry 
spell in which they commited five turnovers (including a 24-second clock 
violation) and missed shots on five straight possessions. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, conversely, suddenly got hot after making only four of 20 shots in 
a 12-point first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Their 16-0 run, like many memorable comebacks, began with failure. In this 
case, it was a missed shot by Green. But Thompson, who had 15 points off the 
bench, tipped in the miss with 5:20 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty one seconds later, Thompson dunked -- but missed the free throw after 
being fouled -- to make it only a 23-point deficit. The teams then went 1:23 
seconds without scoring, until Byron Scott completed a fast break by making a 
layup that turned out to be Scott's only points of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Bickerstaff, stalking the sidelines, called another timeout with his team 
leading by 21. The SuperSonics responded by commiting a 24-second clock 
violation as the Laker defense denied any open shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers then reeled off six more points -- two free throws by Johnson, a 
19-foot baseline jump shot by Worthy and Green's inside shot off an offensive 
rebound -- before Bickerstaff called his third, and final, timeout of the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, the Lakers trailed 54-39, and Johnson's goal of slashing 
Seattle's lead to 15 points by halftime had been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers were far from finished. Seattle's final three possessions ended 
in two turnovers and a missed three-point attempt, while Worthy sank an 
eight-foot jumper in the lane with 55 seconds to play and then added a drive to 
the basket with four seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
So, what had been a 29-point SuperSonic bulge was trimmed to an unsteady 
11-point lead entering the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, through persistence, finally took control. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty nine points is lot, but 24 minutes (in the second half) is a lot of 
time," Worthy said. "Now, if it had been the fourth quarter, and we were down 
by that much, it'd been a lot more difficult to do." 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "When we cut it to 11 (by halftime), that was the key. That took 
something out of them. They were going good, very good. Everything was going 
their way. But then, late in the second quarter, here we come. 
</P>
<P>
"We just started executing better against their trap and started playing better 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
Riley admitted that the Lakers were not ready to play at the start of Sunday's 
game. He said they appeared "hung over" from having to scramble to win Game 3 
on Friday after leading by 15 points in the fourth quarter of that game. 
</P>
<P>
If the Lakers appeared to be in a daze in the first quarter, Riley tried 
everything to snap them out of it. After Ellis, who had 28 points, sank a 
three-point shot to give Seattle a 29-10 lead with 2:01 to play, Riley angrily 
called a timeout. He slammed down his clipboard and screamed at his team. 
</P>
<P>
"(Riley) was saying stuff you'd never hear on 'Sesame Street,' " Thompson said. 
"Let's just say it was in very fatherly tones. He scolded us." 
</P>
<P>
He also benched most of the starters, going with a lineup that included Tony 
Campbell, Orlando Woolridge, Cooper, Green and Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those players turned out to be contributors once the Lakers finally 
claimed the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge, who had five points and five rebounds, gave the Lakers their first 
lead, 82-81, by sinking two free throws. The Lakers made it a four-point lead 
after two free throws by Johnson and one by Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle did not go quietly after suffering the embarrassment of losing such a 
big lead. Leading 85-83, the Lakers called a timeout with 3:15 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy then delivered his most important basket of the game. Perched in the 
right corner, he sank a three-point shot that gave the Lakers an 88-83 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy had made only two of 23 three-point attempts during the regular season, 
but he said he intend all along to make a three-pointer in that situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew where I was supposed to set up," Worthy said. "I don't shoot it a lot, 
but I can make it. It's just a different shot for me." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy's long-distance basket did not shoot down the SuperSonics, though. After 
Worthy and Nate McMillan traded baskets, Xavier McDaniel sank a three-point 
shot with 1:29 to play to cut the lead to 90-88. McDaniel had a chance to tie 
it 41 seconds later but made only one of two foul shots to draw Seattle to 
within one point. 
</P>
<P>
After a Laker timeout, Green sank a baseline jump shot after Johnson drew in 
the defense by driving through the lane. That made it 92-89, and the Lakers 
held off the SuperSonics thereafter by sinking nearly all their free throw. 
</P>
<P>
"Hearts. That's what it takes to do what we did today," Thompson said. "You 
couldn't have done what we did without a lot of heart and dedication. This just 
shows you can't count us out. Not with Magic Johnson and James Worthy and all 
the other guys on this team. We never think it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are off until at least Saturday. That would be the earliest date the 
Western Conference finals would begin, provided the Phoenix-Golden State 
semifinal series ends either Tuesday or Thursday night. . . . Bill Bertka on 
his fainting spell: "I got up quickly after the call. I was extremely 
frustrated. Then, to get the technical, that really (set him off). Then, the 
second round put me down on one knee." Bertka laughed. "Actually, I felt a 
little dizzy." 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics felt they didn't squander the 29-point lead. Rather, they said 
the Lakers earned it. "They're playing good basketball, and it's going to be 
difficult for anyone to beat them," Dale Ellis said. "They came to play. We 
seemed to be hungry for another title." . . . Byron Scott made just one of nine 
shots and did not play in the final quarter and a half.

TWAY'S LATE CHARGE OVERWHELMS ZOELLER FOR A TWO-SHOT VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Tway birdied three of the last four holes Sunday, beating Fuzzy Zoeller in 
a head-to-head duel to win the Memorial golf tournament at Dublin, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Tway twice hit approaches within a foot in his stretch run, then rolled in a 
25-foot putt on the final hole, finishing with a three-under-par 69. 
</P>
<P>
Tway earned his first victory since the 1986 PGA championship with a four-round 
total of 11-under-par 277. 
</P>
<P>
Zoeller, who led through the first three rounds, simply could not match Tway's 
closing holes and gave him a high-five after Tway's final birdie. 
</P>
<P>
Zoeller, also a non-winner since 1986, matched par with a 72 and was two shots 
back at 279. 
</P>
<P>
When Tway tapped in a putt on the 17th, he took the lead and Zoeller needed to 
gain a stroke on the 18th to force a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
That appeared possible when Tway's drive hit a tree on the 18th, and bounced 
back. But it bounced back in the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a break," Zoeller said. "But that's golf. Good things happen to you 
when you're playing good." 
</P>
<P>
Tway took advantage of it. He hooked his second shot between trees to the green 
then ran in the long putt that won it. 
</P>
<P>
Payne Stewart, who started the day nine shots back, shot a bogey-free 65 and 
was third at 281. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who won the Heritage tournament last month, had a chance to make a run 
at the lead but missed birdie opportunities on two of the last three holes. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Lietzke's last-hole birdie got him into a tie for fourth with Mark 
Calcavecchia at 283. Lietzke had a closing 71, and Calcavecchia had a 70 
despite a double bogey on the 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
Mark O'Meara and Scott Verplank were next at 284. O'Meara had a 69, Verplank a 
70. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Rarick curled in a 20-foot birdie putt on the 16th hole to take control 
and capture the $275,000 Chrysler-Plymouth women's tournament at Lincroft, N.J. 
by two strokes for her first LPGA victory in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Davies of England, who chased Rarick along with Sherri Steinhauer, 
finished second, one shot ahead of defending champion Nancy Lopez and Alice 
Ritzman. 
</P>
<P>
Rarick, who had a share of the lead in all three rounds, had a final-round 
one-under-par 72 and finished the 54-hole event in five-under 214. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into the final round, Rarick was tied with Davies and Steinhauer. Four 
other players, including Lopez, were two shots back. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rarick quickly moved into the lead by making a three-foot birdie putt 
on the first hole. When she made a 20-footer on the sixth hole, she suddenly 
had a three-shot advantage. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't last long, as Rarick, 29, bogeyed the seventh hole by missing a 
three-foot putt and the eighth by missing the green. 
</P>
<P>
Davies, the long-hitting 1987 U.S. Women's Open champion, moved into a share of 
the lead at four-under by making an eight-foot birdie putt on the 10th hole. 
But she quickly dropped back with a three-putt bogey from 20 feet on the 11th 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
Rarick never lost the lead after that. But Davies and Steinhauer, who bogeyed 
the last two holes to finish at one-under, kept the pressure on. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Hill watched as Chi Chi Rodriguez missed a 12-foot par putt, then made a 
four-footer on the third sudden-death hole to win the $400,000 Bell 
Atlantic-St. Christopher's seniors tournament at Malvern, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who won $60,000 for the victory, and Rodriguez finished regulation play 
tied at a four-under-par 206 for the 54-hole tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who earned $35,000, missed a chance to win in regulation when he 
bogeyed No. 18. He finished the final round at three-under-par 67 with six 
birdies and three bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
Hill had two birdies on the front nine in finishing the day with a 68. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden-death playoff was the second this year on the senior tour and Hill 
has been involved in both. The first was a four-way tie won by Bob Charles at 
the Suncoast tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Henning won the $29,000 third prize by finishing a stroke behind the 
leaders with a 68 Sunday, and a three-day total of 207 on the 6,710-yard 
course.

MIKE DOWNEY: ANAHEIM IS WHERE ALL THE STARS MAY NOT COME OUT AT NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In preparing for the baseball All-Star party that they will be throwing come 
July 11 at Rancho Autry, the Angels have but one minor headache, that being: 
Will there be enough Stars left to field nine on a side? 
</P>
<P>
Without Jose Canseco, Dave Winfield, Andre Dawson, George Brett, Kirk Gibson, 
Eric Davis, Teddy Higuera, Jim Gott and assorted others, all of whom are 
hurtin' for certain, we wonder if the Angels will be forced to bill the event 
as the No-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, with Jack Clark, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry, Benito 
Santiago, Alan Trammell, Dale Murphy, Juan Samuel, Gary Carter and your Wally 
World impresario himself, Wally Joyner, all nearer .200 than .300 on the latest 
batting charts, and with Frank Viola, Jack Morris and Fernando Valenzuela armed 
but no longer as dangerous, Anaheim Stadium figures to be filing a 
missing-persons report on All-Star night. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, what the heck, we will simply have to entertain a new bunch of 
rising stars, provided the voters are wise enough to choose performance over 
marquee value. The show must go on, so we will gladly settle for Will Clark 
instead of Jack, Alvin Davis instead of Eric, and -- egad -- Lonnie Smith 
instead of Ozzie? 
</P>
<P>
Tough break for the Angels, losing all of those superstars to injuries this 
year of all years. The public generally likes to see them, no matter how they 
are doing. Even if Gary Carter does happen to be 9 of 79, he probably will get 
his name punched on a whole lot of ballots. Somebody who is a nobody -- say, 
Milt Thompson or Paul O'Neill will probably have to watch the midsummer classic 
on their TVs at home, even if they deserve to be in it. 
</P>
<P>
Already we are looking forward to the All-Star contest, with hope that Kevin 
Mitchell catches one one-handed, that Nolan Ryan whiffs nine in three innings, 
and that Wade Boggs confines his Will Call pass list to family and relatives. 
Boggs, by the way, will be appearing in Anaheim, also known as Margoville, 
beginning Tuesday for a series against the Angels, and we advise him to keep 
his red sox on. 
</P>
<P>
Who is going to represent the old home team in the All-Star game? Interesting 
question. The Angels, naturally, hope to put two or three players on the field 
of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill, of all people, currently stands the best chance, although Bert 
Blyleven, Devon White and Brian Downing are definitely in the running. What a 
story McCaskill is, coming back, as he has, from the Pitch Sematary. We figured 
McCaskill would be lucky this season to make the Angel rotation; instead, he 
looks better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Rader's Angels keep acting as though they intend to stay in the American 
League West race, from April to October. Nice surprise, this. With all the 
muscle the Oakland Athletics still flex, and with the fast starts of the Texas 
Rangers and Kansas City Royals, the Angels looked destined to curl up into the 
middle of the pack and hibernate there. But we appear to have underestimated 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching, for starters -- and we do mean starters -- has really come 
around. We have no intention of getting into that gobbledygook about Bob Boone 
not ordering his pitchers to work the inside corner, but we do know that Lance 
Parrish always has been and always will be an expert handler of pitchers, so 
the Angels remain in good hands. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Abbott will make every attempt at hanging onto the No. 5 starting job that 
he earned, but just in case the rookie does have to go down to the minors to 
refine his pitches -- and we are not at all certain this will be necessary -- 
Dan Petry is making noises as though he is ready to go nine. Petry looked sharp 
against the Yankees last Friday, in what Rader referred to as an "almost 
heroic" effort. In his prime, Petry was an All-Star type of star. 
</P>
<P>
Behind their pitchers, the Angels have a sound defense, anchored by their 
center fielder, White, who has a chance to become a real star. Tony Kubek was 
saying on television the other day that the Angels believe White capable of 
crunching 25-30 home runs a year, on top of the base stealing and Gold gloving 
he gives them. That's a lot to ask, but White does put his whole self behind 
that swing. 
</P>
<P>
Defense in the outfield became a priority for the Angels when Chili Davis for 
some reason started playing the field like Dave Kingman, but we prefer to 
believe that 1988 was a mirage, and that the Chili Man won't repeat that 
19-error season that gave Angel fans heartburn. Chili's too capable a player to 
let that happen again. 
</P>
<P>
The guy for whom we feel sorry, the guy who must be knocking his head against a 
wall while watching infielders such as Glenn Hoffman and Kent Anderson getting 
big-league playing time, is Mark McLemore, the kid who cannot catch a break. 
Worthy of starting for somebody, McLemore has the misfortune of playing the 
same position as Johnny Ray. Ray's a player; he has to play. We might have seen 
the last of McLemore. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, the Angels hope to host two main events at the Big A, one a classic 
of midsummer, one a classic of fall. Dave Henderson is definitely invited to 
one, but please, not to the other.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
KITTLE MAKING THE MOST OF RETURN TO CHICAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are some players who have managed to have lucrative baseball careers 
because of the designated hitter rule in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
They are usually guys who hit with power, but leave something to be desired 
when playing defense. 
</P>
<P>
One example is Ron Kittle, the big, right-handed slugger of the Chicago White 
Sox. When he began in 1982 as an outfielder, he was a very productive hitter. 
In his first three full seasons, he hit 91 home runs and drove in 232 runs. 
</P>
<P>
After being hampered by injuries, Kittle was traded to the Yankees in 1986, but 
was released after a couple of disappointing seasons. He was picked up by 
Cleveland last season, then was granted free agency after batting .258 with 18 
homers. He returned to the White Sox last November as a free agent. Now 31, 
Kittle said he was ready to help the White Sox again. 
</P>
<P>
"If I get enough at-bats, I'll hit 30 home runs," he said. "I know I can do the 
job they need, but I'll have to get more than 500 at-bats." 
</P>
<P>
The way he is going, Kittle is going to get his home runs and his at-bats, and 
with Kittle leading the way, the White Sox are scoring in bunches. 
</P>
<P>
Kittle had four hits for the first time in his career Sunday at Baltimore, 
including his seventh home run, and led the sizzling White Sox to an 8-5 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox had 16 hits, including three homers, for the first time this 
season. It seemed as if every time they hit a home run, it brought them from 
behind. Ivan Calderon, Fred Manrique and Kittle all hit two-run homers to wear 
down the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Although they are still in last place in the American League West, the White 
Sox are on the move. They have won four of their last five games, getting 44 
runs in those five games. 
</P>
<P>
Kittle has led the attack. In the five games he is 10 for 18, has hit two home 
runs, scored six runs and driven in seven. A lifetime .237 hitter, he is 
currently batting .296 and has driven in 25 runs in just 115 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't just me," said Kittle. "Everybody's going up to the plate aggressive, 
but waiting for a good pitch," he said. "You just can't ask for more than that. 
</P>
<P>
"Something is going right and you just have to credit that man there (pointing 
to renowned hitting coach Walt Hriniak). He works with everybody after every 
at-bat, telling them what they did right and what they did wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't always believed in some of these batting instructors, but this 
fellow has done nothing but help me." 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox were trailing, 5-4, with a man on and one out in the seventh when 
Kittle came up to bat against reliever Mark Williamson. The count quickly went 
to 0 and 2, but Kittle hit the next pitch over the fence and the White Sox 
never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt decent at the plate all day," Kittle said. "But I really missed one in 
the eighth. That Williamson hung a curve and I should have hit it out of sight. 
Instead, I popped it up. I'm sure glad it wasn't a key to the game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Chicago Manager Jeff Torborg: "We are really getting confidence in our 
hitting. The way they're hitting, they never feel they're really behind. I like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 13, Toronto 1 -- Kirby Puckett is still on that two-hit kick and 
Frank Viola finds it is easy for a pitcher to learn to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett, who had four doubles Saturday in a 10-8 win at Minneapolis, had two 
more to lead a 16-hit attack and tie a major league record held by 12 players 
with six doubles in two consecutive games. The last player to accomplish the 
feat was Hank Majeski, a third baseman for the old Philadelphia Athletics, in 
1948. 
</P>
<P>
Viola, in winning his second straight after losing his first five decisions, 
went eight innings and tied a career-high with 11 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw 92 pitches today," Viola said. "In my first two starts I had that many 
before the fifth inning." 
</P>
<P>
The stumbling Blue Jays have lost 13 of their last 18. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 8, Detroit 3 -- People keep telling Cleveland first baseman Pete 
O'Brien that, being a left-handed batter, he isn't supposed to be hitting 
left-handed pitchers so well. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien hit a two-run homer off Paul Gibson in the first inning to continue his 
assault on left-handers and hand the Tigers another defeat. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien has hit three of his home runs this season off left-handers, and has 
driven in nine of his 15 runs against them. He is hitting .375 against 
left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
"Against some left-handers, I see the ball sooner and tend to get around on it 
quicker," O'Brien said. "If I don't get too jumpy, I'm all right." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien's hitting is a big reason why the Indians are 11-3 in games 
left-handers start against them. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 2, Oakland 1 -- The Athletics' pitching continues to be brilliant. It 
makes one wonder what might happen when they get all their offensive stars 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore (4-3) went into the ninth at Oakland with a three-hitter, one of the 
hits being Glenn Braggs' seventh home run, but lost when Braggs singled home a 
run to break a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The loss cut Oakland's lead over the Angels and Kansas City in the tight race 
in the West to a game. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 3, Texas 2 -- Kurt Stillwell singled home Willie Wilson from second 
base with nobody out in the 10th inning at Kansas City to end a rainy afternoon 
as the Royals moved within a game of first in the West. 
</P>
<P>
After Bret Saberhagen held the Rangers to five hits in seven innings, Jeff 
Montgomery won it in relief. Montgomery is 5-1 out of the bullpen. Last season, 
pitching strictly in relief, he was 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Cecilio Guante, who walked Willie Wilson to open the 10th, was the loser. 
Wilson stole second to move into scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 4, Boston 3 -- Jim Presley snapped a 3-3 tie in the sixth inning at 
Seattle with a run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth inning, rookie shortstop Omar Vizquel tripled in two runs and came 
home on a sacrifice fly by Harold Reynolds to give the Mariners a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Losing pitcher Mike Boddicker walked the first two Mariners in the sixth, then 
left because of a pulled back muscle. Mike Smithson came in and got the next 
two outs, but then Presley delivered. DAN HAFNER

<P>
Bill Shoemaker, the 57-year-old ramblin' man of racing, is never quite sure 
where he'll be waking up these days. 
</P>
<P>
It could be in snowy Chicago, rainy Portland, or in the seat of a 747 midway 
across the Atlantic, heading for yet another special appearance on his farewell 
tour of racing's far-flung outposts. 
</P>
<P>
Of one thing he is certain, however: If he finds himself on a colt named Peace 
in a grass race at Hollywood Park, he is bound win one more time. 
</P>
<P>
Peace, bred and owned by Tom Gentry of Lexington, Ky., kept his record perfect 
on Hollywood's close-cropped Bermuda with a three-quarter length victory over 
the relentless Steinlen in Sunday's $163,900 John Henry Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Riding like a man half his age -- which still would be older than four of the 
other seven jockeys in the field -- Shoemaker got stakes victory number 1,002 
in winning the first Grade I event of the Hollywood meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"That's 1,002 and on his way to 2,000," announced Chris McCarron as Shoemaker 
admired his own work on the taped replay in the jockeys' room afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about that," Shoemaker said. "But you can tell everybody old 
Shoe's got a few more like that still in him." 
</P>
<P>
Peace gave Shoemaker his 1,000th stakes victory on April 30 when he defeated 
Steinlen in the Premiere Handicap by a length. Last weekend, the 4-foot-11, 
98-pound champion found himself freezing in a freakish spring blizzard at 
Sportsman's Park in Chicago, but that did not stop him from winning number 
1,001 aboard Present Value in the National Jockey Club Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Shoemaker is off to Baltimore to ride at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm supposed to give a 30-minute talk on Friday for a bunch of businessmen on 
'Performing Under Pressure,' but I've got no idea what I'm gonna say." 
</P>
<P>
Well, if he finds himself strapped, Shoe could talk about Sunday's race when 
Peace was getting too fresh for his own good and the pacesetters -- Steinlen 
and longshot Wait Till Monday -- were backing up into his face. 
</P>
<P>
"That could have gotten a little tight," Shoemaker said. "But my colt came back 
to me and we were all right by the time we hit the backstretch." 
</P>
<P>
From that point, all Shoemaker needed was a small ration of his legendary 
patience. Wait Till Monday lasted until the far turn and then caved in, 
retreating to the back of the field. Steinlen was tough, as usual, but 
Shoemaker had him measured. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to move too soon, though, because my colt likes to pull himself 
up sometimes when he makes the lead," Shoemaker said. "Like he did today." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Peace appeared on his way to a big victory when he collared and passed 
Steinlen inside the eighth pole. Then, as Peace geared down, Steinlen rallied 
to make the race closer than it looked. 
</P>
<P>
"My horse ran a winning race," said Gary Stevens after bringing Steinlen back. 
"Everything went perfect, except for the outcome. What I can't figure out is 
why my horse is still carrying so much more weight that Peace. If you ask me, 
he's been getting away with murder." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Lukas, trainer of the 6-year- old Steinlen, agreed with his jockey. 
</P>
<P>
"What's got to happen before they get the weights right on these two horses?" 
he asked. "Look at Peace's record here. When's he going to pick up some 
weight?" 
</P>
<P>
In the Premiere, Steinlen carried 121 pounds to 115 on Peace. In the John 
Henry, it was 121-116. 
</P>
<P>
Peace -- who has a half-brother named War -- is five for five on the Hollywood 
Park turf, dating to April 29, 1988, when he beat a colt named, appropriately, 
Perfecting. 
</P>
<P>
The John Henry marked Peace's third stakes victory over the course and ran his 
lifetime record to six wins in 19 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a skeptical crowd of 26,940 at the track and 8,104 off-track made Peace 
third choice in a three-way betting race. Steinlen was slightly favored over 
Peace's stablemate, Payant. 
</P>
<P>
Peace ran the nine furlongs in 1:46 1/5, a tick off the stakes record set last 
year by Deputy Governor. He paid $8.40, $3.80 and $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
Steinlen returned $3.20 and $2.60, and Pay the Butler, running his best race 
since winning the Japan Cup last November, finished another half-length back in 
third and paid $4.40. Payant was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Peace will be nominated to the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Handicap on May 29, but 
Rodney Rash, trainer Charlie Whittingham's right-hand man, indicated that the 1 
1/4 mile might be a little too ambitious for the colt. The June 18 Inglewood 
Handicap or the July 4 American Handicap, both shorter, are more likely 
encores. 
</P>
<P>
Peace will have to get along without Shoemaker, though. Shoe's moveable feast 
will head for London on May 30 for a six-week stay and a series of last hurrahs 
in England, France and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sam Rubin, the owner of John Henry, made the post-race trophy presentation to 
the Peace people. . . . Chris McCarron won three races Sunday to extend his 
lead in the local standings, 21-16, over Robbie Davis.

UCLA RECRUITS SHINE AS U.S. JUNIORS DEFEAT SOVIETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Judging by the performance of three incoming freshmen Sunday night against the 
Soviet Union's junior national team, the future looks bright for UCLA's 
basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Murray, Zan Mason and Mitchell Butler, a trio of prized recruits landed 
by Bruin Coach Jim Harrick, were the standouts for a group of Southern 
California high school all-stars in a 127-99 victory in front of 1,600 fans in 
UC Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, the state's career and single-season scoring leader at Glendora High 
School, scored 25 points but it was the play of another future Bruin, Mason of 
Westchester, who was most impressive. Mason led all scorers with 28 points and 
added 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Oakwood's Butler added 11 points and had the play of the game when he drove 
through the lane and made a no-look wrap-around pass in the final minutes of 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"Those three kids are going to play a big role in putting UCLA on the national 
map," said Bob Gottlieb, the U.S. coach. "I think UCLA is a quality center away 
from a national title in four years."

NORWAY'S LAURITZEN WINS FIRST TOUR DE TRUMP TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dag Otto Lauritzen of Norway benefited from a crucial mistake by Eric 
Vanderaerden of the Netherlands Sunday during the final stage time trail and 
won the overall title of the inaugural Tour de Trump bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
Lauritzen, who held the lead for a week, finished fourth on the 24-mile 
Atlantic City-Brigantine ocean-front course on the Boardwalk in 52 minutes 19 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderaerden, considered one of the world's finest sprinters and time 
trialists, went off course for an estimated 500 meters and finished 1:44 behind 
Lauritzen. 
</P>
<P>
Near the halfway point of the out-and-back course, Vanderaerden followed a lead 
motorcycle straight instead of turning right. According to race officials, 
motorcycles were not allowed on the course. In previous stages, however, riders 
followed lead vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"I just followed the motorcycle," Vanderaerden said. "I don't know exactly what 
happened. But the moment after it happened, I knew that I couldn't win the 
race. But I think I would have won without going off course." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Kiefel of Boulder, Colo., won the final stage in 51:27, with England's Sean 
Yates second in 52:11. Amateur John Stenner of Greeley, Colo., was third in 
52:14. 
</P>
<P>
The race was not injury free as Greg McNeil of Ojai, Calif., hit a wall two 
miles from the finish and sustained a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
Lauritzen, who began the day with a 28-second lead over Dutchman Henk 
Lubberding and 50 seconds over Vanderaerden, said he believed he would have 
been victorious even if his Dutch rival hadn't ridden off course. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt confident that I would have won," said Lauritzen, a former Norwegian 
policeman and military officer who earned $50,000 for the victory. "I was told 
I had gained 30 seconds after eight miles." 
</P>
<P>
Lauritzen, who didn't win a stage, finished the 10-day race, which began May 5 
at Albany, N.Y., with a cumulative time of 33 hours, 22 minutes, 28 seconds. 
Lubberding finished second overall, 1:54 behind Lauritzen.

L.A. TEACHERS STRIKE AS TALKS WITH DISTRICT FAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON and SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District began their first strike in 
19 years today, as the district's 594,000 students faced a day of upheaval and 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Last-minute maneuvering by district and teacher union leaders failed to avert 
the walkout, even though representatives of both sides were in telephone 
contact into the night Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Picketing is set to begin at schools at 7 a.m. today and a flurry of other 
activity is expected in the streets and courtrooms of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The union estimates that 20,000 of the 32,000 teachers, librarians, nurses and 
counselors in the district will not work. But the district pledges to keep 
schools open and urged parents to send their children to school. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said 
of the informal negotiations Sunday: "We are talking back and forth all the 
time and proposing 'what if, what if.' I think we will keep pushing . . . but 
it may take more time than we've got." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the strike might last only a day or two if talks prove fruitful. 
But he said political divisions on the school board were complicating matters. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school board President Roberta Weintraub told a press conference 
Sunday: "There is nothing dramatically new. The lines on this issue have been 
clearly drawn and the ball is in the union's court." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles school board remained on call but had no plans to meet again in 
formal session until Wednesday, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Julie Korenstein said Sunday that she and board members Warren 
Furutani and Jackie Goldberg favor raising the current offer of a 21.5% raise 
over three years based on assurances by several state legislators that the 
district will probably receive about $34 million in extra state money for the 
fall term. 
</P>
<P>
But those three members could not persuade the board majority during Saturday's 
closed-door board meeting to increase the district offer, Korenstein said. She 
described the session as "very tense, very uncomfortable . . . there were hard 
feelings." 
</P>
<P>
The union said that the unanticipated surplus in state revenue should be used 
for a 10% retroactive raise this year, between 5.5% and 9% in the upcoming year 
and 8% the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Union representatives were planning to picket as early as 2 a.m. at food and 
supply warehouses that service the schools, in hopes that drivers would not 
make deliveries. "We just don't want to miss any opportunity to stop the 
system. Maybe it will take that to get the school board to pay attention," said 
Catherine Carey, a union spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 a.m., the union is expected to sponsor eight large rallies in parks 
throughout the Los Angeles area. The union also prepared strike headquarters, 
mainly at other unions' offices, for each of the administrative regions within 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
District officials conceded that they cannot staff every classroom in a strike. 
About 500 new substitute teachers have been hired and 500 administrators with 
teaching credentials will be assigned to classrooms, in addition to the regular 
substitute teachers willing to cross picket lines, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Yamahara, district associate superintendent for personnel, said Sunday 
that substitutes fearful of driving their cars to their assignments can show up 
at regional offices and be transported in district buses to the schools. To 
prevent vandalism, their cars will be left in fenced and guarded parking lots, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers plan to picket at those assignment spots, in hopes that the bus 
drivers will not transport the substitutes. However, the drivers may be 
independent contractors, without union allegiance, said union sources. 
</P>
<P>
Associate Supt. Gabriel Cortina said principals will have the toughest jobs 
today. "They're going to have to make some very quick judgments in the morning 
and work with whatever staff they have . . . to sort kids out properly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Kids on Other Side' 
</P>
<P>
"We are calling out for parents and volunteers to come to school and remember 
that it is the kids on the other side of the picket line," Cortina said. "If 
they cross the line . . . they're helping the kids. I hope people can find it 
in their consciences that they will be helping the kids and not take sides with 
the district or the union." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Roth, one of the attorneys representing the union, said he would go to the 
state Court of Appeal today to seek an emergency injunction suspending district 
Supt. Leonard Britton's order that teachers must hand in grades by today or 
face withholding of pay for the month ended last Friday. In February, a 
Superior Court judge ruled on a similar order that the matter should be 
reviewed by the state Public Employment Relations Board, not the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the union would do if it won such an injunction, union President 
Johnson said that would depend on whether there were progress in the 
negotiations. "We'd have to do some quick rethinking. We might conceivably call 
off the strike and go back to the original strike date of the 30th." The union 
moved up the strike by two weeks in response to Britton's grade order. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, speaking for the board majority, praised the district's current 
offer, calling it "the best in the nation" among the country's largest school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Cuts Promised 
</P>
<P>
The board has agreed to make about $120 million in budget cuts over the next 
two years but, Weintraub said, a board majority is unwilling to make deeper 
budget cuts for salaries. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said that teachers by the end of a one-week strike will lose 
about 2.5% of their annual pay, the same percentage that separates the 
district's offer from the union's demand. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, who urged parents to send their children to school today, 
acknowledged that there will be some confusion at many schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be difficult," Weintraub said. "Schools will range from no teachers 
out to all teachers out; student attendance will definitely and decidedly be 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Bernstein, a teachers union vice president, said her members were being 
reminded of last-minute details and duties for a strike through a telephone 
network on Sunday. Teachers were being assigned picketing duties at various 
sites around the school district at different times of the day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're telling everybody it's a go," said John Fernandez, the union chairman at 
Roosevelt High School. 
</P>
<P>
District spokeswoman Diana Munatones said school police officers have been 
asked to work 12-hour shifts to avert trouble on the 600 campuses of the 
nation's second-largest school district, which struggled through a strike of 
nearly three weeks in 1970. In addition, the district may hire off-duty 
officers from other local jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect any problems maintaining security, but you never know how 
things can flare up," Munatones said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Los Angeles Police Department and county Sheriff's Department 
said they had no plans for extra security measures in preparation for the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lt. Frank Valdez, watch commander in the Police Department's 
gang-plagued 77th Division, said he was concerned about security both on and 
off campus during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem kids . . . are not going to go to school and it's going to create 
problems all over, not just on campus," Valdez said. "What I'm mainly concerned 
about is basically the safety of the other people with all these little 
predators out on the street." 
</P>
<P>
About 20 parents and children demonstrated outside the union headquarters on 
West 3rd Street Sunday afternoon. Chanting "UTLA, NO WAY" and carrying signs 
with slogans such as "Holding Our Students' Grades Is Criminal," they placed 
most of the blame for the current impasse on the union and said they feared 
that the withholding of students' grades by teachers could harm the students, 
especially those heading off to college. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was Annie Richardson, who ran unsuccessfully two years ago for the 
district's South-Central area seat held by Rita Walters. "UTLA is about the 
business of taking control of the district," she said, referring to the union's 
election push for friendly candidates on the board and its desire for teachers 
to have a majority voice on proposed school governing councils. 
</P>
<P>
By striking before a state fact-finder's report is issued, and thus possibly 
breaking the law, teachers are setting "a poor example for telling our children 
to obey rules," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The fact-finder's report is expected to be issued on Wednesday and labor law 
experts said the district could ask that the union be fined, and its leaders 
possibly jailed, for striking before receiving the report. The union, however, 
says that Britton's order about the grades was itself an unfair labor practice 
and a provocation to strike. 
</P>
<P>
No one from the union was at the rally to talk to the parents. Union 
spokeswoman Carey said in a telephone interview that the parents should have 
demonstrated in front of the district's offices instead. "Those parents are 
blaming the wrong people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion remains on the issue of health insurance coverage for striking 
teachers. The union says federal law requires district coverage to continue for 
60 days, but the district disputes that. Contrary to comments by union 
President Johnson on Saturday, the district still insists that teachers send in 
checks for their own premium by today. However, the district has told health 
care providers not to refuse to treat any teacher, although the providers may 
ask teachers to sign a waiver agreeing to possibly pay for the services later.

4 infant centers 
</P>
<P>
The district has 32,000 employees, of whom 22,000 belong to United Teachers-Los 
Angeles. About 17,000 union members voted in favor of a strike. The district 
has 2,800 credentialed substitute teachers and 1,900 administrators with 
teaching credentials. 
</P>
<P>
THE TEACHERS' BARGAINING UNIT: FACTS AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
The bargaining unit covered by the teachers' union contract is made up of union 
and non-union employees. There is not a closed shop, so not all members of the 
bargaining unit belong to the union: 
</P>
<P>
27,000 classroom teachers 
</P>
<P>
2,800 substitute teachers 
</P>
<P>
500 children's center teachers 
</P>
<P>
525 secondary counselors (junior and senior high school) 
</P>
<P>
186 school attendance and adjustment services counselors 
</P>
<P>
450 nurses 
</P>
<P>
373 school psychologists 
</P>
<P>
123 librarians 
</P>
<P>
THE ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
The teachers' union is asking for a 21% pay increase over two years; the 
district is offering 21.5% over three years. The union's salary demand for next 
year exceeds the district's offer by an average of about $900 per teacher -- or 
about $4 per workday. The average annual salary for district teachers is 
$36,000. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides also disagree on non-monetary issues such as a preparation period 
for elementary teachers and how to expand teachers' authority to make school 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
PLANS DURING STRIKE 
</P>
<P>
The district has said it will keep all schools open with the help of 
substitutes and administrators, and will continue to operate after-school 
programs such as sporting events and day care. The district says coaches, drama 
and music teachers and others may direct students and sports teams in the 
afternoons and evenings, even if they participate on the picket lines during 
the day. But the union has asked teachers and coaches not to participate in any 
school activities. The district said no important end-of-the-year events would 
be canceled. Parents would act as prom chaperones, and administrators and 
substitute teachers would lead graduation ceremonies. But without final grades 
submitted by teachers, the awarding of diplomas might be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
TELEPHONE HOT LINES 
</P>
<P>
The district is operating telephone hot lines between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday 
through Friday: 
</P>
<P>
General strike information: 213-625-KIDS 
</P>
<P>
High school information: 213-345-GRAD 
</P>
<P>
Adult education information: 213-62-LEARN 
</P>
<P>
It also has a 24-hour recorded telephone hot line updated daily: 
</P>
<P>
English: 213-625-4000 
</P>
<P>
Spanish: 213-625-4643 
</P>
<P>
The union has a hot line for teachers only, which is not made public.

BUSH TO ASK $1 BILLION FOR NEW PRISONS, NO ASSAULT RIFLE BAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As part of a sweeping anti-crime package to be unveiled today, President Bush 
will seek $1 billion in funding for prison construction to house 26,000 new 
federal prisoners over the next four years but has decided to postpone any new 
attempt to outlaw assault rifles, Administration officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A senior White House aide told reporters traveling in Kentucky with the 
President that the Administration would advocate a "hard look" as to whether 
additional steps might be needed to restrict domestic production of the 
weapons. Other officials said that in the meantime the Administration will rely 
on an existing law that bars entry only to foreign-made weapons not suitable 
for sporting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of an assault rifle ban from the package represents a decision by 
the White House to emphasize traditional programs aimed at reducing crime 
rather than more controversial forays into gun control. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu had played a central 
role in blocking efforts to address assault guns directly, which had initially 
been advocated by national drug policy director William J. Bennett and other 
Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
The decision also represents a victory by the National Rifle Assn., which had 
lobbied ferociously in an effort to block any new assault gun legislation. In 
the face of that effort, a number of members of Congress had warned the White 
House that they would have difficulty supporting any initiative opposed by the 
powerful organization. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you could say that politics won out," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
In settling on the final terms of the crime package, White House officials also 
decided not to declare a national "crime emergency," as had been seriously 
considered. "The crime figures just didn't support that kind of declaration," 
one Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Prosecutors, Agents 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic boost in prison space sought by the Administration is the central 
element in a proposal that also calls for 1,600 additional federal prosecutors, 
800 more law enforcement agents and a widening of the federal death penalty to 
include hard-core repeat offenders convicted of using firearms to commit 
murder. The 800 new personnel include 300 FBI agents and 150 U.S. marshals. 
</P>
<P>
The package would also toughen the penalties for a number of firearms-related 
crimes, including crimes committed while using an assault weapon. All are part 
of an effort to deter criminals by making more certain that they would face 
stringent penalties if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Officials put the overall cost of the package at $1.7 billion but said the 
initiative would require no new funds to be allocated by Congress. "This is 
just money being moved around," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the proposal is to be funded through sales of federal properties 
and the use of funds generated by the sale of assets seized from criminals, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
As an additional cost-saving measure, they said the Administration would seek 
to convert some recently shut military bases into the new penitentiaries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Called Cheap 
</P>
<P>
Only with such innovative measures, one official indicated, could the White 
House hope to create 26,000 jail spaces for $1 billion. Under a generally 
accepted formula for the cost of prison construction, the price tag would be 
about double that amount. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to emphasizing prison construction and other crime deterrence 
measures, Bush will address the assault gun issue indirectly by calling for 
restrictions on the size of ammunition magazines that can be sold, one official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Assault rifles are known in part for their large magazines, some of which can 
hold up to 30 cartridges, which help to give them a paramilitary appearance. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, officials said, Bush plans to advocate mandatory minimum sentences 
for criminals who use guns and a five-year ban on sales of weapons to anyone 
convicted of a crime punishable by six months or more of incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Bush also plans to declare that the current temporary import ban 
on more than 30 types of assault weapons -- imposed March 14 at the urging of 
Bennett -- will be made permanent after the Treasury Department's Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms completes an investigation into how the weapons 
are generally used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1968 Law on Importation 
</P>
<P>
But they said Bush would favor an import ban only on the weapons that the 
agency determines are not generally used for hunting, target shooting and other 
sporting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Such action is required under a 1968 law, which authorizes the importation into 
the United States only of weapons "generally recognized as suitable for 
sporting purposes." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see what definitions these weapons fall under," Andrew H. Card Jr., 
deputy White House chief of staff, told reporters in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials provided few specific details about the package Sunday, 
their identification of seized criminal assets as a major source of prison 
funding raised questions about how other agencies that now rely on the funds 
would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $220 million in funds generated last year from assets seized from 
criminals -- most of them drug dealers -- $110 million was returned to state 
and local agencies as a reward for their law enforcement role. Another $90 
million went to federal efforts by the FBI, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, U.S. attorneys and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next year, about $115 million of the fund will be directly controlled 
by Bennett's office, which has already agreed to divert it to prison 
construction. But other agencies might have to look elsewhere for funding if 
prison construction is given top priority.

ISRAELI CABINET OKS PLAN FOR VOTE IN OCCUPIED AREAS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Israel's Cabinet on Sunday overwhelmingly approved Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir's proposal for Palestinian elections, but the blueprint stopped short of 
clearing up several issues of concern to the Bush Administration, which has 
been pushing for details of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-point plan calls for an unspecified period of "calming" before the 
"free, democratic and secret" vote can take place -- an indirect demand that 
the 17-month old Arab uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip must 
end in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"Violence and elections cannot go hand in hand," advised Yosef Ben-Aharon, a 
top aide of the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The program specifically excludes the Palestine Liberation Organization from 
any role in future peace talks. Jordan and Egypt, on the other hand, are 
invited to join in. 
</P>
<P>
To be eligible to run in the election, all Palestinian candidates must endorse 
Israel's proposal for a five-year period of "autonomy" in the West Bank and 
Gaza, under Israeli rule. The period is meant as a "test for coexistence and 
cooperation," according to the document. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of the vote would work out details of the autonomy scheme with Israel 
and would also be involved in talks on a final settlement, to begin by the 
third year of the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Insistence that the Arabs accept limited self-rule prior to elections appears 
to rule out any candidacies even sympathetic to the PLO. During several months 
of whirlwind diplomatic efforts abroad, PLO chief Yasser Arafat has been 
pressing for immediate recognition of an independent state on the occupied 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Under the conditions spelled out Sunday, no one could run on an independence 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear who would participate without approval of the PLO, which has a 
staunch following among the 1.7 million residents in the occupied lands. The 
PLO views the election plan as a way for Israel to end the Arab uprising 
without having to suspend its military occupation of the territories. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.S. consul in Jerusalem, Phillip Wilcox, six top pro-PLO 
leaders from the West Bank and Gaza rejected the plan as it stands. The program 
is "grossly deficient inasmuch as they (elections) are not part of a political 
process that leads directly to the establishment of an independent Palestinian 
state," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir aide Ben-Aharon countered: "If the PLO is against the vote, it only 
means it worries that a free election would undermine its claim to represent 
all the Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Administration Position 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has been trying to reconcile the PLO's quest for a 
state and Israel's autonomy plan by urging Israel to promise eventual 
withdrawal from at least some of the land. A recent letter from Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III reminded the Israeli government of Washington's 
commitment to the land-for-peace formula. 
</P>
<P>
The plan unveiled Sunday makes no mention of surrendering territory. The 
proposal also skirts issues of whether the 140,000 Arab residents of Jerusalem, 
which Israel annexed in 1967, can vote and whether international supervision 
over the election will be permitted. In his letter, Baker had asked for both 
issues to be clarified. Both issues are considered politically inflammatory in 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Ben-Aharon said such details would be worked out. "The Cabinet approved the 
plan in principle. Modalities will come later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was formally presented to a visiting delegation from the U.S. State 
Department, headed by Dennis Ross, director of policy planning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reports on Soviet Visit 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Ross reported to the Israelis on the just-concluded trip by Secretary 
of State Baker to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the election plans, Shamir's proposal includes what is termed a "wider 
package" that calls for normal relations with hostile Arab countries, 
especially Jordan, aid for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and Gaza, and 
the reaffirmation of the Camp David accords that led to the peace treaty 
between Egypt and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The plan's autonomy scheme is based squarely on the Camp David accords. 
</P>
<P>
After a seven-hour debate, the Cabinet approved the plan by a vote of 20 to 6. 
The six who voted against it included three hawks from Shamir's own Likud Party 
and another hard-liner from the National Religious Party, all of whom thought 
the election would open the way to a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
"This dangerous plan could bring more terrorism and even war," warned Industry 
Minister Ariel Sharon, best known for leading Israel into the 1982 Lebanon war. 
</P>
<P>
"The government is about to bring a terrible tragedy on itself."

BRADLEY'S TOUGH TIMES AMID CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
MAYOR GETS FEW CHANCES TO ENJOY PLACE IN HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the autumn of his life, when he might have been adding the last flourishes 
to his monumental history, Tom Bradley finds his solace in the shouted words of 
a sunburned beach girl, revving her car's spitting engine amid the blare of 
traffic in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, mayor!" she shouted raucously, raising a defiant fist toward a street 
corner where Bradley stood one day last week. "Hang in there!" 
</P>
<P>
Her words sliced through the electronically amplified comments of Los Angeles 
City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who was discussing the area's traffic woes in 
a circle of officialdom that included the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
As fast as the advice reached Bradley's ears, the stoic veil that ever guards 
his massive, impassive face lifted. His eyes brightened, his arm reached toward 
the street in a schoolboy's shy wave, and he giggled. 
</P>
<P>
There have been precious few moments of undiluted joy for Tom Bradley this 
somber season. Four weeks after the day he etched yet another first -- winning 
an unprecedented fifth term as Los Angeles' mayor -- Tom Bradley is captured in 
his worst political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Packs of reporters, ignoring the mayor's regal countenance and rigid silence, 
chase him down hallways. Ceremonial park openings and community gatherings are 
interrupted with questions about his finances. Back at City Hall, lawyers 
ferret out the affairs of a man renowned for guarding his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's friends and allies have wrapped the mantle of business-as-usual 
around the mayor, and Bradley has partly complied. But there are moments when 
it slips, and a wave of sadness seems to cloak Tom Bradley, and suddenly he 
seems every one of his 71 years. 
</P>
<P>
Days ago, at a gathering to commemorate the move of an historic mansion from 
land to be cleared for the expansion of the city's convention center, Bradley 
meandered toward a wind-ruffled table holding pastries and a transparent 
lemonade cooler. Behind him, swept clean of smog and its discordant clatter 
muffled by distance, spread the angular profile of the downtown Tom Bradley 
helped create. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's responsible for this coffee?" the preoccupied mayor asked. Then he 
shrugged. "It's not coffee," he said to no one in particular. "It's lemonade." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'His Place in History' 
</P>
<P>
Said one city councilman, reflecting on the private cost of public controversy: 
</P>
<P>
"All he's looking for is his place in history. Tom Bradley is history in this 
town . . . he's got to be dying." 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, Bradley is overseeing a very public sullying of the image of 
the city's first elected black councilman and its first and only black mayor. 
Once the personification of stalwart integrity, the conciliator who forged a 
political and racial coalition that has lasted almost a generation, he is now a 
man confessing to errors in judgment and the subject of myriad investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the furor, Bradley has maintained his typical schedule, two or three 
events a day outside his downtown office, in the far reaches as well as the 
near neighborhoods of the city he has led since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Last week on his public journeys, Bradley's moods reflected a catalogue of 
emotions. When reporters and the bright lights of television cameras pressed 
in, he tensed and grew aloof, expecting trouble. When bystanders clasped his 
hand or shouted greetings, he loosened his guard and hobnobbed happily, relief 
washing over his features. And often, at odd moments in the public appearances 
that mark the daily routine of political life, Bradley seemed lost in thought, 
dispirited. 
</P>
<P>
But few were the times when Bradley's troubles were specifically broached, in 
part because his gatherings tend to attract the faithful. His hosts never 
mentioned allegations that he interceded with city officials on behalf of local 
firms that paid him for his advice. Bradley, for his part, certainly never 
brought it up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unmentioned by Friends 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some friends have recoiled from its mention even in private. Jim Wood, 
the city's Community Redevelopment Agency chairman, a Bradley supporter through 
campaigns that won and lost, said he has yet to raise the subject with the 
mayor. "From my point of view," he said, "there are plenty of people discussing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's only public concession to crisis comes in the hint of defensiveness 
when he speaks about the length of his public service -- 47 years as a police 
officer, councilman and mayor. The mayor raises it repeatedly, uttering it in 
the plaintive hope that lengthy perspective will outweigh current furor. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's tonic is his full schedule. On Friday night, after a full day of 
meetings at City Hall, Bradley donned a tuxedo and presided over the 11th 
annual Mayor's Asian-Pacific American Heritage Awards dinner, held in the 
bitter chill of the Pacific Design Center's patio. 
</P>
<P>
After a day in which a council committee presented evidence contradicting his 
contention that he had not known the city dealt with a bank that paid him 
$18,000 last year, Bradley was more convivial than he had been all week. 
</P>
<P>
He shook hands and issued sharp waves like a veteran campaigner in the thick of 
a tightening race. He embraced Hollywood actors and straight-laced businessmen. 
At one point, he swiped two white chairs from a dinner table and sat, alongside 
a beaming little girl in a gray pinafore, for a formal portrait. 
</P>
<P>
As the evening progressed, he grew downright talkative, a trait unusual for the 
taciturn man. In his keynote speech, Bradley urged the audience to "just kind 
of hunch over and tighten up" to warm themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Then he targeted Mike Roos, the area's state assemblyman, with 
uncharacteristically risque patter. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Roos, great weatherman," Bradley said. "Told his wife, when she asked, 
'Should I wear a coat?' -- he said, 'Oh no, balmy Los Angeles, West Hollywood 
weather.' 
</P>
<P>
"And he's going to get it when he gets home. Or maybe he won't get it when he 
gets home." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd gasped. Some laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after watching a silent movie praising French Hospital, the Chinatown 
institution now threatened with closure because of financial losses, the mayor 
delivered his summation of the movie plot in bombastic tones usually reserved 
for revival meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is," Bradley hollered, his voice booming across the patio, 
"Hell with the deficit! Ten million is nothing! Save the patient! 
</P>
<P>
"Heal!" he demanded. "Heal!" 
</P>
<P>
Then he dropped to his politician's baritone. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, less than 10 hours after he had left the dinner, Bradley held 
a broom in his hands and lectured 20 school children about the virtues of 
community service. The youngsters -- members of a city-funded environmental 
cleanup program -- listened raptly. Bradley was upbeat and inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
"You not only have cleaned up many of the neighborhoods, alleys, vacant lots, 
cleaned off graffiti, but you've helped build a sense of pride in your own 
community and I think that's very important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to give you all the help you need to stay out of trouble, stay out 
of gangs," he added. 
</P>
<P>
As he greeted the schoolchildren, a couple dressed in painting clothes 
approached the mayor. "Oh!" Marion Ingalsbe said, thrilled. "It's nice to see 
you!" The mayor beamed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Politics' 
</P>
<P>
Neither Ingalsbe nor her husband, Frank, longtime Bradley supporters, worry 
much about the mayor's troubles. "So far as I'm concerned, it's politics," 
shrugged Frank Ingalsbe. "About the same thing is happening in Washington. 
Everyone is trying to find something on everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Days earlier in West Los Angeles, where he spoke about traffic with Galanter 
and other elected officials, Bradley appeared similarly moved when a small 
group of passers-by forwarded slips of paper for him to autograph. As he headed 
toward his car, two aides in tow, a woman shouted from the passenger window of 
her truck. 
</P>
<P>
"You got nothing but my support!" she told Bradley. The mayor's step quickened 
to a bounce. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bradley said in an interview with The Times last week that he finds 
comfort in the waves and grins and salutes he has seen across the city. 
</P>
<P>
"The reaction which I get from people is heartwarming," he said. " . . . 
They'll call, they'll write me, and they say we've known you for 16 years, we 
don't believe that you would do any of these things deliberately, and we want 
you to know we're with you. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a reflection of the kind of respect that has been built up 
between me and the people of the city over that 16-year period of time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's actually 47 years," he added pointedly, "if you go back to my career 
prior to mayor." 
</P>
<P>
But there remains the daily drumbeat of bad news and continuing allegations, 
and the probability that investigations will stream out for months. Bradley 
remains, very likely for months to come, essentially a man under siege. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Appearance 
</P>
<P>
Under the full, late spring leaves of the trees guarding City Hall's southern 
flank, he stood the other day to endorse an abortion rights group's latest 
tactic. Looking drawn and preoccupied, he spoke for a minute or two. 
</P>
<P>
Then as another speaker reached the microphone, Bradley bolted toward the 
nearby doors of the City Hall in which he has served for 26 years, the doors 
over which is carved the saying of Cicero: "He that violates his oath profanes 
the divinity of faith itself." 
</P>
<P>

PANAMA'S CATHOLIC BISHOPS CALL ON NORIEGA TO RESIGN 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of Panamanians chanted, applauded, sang and wept Sunday in support of 
the Roman Catholic Church's emergence as a leader in the struggle to force Gen. 
Manuel A. Noriega from power. 
</P>
<P>
In Masses throughout the country, priests and ordinary church-goers read a 
pastoral letter signed by all 10 of Panama's bishops attacking Noriega for 
trying to steal last week's presidential election -- first through massive 
fraud, then by nullifying the vote -- and for violently assaulting his 
political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In wealthy churches with organs and choirs and in modest chapels where a single 
guitarist accompanied hymns, the clergy condemned Noriega for "violating the 
popular will" by refusing to accept the apparent overwhelming election victory 
of the Democratic Alliance for Civic Opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"What moral justification can be made for firing bullets and beating men and 
women whose only crime was to peacefully demand their rights?" the bishops' 
letter asked. "What moral justification can be made for terrifying the hungry 
masses with a hateful and false nationalism that neither respects nor 
recognizes the rights and safety of the rest of the Panamanians?" 
</P>
<P>
In demanding that Noriega turn over power to the opposition "in recognition of 
the will of the people" as expressed in the elections, the bishops said that 
"not to do so would be a sin of conscience." 
</P>
<P>
The pastoral letter was especially critical of the Noriega regime for ordering 
paramilitary and security forces to attack opposition leaders last Wednesday, 
when Democratic Alliance leaders Guillermo Endara, Ricardo Arias Calderon and 
Guillermo (Billy) Ford were beaten so badly they had to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The strongly worded condemnation of the military regime marked a turning point 
for the church in Panama, a country that is 94% Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, the church was largely noted for its caution and reluctance to 
criticize Noriega, let alone call for his removal from power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Priests Are Foreigners 
</P>
<P>
Apart from a historical conservatism, reasons for the low profile include the 
makeup of the clergy. About 75% of the country's estimated 330 priests are 
foreigners. Required to renew their visas every two months, "priests feel 
pressure and constant threat," according to Father Fernando Guardia, a leader 
of the anti-Noriega clergy. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, as official corruption and Noriega's abuse of power, including a 
growing intimidation of the clergy, increased, the church began speaking and 
acting against the military regime. 
</P>
<P>
Priests spoke out against the government's failure to investigate crimes 
allegedly committed by military officers and other government officials, and 
then last month the church announced that because of concern over the honesty 
of the presidential election, it planned to conduct its own independent count 
of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was that count that helped convince diplomats and international 
observers that Noriega's candidate had been swamped in the election and that 
his government's claim of victory was a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
But with the emergence of the church as a power against the regime, some 
priests are worried that the political leaders are not keeping up with the 
dissatisfaction of the people nor applying enough pressure to force Noriega 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"The opposition has opted for a political solution," said one important priest, 
"but what kind of solution can you get from a dictator?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Nerve 
</P>
<P>
The comment mirrors assessments from many diplomats and observers that the 
opposition and its followers have never shown the stomach or nerve to overturn 
someone as determined to keep power as Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as Noriega made a threat of force, whether he used it or not, the 
opposition generally folded," said one diplomat. "No one expects them to get 
killed, but waving handkerchiefs, milling around and then going home as soon as 
troops show up won't get them power." 
</P>
<P>
Even with the singing, the chants and the cheers, Sunday's show of support for 
the Democratic Alliance never really got out of the pews and into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
With Endara, the opposition presidential candidate, still under medical 
treatment, Ford and Arias Calderon, who were the opposition's vice presidential 
candidates, attended several Masses separately but then got together at the 
Church of Christ the King to hear Msgr. Javier Villanueva read the pastoral 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
The thousand or more people who filled the church to overflowing applauded 
constantly, chanted "Justice! Justice!" and waved the white handkerchiefs that 
have become the symbol of the opposition, then sang "The Battle Hymn of the 
Republic" in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
After the noon Mass, Ford said the reading of the pastoral letter "gives me 
faith that things will get better."

Lawmakers from the Baltic republics pledged to press their demand for a greater 
say over their own affairs at this month's inaugural session of the new Soviet 
Parliament. At a meeting organized by progressive mass movements from all three 
republics -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- deputies agreed on radical 
resolutions to put to the Congress of People's Deputies when it meets in Moscow 
beginning May 25. The meeting was held in Tallinn, the Estonian capital. Marju 
Lauristin, a leading Estonian deputy, said 100 or so progressive Baltic 
deputies hope to win support for some issues from several hundred members of 
the 2,250-seat congress. The informal "Baltic bloc" is among several loose 
factions being formed.

PARENTS PLAN VARIED ROLES IN STRIKE; 
</P>
<P>
SOME TAKING SIDES, PITCHING IN OR TRYING TO PLAY WATCHDOG IN CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Westchester parent Sherry Otsap says she'll be walking the picket line with her 
son's teachers today. Barbara Bronson Gray, a Van Nuys parent, says she's going 
to teach. Pam Bruns of Pacific Palisades says she's going to watch. 
</P>
<P>
As strike conditions take hold in schools all across the Los Angeles Unified 
School District today, parents will be taking sides, pitching in or trying to 
play the watchdog in a conflict that threatens to turn many schools, bereft of 
regular teachers, upside down. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what side they're on, most say they're worried about whether the 
schools will be safe, whether their children will be properly supervised, 
whether they will get any meaningful education -- or whether school will just 
turn into a big baby-sitting operation. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 parents and children held a rally Sunday outside United Teachers-Los 
Angeles headquarters near downtown to protest the planned walkout. 
</P>
<P>
Even district officials admit that it's going to be tough out there. About half 
of the district's 32,000 teachers voted to go on strike, and the district 
estimates that it will have about 1,000 substitutes and administrators 
available to cover classes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monitoring Project 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that we're going to see conditions that will satisfy our parental 
anxieties," said Bruns, who is the co-founder of a Palisades parent-teacher 
group that is sending observation teams onto several campuses today. "But we 
just don't know what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Bruns spent Mother's Day in feverish preparation for today. Early Sunday 
morning, about 20 Palisades parents gathered at her home to make final plans 
for an ambitious monitoring project that will cover the coastal community's 
seven public schools, which together enroll about 6,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Teams of two to four parents armed with checklists and badges identifying them 
as "Parent Observers" will visit each school at three times during the day, 
Bruns said. They will look to see whether students are receiving instruction, 
whether they are in their regular classrooms or herded together in gyms or 
auditoriums, what kind of personnel -- regular teachers, substitutes or 
volunteers -- is manning the school, and whether safe conditions prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Bruns said that although the parent observers all have strong opinions on both 
sides of the teacher dispute, they have agreed to keep their views in check as 
they visit schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We will only be there to observe. We are not going to teach or supervise. Our 
main concern is the safety of students during this tension-ridden strike 
period, and we hope teachers on the picket line will understand our mission and 
not be obstructive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Gray, the Van Nuys parent, said she plans to be anything but 
neutral. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm frustrated with teachers," said Gray, whose child attends kindergarten at 
Kester Avenue School. "A lot of parents out there will be happy to cross the 
picket line and do whatever they can." 
</P>
<P>
Gray said her principal expects that most of the school's 28 teachers will 
honor the strike. About 20 parents plan to show up today to help operate the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
One mother who is an artist plans to set up an "art station" that groups of 
students will rotate through, every hour or so. Other parents will tell stories 
in the library and supervise the lunch hour. One parent who works in alcohol 
rehabilitation will give a lesson about alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who is a nurse, said she plans to bring her stethoscope to class and give 
a lesson about cardiac physiology. 
</P>
<P>
"So there will be some enrichment going on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Far Too Dangerous' 
</P>
<P>
Otsap, the Westchester parent who plans to walk the picket line, said she 
believes the teachers have legitimate gripes. But she will not let her son, who 
is in the eighth grade at Palms Junior High School's gifted magnet program, 
attend his classes during the strike. She's heard rumors of a gang fight today 
and is afraid that the school will be unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
"How in the world can we possibly put our kids in school when in the best of 
times there is violence?" she said. "Now they're going to be berserk. I don't 
dare put my child in school. It's far too dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Another Westside parent said she, too, is keeping her child at home during the 
strike. But, unlike Otsap, she said she feels no sympathy for the teachers and 
plans to cross the picket line. 
</P>
<P>
"I promised I'd volunteer," she said. "But I might get cold feet. If we go up 
to the picket line, is it going to be like the Continental (Airlines) 
machinists? Are they going to leap up and drag us to the ground? I think a lot 
of parents are going to take their children to see what it's like, but if they 
see their child's teacher on the picket line and she snarls at them, they'll go 
home."

2 BOYS HELD IN BB SHOOTING OF HIKER, 79 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two boys attacked an elderly hiker with air rifles, for no apparent reason, 
near Griffith Park on Sunday afternoon, wounding him several times in the face, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were making a joke out of it," Stephen Felszeghy, 79, of Hollywood said 
Sunday evening after being treated at a hospital and released. "They enjoyed 
shooting at me from the back." 
</P>
<P>
Felszeghy, a retired architect, said he turned and shouted: "This is not a 
joke. Don't do this." 
</P>
<P>
The boys offered him a Band-Aid and put it on his face after they shot him, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I continued my hike, but one wound started to give me pain," he said. "I saw 
something protruding beneath the Band-Aid and knew this was something more 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
Felszeghy had been hiking a trail north of Bronson Avenue on Canyon Drive, near 
the southern approaches to the park, when he was assaulted about 2:30 p.m., 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"I drove to the Hollywood station to ask for first aid," Felszeghy said. "The 
police took it much more seriously and said we should look for the boys." 
</P>
<P>
He accompanied officers back to the trail, where he spotted the boys. A 
15-year-old and an 11-year-old had fired the BBs at him, he said. Another 
11-year-old was with them but did not take part in the attack, Felszeghy said. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew this gentleman was bleeding, terrified," Officer J. Leuck said. "One 
admitted the attack. The two who were responsible thought it was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
The boys were walking down the sidewalk carrying two air rifles -- one with a 
missing stock -- and an air pistol, Leuck said. 
</P>
<P>
"They had plenty of ammo," she added. "One was also carrying the blade to a 
straight razor." 
</P>
<P>
Felszeghy said that he has been hiking Canyon Drive every Sunday for at least 
20 years and that he felt the first BB pellet when the boys were from 40 to 50 
feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran toward them and they first ran away," he said. "Then they turned and 
started to shoot me more seriously. I should have run away, but the problem is 
that it is such a steep road. I cannot run so well with my 79-year-old legs." 
</P>
<P>
Felszeghy was taken to Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where five pellets were 
removed from his face and ear. X-rays showed one pellet deep in his cheek, and 
doctors did not remove it because to do so would have left a scar larger than 
the wound, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky that my eye was not hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two boys who allegedly did the shooting are being held for investigation of 
assault with a deadly weapon at the Eastlake juvenile detention facility, 
police said. The third boy was not held. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there are no age restrictions for possession of air rifles.

A CLINICAL DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOL PROPOSAL'S FOES CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON BIRTH CONTROL ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1970, after much controversy, the United States' first health clinic on a 
public high school campus opened -- an attempt to reduce teen-age pregnancies 
by offering students reproductive counseling and contraception. 
</P>
<P>
Now, almost two decades later, with more than 120 school-based clinics 
nationwide, the general focus of the facilities has changed significantly to 
center on prevention and treatment of acute and chronic illness, counseling for 
drug abuse and other behavior-related problems, physicals and immunizations, 
with less emphasis on sexual matters. 
</P>
<P>
But, as supporters of the first such clinic in San Diego prepare to make their 
proposal Tuesday to the city Board of Education, they face a vocal opposition 
that has zeroed in on the original issue of teen pregnancy, even though clinic 
directors reported in a 1986 national survey that no more than 15% of student 
visits involve family planning problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Services 
</P>
<P>
A Hoover High School committee of parents, teachers and community health 
providers has proposed a student health and social service center on the East 
San Diego campus that could offer a variety of services to students with 
parental permission. Among them: medical care for illness and injuries; 
physical exams, immunizations and medications; counseling for police-related 
and drug and alcohol problems, and referrals for specialized medical and dental 
care. 
</P>
<P>
The center also could offer counseling for family problems, provide information 
and referrals on pregnancy and sexual issues, handle prenatal care and perhaps 
dispense contraceptives, based on favorable responses to a proposed list of 
services from 17% of 8,000 parents who returned a survey sent them by Hoover 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
The initial proposal up for consideration Tuesday would direct Hoover 
administrators to design a specific operating plan, seek a contract provider 
and obtain funding from private national foundations that support such clinics. 
There would be no direct financial support from the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents cite surveys among Hoover students last year that show that half the 
school-age population has no regular health care, as well as new county data 
showing that 54% of all children in Hoover neighborhoods -- kindergarten 
through 12th grade -- are from families on welfare. The proposed clinic is 
intended to serve any student at Hoover, Wilson Middle School or the seven 
elementary schools in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the students -- a rainbow mix of Indochinese, Latino, black and white 
teen-agers -- receive regular health care, the Hoover committee argues, they 
cannot and will not learn to their potential. Members note the overwhelming 
caseload of 1,000 students a month seen by Hoover's school nurse, who can 
diagnose and refer students but cannot treat illnesses or prescribe 
medications. Many students cannot afford to visit doctors even when referred, 
the committee says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter From Bishop 
</P>
<P>
Those arguments have made no headway with opponents led by Bishop Leo T. Maher 
of the San Diego Catholic Diocese. He has decried the proposal on philosophical 
grounds in a pastoral letter to county Catholics, writing that a school-based 
health clinic is but "a disguise for a sex clinic." 
</P>
<P>
Maher alleges that clinic backers seek to encourage sexual promiscuity among 
students in a conspiracy with Planned Parenthood, the family planning agency 
whose mission is opposed by the Catholic Church because it offers counseling on 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Maher successfully led the opposition to a July, 1986, proposal from San Diego 
schools Supt. Tom Payzant to establish school-based clinics, and he is even 
more vociferously opposed this time, even though the impetus for a clinic now 
comes from an individual school community. 
</P>
<P>
Father Douglas Regin, the diocesan "respect life" director, has said that 
health clinics undermine the moral value of society by offering "safe sex" to 
students, and that schools should instead stress that pregnancy can be avoided 
through a moral life style of abstinence until marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also argue that any requirement for parental permission prior to 
reproductive services would be subverted by clinic directors in their zeal to 
push contraception and abortion. They further question the sincerity of Hoover 
administrators who say that area students' health and social service needs are 
unmet or that only private funding would be used. 
</P>
<P>
At both the local and national levels, the primary fight against clinics 
revolves around the political issue of providing adolescent family planning 
services. There is no disagreement on the basic facts surrounding that issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Agreement on Solution 
</P>
<P>
About half of all American teen-agers are sexually active by the time they 
leave high school, and more than four in 10 women become pregnant before they 
reach age 20. Data from the Hoover Institution at Stanford University shows 
that 23% of all women will be single mothers by age 25. Of those, 53% are 
black. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond those figures, however, there is no agreement on how to address the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego pediatrician Jeffrey Black, a consultant to the San Diego Unified 
School District, said clinic experiences in St. Paul, Minn., and Baltimore 
indicate a possible reduction in teen pregnancy resulting from a combination of 
contraceptive services and counseling, in addition to classroom sex education. 
</P>
<P>
In a March article on school-based clinics for the journal Contemporary 
Pediatrics, Black said that at the St. Paul clinics, where both pregnancy 
counseling and contraceptives are offered, the birth rate declined from 59 per 
1,000 to 37 per 1,000 over eight years, and the percentage of sexually active 
women using birth control services increased to 35% from 7%. 
</P>
<P>
Black added, however, that other clinics have not shown similar gains, and 
other programs with only sex education and/or an emphasis on abstinence 
produced measurable results. But, in the same March issue, Dr. Morris Green, a 
pediatric professor at the James Whitcomb Riley Children's Hospital in 
Indianapolis, said that "there is no evidence that sexual activity is increased 
among students who participate in clinic family planning counseling," a 
conclusion that Los Angeles school district clinic administrators have also 
reached after almost two years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
"The other assets of using schools as sites for health care delivery are more 
clear-cut," Black said. Although detailed studies are not widespread, Black 
cited a school clinic in Dallas where students showed a lower rate of 
hospitalization than those in schools without a clinic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Effect Seen 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bernstam, a Hoover Institution senior researcher specializing in teen 
pregnancy issues, said his studies show that the rates of illegitimate 
pregnancy or abortion among teen-agers are little affected one way or the other 
by family planning services at school-based clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand why schools would like such services because they see real 
girls -- not just statistics -- who are pregnant or sexually active, and maybe 
in some cases they can help by talking them out of pregnancy," Bernstam said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I believe the real benefit in this area for a clinic comes from helping 
the health of future babies, because these girls who get pregnant usually have 
less access to prenatal care, are less likely to stay in school and have a 
higher birth mortality rate and have more babies with low birth weights, which 
we know brings problems down the line." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstam suggested that a wide range of social services to stem dropout rates 
and to boost self-esteem, if offered at a health clinic, might have more of an 
effect in lowering pregnancy rates than sexual counseling alone. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can show a girl that there are greater opportunities ahead, that 
completing school and going to college is realistic, then you don't have to 
worry as much about pregnancy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstam said he understands the philosophical position of the Catholic Church, 
recalling a 1976 audience he had with Pope Paul VI. "I told him that if the 
church had enough time and money to persuade the world of its position, fine, 
and that he could preach as long as he wanted to, but it would not change the 
practical facts of life one iota." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstam's colleague at the Hoover Institution, sociologist Kingsley Davis, is 
quoted in Bishop Maher's pastoral letter as decrying contraceptives as a 
"technological device" to try and solve a social control/social discipline 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis said in an interview that while he does believe contraception alone 
is no solution, he would have no problems with behavioral counseling and 
contraceptives within the context of a comprehensive clinic. "I see nothing 
wrong if (a proposal) is for a general clinic with pregnancy issues as one 
component," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover and school district administrators say too many teen-agers have a lack 
of knowledge about human sexuality, about pregnancy and about where to get help 
either for prevention or pregnancy care. At present, district nurses can 
provide no family planning counseling, and can only suggest that worried 
students seek help from agencies such as Planned Parenthood or Door of Hope. 
</P>
<P>
The three small programs in the district to help teen-agers who are pregnant or 
have a child continue their schooling have waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents insist that their overwhelming reason for the clinic proposal is 
to provide basic, free medical and counseling services to students who 
otherwise, both for reasons of transportation and economics, are unable to get 
them elsewhere. The student survey showed that 32% acknowledged having 
occasional depression and 16% had thought of suicide at one time or another, in 
addition to not having ready access to affordable basic medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Hoover clinic would serve all public schools in the area, health 
education -- such as dental care for children -- could easily be combined with 
clinic treatments, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
Father Francis Penko, pastor of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart parish near 
Hoover, said that "there is no question" that many students in the East San 
Diego area need better health care. He believes that opposition would be much 
less if a school-based health clinic banned all reproductive-related services, 
but added that he doubts proponents would be interested in such a limitation. 
</P>
<P>
Penko said he thinks there is a desire for what he called "social engineering. 
If their concern is genuinely for health, then why not get private funding to 
hire another nurse or two more nurses and let the nurses refer to outside 
clinics and tell the students how to get there?" Penko said his own parish 
school refers children with health problems to a low-cost clinic several blocks 
from the church. 
</P>
<P>
He and other opponents also label as a sham the need for parental consent, as 
proposed by the Hoover committee, because of a California law permitting minors 
to have access to reproductive services without the approval of parents. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles clinic officials and San Diego city schools attorney Tina Dyer 
say the law allows a minor to receive such treatment only if the provider -- 
whether a doctor or clinic -- has a policy of consenting to offer those 
services to any minor requesting them. 
</P>
<P>
The law does not prohibit a clinic from setting up its own regulations not to 
allow any reproductive services for minors, to allow them only if parents have 
given permission for them or to allow them with or without parent approval, 
Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we would be mandated with a clinic into giving such services 
unless we chose to do so," she said. "And my understanding of the proposal is 
that we would require parent permission for the service before it would be 
offered, and I believe that requirement would not go against state law." 
</P>
<P>
As for funding, another member of the organized opposition, Joan Patton -- a 
board member of the San Diego County Right to Life Council -- argues that 
clinic funding is unstable because private foundations provide money only for 
the first two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters concede that foundations will not back clinics indefinitely, 
although the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has provided $16.1 million for 23 
clinics nationwide and has recently committed itself to additional funding for 
Los Angeles for another four years. 
</P>
<P>
"For the present, clinics must rely on a creative combination of private and 
public funding," Black wrote in his March study. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature has measures pending to provide some state money, but their 
success is questionable given the state's present budget crunch in the health 
and welfare areas.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: RACKING UP RESENTMENT AT OCEANSIDE HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the (Oceanside) Blade-Tribune ran a series of critical articles about the 
finances of Tri-City Medical Center, administrators at the hospital were quick 
to register their protest at what they thought was sensationalism. 
</P>
<P>
They canceled the hospital's three subscriptions to the paper and shelved plans 
to run any further advertising. That's not an unusual response in the newspaper 
business, and Publisher Thomas Missett gave it little mind. 
</P>
<P>
What did strike Missett as strange was when the Blade-Tribune's coin-operated 
rack disappeared from outside the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He talked to the hospital marketing director and mentioned the possibility of 
filing a police report. Wonder of wonders, the rack reappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"The box was removed by one zealous employee," a hospital spokeswoman said. "As 
soon as we found it was missing, we returned it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smooth Sailing at Last 
</P>
<P>
In days of yore, it was pirates who preyed on the great sailing schooners. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays an even more treacherous foe often awaits those who try to restore a 
schooner to glory: bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Todd Schwede, marine surveyor, commodore of the Kona Kai Yacht Club 
and a man who is passionate about the 1924 racing schooner Bagheera. After 
spending $210,000 to restore the 72-foot schooner, including rebuilding 60% of 
the hull, Schwede nearly lost both his boat and his investment. 
</P>
<P>
He discovered the Bagheera several years ago, sad and sinking in San Diego, a 
wreck with noble lineage. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by the legendary John Alden (the Ferrari of sailing) and built at the 
Rice 
</P>
<P>
Brothers Yard in East Boothbay, Maine, the Bagheera had terrorized East Coast 
and Great Lake sailing competitions for decades under several owners. 
</P>
<P>
For years she sailed out of the Chicago Yacht Club and later did a charter 
stint in the Caribbean, and made two trips to the Galapagos Islands. But, like 
a beautiful mistress, she suffered progressively harsher treatment with age. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Schwede, whose rescue efforts were hailed in 1986 by the Save Our 
Heritage Organisation. Soon, however, the enterprise hit the shoals of Chapter 
13. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know how many sharks are out there until you enter bankruptcy," 
Schwede said. "Everyone wants to buy you out for 10 cents on the dollar. It's a 
draining, draining experience, a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
On the night before the Bagheera was set to be sold at auction, Schwede and his 
partners found a buyer -- Encinitas businessman Tom Gay, who provides computer 
demographics for Fortune 500 companies. Creditors were paid, and a managing 
contract was arranged. 
</P>
<P>
The Bagheera (named for a black panther in Rudyard Kipling's "Jungle Book") is 
now available for charter out of H&amp;M Landing in Point Loma, where the newly 
formed Bagheera Sailing Adventures has signed a two-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
"She represents a kind of elegance and splendor that just isn't seen anymore," 
Schwede said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
As Brief as They Come 
</P>
<P>
Just how grim is the San Diego city budget for next year? 
</P>
<P>
Every year the Citizens' Assistance &amp; Information Department publishes a 
Budget in Brief to explain the facts behind the figures to the press, the 
public and the bureaucracy. About 12,000 copies of the tabloid are distributed. 
</P>
<P>
This year the Budget in Brief was set to explain why the city manager says the 
new budget is the tightest since Proposition 13 and why there's not enough 
money for all sorts of things. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Financial Management Department canceled this year's Budget in Brief. 
The budget's too tight.

CHOLESTEROL DATA QUESTIONED

<P>
A team of Stanford University researchers said last week that evidence 
regarding the value of reducing cholesterol is "incomplete," adding that low 
cholesterol may actually be associated with a higher death rate in the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Benjamin Littenberg, a clinical scholar, and two other doctors said they 
reviewed more than 100 published papers about cholesterol screening. They 
concluded that the value of such tests is questionable for adults with no 
symptoms of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Their recommendations, published in the April 15 volume of the Annals of 
Internal Medicine, fly in the face of recent campaigns by the National 
Institutes of Health and the American Medical Assn. The groups and other 
organizations encourage reduction of cholesterol, the fatty deposits that clog 
arteries and are generally believed to be linked to heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alan Garber noted that for middle-aged men who have "marked" cholesterol 
elevation, "in the top 5 or 10%," treatment with drugs to bring the cholesterol 
levels down will reduce the heart attack rate.

VIETNAM WAR PASSIONS AT THE HEART OF FELLOW REFUGEE'S ASSAULT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To an outsider who had not seen firsthand the brutalities of the Vietnam War, 
the remarks quoted in the 1986 magazine piece may have sounded reasonable 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to change Vietnam's repressive Marxism," Tran Khanh Van of 
Westminster said in the article, "is to work with those who will become the 
next generation of leaders." 
</P>
<P>
But to fellow refugee Be Tu Van Tran -- a one-time English teacher in Vietnam 
who saw family members jailed by the Marxist regime and who was forced to flee 
the country after the fall of Saigon in 1975 -- the words were nothing short of 
blasphemy. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion of normalized relations with Communist Hanoi so infuriated the 
Costa Mesa immigrant that he was driven to try to kill the man who had dared to 
write the words, according to Orange County prosecutors and Tran's own disputed 
statements to police. 
</P>
<P>
Tran, seen by some as an anti-Communist hero and by others as a political 
extremist from a shadowy terrorist group, will soon be tried in Santa Ana 
Superior Court for the attempted murder of Van. 
</P>
<P>
The case has already been presented to one jury. In 1986, a mistrial occurred 
just as the panel reportedly was leaning 9 to 3 in favor of acquitting Tran. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers are scheduled to seek a date for the second trial at a hearing on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It is a potentially explosive case which, at its root, centers on the intense 
and sometimes clashing views held by some members of the U.S. Vietnamese 
community toward their homeland. Tran, 33, a truck driver, stands accused of 
stalking Van for weeks and then trying to assassinate the former Saigon housing 
minister because of what Tran perceived to be Van's pro-Communist views. Van, a 
local real estate businessman, was shot twice in the stomach and the shoulder 
in a March 18, 1986, attack near his Westminster real estate office. But he 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
Tran's defense attorney contends that Tran had nothing to do with the shooting 
and only claimed responsibility to police as a "badge of honor" to demonstrate 
his commitment to fighting communism. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the defense attorney acknowledged, the implications of the Tran case 
extend far beyond the guilt or innocence of his client. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is much bigger than a few gunshot wounds; it has clear overtones of 
international terrorism," said attorney Robert K. Weinberg of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think that for better or worse, (the upcoming trial) will put in the 
spotlight the crossroads that Vietnam, and its people who have come to this 
country, are at right now," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, defense attorneys and Vietnamese community leaders agree that the 
Tran trial and its surrounding issues of nationalistic pride make the case 
significant for thousands of Southeast Asians living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the biggest and most delicate cases in our community," 
Vietnamese writer Nhat Tien said. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after his arrest, the name of Be Tu Van Tran still elicits strong 
emotions both pro and con from those in the Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
Virulent anti-Communist feelings have not softened, although 14 years have 
passed since Saigon fell to the Communists. And while some Vietnamese 
shopkeepers and restaurant owners denounced Tran, they did not want to be 
identified for fear of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Strong nationalists like Chuen V. Nguyen, a former fighter pilot in the South 
Vietnamese air force, maintain Tran's innocence and consider his motivations 
"heroic." 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot measure the emotions of someone like Be Tu Van Tran, who lost 
relatives and property during the war," Nguyen said. "You don't understand when 
somebody comes into your village and kills your wife and your children. Are you 
going to ask yourself, 'Do I have a right to shoot them?' 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of it happening 14 years ago or 20 years ago, this image, this 
picture of what they did to your relatives is still there," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
Those close to the Vietnamese community say most people rallied in support of 
Tran after news broke of his alleged attack. Some went so far as to raise money 
for his defense and publish a laudatory book about him. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some Vietnamese regard Tran's alleged actions as objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to learn to compromise. We have to come up with different answers than 
violent answers, and (to learn) that not all things are black and white. There 
are shades of gray," said a Vietnamese businessman who asked not to be 
identified for fear of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
While the subject of Vietnamese nationalism has long stirred intense feelings 
among the refugee community, the Tran trial is also likely to attract a broader 
interest as well. 
</P>
<P>
The trial comes at a time of a warming trend between the United States and 
Hanoi, after years of roadblocks largely over the issues of Vietnam's invasion 
of Cambodia and Americans who are missing in action. And the success of the 
Vietnamese refugees in their transition to this country seems to have 
intensified questions surrounding the Vietnamese community and its attitudes 
toward the Asian homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, for instance, Vietnamese in Orange County were angered when 
Westminster Councilman Frank Fry Jr. told a Vietnamese military veterans' group 
to "go back to South Vietnam" if they were unwilling to recognize traditional 
American military holidays. Vietnamese leaders launched a recall effort against 
Fry but called it off after he apologized. 
</P>
<P>
Violence has also erupted in Little Saigon, the commercial hub of the 
Vietnamese community. In February, angry anti-Communists allegedly firebombed a 
travel agency that booked tours to Vietnam. A few weeks ago, the group also 
allegedly set fire to a truck belonging to a television studio that showed 
pro-Communist symbols -- Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum and an old Vietnamese 
liberation flag -- on a television program. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the district attorney's staff, while declining to specify what 
security precautions will be taken during the trial, say they are worried about 
reprisals against both the defendant and the victim, Van. 
</P>
<P>
Van moved to Thailand after the attack out of fear for his safety, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Chris Evans. But he is expected to return to Orange County to 
testify, as he did in the first trial. 
</P>
<P>
Highlighting its political overtones, that first trial featured the unusual 
sight of Tran, his then-co-defendant in the shooting, a defense investigator 
and their former attorney all sporting emblems on their coats that read "Viet 
Cong Hunting Club." 
</P>
<P>
This time around, prosecutors have granted immunity from prosecution to Tran's 
former co-defendant, Cu Ngoc Duong, who was allegedly the "wheelman" -- driver 
of the getaway car -- in the attack on Van. That sets up the prospect that 
prosecutors may try to get him to testify against Tran. 
</P>
<P>
Duong's attorney, Roger S. Hanson of Santa Ana, said it is unclear whether his 
client would oppose an order compelling his testimony. He said it is also 
unclear what Duong would say if he was to take the stand against Tran. 
</P>
<P>
But the single most damning piece of evidence against Tran may be his own 
statements to police after his arrest in 1986: "I shoot him; I accept 
responsibility," Tran reportedly told police.

LANCASTER MOBILE HOME LAW UP FOR VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bitter dispute that has pitted mobile home park owners against their tenants 
and the city of Lancaster will come to a head Tuesday in a special election 
over an ordinance that requires arbitration of rent disputes. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the city's mobile home arbitration ordinance, which enables park 
residents to challenge owners' proposed rent increases. If negotiations between 
the two parties fail, the city can bring in an impartial third party to 
arbitrate the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Park owners call the ordinance "rent control," but renters at the parks call it 
a safeguard against skyrocketing rents, since it requires owners to justify 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance has existed in some form since 1979. It was beefed up by the City 
Council last year to give the city attorney the power to force a stubborn party 
into arbitration and to either nullify or validate a rent increase. 
</P>
<P>
The council also added a hardship clause that allows the city to help pay the 
$750 arbitration fee if park tenants cannot afford their share -- usually half. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Has 28 Parks 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster is one of several Southern California communities, including 
Westminster and El Monte, that regulate mobile home rents in some manner. The 
city has about 4,500 mobile home owners in 28 parks, estimates George Root, 
president of the Lancaster Alliance of Mobile Home Park Residents. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition A on Tuesday's ballot, sponsored by park owners, bans city 
restrictions on the sale or rental price of any property without a vote of the 
citizens. Proposition B, the only other measure on the ballot, asks voters to 
endorse the city's existing mobile home ordinance and is supported by the City 
Council and mobile home park tenants. 
</P>
<P>
If both measures fail, City Atty. David McEwen said, the existing mobile home 
ordinance stands. If Proposition A wins and B loses, the ordinance will be 
repealed, he said. If both win, the city attorney said, Proposition A would ban 
all future attempts by the City Council to cap rents, except those at mobile 
home parks. And, under B, the existing ordinance would remain in effect and 
provide arbitration for mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
Two groups of owners -- Friends of Lancaster/Yes on A and Lancaster Citizens 
Committee/No on Proposition B -- reported contributions at the end of April of 
$87,911, mostly from owners. The tenants have raised $800, Root said. 
</P>
<P>
During the last year, the two sides have argued over campaign tactics and over 
what constitutes rent control. The city unsuccessfully challenged the park 
owners, saying workers gathering signatures to get Proposition A on the ballot 
were not Lancaster residents. 
</P>
<P>
A mobile home resident is suing the latter group for sending out a campaign 
letter under her name without her authorization. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated action, the city is planning to file charges against the two 
groups for failing to submit copies of their mass-mailing literature to the 
city, an alleged violation of municipal laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearing Tenants' Side 
</P>
<P>
The mobile home ordinance aims "to give tenants some say" when a park owner 
raises the rent, said Susan Davis, spokeswoman for the city. At the same time, 
the ordinance states that landlords are to be assured a "fair return on their 
property and rental income." 
</P>
<P>
But park owners say the ordinance amounts to rent control. It's not the classic 
form of rent control -- a percentage limit on rent increases each year, as in 
Santa Monica -- admits Peter M. Wanserske, president of Friends of Lancaster. 
But the arbitration requirement "is still rent control in that it is a control 
on a business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wanserske said he fears what might come if the measure remains as it is. The 
ordinance "can be changed by the City Council to a percentage or whatever they 
want," including limits on apartment rents and house sales, he said.. 
</P>
<P>
"It just snowballs. . . . It will involve the whole community," he said. "Look 
at Santa Monica," he added, contending that that city has, under rent control, 
suffered from deteriorating buildings and an influx of tenants on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flyers Mailed 
</P>
<P>
The owners groups have mailed about eight flyers in as many days, referring to 
Santa Monica and stating that "other cities with rent control" have cut senior 
programs and other services and have hiked utility taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The mailers amount to scare tactics, the city and tenants say. "We have never 
had rent control," McEwen said. "The council does not want to sit as the 
decision-making body to decide what rents should be paid." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the city does not provide senior services -- the county 
does -- and does not levy utility taxes. The flyers represent "a real example 
that people running this campaign have no idea of what Lancaster's all about," 
McEwen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fair ordinance," Root said. 'It's just arbitration and negotiation, 
that's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
Without the ordinance, "the rents would just go out of sight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About six rent disputes have gone to arbitration in the last five years, Root 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The one case to be heard under the strengthened ordinance, involving Four Winds 
Mobile Home Park, involved the hardship clause. The 17 members of the park's 
residents association appealed to the City Council for funds to arbitrate when 
the owner announced a 17% increase in rent last June, said Gordon Russell, 
president of the Four Winds Mobile Home Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$25 Increase 
</P>
<P>
For his plot of land, 66 feet by 36 feet, the rent went from $150 to $175 a 
month, Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the arbitrator orders that the association and the park owner 
equally split the $750 arbitration fee. But, Russell said, in the Four Winds 
case the tenants were hard pressed to come up with the money because they were 
few in number and many are elderly and live on fixed incomes. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council agreed to pay one-third of the $750, with residents and owners 
each putting up another third. An arbitrator is scheduled to hear the case May 
23, Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Yatuni, manger of Four Winds, said he thinks the City Council was fair in 
reducing the arbitration cost for both parties. But, he said, he would rather 
see no government interference -- including arbitration. The "free market will 
eventually take care of" any rent increases, he said. If a landlord charges an 
exorbitant rent, "people don't pay it," Yatuni said. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not that easy, resident leader Root said. "Once you move your mobile 
home into a space, it's no longer mobile," said Root, who estimated that moving 
the home can cost $5,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
And free-market forces are not enough to regulate rents, mobile homeowners say. 
The ordinance, Russell said, is a "check and balance system to keep the owners 
from going wild." With arbitration, "as long as they're reasonable and not 
trying to steal from us, they can get what they need."

TEACHERS LEARN TO REACH OVER CULTURAL LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Theresa Pro's Southeast Asian students spoke so softly that she could barely 
hear them. Vivienne Bocarsly had to tell her Latino students, "Look me in the 
eye." Juliet Beacham didn't know why Asian kids smiled when they bumped into 
someone in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
Margarita Castaneda said her first-graders from Central America were 
unnaturally spooked at loud noises, such as a whistle blown on the playground 
or a book dropped on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Such behavior, which may seem strange to Americans, is popping up more and more 
as students from other cultures enroll in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. In response, the district has instituted cross-cultural training 
seminars at 14 elementary and junior-high schools in the San Fernando Valley 
and has scheduled more in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Showing Respect 
</P>
<P>
At a session at Lanai Road School in Encino, teachers learned that looking down 
and speaking softly are signs of respect in Southeast Asian and Latino cultures 
and that a smile can be an apology in some Asian cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Erica Hagen, a former television actress who conducts the workshops for the 
school district, said remnants of students' days in war-torn countries may crop 
up at school. Teachers have told her, she said, of times when an airplane would 
fly over or a car would backfire, and Salvadoran and Vietnamese students would 
dive for the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Hagen, from the Immaculate Heart College Center in Los Angeles, demonstrated 
common gestures that are offensive to students from other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
A curled index finger, she noted, beckons another person in the United States 
but is reserved for beckoning animals or for challenging someone to fight in 
several Asian countries. In Iran, a thumb-up gesture is "extremely obscene," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Halloween, she said, can be a horrifying holiday for Southeast Asian children, 
who are raised to believe in good and evil spirits. Their parents "use ghosts 
to control kids; if you're not good, ghosts will get you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Children often get contradictory messages at home and at school. Smiling is 
undignified for Korean men, so while teachers might instruct a Korean boy to 
smile for his class photo, his parents demand a stoic countenance, Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
What parents may demand as respectful conduct, teachers may regard as rude, she 
said in the seminars. Children are to speak softly and lower their eyes before 
elders in some Asian and Latino cultures, but U.S. teachers often believe such 
behavior means that children are not paying attention, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to value diversity," Hagen said, suggesting that teachers say: "I 
understand it's rude to look in adults' eyes in your culture, and it's 
important to continue doing that in your culture. But with American adults, you 
may want to practice looking into their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
This year, about 61,600 students, or 10.4% of the district's total, are 
immigrants who have attended U.S. schools less than three years, up from 51,000 
or 8.7% last year, said Lila Silvern, coordinator of the district's programs 
for immigrant and refugee children. The nation's second-largest school district 
has a fourth of the nation's immigrant students and a third of the state's, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Years in U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Region E of the district, which covers the Valley south of Roscoe Boulevard and 
includes students bused into the area, has 7,434 immigrants in kindergarten 
through eighth grade. These students -- 12% of the region's total -- have been 
in U.S. schools three years or less, Silvern said. 
</P>
<P>
The district tries to help immigrant students adapt, with six-week crash 
courses in American culture and English, and with bilingual classes. But the 
six-week courses will accommodate only about 13,000 students this year -- 
one-fifth of those who need them, Silvern said. 
</P>
<P>
Another tactic is to help the teachers adapt through the cross-cultural 
workshops. The sessions are funded in the Valley by Immaculate Heart center -- 
an independent, nonprofit organization that promotes education of immigrant 
students -- the school district and Pacific Bell, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telling Differences 
</P>
<P>
"Many teachers can't distinguish between a Mexican immigrant from a little town 
and a Salvadoran from a war-torn country," said Maria Casillas, operations 
administrator for Region E. "But the conditions they came from are different, 
so the way they respond in the classroom is different." 
</P>
<P>
Hagen, who taught in refugee camps in Thailand for a year and a half, noted in 
the workshops that education is stressed in Asian cultures and that a student's 
poor performance can bring shame on an entire family. 
</P>
<P>
Pro, a third-grade teacher at Hazeltine Avenue Elementary School in Van Nuys, 
said such values might explain why some Southeast Asian parents cried when she 
criticized their children for such minor infractions as talking loudly in class 
or skipping homework. 
</P>
<P>
Bocarsly, also a Hazeltine teacher, said that her Latino students called her 
"teacher" or "maestra," and she told them, "I would like to be called Mrs. 
Bocarsly." She later learned at a workshop at her school that the students 
believed it would have been a sign of disrespect to address her by name -- 
students can only address peers by name. 
</P>
<P>
Many children of war bring survivor guilt with them, Hagen said in one seminar. 
"They ask, 'Why did I survive when my family died?' They can't talk about this 
at home, so ask them about it," she urged teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers said they do not have to ask. Pro said her Laotian and Cambodian 
third-graders will suddenly raise their hands and blurt out tales of witnessing 
their fathers, sisters or other family members die. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda, a bilingual teacher at Encino School, said one of her pupils will 
start sobbing quietly in a corner of the classroom. "The children tell me 
so-and-so is crying. I console them, and then the story comes out." 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if they just had to get it out," Pro said. "Maybe they're searching 
for answers." 
</P>
<P>
At Hazeltine, where the student body is about 55% Latino and 23% Southeast 
Asian, some of the experiences emerged in an assignment to write a story, 
complete with dedication and author's notes. An 11-year-old Cambodian boy wrote 
an adaptation of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," in which, instead of 
porridge, the bears eat rice soup. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brothers, Sisters Dead 
</P>
<P>
His autobiographical note read: "I have five sisters, but three of them died. 
One more of my big sisters is in Thailand with my grandmother. I also have four 
big brothers. Three died, and one is in Thailand with my grandmother. That made 
me sad and angry." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Douglas, who mainly teaches Cambodian children at Hazeltine, recalled that 
when the 1987 Whittier earthquake hit, "within an hour, all the Cambodians came 
to get their children -- because they'd been through so much, they wanted to 
get their family together as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
In her seminars, Hagen called for understanding -- and for patience. The 
average time a teacher gives a student to answer a question is two seconds, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even for American kids, it's not enough time," she said, noting that 
immigrants have to "translate the question into their native language, think of 
the answer, then translate the answer back to spit it out in English. 
</P>
<P>
"If the child thinks the teacher is going to move on to another kid, he's not 
even going to bother to think of the answer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But some teachers are reluctant to embrace Hagen's message: "I feel that we do 
the best we can and that we are in the U.S. and have our own customs that all 
should assimilate to. Other countries would not do it for us," a Sherman Oaks 
Elementary School teacher wrote on a critique form. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Mandell, a Lanai Road School teacher, said that since the Valley's 
student population is no longer "lily-white" and fluent in English, "I've got 
to become a psychologist, interpeter and remember all the different ways to 
talk to people." 
</P>
<P>
Regina Sahani, a teacher at Sherman Oaks ELementary School, said 
misunderstandings between cultures have hit home. Sahani and her family 
immigrated from India in 1985. Two years ago, she said, a Valley magnet school 
director said her son, who wears a turban for religious reasons, could not 
attend the school because "we don't accept funny hats." The conflict was 
eventually resolved, and the boy attended the school. 
</P>
<P>
But students, as well as teachers, are adapting, school administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feeling More Secure 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Southeast Asians at Hazeltine would cry at the sound of sirens 
screeching, which to them was a sound of war, Principal Nathan Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, the crying has stopped. The Asian population at school and in the 
neighborhood has increased, and many of the children have older siblings who 
have gone to Hazeltine. "There seems to be a much more secure feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, Glickman said, he discovered a Cambodian boy with red stripes on 
his back and abdomen. The marks were reported to authorities as child abuse, 
but after consulting with Southeast Asians, Glickman discovered that the 
stripes resulted from a home remedy called "coining." (To treat such ills as 
chest congestion, balm is applied to the skin and a coin is rubbed in a 
pattern, which breaks capillaries.) 
</P>
<P>
Glickman said such unusual practices are a thing of the past at his school 
nowadays. "Parents are assimilating. They probably give a couple of aspirin 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all part of the growing process -- on our part as well as theirs," he 
said.

MEGA-MEMENTOS;

<P>
THOUSAND OAKS ARCHIVISTS SORT THROUGH CROONER RUDY VALLEE'S 4-TON COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rudy Vallee, the megaphone-carrying crooner and popular radio personality, was 
a pack rat, say archivists at the Thousand Oaks Library who recently began 
cataloguing the four-ton collection of papers and mementos that he gathered 
over more than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
Vallee saved X-rays of an impacted wisdom tooth that was extracted in the 
1970s, brief notes that his fourth wife left on the refrigerator and a copy of 
the formula for his golden hair dye. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for students of entertainment history, Vallee also kept thousands 
of fan letters, radio scripts, musical scores and other items that provide an 
unusually complete record of the popular culture of his day, said Henry Matoon, 
an archivist hired to catalogue the collection. 
</P>
<P>
The material fills about 560 crates and spans Vallee's long career, which began 
in the 1920s, reached its peak during the next two decades when he became one 
of the nation's most successful vaudeville and radio personalities, and 
continued until he was well into his 70s. 
</P>
<P>
The collection will be available to the public by January, Matoon said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God Vallee saved all that stuff," said Larry Gassman, president of the 
Los Angeles-based Society to Preserve and Encourage Radio Drama, Variety and 
Comedy, or SPERDVAC. "For anyone writing his biography or interested in 
history, its value is incalculable." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Vallee died in 1986 at age 84, the Thousand Oaks Library Foundation 
bought the collection for $275,000 as part of an ambitious program to establish 
an archive on the history of radio and early television. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, which raised the money through private donations and a $125,000 
</P>
<P>
grant from the city of Thousand Oaks, outbid the University of Wyoming and 
several other institutions for the highly coveted collection, said Antoinette 
Hagopian, the group's president. By owning the prized Vallee collection, the 
foundation "is on its way to building a first-class archive" on the performing 
arts akin to those at UCLA and other area universities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is rare for a small city library to embark on such an ambitious 
endeavor, the foundation believes that the role of a library "is to preserve 
history, not just to provide typical library materials to a community," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation could have chosen early California history or other topics, but 
decided to devote its archive to radio and early television because many local 
residents are employed in the entertainment industry and have offered to 
bequeath their papers to the foundation, Hagopian said. 
</P>
<P>
The library has more than 2,000 books on the subject and about 6,000 scripts. 
In addition, it has the papers of Clete Roberts, a famous World War II news 
correspondent and veteran Los Angeles broadcaster who lived in the area until 
his death in 1984, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the foundation came under fire from some city residents, who 
criticized it for acquiring the Vallee collection in the face of cutbacks in 
library services that year. But officials defended the acquisition by saying 
that the collection is an investment whose value will continually increase, and 
the outcry was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
"We bought it for a sweet price," Hagopian said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Grant 
</P>
<P>
In January, the foundation received a $50,000 grant from the state library to 
begin cataloguing Vallee's huge collection, which he kept in a three-story 
building on his Hollywood Hills estate. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by pictures of the clean-cut singer and by old newspapers with 
headlines devoted to his appearances, archivists Matoon and Martin Getzler have 
applied themselves to the massive task of sifting through the thousands of 
newspaper clippings, photographs, and financial and other records. While they 
are working, they sometimes play tapes of Vallee favorites, such as "My Time Is 
Your Time" and "I'm Just a Vagabond Lover," Getzler said. 
</P>
<P>
Vallee's widow, Eleanor Vallee Hustedt, owns the copyright to many of Vallee's 
personal papers, and researchers who want to publish the materials will have to 
approach her for permission, library officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The collection contains none of the original megaphones that became Vallee's 
trademark, said Ruth Leonard, special collections librarian. Some mementos are 
now in the Smithsonian Institution and at the University of Maine. However, the 
library has hundreds of recordings of Vallee's radio shows, which will be 
copied onto audiocassettes and loaned to library patrons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Sex Symbol 
</P>
<P>
The two archivists say they have already made some interesting discoveries 
about Vallee. For instance, they have come across records that indicate that 
Vallee hired a detective to follow a woman with whom he was romantically 
involved before he met his fourth wife. Vallee, who graduated from Yale 
University with a degree in Spanish and philosophy, had a clear, cultured voice 
that made him one of the first male sex symbols, Getzler said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days of radio, the fan letters he got from women were on a high 
romantic plane," Getzler said. "Later, in the '40s, the women were a lot more 
forward and tried to instigate meetings with Vallee." 
</P>
<P>
From the age of 8, Vallee saved memorabilia from his life because, even as a 
Maine schoolboy who played the saxophone, he believed that he would become 
famous, said Hustedt, whom he married in 1949. Vallee knew his collection 
"would be valuable for posterity, just like Nixon's," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, the guy was marvelously charming, but he saved this stuff 
because he had a monumental ego," said Gene Gressley, former director of the 
University of Wyoming's American Heritage Center, which tried to buy the 
collection. "The stairway in his house was lined with pictures of him and 
famous people, and I remember it took us two hours to get downstairs because he 
stopped to tell me about each one." 
</P>
<P>
Getzler and Matoon acknowledge that there are materials in the collection that 
indicate that Vallee thought highly of himself, including records of his 
unsuccessful efforts to get the Los Angeles City Council to change the name of 
his street to Rue de Vallee. But Vallee was also generous, they say, paying 
medical bills for friends and employees in need. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rudy Vallee collection is one of the best windows onto a star of his high 
caliber," Gressley said. "You can understand a lot about 20th-Century radio and 
film by studying that collection."

MAN, 73, CRITICALLY WOUNDED AFTER KNIFE ATTACK ON POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 73-year-old man who was behaving "erratically" was in critical condition 
Sunday night after police shot him at his City Heights home, police and 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Robert Miller, was shot when he "went for an officer" 
with a knife, said Sgt. Steve Chivers of the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Miller underwent surgery for multiple gunshot wounds in the upper part of his 
body, said Laura Avallone, a spokeswoman for Mercy Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred just before 2 p.m. Sunday, according to Chivers, who said 
details of the incident were vague. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Tuma, who lives across from Miller in the 3000 block of 44th Street, 
said he had been acting strangely since Saturday, when he came outside and 
began breaking the windows of his house. "He was angry at somebody," Tuma said, 
adding that Chivers went back into the house and began throwing things out the 
broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
Miller apparently had been alone in the house since his sister left two weeks 
ago, Tuma said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuma said police made several visits to the house on Saturday and ultimately 
took Miller to a hospital, but he either left or was discharged.

<P>
A man was killed Sunday when the motorcycle he was riding collided head-on with 
a truck in Lancaster, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcyclist, Roger Wronkowski, 35, of Lancaster lost control of his cycle 
as he was traveling north on Sierra Highway and crossed into a southbound lane 
near Avenue H, Sgt. Terry Lewis of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
said. The cyclist was traveling at about 60 m.p.h. when he hit the truck, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck, Clifton McDouglas of Lancaster, was not injured, Lewis 
said, but was taken to Antelope Valley Hospital for observation because of a 
heart condition.

PADRES, SALAZAR KICK AWAY GAME TO METS IN NINTH, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ball hit the grass in front of Luis Salazar's glove, then bounced off the 
tip of the glove. Then it spun and hopped and rolled and didn't stop until it 
had knocked the Padres into a cold and unfamiliar place. 
</P>
<P>
Last place. 
</P>
<P>
In a fitting end to yet another game of blown chances, Salazar booted rookie 
Mark Carreon's double play grounder with the bases loaded and one out in the 
ninth inning Sunday to allow Keith Hernandez to score from third base and give 
the New York Mets a 2-1 victory in front of 35,547 at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
This morning the Padres will slowly climb out of bed and rub their aching 
hitting, and fielding, and baserunning. Then, when they glance at a newspaper, 
they will want to rub their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
As the losers of five of six games on this current trip, they have fallen to 
18-21 and into last place in the National League West for the first time since 
the second day this season and for only the fourth time since Jack McKeon took 
over as manager last May 28. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we'll take a win any way we can get it, any time, any place, any 
how," said Jack Clark, who went zero for four and now is in a two-for-28 slide 
since hitting his last homer May 2 against St. Louis. "Some of these games . . 
. they are the kind that really hurt because we know we can win them, and 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
Remember that this was the same team that began the season as pennant 
favorites. The same team that won five of its first eight games to bolt into 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, they have won only 13 of 31 and are suddenly four games behind 
first-place Cincinnati with every other team in the division separating them. 
</P>
<P>
And suddenly, as Sunday's three hours here would indicate, everything is going 
wrong. Even when things go right. Especially when things go right. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of loss," pitcher Dennis Rasmussen said, "where we're sitting 
over here kicking ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
One kick is needed for the offense, as the Padres had two blown sacrifice bunts 
that could have led to runs on a day the teams combined to leave 24 men on 
base. 
</P>
<P>
Another kick is needed for the baserunning, which ended a first-inning rally 
and then killed a possible game-winning rally in the ninth. Tony Gwynn ended 
the first inning with the go-ahead run on third base by being thrown out 
attempting to steal second. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was the bottom of the ninth, an inning requiring not just a kick 
but a couple of good slaps. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Dave Leiper, who had escaped a bases-loaded jam in the eighth, allowed 
a leadoff ground-ball single to Howard Johnson, who just beat shortstop 
Salazar's throw to first. Hernandez then ripped a line drive down the 
right-field line for a double. Johnson was sent home on the hit, but Roberto 
Alomar took the good relay from right fielder Bip Roberts and threw Johnson out 
at the plate on a nice diving tag by catcher Mark Parent. 
</P>
<P>
Great play, right? "But it didn't mean anything," Parent noted glumly. 
</P>
<P>
How true. With Hernandez on third after the throw, the Padres intentionally 
walked both Kevin McReynolds and Greg Jefferies to set up a force play at home 
plate with Carreon hitting. There was also the chance of getting a double play 
grounder, but because Carreon runs well, McKeon pulled the infield in on the 
grass, hoping to start any double play with a throw home. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to get the guy at home first," McKeon said. "We were not thinking about 
going around the horn on the double play, because it was the guy going home who 
would have beat us." 
</P>
<P>
As the Padres and McKeon's luck would have it, Salazar might have handled the 
next play easier if he were playing back. 
</P>
<P>
Facing a two-and-two count, Carreon fought off a curveball and bounced it 
toward Salazar. Funny, but it was just what Salazar, and pitcher Leiper, had 
hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get a ground ball, and I wanted it at the shortstop, and that's 
what we got," Leiper said. 
</P>
<P>
Only, it wasn't what Salazar got. The ball suddenly took a quick hop at 
Salazar's feet and bounced off his glove and trickled back toward left field. 
Hernandez could have scored while running on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
All of which made for a bad ending to an otherwise proficient day for Salazar, 
who was making his first start at shortstop this year because Garry Templeton 
needed a rest because of a sore left knee. Before the ninth, Salazar had made 
only good fielding plays and even knocked in the Padres' only run with a 
looping double to left field in the fourth off Mets starter Bob Ojeda. 
</P>
<P>
"I made all the plays . . . but one," said Salazar. "I can't explain it. I 
don't know how I missed it. It was the easiest ball hit to me all day. It was 
hit right at me . . . the perfect double play ball. It was the strangest way to 
make an error. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still wondering, why do I do that? How does that happen?" 
</P>
<P>
Rationalized McKeon: "Hey, it could have been the ninth inning or the first 
inning. It was just spinning, he was trying to get the guy at the plate with 
it, and it kicked off his glove. That stuff happens." 
</P>
<P>
What happened in the top of the ninth with the score tied 1-1, now that doesn't 
always happen. With eventual winner Roger McDowell pitching, Randy Ready led 
off the ninth by drawing a walk. Given the task of bunting Ready to second, 
Parent failed miserably. The bunt bounced almost directly to McDowell, who 
threw to shortstop Kevin Elster for the start of a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Marvell Wynne followed with a single that would have scored the run from 
second. It was almost a carbon copy of the third inning when, with the Padres 
trailing, 1-0, Rasmussen faced the same situation with Parent on first. He also 
bunted terribly, forcing Parent at second. Gwynn followed with a single that 
would have scored Parent. 
</P>
<P>
"I make the bunt, maybe we win," Parent said. "I have got to get that bunt 
down. I'm not executing, none of us are executing." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres still had a chance to salvage that ninth when, after Wynne's single, 
Gwynn followed with a line drive to right to move Wynne to third and bring up 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts never got a chance. On a three-and-one fastball, Gwynn took off for 
second and was thrown out by catcher Barry Lyons, even though Gwynn claimed he 
was safe, and jumped around second base in front of umpire Jerry Crawford to 
illustrate that point. 
</P>
<P>
"You never see me jumping like that, so you know I was safe," Gwynn said. "I 
slid outside (Elster's) tag, he never got me." 
</P>
<P>
But with his run perhaps meaningless anyway, and with two out, why steal in the 
first place? 
</P>
<P>
"It's what we've been doing all year, it's been working," said Gwynn, who 
entered Sunday as the National League leader with 14 stolen bases, although he 
had been caught four times. "I figured, they weren't looking at me, so why not 
go for it? And I had it beat, too." 
</P>
<P>
But today all the Padres have is last place. All to themselves. And no answer 
is the right one.

BROWN SETS SDSU STRIKEOUT RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego State pitcher Rob Brown established a school single-season strikeout 
record in the first game of a doubleheader Sunday when he recorded his 116th 
strikeout of the year in a 9-3 Western Athletic Conference loss to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Brown picked up No. 116, his sixth strikeout of the game, in the fourth inning 
when he got Jon Viela for the second out. Brown was lifted after the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a senior right-hander, eclipsed the mark set by Bob Cluck in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (34-23, 15-9 in the WAC) came back to win the second game, 4-3, on 
an eighth-inning RBI single from Lance Pinnell.

POP CAPSULES : A HEAVY-GOING QUEENSRYCHE AT IRVINE MEADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Queensryche has won praise for using heavy metal to get across heavy concepts 
instead of the usual heavy doses of sexist swill and party-hearty blather. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the Seattle band's serious aims that turned its show Friday at Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre into such tiresomely heavy going. The problem was musical, 
not thematic: While Queensryche may have stretched somewhat the bounds of what 
heavy metal can say, there is nothing striking or original about how the band 
says it. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Geoff Tate has an impressively clean and capacious set of pipes, and he 
hews to an operatic brand of vocalizing that, in its unrelenting bombast, is 
the most stilted and annoying form of rock singing there is. Queensryche's 
playing, though proficient, rehashed the standard metallic strategies: pound 
and chug rhythms and stentorian guitar solos and harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour show included a full rendition of "Operation: Mindcrime," the 
conspiratorial potboiler of a concept album that centers on a brainwashed 
assassin a la "The Manchurian Candidate." If nothing more, the raucously 
received show demonstrated that a good segment of the metal audience thirsts 
for music that has some serious intent. MIKE BOEHM

POP CAPSULES : L.A. ROCK BAND WARRANT MAKES A WARRANTED JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANISS GARZA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time Warrant played in its hometown of Los Angeles, it was headlining 
a club on the Sunset Strip. Saturday night, a scant four months later, the 
quintet headlined the 6,000-seat Universal Amphitheater. This was a daring jump 
that could have easily backfired: Would the place be empty? Would the band be 
able to project in the larger surroundings? 
</P>
<P>
But the move was on the money. The Amphitheater was more than three-quarters 
filled with a mainly teen (and younger) audience, and Warrant came through with 
a potent, 90-minute dose of its high-profile hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
What's fascinating about Warrant is that underneath the typical cockiness and 
sexual innuendo beats a heart of gold. Singer Jani Lane bounced through "So 
Damn Pretty" with so much crotch-grabbing and hip-thrusting that it became 
embarrassing. But when he talked to the audience, or dived into one of the 
ballads, he projected so much sincerity and affability that it was impossible 
not to warm up to the guy. 
</P>
<P>
The band's playing was as tight as its choreographed moves, and while tunes 
like "32 Pennies" and the single "Down Boys" may not be instant classics, they 
have more than enough hooks to get by. 
</P>
<P>
Second-billed House of Lords is also big on entertainment value. Its lushly 
orchestrated songs and powerful performance packed an impressive punch. JANISS

POP CAPSULES : LITTLE CAESAR AT THE PALACE: BLOOD ON THE KICKSTAND

<TEXT>
<P>
Fire up the Harley, suck back a coupla cans of 30-weight, 'n' gitcherself a new 
tattoo, Betty Lou, 'cause Little Caesar is playin' the rockin' role of the 
ultimate biker-bar band right down to the blood on the kickstand. Supercharged 
by Ron Young's self-deprecating sarcasm and strong vocals, these tattooed love 
boys also packed a certain tunefulness into their heavily R&amp;B-based 
material during their set at the Palace on Friday, particularly when working at 
mid-tempo. (The headbanging riffslingers are less distinctive.) 
</P>
<P>
The local quintet could also lose the brew-spewing, buddy-buddy routines. They 
don't need 'em. Not when they can grind out a dirty whiteboy version of Aretha 
Franklin's "Chain of Fools" that's reminiscent of nothing less than Detroit, 
those semi-legendary Motor City mamajammas led by Mitch Ryder back in 1972. 
Maybe even better. 
</P>
<P>
S.F.-based Jet Boy, which headlined the show, is the Living Definition of 
Mediocrity. Probably best at ersatz glamslam stuff such as "Feel the Shake" -- 
the title track of their recent debut LP -- and predictably worst when 
bludgeoning their way through hoary blooze root-tines. After 40 minutes there 
were almost as many people schmoozing in the lobby as there were inside 
watching these poseurs rolloverundersidewaysdown. DON WALLER

'TERROR WITHIN' GROWS FROM A MUTANT RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pro-choicers chagrined by the weight afforded the anti-abortion arguments in 
the current movie "Listen to Me" can take heart that a new film has opened 
presenting an opposing viewpoint: "The Terror Within" (citywide) comes out 
emphatically in support of a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy, if not in 
all instances, at least in cases of rape by a gooey 9-foot-tall mutant. 
</P>
<P>
A plague has wiped out almost all of civilization, save a few scientific types 
holed up beneath the Mojave Desert who are overjoyed when pretty Sue (Starr 
Andreef) is found pregnant. They assume that the proud papa must be her 
blow-dryed biff (Andrew Stevens) and dismiss her contention that it's the 
slobbering, toothy "gargoyle" that violated and almost killed her scant days 
earlier. Denied the right to an abortion, with neither coat hangers nor the 
Supreme Court around, knife-wielding Sue kills herself and her unborn beastie. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, reading "The Terror Within" as an abortion rights parable is giving 
the film makers a whopping benefit of the doubt. In fact, it owes less to Jane 
Roe than to Joseph Campbell, retelling as it does a familiar, ancient myth -- 
if, that is, you consider the year 1979, when "Alien" was released, ancient -- 
with slavish faithfulness. Instead of that movie's "chest-burster," here we get 
a couple of womb-bursters. Just the movie for Mother's Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to enjoy this "Terror" (MPAA-rated R) is to savor star George 
Kennedy's badly synced post-production dialogue and think back to his role in 
the sci-fi cheapie movie-within-the-movie in Albert Brooks' "Modern Romance," 
which was full of hilarious bits about the perils of film dubbing. Nine years 
later, thanks to producer Roger Corman, Kennedy really is in that movie.

ANGER OVER ECONOMY CARRIES PERONIST TO LANDSLIDE VICTORY IN ARGENTINE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carlos Saul Menem, a flamboyant populist promising a "productive revolution," 
won the Argentine presidency in a landslide Sunday on the strength of public 
anger over the nation's worst economic crisis in nearly a century. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Menem trounced Eduardo Cesar Angeloz of President Raul 
Alfonsin's ruling Radical party by a margin of about 49% to 38%, according to 
unofficial results of three-fourths of the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Angeloz, governor of Cordoba province, lost in nearly every district of the 
country and was fighting even to win his own province. 
</P>
<P>
In capturing the presidency for the Peronist party for the first time since 
1973, Menem successfully muted lingering fears of Peronism and turned the 
campaign into a vote on Alfonsin's economic failings -- inflation is surging at 
an annual rate of 3,000%, the Argentine currency has plummeted and workers' 
buying power has disintegrated. 
</P>
<P>
Turnout was about 85% of the 20 million eligible voters. Partial returns had 
Menem ahead with 6.1 million votes, compared to 4.7 million for Angeloz. The 
conservative Center Alliance of Alvaro Alsogaray had 7% of the vote -- less 
than expected -- with the rest split among minor candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Control Legislature 
</P>
<P>
The Peronists, who already control the Senate, also apparently won a majority 
in the lower house of Congress, giving Menem a friendly legislature for his 
plan to achieve a vaguely defined "productive revolution" -- raising salaries, 
reactivating industry, reducing a huge deficit and tackling inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was regarded as a crucial step in the consolidation of democratic rule 
in Argentina, where six coups have broken the constitutional order since 1930. 
When Alfonsin's successor takes office in December, it will be the first 
genuinely democratic transition of power from one elected president to another 
in 61 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Today all Argentines were the winners," said Alfonsin, whose election in 1983 
ended a brutal seven-year military dictatorship and formed part of a trend 
toward restored civilian rule across the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Peronists poured into the streets of the capital to celebrate in a 
steady rain, pounding drums and chanting odes to Juan D. Peron, who founded the 
party in the mid-1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Menem was virtually assured of a clear-cut electoral college majority, thus 
avoiding months of potentially bitter maneuvering for support before the 
electors' meeting on Aug. 10 to choose the winner. 
</P>
<P>
From his home in the small province of La Rioja, where he serves as governor, 
Menem said, "I've defeated an adversary, but I've regained a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Angeloz called Menem to concede defeat and congratulate him. 
</P>
<P>
Menem said: "I have faith and hope that things are going to start to go better 
in this country." 
</P>
<P>
He quoted Juan Peron, saying, "To govern is to give work," and added: "Here 
there will be no possibility of speculation, of usury. Let's end this Argentina 
where those who do nothing live well and those who work every day of the year 
live badly." 
</P>
<P>
The constitution barred Alfonsin from seeking reelection. Despite widespread 
approval of the entrenchment of civil liberties during his six-year term, 
public disaffection is widespread over his economic failures. One of the 
world's 10 wealthiest countries in the 1930, Argentina has lately fallen 
further into the ranks of the Third World, with its foreign debt soaring to 
nearly $60 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The voting proceeded smoothly, with no complaints of irregularities. Argentine 
elections are regarded as among the fairest in Latin America, with observers 
from all parties overseeing every step of the process. 
</P>
<P>
Menem, who spent five years in jail during the last dictatorship, said after 
casting his ballot: "The important thing is that the Argentine people can 
exercise the fundamental right to choose." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working-Class Base 
</P>
<P>
The son of Syrian immigrants who converted from Islam to Catholicism, Menem 
galvanized the working-class base of the Peronist party, a social movement that 
defies ideological labels. An amateur race car driver and pilot who is often 
photographed with starlets, Menem avoided specifics on how he would right the 
foundering economy or on how far he would go in dismantling the state 
domination of the economy begun by Peron. 
</P>
<P>
Menem emphasized the "renovation" of the Peronist party, formally known as the 
Justicialist Party, since the days when Peron dictated every decision. Menem 
helped engineer internal party reforms, including an open primary that he won 
in an upset last July, which he said ended the party's authoritarian 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
With a sonorous voice and bushy sideburns reminiscent of 19th-Century 
provincial political bosses, Menem enthralled rallies with his appeal to 
"Follow me! To end the hunger of the poor children, and the sadness of the rich 
children! I will not defraud you!" 
</P>
<P>
Still, uncertainty over Menem's intentions and memories of the Peronists' 
combative past combined to kept the number of undecided voters relatively high. 
</P>
<P>
Peron ruled from 1946-55 with the help of his charismatic second wife, Eva 
(Evita) Peron, until he fell in a coup. He returned to office in 1973 and, upon 
his death less than a year later, was succeeded by his third wife and vice 
president, Maria Estela Peron. She was ousted in 1976 at a time of 
hyper-inflation, strikes and left-wing violence. 
</P>
<P>
Angeloz, who promised to privatize deficit-ridden state-run enterprises and to 
modernize the economy, sought to portray Menem as a throwback to past Peronist 
reliance on the state to solve the nation's ills. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old governor, a gruff-voiced career politician regarded as a 
capable if dour administrator, was nearly as critical of Radical party policies 
as he was of Peronism. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonsin constantly faced conflict with the military over human rights abuses 
during the previous regime, and he suffered through three military rebellions 
in the past two years and a leftist guerrilla attack against a military base in 
January. Many analysts expect some sort of military amnesty in the months or 
years ahead to ease tensions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memory of Perons 
</P>
<P>
The memory of Juan and Evita Peron was more than a sentimental factor for many 
voters. In the Villa Urquiza neighborhood of the capital, 74-year-old Juana 
Bottini de Rossini pointed to a graffiti-stained stone pedestal in a park 
across from the voting station and said, "That was a bust of Evita until they 
pulled it down after the 1955 coup. 
</P>
<P>
"This barrio was founded by Peron, it was called Barrio Peron, and Evita 
designed this park. They provided houses for the poor. If Peron had stayed in 
power, there would be none of the slums that we have in Buenos Aires now." 
</P>
<P>
She said Peron had given the workers free vacations, social benefits and 
pensions. 
</P>
<P>
"Now Menem is going to do the same for us," she said.

SOVIET UNION NEAR ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE, SAKHAROV WARNS

<P>
Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov said Sunday that his country is 
on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms of the old centralized 
system are too slow in arriving. 
</P>
<P>
While praising the new course in world affairs taken by the Soviet Union, as 
demonstrated by its withdrawal from Afghanistan, Sakharov told the congress of 
the Italian Socialist Party that some aspects of internal affairs are "deeply 
disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
"We all know about the serious economic situation which can only get worse. The 
budget deficit has reached astronomical proportions of more than 100 billion 
rubles ($160 billion). Economic reforms are proceeding slower and slower and 
people are losing interest in them because they can't buy anything. 
</P>
<P>
"The old centralized system is being dismantled, and that is right. But the 
trouble is that it is not being replaced by anything new. We can say that the 
country is on the brink of an economic catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, who did not mention the name of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
described as "anti-democratic" some measures taken to quell nationalist unrest, 
particularly the toxic gas believed to have been used against demonstrators in 
Soviet Georgia earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The physicist also attacked new legislation on personal responsibility now 
under consideration in Moscow. He said the laws could restrict freedom of 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Russian without notes, he said the new laws were supposed to take 
the place of measures used against dissidents like himself in the 1970s and 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov was elected in April to the new Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, 
just two years after he was released from seven years of internal exile.

DEFIANT SOVIET VOTERS GO TO POLLS AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
UP TO 34 CANDIDATES FILE FOR SINGLE SEAT AS CHOICE IS WIDENED

<P>
Some of the country's most defiant voters, who previously protested a lack of 
choice by resolutely crossing their candidates' names off the ballot, headed to 
the polls Sunday for another round of elections with a fresh set of nominees. 
</P>
<P>
A number of seats were expected to remain unfilled, however, even after 
Sunday's runoff balloting. This is because in many cases no single candidate is 
likely to win a majority due to the large number of nominees -- an average of 
six per seat, with as many as 34 running in a single district. 
</P>
<P>
In districts where no candidate wins a majority, another runoff election will 
be held between the two candidates winning the largest number of votes, the 
news agency Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not clear whether such a vote could be held before the new 
Parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies, convenes for its first session 
May 25. The Congress may have to meet without all of its 2,250 seats filled. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress, the center of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts at political reform, 
is expected to give Gorbachev its approval as president and, more importantly, 
elect a new, more active 542-member Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
Results for most seats in Sunday's tallying are expected today or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stormy Sessions 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy election procedure began with sometimes stormy nominating sessions 
in the winter, followed by campaigning and initial balloting in March, when 
most voters had a choice for the first time in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The often chaotic process "clearly shows there is some confusion, and they are 
trying to figure this out as they go," one senior Western diplomat commented. 
</P>
<P>
"But the number of elections and runoff elections is not as important as what 
happens next -- how much power the Congress of People's Deputies is really 
given," the diplomat added. 
</P>
<P>
Among the candidates already elected to the Congress are a handful of prominent 
reformers including human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, who was once 
exiled to the Soviet city of Gorky for his views and permitted by Gorbachev to 
return to Moscow, and maverick former Moscow party boss Boris N. Yeltsin, who 
was forced off the Politburo after criticizing the slow pace of reform. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the districts where candidates were running Sunday previously had only 
one person on the ballot -- often the leading local Communist Party official. 
Nevertheless, unopposed candidates were rejected when either more than half the 
voters crossed the candidates' name off the ballot or, in a few cases, less 
than 50% of the eligible voters went to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
34 for Leningrad Seat 
</P>
<P>
This time, in an effort to give the voters a choice, officials permitted 1,216 
candidates to run for 198 seats. As many as 34 candidates were running for a 
single seat in Leningrad and 33 in Kiev. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party daily Pravda, in a front-page editorial, said campaigning 
was often more heated than for the earlier balloting, particularly in 
Leningrad, where a dozen party bosses were roundly defeated in March. It 
criticized the nominating process as confusing and suggested it be reformed. 
</P>
<P>
Among those defeated in the March balloting in the Soviet Union's 
second-largest city was Yuri F. Solovyev, Leningrad party chief and a member of 
the Politburo, who was running uncontested. Party bosses were also defeated in 
Kiev and Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
The defeats, especially those in districts where only the party leader was 
running, were an embarrassing blow to the Communist Party. Gorbachev said they 
showed that the people support greater democracy but are frustrated by local 
officials who are slow to enact reforms. 
</P>
<P>
This time, virtually everyone who wanted to run was allowed a place on the 
ballot -- not just in Leningrad but across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Of those on the ballot Sunday, Tass reported, 85% were Communist Party members 
and 91% were men. 
</P>
<P>
Among those running was Vitaly A. Korotich, reformist editor of Ogonyok 
magazine, whose name was put in nomination in the Ukrainian city of Kharkov. He 
previously was denied a spot on the ballot for a Moscow district. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates included special prosecutor Nikolai Ivanov, an anti-corruption 
crusader, who sought a seat in Leningrad, and Olympic weightlifting champion 
Yuri Vlasov, who was running in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanov is under fire by the official Soviet media for, in a campaign statement 
Friday, saying top Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev had ordered a halt to an 
investigation into high-level corruption. In his two-minute television 
statement, he did not elaborate.

EX-WRIGHT AIDE'S PROFIT ON SALE OF HOUSE TIED TO AIRPORT PROJECTFROM

A former aide to House Speaker Jim Wright made a substantial profit by selling 
his house to a businessman who had benefited from Wright's work on behalf of a 
new Ft. Worth airport, a Dallas newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
John P. Mack, who resigned last week as an aide to Wright, sold the house in 
May, 1987, for $13,000 above market value to Rex Ball, chairman of HTB Inc. of 
Oklahoma City, which was working on an airport project in Ft. Worth backed by 
Wright, the Dallas Morning News reported. 
</P>
<P>
Deed records obtained by the newspaper showed that Ball paid Mack and his wife, 
Kim, $170,000 in cash for the house in Dumfries, Va. The same records showed 
that Ball sold the house six months later for $153,000 -- a $17,000 loss -- and 
that a Virginia property appraiser valued the house at $156,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Home for $259,000 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen days after selling the Dumfries house, Mack and his wife purchased a 
new home in Annandale, Va., for $259,000 with a $200,000 mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction came after Mack had asked House Appropriations Committee 
members in 1987 to guarantee $25 million in federal funding for Alliance 
Airport, which is being built in Ft. Worth by H. Ross Perot Jr., son of the 
billionaire founder of Electronic Data Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Perot said Ball's company handled some review work for the architectural plans 
at Alliance Airport, which is owned by the city of Ft. Worth and built on land 
donated by the Perot family. The Perot family hopes the airport will attract 
industries to build on nearby Perot-owned land. 
</P>
<P>
The airport has received at least $31 million in federal funds for construction 
with the assistance of Wright, who is from Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused to Pay Bill 
</P>
<P>
The Morning News said Alliance Airport officials submitted a $60,000 bill in 
May, 1988, for work done by HTB, but Ft. Worth and Federal Aviation 
Administration officials refused to pay the bill because much of the work 
involved private property owned by the Perots. 
</P>
<P>
City officials eventually authorized a $16,466 payment out of federal funds to 
the Oklahoma City firm. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Wright, who was accused by the House Ethics Committee of more 
than 60 violations of House ethics rules, said the Speaker had no knowledge of 
the transactions between Ball and Mack, who resigned from Wright's office in 
the wake of renewed publicity over a conviction on a 1973 assault charge.

EXPLOSION, FIRE KILL 2 CREWMEN ON U.S. CARRIER

<P>
An explosion and fire killed two crewmen on the aircraft carrier America, the 
third fatal fire aboard a U.S. warship in less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
The Norfolk-based carrier was in the Atlantic several hundred miles off North 
Carolina when the explosion occurred in a fuel pump room about 7 p.m. Saturday, 
said Lt. Cmdr. Mike John, a Navy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"Shipboard firefighters successfully extinguished the fire with no additional 
casualties," said a statement issued by the Atlantic Fleet's Naval Air Force 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
John said a team of investigators, including structural and fuel experts, would 
be flown to the America to assess the damage and determine the cause of the 
explosion. He would not speculate on possible causes of the blast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hours to Cool Pump Room 
</P>
<P>
"The fire was very quickly isolated and brought under control, said Lt. Cmdr. 
Steve Burnett. "But because of the intense heat . . . it took several hours to 
cool the pump room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The flames and damage were believed confined to the pump room, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ship, which left Norfolk on Thursday with a crew of about 5,000, continued 
on its mission, a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time, we see no reason to cut the mission short," John said. "The 
vessel is able to continue." 
</P>
<P>
On April 19, an explosion and fire in a gun turret killed 47 sailors aboard the 
Norfolk-based battleship Iowa off the coast of Puerto Rico. Last Tuesday, six 
sailors died in an engine room fire on the supply ship White Plains in the 
South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Paul Jenkins, a Navy spokesman, said it is highly unusual for the Navy to 
have three fatal shipboard fires in a month, but he said that "there's no 
evidence to link these three isolated incidents. The Navy's overall safety 
record is superb." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Miles of Piping' 
</P>
<P>
The victims of Saturday's fire apparently were working in the pump room at the 
time of the explosion, Jenkins said. Aircraft carriers have "miles and miles of 
piping" through which jet fuel is circulated by several pumps, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The America, built in Newport News in the early 1960s and commissioned in 1965, 
is 1,047 feet long, roughly the length of 3 1/2 football fields. 
</P>
<P>
John said the investigators, who were to leave Norfolk no later than today, 
would determine whether to repair the vessel during its tour of duty or wait 
until the carrier returns to port. 
</P>
<P>
The two crewmen killed were identified as Petty Officer 3rd Class Richard E. 
Childress, 22, of Ham Lake, Minn., and Airman Recruit Larry J. Brunson, 19, of 
Akron, Ohio. The Navy said their remains would be flown to Norfolk.

VALDEZ, Alaska

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood came to the rescue of a small, struggling radio station that went 
into debt trying to cover the Exxon Valdez oil spill and emerged from a 
celebrity auction Sunday in the black. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, two items touting Exxon safety raised more money in a Saturday 
night auction benefiting radio station KCHU than Jane Fonda's leotards or 
Robert Redford's autographed picture or other items donated by film and 
television stars. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing beat the $5,000 pledged by Barbra Streisand during an earlier, 
weeklong pledge drive to help the 1,000-watt public station stay on the air and 
continue to cover the worst oil spill in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff Covered Spill 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks after the March 24 grounding of the Exxon Valdez, the station 
serving the Prince William Sound communities had spent money budgeted to last 
until June 30, the end of its fiscal year, by extensively covering spill 
events. Temporary news director Claire Richardson not only covered the story 
for KCHU but also provided reports to stations around the country, and station 
manager Dave Hammock anchored live statewide broadcasts of spill-related news 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Operations manager Mary Beth Joyce said the station was in danger of going off 
the air, despite an emergency grant from the city of Valdez to pay salaries, 
staff help from the Alaska Public Radio Network and pledges of support from 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon offered $32,000 to the network, with one-third going to the Valdez 
station, but public radio officials rejected the donation to avoid a conflict 
of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Autographed items from celebrities that were auctioned off included a book from 
Jeff Bridges that earned $155; a sweat shirt from "Cheers" star Ted Danson that 
brought $100; Redford's picture, which went for $50; Fonda's tights, which 
fetched $100, and a Patrick Swayze poster that was good for $45. The "L.A. Law" 
cast sent pictures and a hat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exxon Items Auctioned 
</P>
<P>
But two minor, once-innocuous Exxon items proved valuable collector's items 
when auctioned. A 1987 Exxon safety award belt buckle earned $250. And a prized 
1989 mint-condition Exxon calendar, donated anonymously and featuring the 
wrecked tanker, drew a winning bid of $200. Each month featured an Exxon ship, 
and March proudly featured the Exxon Valdez under the heading, "Take Time to Be 
Careful Now." 
</P>
<P>
Joyce said the station needed to raise $25,000 to make it to the July 1 start 
of the next fiscal year. When all the money was added up Sunday, the station 
had raised $40,000 -- $27,000 from the weeklong, on-air pledge drive, $8,000 
from the auction and $5,000 from Streisand.

C.S. Harding Mott, 82, who with his father developed and sustained what is now 
the nation's 12th-largest charitable foundation. Harding Mott, chairman 
emeritus of the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation in Flint, Mich., played a 
low-key but crucial role with the foundation begun in 1926 by his father, who 
at one time was the largest individual shareholder of General Motors Corp. 
Charles Mott supported the foundation decades after its formation. But it 
burgeoned when Harding Mott, an original foundation trustee, persuaded his 
father in 1963 to donate 1.8 million GM shares, worth $129 million at the time. 
When Charles Mott died in 1973 at age 97, the foundation received all but $1.3 
million of his $43.3-million estate. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Wednesday.

TRIAL SET TUESDAY FOR 2 ACCUSED OF DRAINING ASSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John L. Molinaro had never set foot inside a financial institution except as a 
customer until the day he and a partner bought Ramona Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana resident had no college degree, and his only business experience 
was as a carpet salesman. "I had no experience at all . . . in connection with 
the running and directing of a savings and loan association," Molinaro 
acknowledged in a court deposition years later. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Molinaro and real estate developer Donald P. Mangano won swift 
approval from regulatory agencies in April, 1984, for their $4-million purchase 
of Orange-based Ramona and its $55 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has alleged in a lawsuit that once 
Molinaro and Mangano were in charge, they began a scheme to systematically 
drain the institution of its assets. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board -- of which the FSLIC is an arm -- concluded 
in a report that the tiny thrift's 57-year tradition of writing single-family 
mortgages ended almost overnight and that Molinaro and Mangano began investing 
depositor funds into a slew of real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona collapsed in September, 1986, requiring a subsequent $65.5-million 
federal bailout of depositors. Nine months later, Molinaro allegedly was 
planning to leave the country after depositing millions of dollars in former 
Ramona funds in Caribbean banks, according to court papers and regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"Ramona was operated essentially as a petty cash fund and personal piggy bank," 
said Del Fassett, supervisory agent with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San 
Francisco, which regulates savings and loans in its region. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Molinaro, 48, and Mangano, 52, are scheduled to start trial in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles on more than 30 criminal charges, including bank 
fraud and conspiracy, stemming from a Palm Springs real estate deal that 
represents a small portion of the activities covered by the civil action. 
Government officials say it is the first prosecution of owners of a Southern 
California S&amp;L since the national thrift debacle began to unfold in the 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Both men have pleaded innocent. If convicted, Molinaro -- sole owner and 
operator of Ramona at the time of its collapse -- faces a maximum prison 
sentence of 165 years and $8.3 million in fines; Mangano could receive a 
155-year sentence and $7.8 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous government officials say Ramona's transformation from a traditional 
mom-and-pop thrift into a scandal shows how the S&amp;L industry was plundered 
after its deregulation in 1982. The case also demonstrates how difficult it is 
years later for prosecutors to press criminal charges against the individuals 
accused of mismanaging and defrauding institutions across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Ramona is a good living example of what went wrong with the S&amp;L industry 
and why it went wrong, " Fassett said. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after Molinaro bought half of Ramona, he was arrested in a San 
Francisco passport office. 
</P>
<P>
Suspicious that a middle-aged man by the name of John Anthony Cook had 
presented a birth certificate that looked brand new, the U.S. passport agency 
called the FBI on July 22, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The man was arrested on suspicion of passport fraud. The FBI searched him. 
Subsequent investigation disclosed that John Anthony Cook had died in 1957 and 
that the suspect was in fact Molinaro. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI reported that a bag he was carrying contained numerous business cards 
from the Cayman Islands, bank records and travel brochures on Eastern Europe 
and China. Further inspections of his car and bank holdings uncovered a gun, 
$278,000 in cash, at least $100,000 in gold and diamonds, and death 
certificates -- all obtained on the same day -- for four different people. The 
FBI also found a notebook containing a handwritten list of at least 60 personal 
reminders, such as this entry: "consider bouncing $ on-shore, then off-shore 
again."

</P>
<P>
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. charges in a civil suit that 
Molinaro was planning to flee to the Cayman Islands in order to avoid 
litigation. Nine months earlier, FSLIC had shut down Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Molinaro was not fleeing the country," said Gerald V. Scotti, his 
attorney. "If you think you are going to be incriminated criminally, you don't 
stick around nine months." Molinaro recently finished serving a prison sentence 
for passport fraud. 
</P>
<P>
So far, FSLIC has recovered $3 million from accounts Molinaro set up in the 
Caribbean after the agency convinced a federal court judge that the money 
belonged to Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro has argued that the accounts contained his personal savings, money he 
earned during his 18 years in the carpet business. 
</P>
<P>
"He had made deposits in the Cayman Islands with money he had legitimately 
owned long before he had ever heard of Ramona Savings &amp; Loan," Scotti said. 
"These (funds) were earned separately and independently." Molinaro told 
investigators at the time of his arrest that the overseas accounts were set up 
as trust funds for his children. 
</P>
<P>
FSLIC alleges in its lawsuit that part of the proceeds were from a $2-million 
dividend Molinaro had illegally obtained from Ramona. Molinaro has denied that 
he knowingly took the dividend in violation of banking rules. Scotti said 
Molinaro actually lost money on Ramona and has accused federal regulators of 
using "Gestapo-like tactics" in seizing his assets. 
</P>
<P>
Near the time Ramona was closed, FSLIC tried to serve a temporary restraining 
order that would have frozen Molinaro's assets. Four investigators tried to 
find him at eight different addresses in California, conducted a two-day 
stakeout of a San Jose home he owned and called dozens of hotels, according to 
court papers. 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro has denied charges that he was avoiding authorities. He said he was 
living at his $1.5-million home in Santa Ana. "I was living there, but I was 
moving about a bit," he said in a deposition. He acknowledged in a deposition 
that he had stayed in several Orange County hotels, but he said "that was for 
the purpose of meeting ladies every now and then" and not to duck the court 
order. 
</P>
<P>
The FSLIC lawsuit, filed four days after the thrift's collapse, seeks more than 
$65 million in damages to cover the money the agency is spending to restore 
order among Ramona's former accounts even though the S&amp;L no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
Despite FSLIC's claims that Molinaro and Mangano began pilfering Ramona almost 
as soon as they set foot inside, the U.S. attorney's criminal prosecution is 
limited in scope and mostly centers on a single Palm Springs real estate deal 
that regulators say contributed to Ramona's demise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attorney Predicts Vindication 
</P>
<P>
To prove criminal intent in white-collar crime cases involving S&amp;Ls, the 
Justice Department must reconstruct a paper trail of transactions to document 
the fraud. Because S&amp;L fraud is fairly sophisticated, prosecutors narrow 
their sights on particular schemes that are more easily documented and 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
"When we bring a criminal case, we want to focus on those charges we can easily 
prove and those charges we can present to a jury in such a way that the jury 
can understand the fraud," said Terree A. Bowers, chief of the major fraud 
section for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Scotti said his client will be vindicated. Molinaro has argued that any 
violations of banking laws at Ramona were a result of his inexperience, not 
part of a criminal plan to defraud the institution. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced and confident that the evidence will show there was no criminal 
intent," Scotti said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael E. White, Mangano's attorney, declined to discuss specifics of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged Palm Springs scheme is said to have begun shortly after Molinaro 
and Mangano, who were neighbors and friends, acquired Ramona. Taking advantage 
of new laws that allowed state-chartered S&amp;Ls to invest 100% of their 
assets in real estate, the thrift invested heavily in land development deals. 
</P>
<P>
It paid nearly $3 million for a tract of vacant land in Palm Springs and signed 
a construction contract with Mangano &amp; Sons, an Orange company owned by 
Donald Mangano. The project was a 180-unit luxury condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee Village was finished in mid-1985 after Ramona spent about $25 million 
-- a fourth of its assets -- on the project. Mangano &amp; Sons realized a 
$3.75-million profit, regulators said in the criminal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
"RSL's investment in Cherokee Village proved to be a huge mistake," Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Steven E. Zipperstein said in court records. "Because defendants set 
the prices for the individual condominium units too high, and because the Palm 
Springs condominium market was glutted, RSL was virtually unable to sell any 
units." 
</P>
<P>
Only seven of Cherokee Village's 180 units had ben sold by the summer of 1985. 
Federal regulators had urged Ramona in March, 1985, to do something, so the 
thrift converted Cherokee Village into a resort featuring eight swimming pools 
and the Tracy Austin Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Better As Hotel 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee Village fared no better as a hotel. Mangano sold his 50% share in 
Ramona to Molinaro in May, 1985, but continued to exert some influence over the 
thrift, according to the indictment. Molinaro became chairman, chief executive 
and sole owner. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government's indictment against Molinaro and Mangano says the two 
men decided to sell Ramona before it and Cherokee Village went belly up. So, 
they allegedly transferred Cherokee Village to Mangano to hide the problem from 
a potential buyer of Ramona. Once a buyer was found, they intended to transfer 
Cherokee Village back to the S&amp;L unbeknown to the new owner, the indictment 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that the deal worked this way: 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro found three men willing to set up four dummy corporations. Ramona then 
recorded a supposed sale of its Cherokee Village resort to three of those 
corporations for a $30,000 paper profit per residential unit. 
</P>
<P>
The men then transferred all of the stock in the three corporations to Mangano, 
which made him the new owner of Cherokee Village. For their trouble, the three 
men received a parcel of land in north Palm Springs, which was transferred from 
Ramona to the fourth corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Even though no money had changed hands, Ramona recorded a $4-million profit on 
the deal. "This would placate the regulators, while simultaneously making RSL 
appear healthier to a potential buyer," the indictment alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona found a buyer and allegedly agreed to loan him, through a third party, 
the $7.2 million he needed to buy the thrift. Molinaro and Mangano then 
transferred ownership of Cherokee Village back to Ramona, disguised as a land 
acquisition of 23 acres in Palm Springs, according to the indictment. No 
mention was made of Cherokee Village. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Molinaro had Ramona's board issue him a $2-million cash dividend 
based on the $4-million profit the S&amp;L had recorded on the allegedly bogus 
Cherokee sale, according to the civil suit and indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Four months before Ramona was put into FSLIC receivership, the same buyer paid 
Molinaro $6.3 million for the thrift but never assumed control because 
regulators rejected the proposed change of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona's records indicated that it had a net worth of $6.7 million, but 
examiners say the thrift actually had a deficit of $19 million, meaning that 
its liabilities exceeded its assets by that amount. "It was an outrageous 
fraud," said William Davis, deputy commissioner of the State Department of 
Savings and Loan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claim Sage Involved 
</P>
<P>
Both Molinaro and Mangano deny any wrongdoing in connection with Cherokee 
Village. For his part, Molinaro said he was relying on the validity of records 
kept by accountants, including Michael Sage of Tustin. "I had no reason to 
believe they did not present a true and accurate financial picture of Ramona 
Savings &amp; Loan," Molinaro said in a deposition. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities say Sage was involved in the alleged scheme. He currently is a 
fugitive from a federal grand jury indictment alleging that he helped a friend 
fraudulently apply for a $100,000 loan from Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
The latest estimate of the cost of cleaning up the national S&amp;L debacle is 
$157 billion. While Congress grapples with how to fund the bailout, it has 
placed much of the blame on the new breed of S&amp;L operators who entered the 
industry after deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the S&amp;L owners, executives and borrowers now being held 
accountable for the collapse of institutions blame the government for 
encouraging new, riskier types of investments that contributed to their 
downfall. "They have encouraged the policies they now decry," said Scotti. 
</P>
<P>
Even regulators admit some responsibility for the disaster, conceding that 
inexperienced executives such as Molinaro should never have been allowed to 
operate thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were an ordinary, normal person with no criminal record and had the 
money, you could buy one," said Davis of the State Department of Savings and 
Loan. "This was undoubtedly a mistake."

DREXEL APPOINTS EIGHT NEW VICE PRESIDENTS

Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. named eight new executive vice presidents as part 
of a continuing shake-up following the firm's agreement April 13 to settle 
Securities and Exchange Commission charges of securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ackerman, 42, at one time thought to be a possible successor to Michael 
Milken as head of the firm's junk bond department, was moved out of the 
department and named head of Drexel's newly created International Capital 
Markets Services Group. Drexel has said the new separate department was 
established as a way of restricting the flow of confidential information 
between the firm's corporate finance department and securities traders. As 
executive vice president, Ackerman will continue to perform much the same 
duties as before, designing the securities to be used in corporate 
restructurings or leveraged buyouts, Drexel said. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Davin, 43, who joined Drexel last year after 19 years at First Boston 
Corp., was named executive vice president and designated as the senior trading 
official responsible for ensuring that the firm's trading activities comply 
with federal laws, Drexel said. The SEC settlement requires Drexel to appoint 
such an official. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen L. Joseph, 46, the brother of Drexel Chief Executive Fred Joseph, was 
also named executive vice president and given responsibility for domestic fixed 
income trading and sales, but not including high yield bonds or government 
securities. He had established and been head of Drexel's mortgage-backed 
securities department, which is being folded into a newly created "structured 
asset" department. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Bilger, 36, Leon Black, 37, and John Sorte, 41, also were named 
executive vice presidents. As previously reported, the three earlier this year 
were named to jointly head the firm's corporate finance department. 
</P>
<P>
The other new executive vice presidents are Michael J. Kugler, 50, in charge of 
government securities trading and money market operations, and Walter J. 
Sieczkowski, 44, who joined Drexel in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The eight new executive vice presidents join two Drexel officials who already 
hold that title. They are John H. Kissick, currently serving as head of the 
high-yield bond department in Beverly Hills, and Burton Siegel, director of 
domestic and international institutional equities.

TWA Reports Loss: Trans World Airlines lost $83.1 million on revenues of $989.7 
million in the first quarter, swelling by 58% the shortfall it suffered a year 
earlier. Sales were 7.5% higher in the three months ended March 31 than a year 
ago. The nation's ninth-largest airline said its operating expenses increased 
for the quarter largely because of higher employee costs. TWA, which was taken 
private by Carl C. Icahn last year, also said it had $16.3 million in charges 
against earnings that resulted primarily from that transaction.

GROUP TO BACK POSSIBLE PAN AM BID FOR NWA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prudential Bache and the Airlie Group, a fund whose investors include the 
wealthy Bass brothers of Ft. Worth, Tex., said Sunday that they would 
contribute $400 million in equity to a possible combined bid with Pan Am Corp. 
for the parent of Northwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The amount the group expects to borrow if it bids for NWA Inc., Northwest's 
parent, wasn't disclosed, although it would almost certainly exceed $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman, said Pan Am believes that a $400-million 
equity contribution is more than adequate, and that it is "substantially" 
greater than the $300-million ownership stake proposed by a competing NWA 
bidder, Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Investment analysts have said that Pan Am, heavily burdened with around $1 
billion in debt, would have to raise between $300 million and $500 million in 
equity to avoid taking on too much additional debt to buy NWA. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's announcement signaled that billionaires Sid and Lee Bass now support a 
possible bid for NWA. A source close to the brothers said they were upset last 
Tuesday when Pan Am said it was exploring an NWA bid with the Airlie Group 
without first informing the Basses. 
</P>
<P>
Morton H. Meyerson, co-manager of the Airlie Group, said he met Friday with Sid 
Bass, who said a possible bid for NWA "looked like a good deal." Meyerson said 
the Basses dismissed as "rumor" talk that they had been initially upset. 
</P>
<P>
Meyerson said Airlie is committed to providing a maximum of $200 million in 
equity to a possible bid for NWA. The rest of the equity would come from 
Prudential Bache, the merchant banking arm of Prudential Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5-Year-Old Fund 
</P>
<P>
The Airlie Group is a 5-year-old fund that had primarily concentrated in 
high-yield, high-risk "junk bonds." In January, the Airlie Group changed its 
focus to concentrate on leveraged acquisitions, Meyerson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meyerson said Airlie's limited partners are the Bass group, a second group of 
investors led by Ft. Worth financier Richard Rainwater, and a third group whose 
members are Airlie employees. Each group has an equal, one-third stake in 
Airlie. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States is a 
special limited partner, suppling about 95% of Airlie's financing, he said. By 
the end of the year, Meyerson said, Airlie expects to have $1.6 billion 
available for investments. 
</P>
<P>
Meyerson acknowledged that Los Angeles financier Alfred Checchi, who is 
weighing a competing bid for NWA, is a member of the Bass group of Airlie 
investors. But Meyerson described Checchi's investment as small and said his 
participation in the fund had no bearing on Airlie's decision to possibly bid 
for the airline.

Greer Garson, who was known in the 1940s as "The First Lady of the Screen," has 
made a $3 million gift to open a communication arts center at the College of 
Santa Fe, expected to be utilized by year's end. The donations include two 
professional sound stages for motion pictures and television productions and 
video recording studios for academic use. "The gift is especially gratifying to 
me because it will bring together two dominant interests in my life -- the 
academic study of the moving image and the professional management of the art," 
Garson said in a statement. The college president, James Fries, expects the 
Garson Communication Center to serve as headquarters for film production in New 
Mexico. CLAUDIA PUIG and ALEENE MacMINN

Crime may not pay but "Vice" does. Edward James Olmos visited 52 His-panic 
inmates in Chicago's Cook County Jail last week to stress the economic 
ad-vantages of clean living. "When I started, I couldn't sing, I couldn't dance 
and I couldn't act," he said. "Now I make $3.5 million a year on 'Miami Vice."' 
To underscore his point home, Olmos told the inmates how he bought a $140,000 
Porsche for $45,000 at a police auction of property confiscated from drug 
dealers. "The guy got 30 years," he said. "I got his car." CLAUDIA PUIG and

Showing violent scenes on a Chinese-language program proved costly for one of 
Hong Kong's two television companies. The Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority 
fined Asia Television $45,000 after receiving complaints about scenes of a 
violent assault on a woman and a rape included in a show titled "The Police 
Archives." The rape scene in particular "was considered by the authority to be 
a most serious breach as it depicted sexual violence in a severely excessive, 
gratuitous and explicit manner." CLAUDIA PUIG and ALEENE MacMINN

An exchange exhibit of works by emerging Los Angeles and Czech artists has been 
organized as a way to bridge cultural barriers. Works by 16 Los Angeles artists 
will be shown this August in Prague, Czechoslovakia, while works by 10 Czech 
artists will be displayed at the Otis Parsons Art Institute here next year. The 
idea of the exhibit is "to promote art and the exchange of ideas and culture 
between our two countries and around the world," explains participating artist 
and exhibit organizer Barbara Benish. CLAUDIA PUIG and ALEENE MacMINN

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE CAPTURE MAN AFTER 20-MINUTE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who allegedly exposed himself to women at a Santa Ana intersection was 
captured after a 20-minute automobile chase through several cities, police 
reported over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Jonathon Smith, 30, of Anaheim, was arrested on suspicion of trying to 
evade arrest and driving while intoxicated. He was not charged with indecent 
exposure because the two women who made the original complaint could not be 
located after his arrest, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the women stopped a patrol officer about 11 p.m. Friday and told 
him that a driver near the intersection of 17th Street and Harbor Boulevard had 
exposed himself. The driver fled as police tried to stop him, and a chase 
ensued, with speeds up to 80 m.p.h., officers said. No one was injured during 
the chase, police said.

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: TEEN-AGER IS WASTING NO TIME BECOMING SKI-RACE EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
For a 14-year-old who someday wants to play major league baseball, Jeff 
Ettinger rides a mean water ski. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he won the Water Ski Race National Championship in Northern California 
at age 12, traveling up to 90 m.p.h. behind a boat piloted by his 19-year-old 
brother, Rob Ettinger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the thrill of it," explained Jeff, a freshman at El Modena High School in 
Orange. "It's kind of crazy going down a straightaway at 90 miles per hour," he 
added, pointing out that the objective is to stay on top the water, not in it. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, it's fun and it keeps the family happy," said Jeff, who competes in 
open class ski races against all ages. "They cheer me on, and it's really nice 
having them there." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is Jeff's true love, however. In Little League baseball, he has made 
several all-star teams and plans to make the game his adult career. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather play baseball than anything," said Jeff, the starting catcher and 
cleanup batter for El Modena High's freshman team. "I hope to get a baseball 
scholarship to a good college." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there is water ski racing, and his family members are 
unabashed boosters of Jeff's abilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff is one of the most stable skiers I've ever pulled," said Rob Ettinger, 
who pilots the family's Toker Sport Tunnel Ski boat, which is capable of 
reaching 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really solid both physically and mentally and wants to be an 
international competitor. And I know some day he will." 
</P>
<P>
But the cost of racing can be prohibitive. "It's a very expensive sport," Rob 
Ettinger observed. "When you figure it up, it has already cost $60,000 for 
equipment, truck and boats." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff has been water skiing since the age of 7, but it was his mother, Beth 
Ettinger, who got him started in ski racing -- well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
"I take an exercise class and the instructor asked me if I wanted to ski race," 
she explained. "I told him I didn't, but I would give him my son." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Jeff is preparing for September's marathon water ski race to Catalina and 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried it 2 years ago and could only make it one way," he said. "This time, 
I'll have a bigger boat to cut the wake and make it easier. I'm going to finish 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
The First Church of Religious Science in Fullerton plans to welcome 
parishioners back to its sanctuary on June 4 after completion of restructuring 
the building, which was damaged during the Whittier earthquake on Oct. 1, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the work consisted of digging a series of trenches below the foundation 
to support six massive steel beams. 
</P>
<P>
So it was only natural that the Rev. Marlene Oaks, pastor of the church, would 
quip, "We're the holiest church in town." 
</P>
<P>
The Brea Fire Department's new $250,000 state-of-the-art pumper has been dubbed 
the "Brea cab" by other departments. 
</P>
<P>
The truck has an enclosed air-conditioned cab for the five firefighters aboard 
the truck on calls. It also has a rear engine that reduces noise, which has 
prompted a second nickname -- the "hush" pumper. 
</P>
<P>
In case you were wondering, engineer Jerry Richardson said the 36-foot-long 
pumper truck handles like a luxury automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Alisa Runstrom, 9, a deaf student at Bonita Canyon 
Elementary School in Irvine, was named recipient of the Youth Achievement Award 
from the Alexander Graham Bell Assn. for the Deaf, an international 
organization based in Washington, D.C. The third-grade student, who has been 
deaf since birth, has been mainstreamed into normal hearing classrooms. She 
wears two hearing aids and an auditory trainer at school.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE DAMAGE TO HOME ESTIMATED AT $90,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire of undetermined cause did about $90,000 damage Sunday night to a 
single-family residence at 5171 Gelding Circle, the Huntington Beach Fire 
Department reported. No one was home at the time of the fire, and no 
firefighters were injured in quickly extinguishing the blaze, Fire Capt. Mike 
McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
McKay said the fire was reported at 6:12 p.m. Sunday. Firefighters found most 
of the blaze already dead for lack of oxygen in the smoke-filled house when 
they arrived. He said the remainder of the fire was under control within 5 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The fire appeared to have started in either the laundry or kitchen of the 
single-story, wood-stucco home, McKay said. He estimated $70,000 damage to the 
structure and $20,000 to the contents.

BODY DISCOVERED NEAR CRYSTAL COVE STATE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's Department detectives Sunday were investigating the death of an 
unidentified woman whose body was discovered alongside Coast Highway near 
Crystal Cove State Park. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death will note be known until an autopsy this morning, but 
Sheriff's Lt. Harold Schaffroth said the clothed body showed signs of "some 
trauma." 
</P>
<P>
An employee of the state park said it appeared that the woman might have been 
thrown from a passing car. Her body was off the shoulder of the road on the 
coast side of the highway, near a barbed wire fence. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Larry Abbott described the woman Sunday as white, about 25 to 40 
years old, 5 feet 2 inches tall, weighing 158 pounds, and with shoulder-length, 
bleached-blonde hair with dark roots. She had hazel eyes and was wearing a 
white tank top, a short red skirt and white tennis shoes, Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
The lieutenant said a clue to her identity is that four of her top front teeth 
were missing "and those teeth were not missing from the trauma she suffered." 
Abbott said it is not known if the woman had worn a denture to cover the 
missing front teeth. 
</P>
<P>
A park employee said a maintenance worker discovered the body on morning 
rounds, but according to Lt. Schaffroth it was seen about 6 a.m. by people 
driving past. Newport Beach police initially were called to the scene, but when 
they determined that the body was south of Corona del Mar, in unincorporated 
territory, sheriff's investigators were summoned, Schaffroth said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was declared dead at the scene.

UCLA RECRUITS HELP U.S. JUNIORS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judging by the performance of three incoming freshmen Sunday night against the 
Soviet Union's junior national team, the future looks bright for UCLA's 
basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Murray, Zan Mason and Mitchell Butler, a trio of prized recruits landed 
by Bruin Coach Jim Harrick, were the standouts for a group of Southern 
California high school all-stars in a 127-99 victory in front of 1,600 in UC 
Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, the state's career and single-season scoring leader at Glendora High 
School, scored 25 points but it was the play of another future Bruin, Mason of 
Westchester, that was most impressive. Mason led all scorers with 28 points and 
added 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Oakwood's Butler added 11 points and had the play of the game when he drove 
through the lane and made a no-look wrap-around pass in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Those three kids are going to play a big role in putting UCLA on the national 
map," said Bob Gottlieb, the U.S. coach. "I think UCLA is a quality center away 
from a national title in four years." 
</P>
<P>
The center who most four-year colleges will have on their shopping list in two 
years also was impressive. Cherokee Parks, a 16-year-old, 6-foot-10 sophomore 
from Marina, scored eight points and had 15 rebounds. Parks, the only 
underclassman on the U.S. team, held his own against a very physical Soviet 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"Before Cherokee Parks is through, he will be the best big man to ever come out 
of Orange County," Gottlieb said. "With normal growth, maturity and strength, 
he has a chance to be a four-year starter in college and a power forward in the 
NBA." 
</P>
<P>
The Southland preps also showed they've learned what it takes to be successful 
in international competition . . . the three-point shot. Murray made five of 11 
attempts from three-point range as the Americans were 11 of 22 from the 
three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Murray opened the second half with two consecutive dunks that gave the U.S. a 
73-54 lead. Murray had 40 of the U.S. team's 69 points in the opening half. It 
was a game that Murray perceived as a crystal ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a chance to look at the future tonight and it looks good," Murray said. 
"I wanted to have some fun in this game. We played team ball, and any time 
you're playing team ball, you're having fun. 
</P>
<P>
"This game was revenge for two years ago when they came here and blew us out by 
25 points. They were aggressive and scrappy, but I thought we were much 
quicker." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, however, were stronger inside. Kahka Shengelia muscled his way to 
15 points and was named the most valuable player on the visiting squad by a 
panel of sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Mason was the only match inside for the Soviets. At one stretch in the first 
half, Mason made eight consecutive shots. He was named the most valuable player 
on the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
"In 25 years of coaching, I've never had a player as strong as Zan," Gottlieb 
said. "He was awesome tonight inside." 
</P>
<P>
Mason credited a trip six weeks ago to West Germany for his rugged style 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
"They play a more physical game in Europe and that was the style tonight," 
Mason said. "This was my last high school game, and I wanted to play hard and 
win." 
</P>
<P>
The game was the fifth stop for the Soviet team on a whirlwind, 15-day, 11-city 
tour for its top players aged 17 and 18. Arturus Karnishovas led the Soviet 
team with 22 points and Yuri Leonov added 20 points.

WASHINGTON BACK, MAKES BIG SPLASH WITH DIVING CATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were plenty of thank-yous to throw around after the Angels' 5-0 victory 
over the New York Yankees Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader thanked right fielder Claudell Washington for his sprawling 
sixth-inning catch of a Steve Sax line drive, a Greg Louganis dive-and-slide 
that stretched every muscle in Washington's 34-year-old body. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't think about it (age) when you're taking off after the ball," said a 
sore Washington afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Washington then thanked Rader for showing such compassion during the right 
fielder's recent personal ordeal in which Washington's 15-year-old daughter, 
Camille, was nearly paralyzed after a freak domestic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's appearance Sunday was his first since April 29 and his first since 
the accident on May 2. He was on the road when Camille was injured and 
immediately flew home to Orinda, Calif., to be with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Washington rejoined the team Friday, but sat out the first two games of the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
"She's coming along fine," Washington said of his daughter, who bruised her 
brain stem when a lamp struck her on the back of the neck. "She's taking 
therapy now, and she's going to start to swim a little bit to get her legs 
back, because she can't walk from here to there without losing her balance. 
They figure the swimming pool will strengthen her legs. In a couple of weeks, 
she'll be up and at 'em. That's what they say." 
</P>
<P>
The first reports weren't as encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough," Washington said. "We're just happy she's not paralyzed. That's 
what they were worried about. And for four days she was." 
</P>
<P>
This, mind you, wasn't your average household accident. 
</P>
<P>
"She was making a bed, doing her regular housework," he explained. "And she was 
pulling the cover up over the pillow. She was down on her knees, got caught in 
the (lamp) cord and pulled it down and hit her in the spinal column. It was a 
big dresser lamp. I was telling her that it could only happen to her. She's so 
fragile. She's an athlete, but she's a little fragile too." 
</P>
<P>
Washington was out of the lineup for more than two weeks, but said the Angels 
insisted he not return until Camille was out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
Washington wondered whether other teams would have showed as much compassion. 
</P>
<P>
"It did surprise me," he said. "Because I think if I'd been on the other side, 
in New York, well I don't know what might have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Washington played two and a half seasons with the Yankees before signing with 
the Angels as a free agent over the winter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hate to even think about it if I was still with the Yankees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was better just to take things out on his former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, who also added a fourth-inning single in Sunday's victory, said he 
stayed in frequent contact with the Angels while he was away. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been real happy about the way they've handled it," he said. "Because I 
was concerned. It wasn't tough for me to come back once she got out of the 
hospital. I was just waiting for her to be released and for them (doctors) to 
tell me everything was fine. Once they did that, I was ready to come back." 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't a bad comeback. Washington's catch was drawing raves around the 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Washington tried to compliment left fielder Chili Davis on his fine running 
catch of a Tom Brookens fly ball in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
"Yours was sweeter," Davis shot back. 
</P>
<P>
And Washington couldn't argue. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a 10," he said of his catch. 
</P>
<P>
It was good to be back.

COULD THREE CONSECUTIVE WORLD TITLES BRING EVEN MORE LUCK TO POKER ACE JOHNNY 
CHAN?; 
</P>
<P>
BIG DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the outrageous characters bouncing around the green felt court of 
high-stakes poker, Johnny Chan may be the oddest ball of all. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the People's Republic of China and reared in Houston, the two-time 
world poker champion is both the classically serene Asian and the boastful, 
heat-seeking Texan. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Chan may rank as the world's most inscrutable good ol' boy. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a lethal combination. As Bobby Baldwin, world poker champ in 1982 
and currently the president of the Golden Nugget Casino, says, "Johnny Chan is 
a fierce opponent and a first-class guy. He's real hospitable -- as kind and 
nice a person as you'd want to meet -- and at the same time he's got ice water 
flowing in his veins." 
</P>
<P>
That Chan, 31, has been blessed with the gifts of both the East and the West is 
apparent. He acknowledges he received "patience" -- a prime poker virtue -- 
from his Chinese heritage and equally vital "aggressiveness" from his Texas 
upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
Balancing the two polarities has served him well. He's been winning major poker 
tournaments since 1983, but in 1987 and 1988, he became the reigning ace at the 
World Series of Poker. Sponsored since 1970 by Binion's Horseshoe Casino, the 
two-week marathon of grueling shoot-outs is the most respected poker meet 
around. 
</P>
<P>
The Series' final, four-day showdown, which begins today at noon, determines 
its new winner the old-fashioned way: through slow, gut-wrenching attrition 
played out in a no-limit war of Texas "Hold 'Em." That's the seven-card game 
prized by the truly big boys because it encourages bravado from its players. 
The event lasts until one diehard has hauled in everybody else's chips. 
</P>
<P>
Capturing the tournament three years in a row has never been done. Even 
"Amarillo Slim" Preston, the best-known poker pro in the world, has only won 
this cardfest once, back in 1972 when there were only eight gamblers at the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are more than 100 competitors waiting to play, each of whom has put 
up $10,000 for a chance to dethrone Johnny Chan. Only Chan and one other 
"mental athlete," as casino owner Jack Binion calls them, have ever managed to 
annihilate the entire field in back-to-back years. 
</P>
<P>
A Cerritos resident since 1987 who also maintains homes in Vegas and Houston, 
Chan is exuberantly confident about his chances, having publicly declared 
himself to be "the most aggressive poker player in the world." 
</P>
<P>
His competitors, some of them at least, know it's not a bluff. Says Dewey 
Tomko, the former kindergarten teacher from Florida who's come in second to 
Chan in many tournaments: "You get in a pot with him and you have to be willing 
to put all your chips in every time. He forces you to play. . . . I think his 
strongest asset is that he has no fear of his opponent, and no fear of money." 
</P>
<P>
Though Chan says he sincerely enjoys the proceeds, he indicates he's not just 
in the Spring Classic for its $700,000 prize money. That much can be collected 
in unofficial "side games" held night and day during the two-week Series. It's 
not uncommon, he allows, for a side-games player to take home -- or toss away 
-- $100,000 a night. "Or more." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the money, Chan is intrigued by the psychological damage a triple hit 
could inflict on future opponents. "They'll think I'm God," he told a magazine 
interviewer, referring to the professional gamblers and thrill-seeking 
millionaires he routinely faces throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
At a side game late one night at Binion's, a fellow player suggests Chan might 
want to rephrase his remark. Though Chan believes in God, grew up attending a 
Texas Baptist church with a Chinese congregation and now goes to services "on 
holidays," he just laughs and shrugs his broad shoulders. Then, finding no 
reason for God to take offense at his boast, he firmly and politely says "No" 
to the restatement offer. 
</P>
<P>
This evening he's wearing the '88 World Series ring he collected earlier in the 
day as the tournament was launched. Normally, he shies away from the overstated 
jewelry favored by many gamblers, preferring more refined accessories such as a 
gold bracelet and matching necklace outfitted with a small Chinese jade dragon. 
</P>
<P>
"Why invite people to chop your hands off?" he reasons. Tonight, though, he's 
having a good time at the expense of the gaudy black ring full of diamonds, a 
chunky flasher that extends far beyond his manicured finger. 
</P>
<P>
"How much you think I could hock this for?" he asks several players, whose 
estimates range from $35 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
But there's another hotshot ring Chan might pick up this year if he makes it 
three straight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victory Jacket 
</P>
<P>
Lakers' owner Jerry Buss, one of his occasional businessman opponents, gave 
Chan a Lakers jacket last year when both Chan and the Lakers prevailed in 
back-to-back victories. If Chan and the Lakers win three in a row, he adds, 
Buss has promised him an NBA ring as well. 
</P>
<P>
But according to many students of sporting odds, the Lakers are far more likely 
than Chan to get championship keepsakes this year. 
</P>
<P>
Says Bill Frymer, a non-professional, recreational gambler who sometimes plays 
with Chan at the Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens: "It would be harder for Johnny 
to win three in a row than the Lakers to win six in a row." 
</P>
<P>
After first asking to be quoted anonymously, Frymer reluctantly gives his name 
and identifies himself as a Drexel Burnham Lambert employee who served as one 
of Michael Milken's traders but "wasn't indicted." Then he points out that the 
competition in the World Series of Poker is far tougher than it was in the 
early days. "Now," he says, "people who enter are up against kids who are 
computer whizzes." 
</P>
<P>
Poker spoke to Johnny Chan's soul at a young age. His family moved from Canton 
to Hong Kong when he was 3, then to Houston when he was 9. He learned to play 
poker there, though he doesn't remember exactly when he sat down to his first 
game. 
</P>
<P>
He has a better memory for dollar figures. In high school, he says, he earned 
about $200 a week in his father's Chinese restaurant in Houston -- plus an 
average of $1,000 in a weekly poker game with the guys at K.C. Air 
Conditioning. All while he managed to pull down "excellent" (B) grades in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
By age 16, Chan says, he'd flown to Vegas with friends on a junket, only to 
return totally busted after blowing his entire bankroll on a two-day series of 
$500 blackjack games. 
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly went to Vegas and repeatedly went broke, somehow not discovering 
until he was 18 that poker was also played there. In his first Vegas poker 
game, he walked away with $20,000. Then he went out and lost it all the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern of regular trips, enticing wins and devastating losses continued 
while Chan studied hotel management at the University of Houston, playing more 
than a few 50-cent games with other students there. But by the time he was 21, 
he dropped out. "I found out there's no money in it (hotel management)," he 
explains flatly, over a cup of Lipton's tea at the Bicycle Club's restaurant a 
few days before departing for the Series. "You only make about $30,000 a year 
-- enough for me to see two cards." 
</P>
<P>
So Chan married Judy, an attractive Taiwan-born Houstonian he'd met on a 
bowling outing, and they settled in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
In his first few years there, he admits, he was relentlessly broke and had to 
take more traditional jobs (chef at a Chinese restaurant, dealer, casino floor 
manager) to amass modest bankrolls. He counts one six-month spell of bad luck 
in that period as the worst time in his entire life. 
</P>
<P>
Though he insists he always paid his rent "two or three months in advance" and 
was well fed because of complimentary food for gamblers at casinos, Chan 
considers it a horrible time: "I would wake up every morning knowing I was 
going to be broke again at night. . . . When I was broke, I wasn't in action. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a compulsive gambler. I didn't know when to stop," he concedes, claiming 
that his ego is in far better control now and lets him walk away from a game 
when his luck starts to evaporate. "I learned one day you can't win the whole 
casino overnight. You win just a little bit at a time." 
</P>
<P>
He also realized he had been seduced by the social perks of the game: "I had 
only played to play . . . just to be at the poker table with the boys. Now I am 
here to win and I am going to win." 
</P>
<P>
Unless, say, he's gambling for the heck of it. Pressed on his spending habits, 
Chan will grant that he's casually dropped $30,000 or $40,000, betting on 
sporting events such as fights. He also plays the stock market. And loves 
flinging dice at crap tables. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appropriate Middle Name 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I get bored and I like the excitement," enthuses Chan, whose middle 
name is appropriately Chi, the Chinese term for energy. "I scream a little bit. 
'Come on 7, 11.' You can scream your head off and nobody cares." 
</P>
<P>
But while the gambler grows most animated talking about any form of betting, in 
general he doesn't surrender information easily. It has to be coaxed from him 
one morsel at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Chan doesn't duck questions, except perhaps for those about his income. 
Responding to a printed estimate of his '88 earnings to be $900,000 in 
tournaments and $1.5 million on the side, he just says, "They're way off. They 
estimated too much. I wish I won $1.5 million." 
</P>
<P>
Might such un-Texan-like modesty be trotted out simply for the sake of the IRS? 
</P>
<P>
"I pay more tax than most people," Chan replies evenly. "I've been paying 
gambling tax for the last 10 years. They love to have me around." 
</P>
<P>
He's also ready to start diversifying his exploits beyond purchasing real 
estate. Chan would like to offer some of the pieces to his "puzzle" in a book 
on poker and gambling in general. Among his other goals: studying yoga, taking 
up acting ("I think I'd be great in a gambling movie") and pulling in 
commercial endorsements for products such as the fashionable Fila track suits 
he often wears at card tables. And he'd like to put that college education to 
use -- he wants to own a casino. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people in Vegas still remember Chan from his wobbly first years there. 
Vegas World casino owner Bob Stupak, for instance, recalls a six-month stretch 
in the early '80s when he and Chan played about half a dozen $5,000 games "head 
up" (one on one), all of which Chan lost. 
</P>
<P>
"I was known as a 'loose' player. I played for the fun of it and I made it 
known I'd play anybody in a $5,000 head-up game," Stupak says in the casino 
coffee shop at 3 one morning after a big-money side game with Chan and three 
others at Binion's. "To get the $5,000, Johnny would form a 'corporation.' He'd 
get $500 off this guy and $1,000 off that guy. I'd wind up beating him and he'd 
get frustrated. People would come in all the time and pop me off. He was just 
unlucky. Then from 1980 to 1982, he just got real good. I played him in six 
$5,000 games . . . and he beat me six straight." 
</P>
<P>
Chan remembers losing to Stupak only two or three times but in 1983 his 
performance was logged into Stupak's record book. That's when he won $130,000 
in Stupak's Vegas World America's Cup tournament, and Stupak nicknamed him the 
"Oriental Express," because he was "very fast and very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't give poker talk back very well," Stupak continues. "He doesn't have 
that bullshit that other Texas players do. . . . He talks from the heart." 
</P>
<P>
As for Chan's edge, Stupak figures much of it comes from the discipline he 
exercises both at the table and away from it: "He doesn't have any bad habits. 
He doesn't drink, smoke, do drugs or get in any trouble with women. This is his 
profession. He takes it very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Chan keeps precise records of daily wins and losses, and has been able 
to detect predictable cycles over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Though he's on the hefty side at 5 feet 5 inches and 165 pounds, Chan jogs, 
swims, lifts weights and plays basketball year-round. He's also famous for 
excusing himself during a game -- particularly if he's going "on tilt" or 
turning emotionally reactive -- and racing around the block to oxygenate his 
brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of some admittedly frivolous wagering, food may be his only other vice. 
"I love to eat," he laughs. "I can really eat." A former 
three-to-four-pack-a-day smoker, he mentions that he quit at age 25, when his 
first of three children was born and he didn't want to set a shabby example. 
</P>
<P>
Though he's frequently away from home, Chan claims he's a devoted family man. 
That part of his life is a mystery to all of his gambling associates. Few if 
any have even seen Judy Chan, including Pat Robertson, a poker pro who also 
works for Chan in conjunction with his job as liaison to the Asian community 
for the Sycuan Gaming Center near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson has known Chan on the card circuit for 10 years. Yet, like others who 
are relatively close to him, she says there is "nobody" privy to what's really 
in his mind unless it's "himself -- that's just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Chan, of course, maintains he readily opens up to his wife, though she never 
accompanies him to casinos: "She doesn't like the smoke and it makes me nervous 
for her to be there." His three children likewise are never exposed to the 
gambling world. He doesn't want them influenced by the environment or to grow 
up to be gamblers. In one of his rare concessions on the downside of his work, 
he confides he'd rather they become more traditional professionals, doctors 
perhaps. He'd prefer to spare them society's judgments on his career. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he'd make his wife available for a phone interview, he at first 
brushes the idea off because her English isn't very polished, then mildly warms 
to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask her if she can tell if I've won or lost when I come home?" he suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Reached in Cerritos, Judy Chan reveals she can't discern his profit/loss status 
and that he never presents her with a daily tally. "He treats me just the same. 
He loves me," she says, giggling nervously. "I love him." 
</P>
<P>
Does Judy, who works full time rearing the children (Jason, 7, Jennifer 6, and 
Jody, born last November), consider her husband a good father? 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very good father," she responds, sounding totally secure, feeling no 
need to offer an example and adding she's eager to have a fourth child. 
</P>
<P>
But doesn't she ever wonder if her husband will one day catch a string of lousy 
cards and come home no longer owning any of their houses? 
</P>
<P>
"He already promised me he won't do that," Judy Chan says, before excusing 
herself to attend to her crying infant. "I knew (he was a gambler) before I 
married him." 
</P>
<P>
The two biggest moments in recorded poker history are playing 24 hours a day at 
Binion's. Both of them star Johnny Chan. 
</P>
<P>
Guests at the casino who tune in to closed-circuit Channel 11 on their room TVs 
can see an ESPN tape of Chan losing the largest amount of money ever officially 
wagered in a single pot ($1.2 million). 
</P>
<P>
If that's not enough high drama, they can then watch him gleefully win it all 
back in less than an hour, throw his hands high in the air like an Olympic 
athlete and claim the '88 World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
There are many telling moments on the tape. In one early scene, for example, 
Chan rakes in a moderately big pot and the crowd starts cheering. He loves it. 
And like a veteran Texan, he gestures to the onlookers to keep it up, inciting 
more applause. 
</P>
<P>
But a more subtle clue to Chan's nature comes during a break in the play. The 
ESPN announcer asks Chan how he feels now that he's just set the world record 
for worst loss in a single hand of poker. At this point, he doesn't know if 
he'll win the money back. 
</P>
<P>
In the sound bite, Chan more closely reflects his Chinese roots. If he is "on 
tilt," his smoothness makes it impossible to tell. His unruffled detachment 
could go down in psychiatric history. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing the same, half-bored poker face he has perfected over the last decade, 
Chan stands before the camera and cooly replies to the announcer, "There's no 
pressure. It's just a game."

JACK SMITH: THE SULTAN OF SWATTERS STRIKES OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I hear a bee," my wife said the other day when we were both in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
I heard it too. She handed me the fly swatter. I am deadly with a fly swatter. 
The stroke is swift and true. It is one of the few athletic skills I have left. 
</P>
<P>
"There it is," she said, "in the window." 
</P>
<P>
It was against the window pane above the sink. I raised the swatter to deliver 
a fatal swat. Then I realized that the bee was trapped in an invisible web. Its 
wings were moving but it obviously couldn't fly. Now and then it would throw 
its whole body into a frenzied effort to escape. It was like a seizure. Then, 
evidently exhausted, it would simply hang there, as if appraising its 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Then I saw the spider. It was suspended, also in an invisible web, about three 
inches above the trapped bee. I lowered the swatter. "Might as well let nature 
take its course," my wife said, reading my mind. 
</P>
<P>
I was tempted to interfere, but I wasn't sure I could. If I killed the spider, 
the bee would still be entangled. If I tried to free the bee, it would probably 
sting me. Besides, I probably couldn't free it from the web without breaking 
its wings. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I thought, what right did I have to interfere in this dance of death? 
It happened every second of every day. The hunter and the prey. I remembered 
Tennyson's line: 
</P>
<P>
 Nature, red in tooth and claw 
</P>
<P>
 It was God's doing. From the protozoa on up, one species preyed upon another. 
Who was I to intrude? 
</P>
<P>
Of course we killed foxes and weasels to protect our chickens, but that was 
different. In that case the predators had intruded on our establishment, 
threatening our own prey. That man would protect his chickens was a part of the 
divine equation. 
</P>
<P>
One does not like to kill bees. They make honey. They are industrious. They 
have qualities that we admire. On the other hand, spiders are sinister. They 
are venomous, although only a very few are dangerous to man. But they are cruel 
and relentless hunters. We are even told that in some species the females eat 
their mates after copulation. That habit has been translated into a human 
metaphor as the "spider woman." 
</P>
<P>
I used to kill spiders on sight. But somewhere along the line I learned that 
they were beneficial. A spider in the house kept even more unlovely creatures 
from proliferating. Some house spiders are even thought of as good omens, like 
lizards in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago I killed a tarantula that was crawling up our screen door; but I 
regretted it. I could have spared it. Since then I have never killed a spider, 
except black widows when they turned up in the garage. I regard black widows as 
one of God's mistakes. I have even rescued spiders from my bathtub and 
transferred them outdoors, where they undoubtedly fell prey to one of their 
other enemies. 
</P>
<P>
We watched. The spider began making swift runs down its web to the bee. It 
touched the bee with its legs. The bee reacted violently, turning itself upside 
down in the web in its terror. The spider quickly withdrew. From a distance of 
two inches it kept an eye on its prey. Then, every minute or so, it would go 
down to the bee like a trapeze artist going down a ladder. Each time it would 
reach out toward the bee and the bee would go into one of its terrible 
exertions. And again the spider would withdraw. Once or twice, it seemed to me, 
the spider got close enough to bite the bee with its fearful pincers. Every 
spider, I have read, is equipped with fangs that secrete poison. 
</P>
<P>
The spider was exquisitely careful, but unrelenting. Again and again it touched 
the bee with its kiss of death. Finally I tired of the prolonged ritual and 
went into the living room to finish my coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe 15 minutes later I went back to the window. The spider had drawn the bee 
to the upper corner of the window, and now had it in its fatal embrace. The bee 
was still, its struggle ended. It was merely a carcass. The spider, as we knew 
it would, had won.

ARCHITECTURE: CHAIRS ON EXHIBIT: THE BOTTOM LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Designing a chair is no simple matter, architect Larry Scarpa discovered when 
he first set out to invent his own version of this common piece of furniture. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as he began to think about the whole notion of resting on one's bottom, 
he found himself delving into the historic meaning of the chair as a symbol of 
rest and a seat of the soul. 
</P>
<P>
"The technological evolution of the chair fascinated me," he explained. "I felt 
I had to express the entire history of 'chair-ness' in my design in order to 
give fresh meaning to the simple act of sitting down. Anything less would have 
been inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
His "Evolutionary Chair" rests on a smooth concrete stone. The crude base 
supports a finely crafted, hinged and folding wooden back and a welded metal 
swivel seat of stainless-steel mesh. The primitiveness of the concrete chunk 
contrasts with the subtlety of the wooden joinery and the high-tech gloss of 
the steel seat. 
</P>
<P>
The work is part of an exhibition, "Chair as Art," at the Gallery of Functional 
Art on Main Street, Santa Monica. The exhibit, which opens today and runs 
through July 19, includes 70 or so contemporary chairs designed by architects, 
artists and furniture makers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've collected a range of designs from around the U.S. that represents the 
aesthetic, functional and formal possibilities of the chair," gallery owner 
Lois Lambert said. "I was amazed at the variety of expression the artists 
contrived out of this simple and useful object." 
</P>
<P>
The chairs on display run the gamut of the un-sittable, the elaborately obvious 
and the almost unimaginable. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Therman Statom's un-sittable $3,700 "Sculpture About Chair" has a glass 
seat and back, housing a series of small sculptural scenarios. Resembling a 
static trash art video game, it is a witty comment on the civilized absurdity 
of sitting. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Garner's $800 "Suctionaire," with its seat made of red rubber toilet 
plungers, contrasts with Jon Brook's sticklike, seatless "Styx Ladderback" 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles artist Jon Bok's $2,000 bottle cap-studded "Folk Chair" is plated 
with flattened Folger's coffee cans. Ries Niemi's pair of powder-coated, gray 
steel "Profile" chairs features facing male and female silhouettes that the 
designer suggests "could speak to one another." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the items displayed have the effrontery to eschew wit, irony, 
philosophy or sheer cleverness for the grace of beautiful simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
Superbly crafted in bird's-eye maple and lacewood, "Canilune," an $1,800 work 
by Massachusetts artist Thomas Stender, resembles a slender new moon. The 
delicacy of its detailing make it seem ghostly as lunar light. 
</P>
<P>
The romance of the chair as seat of the soul inspires several "Chair As Art" 
designers to wax poetical. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been sustained by the magic at the heart of life," declared David 
Rudolph, designer of the "Cloudy City Chair," which looks like a miniature 
Manhattan skyline in maple. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Profile Inspiration 
</P>
<P>
The profile of his wife, Kena, inspired the corrugated metal silhouette of Mel 
Zaid's "Love Notes." 
</P>
<P>
Shaped like an African slave woman with pierced lips and pendulous ears, the 
silicon-bronze "Ubangi" chair makes a socio-historical statement. "It asks the 
question, 'Is a chair happy or sad?' " said designer Philip Miller. "Does it 
support its burden with a smile, or does it groan under the burden of a load it 
doesn't deserve? If you hit my chair with a hammer, it sings!" 
</P>
<P>
The rocket-powered black steel "Time Traveler" is H.G. Wells-meets-Capt. James 
T. Kirk. Dane Scarborough, who designed the sets for Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
new sci-fi movie, "Total Recall," suggests the sitter should "warm up the 
retro-thrusters and set the desired past or future destination date." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urge to Design 
</P>
<P>
The urge to make art of the chair has a long history in modern design. Several 
chairs on display in Santa Monica -- such as "Canilune" and Mark Schlabaugh's 
high-backed maple dining chair -- resemble classic early 20th-Century designs 
by Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh and America's Frank Lloyd 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Mies van der Rohe's famous chrome steel and padded black leather "Barcelona" 
chair is on permanent display in New York's Museum of Modern Art. In the 1920s 
and '30s, Bauhaus designers Marcel Breuer and Walter Gropius also created 
chairs that have become sleek icons of modernism. Eero Saarinen, Alvar Aalto, 
Charles Eames and, more recently, Michael Graves, Robert Venturi and Arata 
Isozaki -- designer of the Museum of Contemporary Art -- have crafted highly 
expressive seats. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the idea that a piece of furniture can be art is simply an extension 
of what the early Modernists talked about in their effort to take good art to 
the masses and out of the museums," Akiko Busch wrote in an article titled 
"Unusual Comforts" in Metropolis magazine. "The new generation of furniture 
makers claim that . . . these pieces can be perceived both as art and 
functional furniture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Object as Art 
</P>
<P>
Lambert has no quarrel with this concept. She plans a series of 
furniture-as-art shows through the rest of the year, featuring tables and 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
"Any object can become art if an artist creates it," she said. "Van Gogh can 
paint a peasant straw-seated chair and transform this humble functional thing 
into a potent symbol. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything functional has a symbolic resonance beyond its mere usefulness -- 
or because of it. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, a chair is a chair is a chair. 
Amen."

A BIG NIGHT OUT FOR PARACHUTISTS; 
</P>
<P>
BENEFIT FOR ISRAELI GROUP HONORS EX-PARATROOPER PLITT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Gen. Alexander Haig wasn't there. He was what parachutists call a refusal. "He 
stood at the door but wouldn't go out," Henry Plitt said of his fellow former 
paratrooper. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, if there were ever a parachutists' party, this was it. Table 
centerpieces were parachutes anchored in beds of red roses. The baked Alaskas 
arrived with tiny plastic airplanes on board. And just thinking about some of 
the great moments in paratrooping history turned this crowd nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the $250-a-person gala at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Thursday 
night was a fund-raiser for Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, a 
nonpolitical organization that provides educational, recreational and cultural 
services to Israeli soldiers ("It's Israel's USO -- it's that simple," said Lou 
Lenart, who directs activities in North America) and for Israel's Open 
University. The evening coincided with Israel's 41st Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A War Hero 
</P>
<P>
But the man of the hour, honoree Henry Plitt, was a war hero in World War II 
and a captain in the 101st Airborne Division who was among the first 
paratroopers to jump at Normandy. Though he is currently a Hollywood producer 
who recently sold his 700 Plitt Theaters to Cineplex Odeon, on this particular 
evening he was unquestionably Gen. Henry Plitt. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, because of me, it's a parachutists' event," he said. Plitt not only 
invited Maj. Gen. Amos Yarom, in charge of parachutists in Israel, but also 
retired Col. Salvo Rizza, who also served in the 101st Airborne, whom Plitt had 
only met earlier in the week at another party. "When he asked me to come, he 
said 'Please wear your uniform,' " said Rizza, who indeed arrived at the 
black-tie event in his "formal mess." 
</P>
<P>
Seated with Plitt and his wife, Sedge, were his son, Sam, who also served in 
the 101st Airborne, and his 21-year-old grandson Henry II -- in Army uniform 
and jumper's boots -- who currently serves in the famed unit. Also present were 
members of Machal, American volunteers who served in Israel's war of 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Few Snags 
</P>
<P>
For anyone unaware of Henry Sr.'s talents, he left no doubts about his ability 
to command. The evening was replete with more than the usual number of snags -- 
emcee Morey Amsterdam had not only forgotten to introduce Rabbi David Baron for 
the invocation, but he skipped over Maj. Gen. Yarom. To top it off, many guests 
were grumbling about seating mistakes. Before his cue, Plitt marched to the 
podium and restored dignity to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
On hand to honor Plitt and for the cause were Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and his 
wife, Judge Diane Wayne; Ruth and Harry Roman; Vidal and Jeanette Sassoon; 
Guilford and Diane Glazer; Fred Hayman and his son, Robert; Frances and Sid 
Klein; Nathan and Lily Shapell and Father Maurice Chase. Norm Crosby 
entertained after dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The event, which raised $200,000 for the charities, was stylishly chaired by 
Ellen Byrens, Beverly Cohen and David Horne. Hal and Cynthia Gershman received 
a special award for establishing a family center at the Hatzor Air Base in 
Israel.

ARTISTS POP OFF ABOUT '60S SHOW IN NEWPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If an exhibition must be controversial to be good, as some would argue, then 
"L.A. Pop in the Sixties," at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, seems to have 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exhibition which creates a fuss, which is what an exhibition is all 
about," said Henry Hopkins, moderator at a panel discussion Saturday, during 
which the show's basic premise -- that there was a distinct Pop art movement 
here in the 1960s -- was roundly though cordially denounced during the panel by 
three of the show's nine artists. 
</P>
<P>
The issue had already surfaced in local newspapers -- in which both writers and 
some of the show's artists questioned the existence of an L.A. Pop art 
movement. "I never considered myself a Pop artist," Billy Al Bengston told The 
Times recently. 
</P>
<P>
Taking part in the discussion were the exhibit's curator, Anne Ayres, and 
artists Llyn Foulkes, Robert Dowd and Joe Goode, all of whom closely echoed the 
proclamation of Bengston, who did not attend the panel. The other Los 
Angeles-based artists in the 80-piece exhibit, which runs through July 9, are 
John Baldessari, Wallace Berman, Vija Celmins, Phillip Hefferton and Edward 
Ruscha. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was thinking about the fact that they were Pop artists, because nobody 
knew it was Pop," Foulkes said to about 80 art enthusiasts gathered at the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us had ever heard of Pop art because there was no such thing," Goode 
said. ". . . We were not aware of (Andy) Warhol and (Roy) Lichtenstein," two 
Pop art giants based in New York, because their work had not yet been shown in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any definition (of what sort of art we were creating) at that 
time," Dowd said, adding later: "I strongly object to the concept that L.A. art 
is regional; so is New York art. That concept is always used to make L.A take a 
back seat to New York art." 
</P>
<P>
Even the widely respected Hopkins, director of Los Angeles' renowned Frederick 
R. Weisman Collection, said an inner voice told him, "This is not Pop art" when 
he saw the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Ayres, director of the art gallery at Otis/Parsons Art Institute, defended and 
repeated her curatorial reasoning, though quickly remarking that the show's 
title is misleading. "I admit right now that the title is unfortunate," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ayres' premise has a lot to do with the absence of the word art from the 
title of the exhibit -- which does not specifically refer to Pop as a movement 
or style of art. 
</P>
<P>
Though Ayres insisted that all the show's artists were at one time associated 
with Pop art during the '60s and that she intends to compare their works to to 
New York Pop art, the exhibit is "not about defining an L.A. Pop art movement." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it is about art that reflected the impact of Pop culture and the 1960s 
as the birth of mass media, she said: "It was about how some artists seemed to 
be responding to mass culture and mass media." 
</P>
<P>
Like Warhol's iconic silk-screen of Marilyn Monroe and his Campbell soup cans, 
the paintings on view have to do with how words, images and common everyday 
objects are seen repeatedly in the media. By including the word paintings of 
Ruscha -- where words such as Spam, Flash and Honk stand alone -- and 
Baldessari's compilations of photography and text, "I was arguing for a kind of 
conceptual undercurrent in L.A. art of the time," Ayres said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, unifying the works was a kind of "strangeness," the curator said. 
"There's an odd, quirky strangeness. Almost a surreal quality." Many exude a 
melancholy, a sense of loss, she said, "of needing to keep one's integrity to 
avoid being used up by the media. That feeling is like nothing we see in the 
New York work." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the clarification, Ayres seemed less confident when asked by Hopkins 
whether she would change her concept were she to curate the exhibit over again. 
While she would probably have chosen other works had they been available and 
doubted whether she would have included any different artists, she responded: 
"I'm too close to (the exhibit) to comment on that. I don't know." "L.A. Pop in 
the Sixties" -- an exhibition of work by Ed Ruscha, Joe Goode, Billy Al 
Bengston, Llyn Foulkes, Robert Dowd, John Baldessari, Wallace Berman, Vija 
Celmins and Phillip Hefferton -- remains on view through July 9 at the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. Admission: $2 to $3. Information: (714) 
759-1122.

SOVIETS MUST SHARE BLAME FOR COLD WAR WITH BEIJING, GORBACHEV SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
On the first day of a historic summit disrupted by student protests, Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev said today that the Soviet Union must share the blame for the cold 
war that divided the two countries for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
"Very probably we are also responsible for that period to a certain extent," 
the Soviet leader told China's President Yang Shangkun. 
</P>
<P>
China's leaders moved the welcoming ceremony to the airport from a central 
Beijing square to avoid a confrontation with tens of thousands of rebellious 
students camped out on the plaza for a third day. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks broadcast on Chinese television, Gorbachev expressed "sorrow and 
regret" for the bad blood of the past and said, "This period has come to an 
end." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, 58, arrived today for the first Sino-Soviet summit since Nikita S. 
Khrushchev met Mao Tse-tung in 1959 in acrimonious talks that contributed to 
rapidly deteriorating relations. 
</P>
<P>
The two nations nearly went to war after border fighting broke out in 1969 and 
have since been at odds over the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, Moscow's 
backing of Vietnam's involvement in Cambodia and what China has called Soviet 
"hegemonism." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that Gorbachev's meeting Tuesday with 84-year-old senior 
leader Deng Xiaoping will normalize government and party ties and help spur 
economic, cultural and academic contacts. 
</P>
<P>
"The way toward this meeting was not an easy one," Gorbachev said at a later 
banquet speech. "It required from both sides wisdom, responsibility and 
perseverance in removing the negative aggravations and prejudices that marred 
our relations for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also stressed that "the improvement of Soviet-Chinese relations is 
not directed against any third country. In the final analysis, the entire world 
community stands to gain from that improvement." 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which in the past has benefited strategically from the 
Sino-Soviet split, has welcomed their rapprochement, saying it will contribute 
to stability in the region and world. 
</P>
<P>
But the summit got off to a rocky start as up to 150,000 people, half of them 
students, occupied Tian An Men Square -- China's symbolic seat of power -- in a 
massive protest for a more open and democratic society. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, in a briefing, said the 
demonstrations will disrupt plans for Gorbachev to lay a wreath on a monument 
to revolutionary heroes in the center of the square Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically it's impossible. The place is taken up by demonstrators," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said the Soviet side understands China's difficulties in coping with 
the students. "We have similar experiences and have lived through some 
difficult times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev laughed and joked with Yang during in the first minutes of their 
meeting. The 81-year-old Yang, who like many older Chinese studied Russian in 
his youth when the Kremlin was Beijing's ideological mentor, greeted the Soviet 
leader in Russian and was praised for his skill in the language. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a welcoming banquet in the Great Hall, Yang noted that "Sino-Soviet 
relations traversed a tortuous course in the past. Today, we have come to a new 
starting point."

Movie producer Robert Evans won a crucial round today in his legal fight to 
avoid testifying about a murder linked to his movie, "The Cotton Club." 
</P>
<P>
A judge who had threatened on Friday to jail Evans for contempt instead upheld 
his right to invoke Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination in 
the 1983 slaying of New York theatrical producer Roy Radin. 
</P>
<P>
However, Municipal Court Judge Patti Jo McKay added a proviso: Evans must 
answer whether he knew Radin, a question posed by the prosecutor last Friday.

Actor Martin Sheen, appointed honorary mayor of the film star colony of Malibu, 
today declared the area a sanctuary for the homeless and a nuclear-free zone. 
</P>
<P>
Homes in the beach colony sell for up to $12 million and give shelter to such 
stars as Barbra Streisand, Julie Andrews, Larry Hagman, Dustin Hoffman, Nick 
Nolte, Sylvester Stallone and Goldie Hawn. 
</P>
<P>
Sheen, the star of such films as "Apocalypse Now" and "Badlands," issued a 
statement saying: "I hereby declare Malibu a nuclear-free zone, a sanctuary for 
aliens and the homeless and a protected environment for all life, wild and 
tame." 
</P>
<P>
Sheen, 48, has been arrested several times while taking part in anti-nuclear 
protests and has also crusaded for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The colony's honorary mayor is appointed by the local Chamber of Commerce. 
Asked if the chamber had approved Sheen's statement, a startled spokeswoman 
replied: "Good Lord, no." She said the chamber intended to hold a meeting to 
study the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Sheen succeeded actress Ali MacGraw as honorary mayor. "I hope that by some 
miracle Malibu will be able to retain its unique qualities," she said.

David Abel, 19, of Malden was pushed from the commuter train Friday in 
Wilmington after he and his brother were allegedly refused entry by the 
conductor because they were determined to be rowdy, police said. Abel was 
listed in fair condition today at Massachusetts General Hospital after surgery 
two days earlier to amputate his leg.

The conductor, Stephen Benson, 37, of North Andover, was arrested by Wilmington

U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis, recalled for consultations with President Bush, 
today accused military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of directing his 
supporters to kill an opposition leader during an attack on a protest rally 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, in a statement issued before returning to Washington, said the 
Panamanian military should topple Noriega, echoing a call made by Bush after 
the attack on the opposition rally and the annulment of the May 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened was a deliberate Noriega-directed attempt on the life of one of 
the candidates," Davis said. "From eyewitness reports and from the evidence of 
the wound suffered by the bodyguards of second vice presidential winner 
Guillermo Ford, the attack was meant to kill him." 
</P>
<P>
Ford and other candidates and supporters of the Civil Democratic Opposition 
Alliance were beaten by members of the pro-Noriega paramilitary squad during a 
rally Wednesday that was called to protest fraud and violence in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said only "the courage and quick thinking" of Ford's bodyguards saved 
him. He quoted witnesses and reports of gunshot wounds suffered by Ford's 
bodyguards as evidence but declined to elaborate. One of Ford's bodyguards died 
in the attack. The government has accused Ford's bodyguards of firing on a 
group of Noriega supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Nor should anyone be mistaken about who carried out the attack. There is clear 
evidence Noriega's goons did it," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis echoed a call by Bush for the 15,000-man Panamanian Defense Forces to 
overthrow Noriega but said, "I do not have that many contacts any more . . . to 
incite a rebellion." He said most people agreed that the best way to remove 
Noriega "would be for his own Panamanian Defense Forces to take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Noriega demonstrators Sunday waved white handkerchiefs and shouted 
"justice, justice" in churches across Panama. The protests appeared to indicate 
further distancing of Panama's powerful Catholic Church hierarchy from Noriega,

President Bush earned $156,000 in 1988 on a blind trust that is valued at 
$998,000, financial disclosure forms released by the White House showed today. 
</P>
<P>
Bush set up the trust in 1981 when he became vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The report, the first Bush has filed as President, also showed that he recently 
paid off $49,000 in loans he took out in 1979 against life insurance policies, 
apparently to help finance his first campaign for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
It also showed that Bush and his wife, Barbara, accepted over $20,000 in gifts 
in his final year as vice president, ranging from a $120 vase from a Chinese 
official to two $75 neckties from an executive of the Coca-Cola Co. 
</P>
<P>
The financial disclosure forms also put at $31,000 the value of his share of a 
Houston barge company, a business venture with Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III and Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher. Bush earned $11,962 last 
year on the investment, the financial document showed.

SUPREME COURT UPSETS LOWER COURT'S RULING ON INMATES' RIGHTS

The Supreme Court today gave prison officials sweeping power to limit what 
inmates may read and who may visit them. 
</P>
<P>
Voting 6 to 3 in a case from Kentucky, the justices said officials are not 
required to explain why they bar an inmate from having visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The court rejected arguments that the state, by establishing a system 
permitting visits, endowed inmates with a new right to see outsiders. Prisoners 
do not have a right in such cases to "due process" -- for example, a hearing or 
an explanation -- when they are denied a visit by someone, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
By the same 6-3 split, the justices overturned a ruling by a federal appeals 
court here that limited the authority of officials to censor reading material 
behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Broad Discretion' 
</P>
<P>
"Where the regulations at issue concern the entry of materials into the prison 
. . . a regulation which gives prison authorities broad discretion is 
appropriate," Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmun said regulations must be upheld as long as they are "reasonably 
related to legitimate penological interests." 
</P>
<P>
The court upheld the power of wardens to ban any publication at federal prisons 
that they believe is "detrimental to the security, good order or discipline of 
the institution or . . . might facilitate criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
Among the prisoners who challenged the publications rule is Jack Henry Abbott, 
a convicted murderer and bank robber who achieved notoriety after he was 
befriended by Norman Mailer and other prominent writers and editors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stabbing After Release 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks after Abbott was freed in a work-release program in 1981 he stabbed 
to death an aspiring actor outside a New York City restaurant where the victim 
was working as a waiter. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott's book on prison life, "In the Belly of the Beast," was critically 
acclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court today ordered further hearings to determine whether prisoners 
should be allowed to read any of 46 publications officials want to ban. 
</P>
<P>
But the justices said the officials do not have the burden of proving that any 
of the publications threaten security, order or rehabilitation at the prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leftist Paper Cited 
</P>
<P>
Among the publications on the list, for example, was an issue of the Call, a 
left-wing newspaper that included an article charging "inhumane treatment . . . 
by racist guards" in federal prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Today's ruling is a victory for the Justice Department, which urged the high 
court to overturn a ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials cited uprisings in 1987 by inmates from Cuba in two U.S. 
prisons as evidence that information from the outside can have "grave 
consequences" in a prison. 
</P>
<P>
The government said that between Sept. 1, 1986, and Aug. 31, 1987, about 1,700 
publications were withheld out of 1.8 million sent to federal inmates.

<P>
Sales of cars and light trucks by the nation's Big 3 auto makers fell 8.5% in 
early May compared to a year ago, when buyers flocked to showrooms to take 
advantage of expiring incentives. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said today that they 
sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 34,847 during the May 1-10 
period this year, compared to a rate of 38,089 during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales dropped 10.8%, and truck sales were off 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The May 1-10 period of 1988 was among the strongest during what resulted in the 
second-best selling year in auto industry history. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives were in effect during early May this year and last. But last year, 
many of the special discounts expired May 11, prompting a buying rush. Of the 
incentive packages in effect now, Ford's expires May 31, GM's ends June 5 and 
Chrysler's continues indefinitely.

ARBITRATION NEEDED IN INVESTMENT FRAUD SUITS, JUSTICES HOLD

<P>
The Supreme Court ruled today that disputes between investors who allege fraud 
and their brokers must be resolved by arbitration, not in court suits. 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-4 vote, the justices overturned a 1953 high court decision that 
permitted lawsuits under an anti-fraud provision of the Securities Act of 1933. 
</P>
<P>
In its history, the high court has reversed itself fewer than 200 times. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, said the 1953 decision "has 
fallen far out of step with our current strong endorsement" of federal laws 
that favor arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
"Our conclusion is reinforced by our assessment that resort to the arbitration 
process does not inherently undermine any of the substantive rights afforded 
(investors) under the Securities Act," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unwarranted Activism 
</P>
<P>
Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, accused the court of 
unwarranted judicial activism that ignores the will of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Kennedy were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. 
White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia. Dissenting with Stevens were 
Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun. 
</P>
<P>
The case stems from a challenge by 17 first-time investors to standard 
brokerage contracts that order arbitration to settle all disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Today's ruling affirms a decision by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, 
which reversed a ruling by a lower federal court in Brownsville, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The investors, some of whom could not understand English, included minors, 
widows and people dying of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mismanagement Claimed 
</P>
<P>
They opened securities accounts in 1982 and 1983 with the Shearson Lehman 
Hutton office in Brownsville, doing business with account manager Jon Grady 
Deaton. 
</P>
<P>
The investors claimed that Deaton mismanaged separate accounts totaling 
$190,000 and conducted unauthorized transactions to generate commissions and 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson went to federal court to enforce the arbitration agreements in the 
contracts. But the lower court cited the Supreme Court's 1953 decision against 
arbitration that permitted a court suit. 
</P>
<P>
The company then appealed, citing a 1987 high court ruling that said claims 
against brokers made under the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934 should 
be arbitrated. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said today that the 1933 and 1934 laws should be in harmony to 
discourage investors from manipulating complaints -- allowing them to go to 
court if they invoked the earlier law.

Israel said today it will unveil an unmanned remote-control plane, designed for 
both war and peace, at the Paris air show next month.

<P>
"The Impact unmanned air vehicle is the most advanced operational 
reconnaissance UAV in the world," said Rafi Laufer, a deputy general manager at 
state-owned Israel Aircraft Industries. 
</P>
<P>
But it also has great civilian potential in its ability to cruise slowly for up 
to 12 hours, transmitting television pictures by night or day to controllers 
directing it up to 90 miles away, he said. "It can, for example, monitor 
traffic and forest fires for much cheaper and far longer than manned aircraft," 
Laufer told a press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
The Impact has an eight-foot wingspan and propellers in front and at the back. 
It can fly at an altitude of up to 19,000 feet, he said.

2 ON EPA SAFETY PANEL TIED TO CHEMICAL FIRMS

Two senators said today that members of an Environmental Protection Agency 
advisory panel that advised on the use of the chemical Alar on apples had been 
receiving income from the chemical industry at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The senators, Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) called on 
the EPA to investigate the apparent conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The use of Alar, made by Uniroyal, on apples has sparked a controversy with 
disclosure that the chemical has caused cancer in laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
Reid and Lieberman said in a letter to the EPA that one member of the EPA's 
Scientific Advisory Panel accepted a consulting job with Uniroyal soon after 
leaving SAP, where he had been responsible for reviewing the safety of the 
chemical. 
</P>
<P>
They said a second member of the panel that reviewed Alar was paid to testify 
on behalf of another Uniroyal chemical that the panel had reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
The letter to EPA Administrator William Reilly said the senators "are concerned 
that seven of the eight SAP members appear to have been employed as consultants 
for the chemical industry while they were members of the SAP." 
</P>
<P>
They added, "Although this information was disclosed, and direct conflicts 
avoided, we are concerned that there is a serious appearance problem created 
when so many members of an 'independent' scientific panel derive a substantial 
portion of their income from the industries they regulate." 
</P>
<P>
Also today, consumer advocate Ralph Nader won a warm response from a Senate 
panel when he called for legislation to immediately ban use of Alar on apples. 
</P>
<P>
Nader said Congress "should ban Alar by name, unilaterally and immediately." 
</P>
<P>
He told the Senate subcommittee on toxic substances that there is now "a 
convergence" of interest between consumers who do not want Alar on apples and 
apple growers hurt by plummeting apple sales. 
</P>
<P>
Nader maintained that the only opposition to an immediate ban comes from 
suppliers of Alar.

Scott Minier, a spokesman for the Marion County Sheriff's Department, said no 
one was injured in the fight, which began near the fourth turn at about 4 p.m. 
Sunday. Two sheriff's deputies who tried to quell the melee were attacked by 
the crowd. They were assisted by two deputies on horseback, who eventually 
broke up the disturbance, Minier said.

Twenty-six drivers qualified Sunday for the 73rd running of the race on May 28, 
leaving seven spots to fill in the final two days of time trials this weekend.

within 200 yards of the starting gate. Stroud, who was wearing his jockey's 
helmet, struck the rail with his neck as he fell and landed face up on a 
grass-and-gravel surface three or four feet off the track.

Former Oklahoma cornerback Jerry Parks began serving a nearly three-month jail 
sentence today after pleading no contest to a charge he shot and wounded 
teammate Zarak Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Parks surrendered to the Cleveland County Sheriff's Office after being 
sentenced by District Judge Preston Trimble, who also gave him a five-year 
deferred sentence, with two years of supervised probation. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to apologize to my family, to Zarak Peters and to the university 
for this tragic incident," Parks said in a brief statement to reporters after 
sentencing. He declined to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
Parks also was ordered to pay the medical expenses of Peters, who was shot in 
the chest during an argument in the athletic dormitory Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Joel Barr said it was not a lenient sentence. "I don't think 
the court went easy on him at all." 
</P>
<P>
Trimble ordered Parks held in Cleveland County Detention Center until Aug. 4, a 
date Barr said was chosen to give Parks time to enroll in another school. He 
said Parks is considering three or four schools, but he declined to name them. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to go back to college to play football," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Trimble told Parks that he was lucky he wasn't charged with homicide.

BENGALS' WILSON SUSPENDED FOR LIFE

Stanley Wilson, the Cincinnati running back suspended for drug use on the eve 
of the Super Bowl, was permanently banned from the NFL today for his continuing 
substance abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
The action amounts to a lifetime ban for the 27-year-old Wilson, who had also 
missed the 1985 and 1987 seasons because of drug problems and is being treated 
at a Phoenix clinic. 
</P>
<P>
League spokesman Joe Browne said, however, that it is possible he could apply 
for reinstatement if he presents evidence of his rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of Wilson's history, this permanent ban can't come as a surprise to 
him," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the NFL's drug policy, a player who fails a drug test once is not 
suspended but can be tested regularly for cause. If he fails again, he is 
suspended for 30 days; a third failure means a permanent ban with the option to 
reapply for reinstatement after a year. 
</P>
<P>
Browne would not say, however, if Wilson's suspension resulted from the drug 
policy or from conditions given him in April, 1988, when he was reinstated 
after agreeing to what the league called "certain conditions." Bengals coach 
Sam Wyche said the day of Wilson's Super Bowl suspension: "Part of the 
situation coming into the season was that it was a final chance." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson began last season as Cincinnati's starting fullback but injured a knee 
and lost the job.

LENDL BEATS SKOFF, WINS GERMAN OPEN

Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia won his 78th Grand Prix title today when he beat 
Austrian Horst Skoff 6-4, 6-1, 6-3 in the rain-delayed final of the German Open 
tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl had to struggle in a difficult opening set as Skoff, ranked 31st in the 
world, used his sharp, hard-hitting base line play to move Lendl around the 
court and often catch him out of position. 
</P>
<P>
Skoff, who beat second-seeded Boris Becker of West Germany in Sunday's 
semifinals after Becker suffered a back injury, broke Lendl's serve to take a 
4-2 lead in the first set. But a double fault at 40-30 in the next game cost 
him dearly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serve Broken 
</P>
<P>
Lendl broke Skoff's serve in the seventh game as he went on a four-game sweep 
to win the first set in exactly an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was hitting the ball short, but once I got my length, everything 
began to take shape. Overall I was very pleased," said Lendl, who earned 
$135,000 in taking the title. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl faced little resistance after winning the first set. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have won the first set, but unfortunately I was very tired," Skoff 
said. "If you don't put pressure on Lendl, he will kill you." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, a Czech citizen who lives in the United States, will spend the next week 
and a half fine-tuning his game for the French Open, which begins May 29 in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been in better shape physically going into the French Open. 
Nearly everything I have touched this year I have won," said Lendl, who has a 
37-2 record for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Skoff collected $67,500. 
</P>
<P>
In Rome, unseeded Mark Koevermans of Holland ousted No. 3 seed Kent Carlsson of 
Sweden 6-3, 6-4 today in a first-round match in the $1-million Italian Open 
tennis championship. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Koevermans, ranked No. 98 in the world, used a strong serve and 
a steady base line game to defeat the hard-hitting Swede. Carlsson is ranked 
ninth in the world. 
</P>
<P>
For Koevermans, who joined the pro tour six months ago after finishing high 
school in Holland, it was the first victory over a player ranked in the top 10. 
In the second round he will play the winner of the match between Jose Luis 
Clerc of Argentina and Australia's Jason Stoltenberg. 
</P>
<P>
In another first-round match, Aaron Krickstein beat Andres Vysand of the Soviet 
Union 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein, the tournament's seventh seed, played steady tennis against the 
Soviet, hitting deep shots and forcing his opponent into numerous errors. 
</P>
<P>
Currently ranked 22nd in the world, the 21-year-old Krickstein has been on the 
pro tour since he was 16. The American, after a promising professional start, 
has been hampered by a series of physical ailments for the last four years. 
Against Vysand he played with a brace on his left knee and a heavily taped 
right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
No. 16 seed Mark Woodeforde of Australia became the day's first casualty among 
the seeds as he dropped his opening-round match to unseeded Fernando Luna of 
Spain 6-2, 6-3.
