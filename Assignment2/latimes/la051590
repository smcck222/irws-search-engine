And now for the view from Central California: 
</P>
<P>
"There is good news for California agriculture," began a recent Fresno Bee 
story. "The controversial Mediterranean fruit fly spraying program will 
continue." 
</P>
<P>
L.A. artist Dave Quick often celebrates the quirky and offbeat side of history 
in his motorized works. 
</P>
<P>
In "Watch Out, Vince!" he reenacted a 1985 incident in which a tarpaulin 
machine ran over St. Louis outfielder Vince Coleman before a Cardinals-Dodgers 
playoff game. As the roller heads toward the tiny figure, an instrumental 
version of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" plays and a voice cries, "Watch out, 
Vince!" 
</P>
<P>
Quick will have several works on display Sunday at the Chiat Day ad agency, 
which is one stop on the annual Venice Family Clinic Art Walk. The most 
eye-catching of Quick's pieces may be his reenactment of one of Southern 
California's most infamous crimes: 
</P>
<P>
The theft of Dick Dale's first guitar from the Surf Museum in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The free-thinking Southland might be the capital of dual-interest groups, 
offering such combinations as the Atheist Dating Service, Single Animal-Lovers, 
and the California Freeway Singles Club. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the Altadena-based New Age Walkers, a group of physical fitness buffs 
who believe in UFOs. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, it sponsored a Mother's Day and UFO Awareness Walk at Descanso 
Gardens -- raffling off flying saucers, no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"In this market, you have to do something special," said real estate agent Gail 
Woodruff, explaining the somewhat un-subtle approach she took with one piece of 
property in Long Beach (see photo). 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is considering whether to set aside part of L.A.'s bed-tax 
revenue for the creation of videos and ads that would promote San Pedro as a 
tourist's paradise. If the port community wants to go upscale, it may already 
have one prerequisite: A snooty French restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
When Only in L.A. dined at this spot the other night, we overheard a diner 
point out that the lettuce in his salad was brown and wilted. 
</P>
<P>
The waiter responded: "Would you like more dressing?" 
</P>
<P>
Another diner complained that her cheese hors d'oeuvre contained no cheese. 
</P>
<P>
"You ate it," the waiter charged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LAny: 
</P>
<P>
Some cities are content to celebrate Presidents and generals in their statuary. 
For a different approach, try the piers at Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach, 
which feature sculptures of George Freeth and Tim Kelley, respectively, in 
bathing suits. They were surfers.

MAYOR BRADLEY'S PROPOSAL FOR MANDATORY WATER RATIONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Mayor Bradley wants to begin water rationing, he ought to begin in his own 
back yard. For the last two months, everyday in the late afternoon as I stroll 
by City Hall East at Main and 1st streets, the automatic sprinkler system comes 
on with one particular sprinkler head missing, hence the water just pours out 
from the shrubbery bed onto Main Street with not one city worker in the least 
bit attentive to this small hypocrisy.

JURY VERDICT ON HOSTAGE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury in Portland found Richard J. Brenneke not guilty on five counts of lying 
when he told a judge that indeed Reagan-Bush officials asked Iran not to 
release the hostages until after the election in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
As the Church Lady on "Saturday Night Live" would say, "How convenient!" Have 
Iran keep the hostages so all the blame can go to Jimmy Carter and he will most 
assuredly lose the election. 
</P>
<P>
All this is not news, except to the "liberal press" who apparently dropped the 
ball on this one. Does the press really believe that Iran-Contra was just a 
happenstance? No, guys, the groundwork was laid years before.

BUSH AND TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Rep. Jon Kyl(R-Ariz.), "The President feels a lot about taxes the 
way he feels about broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
You can put it on the table in front of him, but he's not gonna eat it" (Part 
A, May 10). 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if Barbara makes him eat all the green stuff like a good boy, the 
deficit won't appear nearly so red. After all, a Bush is at its best when it is 
green.

MAYOR BRADLEY'S PROPOSAL FOR MANDATORY WATER RATIONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How wonderful to read that Mayor Bradley is leading the way in water 
conservation "by having his car washed at the City Hall garage" rather than at 
his Hancock Park residence (May 4). Are we to believe that the City Hall gets 
its water supply from some other source, or that the rest of us may save water 
by having our cars washed at the City Hall? 
</P>
<P>
The mayor is setting the kind of example (and peculiar logic) that makes us 
realize how we got into this mess in this first place.

MAYOR BRADLEY'S PROPOSAL FOR MANDATORY WATER RATIONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Bradley's water rationing proposal victimizes the poor. The poor who live 
in old homes or tenements with deteriorating plumbing have less control over 
their water usage than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
The poor will in effect end up paying for water usage by households better able 
to control water usage, households with swimming pools, with expansive grounds, 
with funds available to repair plumbing. In other words, the mayor is asking 
the poor to subsidize water usage by the rich. The mayor's rationing exemption 
for households with new swimming pools is particularly outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
While the rationing proposal might work in a city composed mainly of 
middle-class and upper-class households, the vast majority of households here 
now have annual incomes less than $25,000. Someone might hint to Bradley that 
declining city services and increases in crime and pollution have caused 
middle-class families to flee.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hey, lots of us don't want to take shorter showers! It's time for Mayor Bradley 
and members of the City Council to get more anti-growth. I don't see our city 
officials calling on our federal officials like Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles) and company to do something about curbing population growth in already 
crowded Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of remaining passive to the issue of controlling our borders against 
illegal immigration and passing more laws increasing legal immigration as well, 
our members of Congress should be fighting for vastly increased family-planning 
assistance to the teeming and disadvantaged peoples of the Third World.

VALENZUELA DOES DOUBLE DUTY AS DODGERS END SLUMP, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fernando Valenzuela turned back the clock and the Montreal Expos on Monday with 
a vintage performance that earned him standing ovations for his hitting as well 
as his pitching. 
</P>
<P>
With the Dodgers reeling from a six-game losing streak and desperately looking 
for a stopper in Orel Hershiser's absence, Valenzuela stepped up with a 3-2 
victory in the opener of an eight-game home stand at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran left-hander not only improved to 3-3 in winning his third game in 
four starts, but he went two for two with a home run, picked off Tim Raines -- 
the potential tying run -- in the eighth inning and withstood some more shaky 
Dodger defense, working around two errors by third baseman Mike Sharperson that 
put runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up a home run to losing pitcher Kevin Gross (4-2), Valenzuela got 
the crowd of 28,758 roaring in the third inning with his first home run since 
Sept. 5, 1987. He then sailed through three perfect innings, aided by two 
outstanding fielding plays by shortstop Alfredo Griffin, and got out of trouble 
after giving up an unearned run in the eighth by catching Raines leaning the 
wrong way off first. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was so combative in the ninth that after he walked leadoff batter 
Andres Galarraga, he tried to persuade pitching coach Ron Perranoski to leave 
him in the game, and stalked off angrily when Don Aase was brought in for his 
second save. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Valenzuela acknowledged that he was tired. "I like to stay in the 
game all the time," he said. "After the first inning I felt like it was one of 
those (good) games." 
</P>
<P>
Expo Manager Buck Rodgers said after Gross homered, Valenzuela "was awful good. 
He's the kind of guy who doesn't have a best pitch -- he used all his pitches 
and kept us off balance." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was in control for much of the game, striking out six through five 
innings and giving up only one other hit out of the infield through seven 
innings. He gave up five hits and walked one in his eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
And Valenzuela seemed to energize the offense when he hit Gross' first pitch of 
the third inning over the right-field fence. Juan Samuel followed with a single 
and his 17th stolen base and Lenny Harris doubled him in. Four batters later, 
Mike Scioscia drove in the third run home with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers also threatened in the fourth, Griffin and Valenzuela opening with 
singles to put runners at first and third. It took a running catch by Expo 
rookie outfielder Larry Walker that was turned into a double play at the plate 
to quell the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Even Dodger first baseman Eddie Murray seemed rejuvenated Monday, stealing his 
first base of the season after missing a game during the weekend because of a 
strained hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
It was Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda who put Valenzuela's performance in 
perspective. Asked if he would have let Valenzuela finish the game five years 
ago, Lasorda said, "Five years ago he was five years younger." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who threw 118 pitches, lowered his earned run average to 2.68, 
raised his batting average to .333 and brightened the Dodgers' outlook. The 
home run was the eighth of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my eighth. I knew the ball was going out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gross: "He's hit a lot more (home runs) than I have. I threw a good pitch 
at his knees, he just lifted it. . . . Maybe this was just their night to win." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Left-handed reliever Ray Searage, suffering soreness in his left elbow, Monday 
was placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to May 11. Left-hander Mike 
Munoz was recalled from Albuquerque to take his place. Searage was examined by 
Dr. Frank Jobe, whose diagnosis was inflammation of the muscles. . . . Disabled 
pitchers Pat Perry and Jim Gott pitched for Bakersfield Sunday. Gott will throw 
a simulated game here Wednesday. . . . Disabled outfielder Kirk Gibson took 
batting practice, ran and threw Monday. . . . Disabled reliever Jay Howell 
worked out Monday and hopes to return soon. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Samuel started in center field Monday night but said he expects to be at 
second base tonight. The newest Dodger, Stan Javier, was in uniform Monday, 
wearing No. 5 -- which, he said, has no special significance. Dodger Manager 
Tom Lasorda's first advice to Javier was, "Stay away from (Mickey) Hatcher. The 
last three guys who hung around him went down. We fine (Brian) Traxler for 
sitting next to him in the dugout."

MORNING BRIEFING: FIELDER WAS DEALT OUT BY CARD MAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Cecil Fielder of the Detroit Tigers is leading the major leagues in 
home runs and runs batted in, his 1990 baseball card hasn't increased in value. 
</P>
<P>
How could that be? 
</P>
<P>
Fielder doesn't have a 1990 baseball card. 
</P>
<P>
But the card makers aren't responsible, because Fielder played in Japan last 
year, and the Tigers didn't sign him until after card production began. 
</P>
<P>
"The (card) rosters are made up early and there was no way anyone would have 
known that Cecil Fielder would be in the majors, let alone leading both leagues 
in home runs," said Ken Liss, a spokesman for Topps. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, however. Fielder will appear in Topps' Bowman set, scheduled for 
release next month. And he's is a shoo-in for the end-of-season update sets. 
</P>
<P>
Hungry Man: Mike Powell, 1988 Olympic silver medalist in the long jump, won 
$50,000 in a recent slam dunk contest, beating Randall Cunningham and Cris 
Carter of the Philadelphia Eagles, Deion Sanders of the Atlanta Falcons/New 
York Yankees, Ed (Too Tall) Jones of the Dallas Cowboys and Devon White of the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he beat those talented athletes, Powell replied: "Hungrier. Can you 
imagine how many long jumps I'd have to compete in to match Cunningham's 
$2-million-a-year salary?" 
</P>
<P>
Family ties: After hitting a home run in a recent game, outfielder Ken Griffey 
Jr. of the Seattle Mariners called his father, collect. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Griffey didn't exactly appreciate the timing. 
</P>
<P>
"He called at 4 a.m. (and) I said, 'Can't you wait until a decent hour?' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia Time: What was the United States' biggest upset in the World Cup? 
</P>
<P>
Boz update: With his football career jeopardized by an injury, linebacker Brian 
Bosworth of the Seattle Seahawks is on the verge of becoming an actor. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are under way for a multimillion-dollar deal for a movie starring 
Bosworth as a police agent who infiltrates a gang of lawless bikers on the 
Mississippi Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The part would not call for Bosworth to alter his trademark haircut, and he 
could retain his earrings. 
</P>
<P>
The film has a working title of "The Brotherhood." 
</P>
<P>
No Mercy: The Leonard (Tex.) High School baseball team did not make it easy on 
Chisum (Tex.) High in two recent games. Despite playing only 4 1/2 innings in 
each of the games because of a mercy rule, Leonard outscored Chisum, 79-6, and 
stole 111 bases. 
</P>
<P>
In a 46-5 blowout, Leonard had 53 steals. Leonard stole 58 bases in a 33-1 
romp. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Coach Bill Francis insisted he wasn't trying to run up the score. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those games where you score a lot of runs and you don't 
know how to stop it," Francis said. "Our kids are concerned about their batting 
averages and stuff. They didn't go up there with the intention of striking 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Chisum Coach Mike Erwin disagreed. "Look at the score yourself and see," Erwin 
said. "He speaks for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Add Chisum High: The school, located about 100 miles northeast of Dallas, could 
be in for more trouble this fall, when it will field its first football team. 
</P>
<P>
Brain Power: There'll be a lot of brain power in the women's mile at the 
Jack-In-The-Box track meet Sunday at UCLA's Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In the field are PattiSue Plumer, a graduate of the Stanford law school, and 
Kathy Kanes, who has a doctorate in chemical engineering from Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
Her doctorate thesis: "Biophysical and Biochemical Studies of the Anion 
Transport Protein Red Blood Cells."

From Oakland Athletic second baseman Mike Gallego after the trade with the 
Dodgers for Willie Randolph: "It's going to be tougher for me to get a good 
table at a restaurant now, saying, 'I'm Mike Gallego, extra infielder.' " . . . 
</P>
<P>
No matter how many players he loses, Bob Rodgers always seems to have the 
Montreal Expos playing respectable baseball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It came as no great surprise to those who saw him pitch with the Dodgers that 
Matt Young tied a Seattle Mariners' record with three wild pitches Sunday. . .

</P>
<P>
Recently retired major league stars played a nine-inning game in Las Vegas 
Saturday that was taped by NBC, and now there's talk of a tour to include 
Hawaii and Europe. . . .

Glad they've slowed down the Indy cars so much that a mere 225.301 m.p.h. 
average was good enough to win the provisional pole. . . .

REDS WIN AS LARKIN REHEATS

<P>
Barry Larkin cooled off briefly after a blazing start this season, but the 
Cincinnati Red shortstop is getting hot again. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin extended his hitting streak to 10 games Monday night at Cincinnati with 
a game-winning, bases-loaded single in the Reds' 5-3 victory over the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, whose .303 team batting average leads the major leagues, overcame a 
three-run, first-inning deficit to maintain the best record in baseball (22-7). 
</P>
<P>
Jack Armstrong (6-1) gave up seven hits in six innings. Randy Myers, who 
relieved Rob Dibble in the eighth, pitched two innings to get his seventh save. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Terrell (1-2), who is 1-4 against the Reds in his career with an 8.07 
earned-run average, allowed six hits and five runs in 1 2/3 innings. The 
Pirates entered the game with major-league leading 2.61 staff ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Cincinnati second baseman Mariano Duncan was put on the 15-day 
disabled list with severely pulled muscles in his right side. Duncan was the 
Reds' top hitter, with a .382 average that ranked second in the National 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Paul Noce was called up from Triple-A Nashville to take Dincan's spot 
on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 5, Philadelphia 1 -- Andy Benes pitched a two-hitter for his first 
major league complete game and Joe Carter and Tony Gwynn each hit two-run 
homers at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Benes (3-3) allowed singles to Darren Daulton and pinch-hitter Curt Ford in his 
17th major league start. The right-hander struck out five and walked four. 
</P>
<P>
Carter homered off Pat Combs (2-3) in the third inning. Gwynn, who was three 
for four, homered off Don Carman in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 3, Chicago 2 -- Francisco Cabrera made his first major-league run 
batted in an important one, driving in the winning run with a pinch-hit single 
in the eighth inning at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
It was Cabrera's first at-bat after the Braves purchased his contract from 
triple-A Richmond earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Dwayne Henry (1-1) earned the victory. Charley Kerfeld got Ryne 
Sandberg to ground out with the bases loaded for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Dawson hit his ninth homer and Sandberg had his sixth for the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 4, New York 2 -- Bob Knepper allowed two runs in 6 2/3 innings at 
San Francisco to beat the Mets for the second time in a week. 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark's two-run homer was his fifth for the Giants, who won for only the 
third time in 14 home games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Knepper (2-1), a 35-year old left-hander, is 3-0 with a 1.69 ERA against the 
Mets over the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bedrosian earned his fifth save.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: GOLDEN WEST'S HADFIELD SWIMMING IN FAST LANE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the last two weeks, Lisa Hadfield of Golden West College has set a national 
record in the 50-yard butterfly at the state championship and been named state 
swimmer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe her most surprising feat of the spring was simply swimming 
competitively at all. 
</P>
<P>
Hadfield's career has been in doubt since December, 1988, when she broke her 
wrist in an auto accident. She spent three months out of the pool, the longest 
period she had gone without swimming since she started the sport at age 3. 
</P>
<P>
Hadfield returned late in her senior season at Westminster, but was out of 
shape and not sure if she wanted to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first setback of my career," Hadfield said. "It brought me down. 
It was a tough time." 
</P>
<P>
Hadfield worked out on her own last summer and decided to give swimming a try 
at Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
Still bothered by the wrist injury, which still requires her to wear a brace, 
Hadfield swam inconsistently during the season. 
</P>
<P>
But in the state tournament, she won the 50 butterfly in 25.84, beating the 
record of 26.36 set in 1987 by Suzanna Brown of Diablo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball playoffs: Any doubters of the overall strength of the Orange Empire 
Conference should be convinced after last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the eight teams left in the Southern California playoffs are from the 
conference, including three in one regional at Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago, Fullerton and Riverside will be joined by Moorpark at 
Riverside in Friday's opening round. Fullerton (26-14) plays Moorpark (24-12) 
at 11 a.m. and Rancho Santiago (34-10) plays Riverside (29-15) at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At Cerritos, Golden West (27-12), the other Orange Empire playoff entrant, 
plays San Bernardino Valley (31-13) at 11 a.m. and Los Angeles Harbor (45-5) 
takes on Rio Hondo (22-17) at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The double-elimination regionals continue through Sunday with the two winners 
advancing to the May 25-27 state tournament at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Empire Conference is pretty strong when it comes to softball as 
well. Champion Cypress and third-place Golden West will be in the state 
tournament, which starts Friday at Sunnyvale. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (33-14) takes on West Valley (39-2), Cypress (40-6) plays Ohlone 
(41-9), Sacramento City (41-4) plays Moorpark (29-9) and defending state 
champion Palomar (44-4) plays Fresno (44-18). All of the first-round games of 
the double-elimination tournament start at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament will be a reunion of sorts for Ohlone Coach Donna Runyon. Runyon 
coached at Cypress from 1981-86 and had a record of 152-95. Runyon left Cypress 
and coached for two seasons at City College of San Francisco. She is in her 
second season at Ohlone. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Pickler took over for Runyon and has a record of 123-56 in four seasons. 
This is the second consecutive season he has led Cypress to the state 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Perfect chance: The Saddleback men's tennis team will try to complete its 
dual-match season undefeated, when the Gauchos play for the state title Friday 
at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback (23-0) defeated Santa Barbara, 5-1, Friday to take the Southern 
California championship. Saddleback takes on West Valley at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty excited about the chance to go undefeated," Saddleback Coach Bill 
Otta said. "It would really be something. This is the best team I've had." 
</P>
<P>
The OCC women's tennis team plays Grossmont for the Southern California dual 
team title at 2 p.m. today at La Costa Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The teams played to a 4-4-1 tie earlier this season. The final doubles match 
was called because of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
OCC won the Southern California women's title over the weekend at Long Beach as 
Gina Garcia won in singles and Garcia and Iliana Adame won in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia defeated Zarina Galvan of Grossmont, 6-3, 6-0, for the title. She also 
won the Orange Empire Conference singles championship last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia and Adame defeated Galvan and Kristi Douglass of Grossmont, 7-6, 7-5, 
for the doubles title. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
OCC high jumper Liz Bauer set a school record in the event at 5 feet 6 1/2 
inches in the Southern California finals at Cerritos. Gary Kirchhoff of 
Saddleback was the lone Orange County winner. He had a throw of 56-5 3/4 in the 
shotput. . . . Alex Kreps, a 6-7 forward from Golden West, has signed with 
Idaho State. Kreps, who was an All-Orange Empire selection, averaged 20.5 
points and 8.7 rebounds. . . . Randy Graves, a first baseman at Riverside, set 
the Tigers' single-season record for hits with 71. Graves played at Cal State 
Fullerton last season.

COLLEGE DIVISION: CAL STATE SAN BERNARDINO GETS ITS LONG-AWAITED NCAA BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After completing its regular-season schedule with a 25-12 record last week, Cal 
State San Bernardino's baseball team seemed a shoo-in to receive its first NCAA 
Division III playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Chuck Deagle wasn't about to take anything for granted. 
</P>
<P>
At least, not until he received official word from the NCAA on Sunday that the 
Coyotes will be facing Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
champion Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in the Division III regional starting Friday in 
Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
The coach still has bad memories from the previous two seasons, when San 
Bernardino was listed among the top 10 in the NCAA rankings, only to be passed 
up for a playoff berth. San Bernardino was ranked No. 5 in 1988 and No. 6 last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two real disappointing years in a row," Deagle said. "The year before 
we were 29-7 and last year we were 28-8 and there were always reasons given why 
we didn't make it. You know, like we're an independent or that they don't think 
we play a tough schedule." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise was last year's, since the Coyotes were recommended for 
the playoffs by the Division III regional committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We were 28-8 last year and, boy, it was a shock when we didn't make it," he 
said. "We just couldn't believe it. We were even picked by the regional 
committee but the NCAA still didn't pick us." 
</P>
<P>
Deagle, in his fourth season as coach of the Coyotes after four seasons at the 
University of Redlands, said he was particularly concerned for the seniors on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that bothered me was that I've been through the ups and downs of 
life but for a lot of those seniors that was it," he said. "I knew I'd always 
be back the next year but they wouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
This season, San Bernardino took the matter into its own hands, although the 
season didn't start well. 
</P>
<P>
The Coyotes won only three of their first 10 games and suffered a 17-3 loss to 
Cal Baptist in February. It didn't help that the team had 12 newcomers and only 
one returning starter, first baseman Paul Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
"As a coaching staff, we were very concerned," Deagle said. "We felt we were 
better than that. It was almost like we didn't know how to win." 
</P>
<P>
The team then swept a doubleheader from Menlo on March 10 in Menlo Park. The 
Coyotes returned home and won their own tournament in late March. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the turning point was when we had our tournament here and we had some 
Division III teams and Southern California College here and that's when we 
really felt like we could beat these guys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino has won 22 of its 27 games since March 10, but the team may have 
clinched a playoff berth with its play in the final weeks of the season. That's 
when the Coyotes swept a doubleheader from UC San Diego and took a single game 
from Claremont -- perhaps its two biggest challengers for a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
That is the biggest reason, Deagle said, that the Coyotes have reached the 
playoffs, even though they finished with better records the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"What really helped us this year is we won at the right time," he said. "It was 
a five-way race (for the playoffs) down the stretch and it just so happened 
that we won all of our games. Last year we lost a couple here and there and 
that had to hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The Coyotes have been led by the pitching of Rene Aguilar, a transfer from San 
Bernardino Valley College, who is 4-1 with a 2.40 earned-run average, and 
Brooks Peters, who is 6-1 with 54 strikeouts and only six walks. The offensive 
leaders are Gonzalez, batting .370, and second baseman Ryan Love at .363. 
</P>
<P>
They will face a Claremont squad that finished with a 21-16 record and won the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title. It will be the 
fifth regional trip for Claremont and the first for San Bernardino, which has a 
100-42-2 record in the first four years of its program. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the best-of-five, double-elimination series advances to the 
Division III World Series May 25 in Battle Creek, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino has defeated Claremont twice this season, 6-1 Feb. 9 and 8-6 in 
10 innings May 1. That should make the Coyotes the favorites this time. 
</P>
<P>
But considering the team's disappointment in the past, Deagle said the Coyotes 
are not taking anything for granted. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State San Bernardino and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps are not the only College 
Division teams from the Southland competing in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge and UC Riverside have advanced to the NCAA Division II 
regionals, and Cal Lutheran has gained the National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics area playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. rivals Northridge and Riverside, who tied 
for the conference title, will compete in the three-team Division II West 
Regional that starts Friday at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The double-elimination tournament opens with Riverside (37-16) playing UC Davis 
(28-23) at 11 a.m. and the loser meeting top-seeded Northridge (34-20) at 2 
p.m. The regional runs through Sunday, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, making its first playoff appearance since 1987, has been led by 
pitcher Craig Clayton and first baseman Scott Sharts. Clayton has a 12-5 record 
and is batting .387, and Sharts had a conference-leading 24 home runs and 62 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, which is making its first playoff appearance since it won the 
Division II World Series in 1982, has been led on offense by outfielder Pete 
Weber and shortstop Mark Saugstad. The team's top pitchers are Bill Jordan and 
Bob McElderry, each at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran may be the biggest surprise among the Southland teams in the 
playoffs. The Kingsmen had to sweep a doubleheader from Azusa Pacific, the 
regular-season District 3 champion, last Saturday to earn a berth in the area 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen (32-14) face District 29 champion Hawaii-Pacific (23-19) in their 
opening game Thursday at the University of Portland. The other teams in the 
double-elimination tournament are Whitworth of Washington and Lewis and Clark 
of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a distinct CCAA flavor when the NCAA Division II women's softball 
tournament is held Friday through Sunday at Saginaw Valley State University in 
Midland, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four teams in the double-elimination event are Cal State Northridge 
and Cal State Bakersfield, which has won the Division II title the last two 
years. The other two entries are Bloomsburg State of Pennsylvania and Missouri 
Southern. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge is ranked No. 1 in Division II, Bloomsburg No. 2 and Bakersfield No. 
3. First-round pairings have yet to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (49-19) won the CCAA title, with Bakersfield (40-10) finishing 
second. 
</P>
<P>
But Bakersfield has been difficult to beat in postseason play the last three 
seasons with a 16-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
Three players from Cal State San Bernardino have been selected to the NCAA 
Division III All-West Region softball team. Senior outfielder Anne Cordaro made 
the first team and senior second baseman Tammy Shearer and sophomore pitcher 
Tanna Cash were named to the second team. Cordaro, a Division III All-American 
in 1988, led the Coyotes with a .500 batting average, four home runs and 37 
runs batted in, posting a career average of .477. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge has placed three players on the NCAA Division II All-West 
Region softball team selected by the National Softball Coaches Assn. The 
players are senior pitcher Debbie Dickmann, sophomore catcher Patti Pearson and 
senior outfielder Lisa Erickson. Dickmann was previously named CCAA most 
valuable pitcher and Erickson was the conference's co-most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Edna Olivarez of Cal State Los Angeles capped a brilliant college career 
by winning the singles title last week and combining with teammate Jennifer 
Choi to take the doubles title at the NCAA Division II women's tennis 
championships in Sacramento. Olivarez defeated Julie Slattery of Cal Poly 
Pomona in the singles final, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, and teamed with Choi to defeat 
Christy Murphy and Vicki Kanter of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in doubles, 7-5, 
7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona posted its highest finish in NCAA Division II women's tennis by 
placing second to UC Davis in the championship match last week. The top-seeded 
Broncos (24-2) suffered a 5-3 loss in the final, which snapped a 20-match 
winning streak. San Luis Obispo finished third with a 5-2 win over Abilene 
Christian of Texas.

Tustin High School's baseball team is top-seeded and Laguna Hills is seeded 
fourth in the Southern Section 3-A division playoffs, which begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (22-3) will play host to Etiwanda (10-12) in the opening round of the 
single-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin advanced to the 3-A division semifinals last year before losing to 
eventual champion Kennedy, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills (19-7) will play host to defending champion Kennedy (14-13) in a 
rematch of last year's quarterfinal game that Kennedy won, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia (16-10) and Woodbridge (12-11) drew wild-card games in the 32-team 
division, with Estancia playing host to the Warriors at 3:15 p.m. today. The 
winner travels to Bellflower (14-8) Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Four county teams will be playing wild-card games today in the 4-A division. 
Santa Ana (12-13) is making its final playoff appearance under Coach Bill Ross, 
who is stepping down after 32 seasons. The Saints play host to Irvine (14-13), 
and the winner travels to Paramount (14-4) Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sonora (12-12) will play host to Anaheim (15-9-1), with the winner traveling to 
fourth-seeded Upland (21-4) Friday. El Toro (20-6) is the second-seeded team in 
the division behind Hart (22-1-2) and plays host to LaSalle (12-7) on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-A division features one of the strongest fields in Southern Section 
history with 18 of the 33 teams having won 17 or more games. Westlake (24-1) is 
the top-seeded team, while defending champion El Dorado (13-13) failed to 
qualify for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Championship games in all divisions except small schools will be played June 2 
at Anaheim Stadium. TOM HAMILTON

ERMA BOMBECK: TODAY, A WOMAN'S PLACE IS AT THE MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ERMA BOMBECK

<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when women got away from it all by climbing in the car, 
driving to a gas station and putting air in the tires. Their kids could go to a 
playground and their husbands could hang out at barbershops or bars, but women 
never really had a place of their own to escape to . . . until malls. 
</P>
<P>
Any time of the day or night, there's a procession of women whose blank faces 
are illuminated by the neon lights as they shuffle through the maze of shops as 
if they're returning from a war. Occasionally they pause to stare into a 
window, but mostly it's someplace to be where they don't have to worry about 
walking into the headlights of a moving car. 
</P>
<P>
Malling has become a verb. It's what women do when they see mushrooms growing 
out of the bathroom carpet. It's what they do when their husbands are watching 
38 consecutive hours of football and they feel a desperate need to see some 
form of life. It's the only activity that seems to help when MTV has them 
talking to the toaster. Malling is a lot like cruising without a car. 
</P>
<P>
I mall every weekend. I know when the plants there are too dry and need 
watering. I know how many times the same store goes out of business and when 
"Final Sale" really means final. I know how many candles I can inhale before I 
pass out and when the pet shop needs to change the sand in the litter boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, I even know Victoria's Secret. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not the only mallie. There's a whole city of us who don't know one another 
by name but who are drawn to this retreat just to get away from the routine at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Some mallies start off their day walking or jogging. They have a little 
breakfast, sit on the benches and read the paper, and then break for lunch. 
Sometimes they go home to shower and then return in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, if it weren't for checking their mail at home, there would be no 
reason to leave a mall. Everything is there . . . dentists, doctors, lawyers, 
accountants, food, clothing, florists, bookstores and social activities. 
</P>
<P>
Future anthropologists will undoubtedly poke through the remains of shoe 
stores, card shops and wicker furniture emporiums and wonder what we did in 
these huge indoor tunnels. They probably won't begin to understand why we got 
in our cars, drove to a parking lot the size of Maryland and malled away our 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
They'll never know it was our Main Street, our front porch after dinner, our 
favorite soda fountain, our town's only street light that beckoned us.

JOURNEY THROUGH GENIUS: THE GREAT THEOREMS OF MATHEMATICS BY WILLIAM DUNHAM 
JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS $19.95, 300 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DEMBART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reviewing a book a week doesn't allow much time to stop and dawdle, but 
"Journey Through Genius" is one that I wanted to savor for a while. It's a very 
special math book, as good as any popular book in the subject sincT. Bell wrote 
"Men of Mathematics" in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
There's probably no such thing as a math book for people who don't like 
mathematics, but "Journey Through Genius" comes close. William Dunham, a 
mathematician at Hanover College in Indiana, has written an inspired piece of 
intellectual history that explains a dozen of the greatest theorems in the 
history of mathematics, placing them in their historical contexts in the larger 
world as well as in the narrower world of pure thought. 
</P>
<P>
For example, his chapter on Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem ("In a 
right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares 
of the other two sides") gives a rounded synopsis of the history of mathematics 
and the history of Greece before turning to Euclid, geometry and right 
triangles. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the Pythagorean theorem, which is the 47th proposition in the first 
book of Euclid's "Elements," Dunham marches straight through the first 46 
propositions, arguing that the 47th is the emotional climax, the theorem to 
which all the others point. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the chapter on Isaac Newton, which includes a terrific description 
of Newton's approximation of pi, begins by placing Newton in the same century 
as Cervantes and Shakespeare, as well as Galileo, Descartes, Pascal and Fermat. 
Logarithms were perfected and introduced just before Newton was born in 1642. 
</P>
<P>
(The book has a welcome paragraph on logarithms. We who take pocket calculators 
and computers for granted should recall this early and very successful method 
for speeding up arithmetic. A century later, Pierre-Simon Laplace observed that 
logarithms "by shortening the labors doubled the life of the astronomer." By 
what factor have computers lengthened scientists' lives today?) 
</P>
<P>
Dunham's project is to treat mathematics like an art form: Just as great 
novels, great symphonies and great paintings are the objects of study in 
appreciating literature, music and art, theorems are the appropriate objects of 
study in appreciating mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
When he describes the actual proof of the theorem, the timeless logical insight 
that solved a problem in pure thought, Dunham's descriptions are crystal clear. 
Not all of them are easy (Cardano and the solution of the cube and Cantor's 
investigation of the transfinite realm, for example). 
</P>
<P>
But they all reward effort. They are written for interested, non-specialist 
readers -- preferably those who enjoyed high school math and remember some of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Dunham notes that mathematics is built on the twin pillars of arithmetic and 
geometry -- numbers and space -- and they have alternately held sway as long as 
people have thought about such things. As a result, the book embraces geometry 
(Archimedes' "On the Sphere and the Cylinder") and numbers (Euler's number 
theory). In each case, Dunham lucidly describes the problem and then equally 
lucidly presents the ingenious solution. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike any other sphere of human inquiry, the truths of mathematics, once 
proved, are proved forever. They do not rest on experiment or judgment or 
opinion. They rest on naked logic. 
</P>
<P>
In general, we think of Greek science as quaint, if anything, but we read 
Euclid with awe. Twenty-three centuries later, its beauty is still compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Dunham's book captures and conveys the power behind mathematical proof. 
Mathematics is the science of pure thought. I shudder to think it. 
</P>
<P>
The book contains a fair amount about the characters who do mathematics. It 
takes a special kind of person to muck about in naked logic, and these 
peculiarities sometimes manifest themselves in other aspects of mathematicians' 
lives. They tend to be odd people. 
</P>
<P>
But most important is their work. Having opened up for examination a dozen 
great theorems, Dunham wonders what about them makes them great and concludes, 
with G. H. Hardy, that they possess "economy, inevitability and 
unexpectedness." 
</P>
<P>
In that sense, too, mathematics is like art. The combination of inevitability 
and unexpectedness packs unbeatable emotional appeal. 
</P>
<P>
OK. So this isn't a book for everyone. I wish it were. But for those who like 
this sort of thing, this book is a gem. 
</P>

TENSION HEADACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON, Neil Solomon is the author of Sick &amp; Tired of Being 
Sick &amp; Tired, Wynwood Press. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I know from my own experience that psychological factors, such as 
anxiety, can cause tension headaches. Is this possible? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Poor posture can trigger tension headaches. 
</P>
<P>
Slouching, for example, may force the body out of alignment so the head and 
neck muscles contract. When you are sitting, try to keep your shoulders back 
with your head erect and your feet flat on the floor. If you have to remain 
seated for an extended period of time, try changing your position. Stretch your 
arms above your head or rotate your shoulders in a circular fashion. Also, 
lower your head slowly to one side, then do the same to the other side. 
Rotating your head slowly, both clockwise and then counterclockwise, may also 
be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
Even sleeping in an unusual position can trigger a headache by stiffening the 
head and neck muscles, causing them to contract. Whether you sleep on your back 
or on your side, your head, neck and spine should be aligned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box 36184, 
Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. Solomon cannot give personal replies but will answer 
as many questions as possible in his column.

'TELEVISED TEXTS': A NEW WAVE FROM HOLZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the 1990 Venice Biennale opens to the public next week, the United States 
Pavilion will be filled with the flashing signs and chiseled sarcophagi of 
Jenny Holzer, the only woman to represent the U.S. in the exhibition's 93-year 
history and an artist for whom poetic language can be a visual form of unusual 
power. 
</P>
<P>
As an adjunct to this venerable international exhibition, Holzer also has 
produced a group of disarming television spots, ranging in length from 10 
seconds to 15 seconds, for local broadcast in Italy. Those who'd rather not 
brave the Biennale's throngs can still see Holzer's art merely by staying home 
and turning on the television. And so, in fact, can residents of Los Angeles. 
In an adventurous programming move, the Long Beach Museum of Art has undertaken 
to air a variety of Holzer's spots on KCOP-TV Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
This on-air exhibition, which was scheduled to begin in the wee hours this 
morning and continue at various times through Saturday, is one component of a 
group show at the museum called "Video Poetics." Featuring videotapes by Dara 
Birnbaum, Gary Hill, Scott Rankin, Steina Vasulka and six other artists, 
together with an interactive videodisc installation by Bill Seaman, the museum 
presentation seeks to examine the ways in which numerous artists have exploited 
correspondences between poetic form and the structure, language and electronic 
time of video. 
</P>
<P>
Sent out over the public airwaves, Holzer's "Televised Texts" constitute the 
public art component of the museum show. Like not a few other public art 
projects, this one generated a bit of nervous controversy even before it saw 
the light of day. Initially, the Long Beach Museum had purchased time during 
regular commercial and program breaks on two local stations, not one. At the 
11th hour, KTLA-TV Channel 5 changed its mind and pulled the plug on "Televised 
Texts." 
</P>
<P>
Both stations had informed the museum that sponsor identification tags would 
have to be appended to the spots, which Holzer agreed to allow and exhibition 
curator Michael Nash added. According to Nash, KTLA also explained that it had 
decided not to sell the air-time because the content of the spots was found to 
be "too provocative to meet commercial broadcast standards." 
</P>
<P>
KTLA broadcast standards administrator Roger Field said, "In a few spots they 
had utilized what we would consider subliminal perception," which he described 
as an attempt to convey information below the normal level of audience 
awareness. "There was some questionable material in some of the commercials," 
Field added, which he believed might offend some viewers. He did not identify 
what that material was. 
</P>
<P>
Having seen all the spots, it's hard to imagine what could possibly offend. 
Whatever the case, kudos to KCOP for pressing ahead with this bold and 
refreshing incitement to independent thought. 
</P>
<P>
Holzer uses a variety of simple formats for her brief spots (many of which, 
incidentally, were created in 1989 for cablecast on MTV). Words, singly or 
clustered, emerge from or disappear into the blackness of a blank screen, or 
the fuzzy "snow" of static. Occasionally, the words flip up, like flash cards. 
Some are silent, some feature voice-over, and some are given an air of urgency 
by jangling bells and whistles. A few texts trail a phosphorescent glow, like a 
comet in the night sky. 
</P>
<P>
Holzer's phrases are printed in upper-case white letters, without punctuation. 
As a result, they read less like firm statements or pointed questions than 
passing "thoughts." Those thoughts are wide-ranging and diverse. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 24 different aphorisms that will appear on KCOP, most of them 
familiar from the artist's earlier signboards and carved benches and 
sarcophagi, are these, which will be slipped in between ads for detergent and 
laxatives, the evening news and new-car showrooms: 
</P>
<P>
* PROTECT ME FROM WHAT I WANT 
</P>
<P>
* EXPIRING FOR LOVE IS BEAUTIFUL BUT STUPID 
</P>
<P>
* IT'S A GIFT TO THE WORLD NOT TO HAVE BABIES 
</P>
<P>
* RAISE BOYS AND GIRLS THE SAME WAY 
</P>
<P>
* ABUSE OF POWER COMES AS NO SURPRISE 
</P>
<P>
* PRIVATE PROPERTY CREATED CRIME 
</P>
<P>
* YOU ARE TRAPPED ON THE EARTH SO YOU WILL EXPLODE 
</P>
<P>
* SLIPPING INTO MADNESS IS GOOD FOR THE SAKE OF COMPARISON 
</P>
<P>
The most intriguing aspect of Holzer's assorted texts will not be found in what 
they tell you, but in what they withhold. Whose voice is speaking in these 
aphorisms? Many of the phrases seem to contradict each other. Tone varies 
widely. The style of writing changes from one to the next. 
</P>
<P>
As they flash by on the screen, these TV texts seem the utterances of a host of 
different people: teacher, psychiatrist, ideologue, huckster, philosopher, 
comedian, crank, technician, madman, novelist. Accustomed to the singularly 
expressive voice of "artist," we get thrown for a loop in the face of this 
seeming crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The most potent content of Holzer's art is its steadfast refusal to succumb to 
homogenization, to the collective forces of contemporary culture that seek to 
pigeon-hole people and degrade human differences into a lowest common 
denominator. This central feature of her work might well be what disturbed, 
consciously or not, the broadcast standards department at KTLA. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcast television is, after all, the great and all-pervasive homogenizer of 
modern life. Its programming relentlessly disintegrates difference in a 
continuing effort to sell the largest possible audience to an advertiser. 
Accustomed to speaking with the singular, bland voice of "commercial 
television," a station might easily be thrown for a loop by Jenny Holzer's 
uncooperative rabble. 
</P>
<P>
"Jenny Holzer: Televised Texts" may be seen daily through May 19 on KCOP 
Channel 13. Spots air today at approximately 11:13 a.m. and 12:15 p.m., and at 
1:45, 2:32 and 3:10 a.m.; actual airplay may occur up to 10 minutes before or 
after the times listed.

IAN HOBSON PLAYS CLEMENTI, ET AL., IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That group of budding Romantics from across Europe, working in England at the 
cusp of the 18th and 19th centuries, has recently been dubbed the London School 
of piano-playing. The music produced by this group -- by Clementi, Field, 
Pinto, Weber, Sterndale Bennett and Moscheles, among others -- is as 
fascinating as the appellation. 
</P>
<P>
Some of it was exposed on Ian Hobson's splendid recital on the Chamber Music in 
Historic Sites series, Sunday. The prize-winning British pianist who teaches in 
Illinois has been absent from Los Angeles for the better part of a decade. We 
deserve to hear his elegant brand of pianism more often. 
</P>
<P>
His compact but generous program offered worthy sonatas by Dussek, Field and 
Clementi, six of the 84 etudes written by John Baptist Cramer, and shorter 
pieces. If one never felt completely engaged by Hobson's musical concentration 
-- forgiving listeners might say his mind was wandering on this idyllic 
afternoon in a 75-year old mansion (the Tod Ford house) overlooking the Arroyo 
-- his expertise and authority were never in question. 
</P>
<P>
A half-dozen of the "Studios per il pianoforte" by the German pianist, composer 
and publisher, Cramer, proved the most colorful of these unfamiliar works. 
</P>
<P>
Of passionate temperament and Romantic bent, these pieces, written in 1804, 
look forward to comparable morceaux written 30 years later by Schumann and 
Mendelssohn. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly warm-blooded, Dussek's "Farewell" Sonata displayed melodic and 
architectonic qualities which ought to be aired more frequently. One felt the 
same about Clementi's spare and serious F-minor Sonata (Opus 13, No. 6), which, 
like most of that composer's later works, deserves a wider broadcast than it 
has heretofore received. 
</P>
<P>
Technically alert and musically astute, the 37-year old Hobson performed all 
these pieces carefully and conscientiously. At the end of the program, he 
finally had some fun, in a most charming performance of the irresistible, 
two-movement, E-flat Sonata by John Field. After that, he offered a single 
encore in Moscheles' Romance and Tarantella.DANIEL CARIAGA

CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calligraphy may seem an unlikely basis for a particularly vivid, dramatic 
performance art. But the centerpiece of the opening Chamber Music/LA concert, 
Sunday afternoon at the Japan America Theatre, proved an attention-getting 
exercise in something like mutant ninja lettering. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the five festival programs this year is built around the local premiere 
of a contemporary Japanese work. For the opening it was Isao Matsushita's 
"Kizuna," which pits a percussion/Japanese flute duo against a string 
bass/piano pair. Bridging the large cultural -- and spatial, in this 
performance -- gap between East and West was a wide, three-panel screen, on 
which Shioh Kato worked his surprisingly violent calligraphic will. 
</P>
<P>
The portentous, evocative music was ably delivered by flutist Michiko Akao, on 
the yokobue, percussionist Shinichi Ueno, bassist Buell Neidlinger, and pianist 
Shunsuke Kurakata. Matsushita's score suggested its own musical commonalty, in 
shared rhetorical, quasi-improvised gestures. 
</P>
<P>
The instrumental outbursts and mutterings, however, were quickly reduced to 
accompaniment by the commanding presence of Kato. Working with large, dripping 
brushes, he attacked the screen with explosive shouts, drawing three symbols -- 
said to represent "flying in the universe" -- as a wrenching act of creative 
will. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Matsushita's "Kaze-no-rosho" is understated, though on its own 
terms this solo for Japanese flute, introduced locally by Akao two years ago, 
is equally convulsive. Akao delivered it again with centered strength and a 
wealth of inflective nuance. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's Septet occupied the second half of this generous program, in a 
sparkling, balanced, suave account. Violinist and festival artistic director 
Yukiko Kamei led the pert and pertinent effort, convincingly seconded by 
clarinetist Gary Gray, bassoonist Kenneth Munday, hornist Richard Todd, violist 
Milton Thomas, cellist Sumiko Kurata and bassist Neidlinger. 
</P>
<P>
For the opener, violinist Paul Rosenthal led Kamei, Thomas and Kurata in a 
steely performance of Haydn's D-minor Quartet, Opus 76, No. 2. Rosenthal's 
sound was smooth and invariably louder than anything else, and his fingers more 
than adequate to the challenges, but he often put himself out in front of the 
ensemble in time as well as volume.JOHN HENKEN

the news reader on "Today," according to sources at the network, and is 
expected to sign her today. Daniels has been co-anchor on CBS News' "Morning 
News." NBC denied rumors last week that "Today" co-anchor Deborah Norville, who 
previously had been the show's news reader, was in danger of being replaced due 
to sagging ratings. GREG BRAXTON

NBC Called on Clay: Phones were ringing off the hook at NBC's Burbank and New 
York offices after the appearence of comedy bad boy Andrew Dice Clay on 
"Saturday Night Live." The two offices received 1,764 calls against Clay and 
198 in his favor in what was probably the highest number of pre-show protests 
in the program's 15-year history, NBC officials said. Clay apparently brought 
its largest audience all season -- an 11.6 rating and a 31% share of the 
audience in the 24-city overnight Nielsens, NBC said. GREG BRAXTON

2 Live Crew in Court: The debate over whether the lyrics of a recording by the 
million-selling rap group 2 Live Crew are obscene moved to a higher level 
Monday with the issue's first airing in federal court in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. 
U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez was asked to determine whether "As Nasty as 
They Wanna Be," which has been removed from store shelves in several Florida 
counties, should also be banned in Broward County. The first witness to 
testify, Broward Detective Sgt. Mark Wichner, said he found the recording 
"explicit and degrading to the female sex." GREG BRAXTON

JENKINS COMPANY OFFERS REVELATION AT CSLA

<TEXT>

Blunted ballet mixed with classical modern dance, gestures of suppressed 
emotion, popular songs used ironically, taped text, film and video, sexual 
ambiguity, personal detachment, and social alienation. The elements were 
familiar, but the performance of the Margaret Jenkins Dance Company seen 
Saturday at Cal State L.A. was a revelation of concentration and beautifully 
executed movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Rollback" played a drama of desolation against the lore of the Southwest, with 
film of lone Western riders (one upside down) and Terry Allen's 
Spanish-inflected score featuring "Home on the Range" in English and in French. 
</P>
<P>
A bright, bouncy Tharpian opening gave way to Tharpian lyricism alternating 
with Tharpian propulsion. Solitude was the underlying reality, and Anne Krauss 
summed it up when she blew across her palm at the audience (a recurring motif 
of dismissal) and danced off alone into the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Ellie Klopp and Jesse Traschen made contact but never connected in "Miss Jacobi 
Weeps," (music by Miguel Frasconi), a survey of the standoff of the sexes. 
Sweeping, elastic movement reached outward, but the gaze turned inward. Moments 
of tenderness were spurned or dissipated in this pas de deux of blank despair. 
</P>
<P>
"Woman Window Square," a collaboration by Jenkins, Rinde Eckert and John 
Sanborn, explored the disappearance of the individual and the extinction of 
privacy. Inquiry and interrogation sought "private moments and daydreams" 
through layers of recollection. Uniformed dancers collapsed like dominoes and 
paced within their confines as Jenkins, the white-coated 
clinician/authoritarian, patrolled and observed. SHELLEY BAUMSTEN WAGERS

GLORIOUS WILTERN FINALE FOR ALVIN AILEY COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The final Alvin Ailey program of the season at the Wiltern Theatre Sunday 
afternoon was one of those occasions when just about everything seemed glorious 
-- the dancing, the choreography, even the die-hard fervor of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Donald McKayle's "Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder" was performed with an urgency 
that belied its 31 years. Its simple strength derives from stark movements set 
to the compelling rhythmic pulse of folk songs arranged by Robert de Cormier 
and Milton Okun. 
</P>
<P>
Five men on a chain gang twist their bodies at the same pained angle, tense 
their necks and clasp their hands behind their back. The same clasping gesture 
performed by a jigging boy (Aubrey Lynch II) who goes courting becomes the 
hallmark of eager shyness. His life as a free man is a counterpoint to the 
unison moves of the prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
As the boy grown to manhood, Desmond Richardson was a driven figure in the duet 
with his wife (Elizabeth Roxas), who comforts him when -- obsessed by inner 
demons -- his gaze curdles and his arms flail. But free black men are not long 
for this world, and death comes in a gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
The company also imbued the signature reach-and-grasp movements and the 
whiplash turns in excerpts from Ailey's "Blues Suite" with a suave and frisky 
good humor. The 1958 piece, to traditional songs, is about how people survive 
through a complex network of social interactions, a favorite Ailey theme. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Banks as the proud and bitter woman and Gary DeLoatch as the swaggering 
guy who knows how to prey on weakness offered superb timing and emotional 
presence in the down-and-dirty "Backwater Blues" section. 
</P>
<P>
The only major disappointment in a program that also included Ailey's 
"Revelations" (previously reviewed) was Renee Robinson in Ailey's "Cry." 
Robinson has the moves down, especially the cut-loose flamboyance of the final 
section, but she doesn't convey the suffering and surviving that are also 
integral to the role. CATHY CURTIS

MARTIN OUT OF CHARACTER AS 'BAD-BOY' IN 'ILLUMINATIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Douglas Martin is a handsome and technically accomplished young dancer whose 
height and partnering prowess alone would justify his prominence during the 
current Joffrey Ballet season at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
However, casting him in the stellar "bad-boy" roles of the repertory -- first 
Billy the Kid last week and, on Sunday afternoon, the Rimbaud character in 
Frederick Ashton's "Illuminations" -- forces Martin way out of his depth as an 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
He works hard to conquer all the movement challenges and knows how to hold 
attention through sheer presence, but something fundamentally decent in his 
nature undercuts every attempt to seem venal. 
</P>
<P>
When he throws himself on top of the character called Profane Love (a rather 
aimlessly jittery Julie Janus), this Rimbaud arches his back all right, but it 
isn't sex, it's choreography. Significantly, Martin's best moment in the ballet 
is his disgusted final rejection of her. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Daniel Baudendistel in "Lacrymosa" on Sunday night, Martin broods 
superbly -- coming between Jodie Gates and Edward Stierle in a portrayal of the 
enigmatic man in black that suggests hidden depths. But, for now, both "Billy" 
and "Illuminations" are better served with other Joffrey casts. 
</P>
<P>
Several new "Cotillon" principals interacted well with previously reviewed 
artists on Sunday afternoon. Charlene Gehm made an elegant-unto-brittle 
Mistress of Ceremonies: perfect for a ballet with lots of secrets under the 
fancy-dress vivacity. Cameron Basden danced the Young Girl's friend with an 
effective, carefree attack. However, Janus looked strained and listless as the 
glamorous predator in the "Hand of Fate" pas de deux -- another Joffrey dancer 
who's no good at being bad. LEWIS SEGAL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOTH ACTRESS, FATHER GOT MAIL THREATS, 
COURT TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man accused of mailing threatening letters to actress Stephanie Zimbalist 
also sent copies of his mailings to her actor-father, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., as 
well as to other entertainers, court documents in Los Angeles revealed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shields, 42, first saw Stephanie Zimbalist perform in 1979 and, five 
years later, "began a series of secret trips to find Miss Zimbalist," Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Carol Gillam said in a memo. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan man sent more than 200 letters to Zimbalist, best known as the 
co-star in the TV series "Remington Steele," and purchased a semiautomatic 
rifle before attempting to track her down in Los Angeles in March.

MOTIVE SOUGHT IN PUZZLING SLAYING OF AILING HOUSE-SITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police were attempting Monday to determine the motive for the 
baffling slaying of a man who was found shot to death in a house he was 
watching for his sister and her husband in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Arthur Lee Ekrem, 59, of Palmdale was found in the house in the 
22300 block of Quinta Road about 7:30 p.m. Sunday when his sister and 
brother-in-law, Phyllis and Robert Matthews, returned home after a weekend out 
of town. 
</P>
<P>
Ekrem, who was retired and in poor health, had been shot numerous times in the 
upper body, Detective Rick Swanston said. He had been staying at the Woodland 
Hills house about a week while he was sick. He had agreed to house-sit while 
the Matthewses went away for the weekend to Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said there was no sign of forced entry or that a struggle had taken 
place in the house. Robbery was apparently not a motive, he said. Ekrem's car 
and other valuables were not taken. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is missing," Swanston said. "There was no ransacking and everything 
seems to be intact in the house." 
</P>
<P>
The Matthewses left their house in a quiet hillside neighborhood near 
Mulholland Drive and Topanga Canyon Boulevard on Saturday morning, Swanston 
said. It appears from evidence at the crime scene that Ekrem was probably 
killed Saturday afternoon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said evidence also indicates that Ekrem never left the house after the 
Matthewses departed. 
</P>
<P>
He said investigators have so far found nothing about Ekrem that indicates a 
reason for the slaying. Ekrem, a former buyer for a department store, had been 
retired for 20 years, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
"No motive has been established," Swanston said. "He was retired and was just a 
house guest in the residence. We are not certain at this point he was the 
intended victim. It could have been a mistake and the wrong guy got it." 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said that investigators found nothing to indicate that the victim's 
brother-in-law, Robert Matthews, the owner of a chain of car lubrication shops, 
was the intended target.

CRASH VICTIM'S MOTHER FINALLY GETTING DAY IN COURT; 
</P>
<P>
TRIALS: AS A MADD VOLUNTEER, RUTH HANZLIK COMFORTED OTHERS. NOW SHE MAY FIND 
COMFORT -- SEEKING JUSTICE IN THE 1982 WRECK THAT KILLED HER DAUGHTER.

As a volunteer for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Ruth Hanzlik of Granada Hills 
spent three years in Van Nuys courtrooms, absorbing the cases of drunk drivers 
accused of homicide. She comforted the survivors and committed herself to 
understanding the intricacies of the legal system, so she would be ready when 
her turn came. 
</P>
<P>
Hanzlik's turn came Monday when the man accused of killing her 23-year-old 
daughter and a friend in a 1982 drunk-driving accident appeared in court after 
more than seven years as a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Perez Lemon, 28, is accused of killing Carrie Sue Hanzlik and Paula Ann 
Colicci, 21, who were driving home from a birthday party in the early morning 
when their car was struck by Lemon's auto at Sherman Way and Reseda Boulevard, 
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
Lemon's car, traveling at 60 m.p.h. to 70 m.p.h., ran a red light and swerved 
to avoid two pedestrians in a crosswalk before hitting Hanzlik's car, according 
to court records. According to the records, Lemon fled and was arrested later 
at his home. He posted $5,000 bail and fled to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested again Thursday as he stood on a corner in the 20800 block of 
Ventura Boulevard. Police would not say how they located him. 
</P>
<P>
Lemon pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of two counts of vehicular 
manslaughter, two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol and one 
count of hit-and-run. Bail was set at $200,000. A preliminary hearing was 
scheduled for May 23 
</P>
<P>
Hanzlik said of Lemon in court: "It feels like finally we're going to see an 
end to this. We're going to get to a place in our life where we can go on with 
it. The last 7 1/2 years have been somewhat of a limbo for us."

MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO LESSER CHARGES IN OFFICER'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of two defendants in the 1987 fatal shooting of a Los Angeles police 
officer in Sylmar pleaded guilty to cocaine-selling and assault charges Monday, 
but prosecutors decided to drop the murder charge, saying the case against him 
was shaky. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Lee Mixon, 21, was being prosecuted for the June, 22, 1987, shooting 
death of Officer James H. Pagliotti on the theory that he and the other 
defendant took part in a drug-selling conspiracy that led to the officer's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan M. Speer said Monday that evidence in the case did 
not demonstrate that Mixon and co-defendant Louis Belvin Jr., 20, were engaged 
in such a conspiracy at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Mixon had admitted to investigators that he and Belvin -- who authorities said 
were both South-Central Los Angeles gang members -- had come to Sylmar that day 
to sell drugs, but no drugs were recovered from them after the shooting, Speer 
said. Mixon also did not fire the fatal shots and was standing a half block 
away from where the shooting took place in the Sylmar Square area, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to concentrate our efforts on the shooter," Speer said, referring 
to Belvin, who she said was "the guy who was really responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Pagliotti was killed in a gun battle after confronting Mixon and Belvin in the 
belief they were dealing drugs, authorities said. Prosecutors said it was 
Belvin who opened fire on the plainclothes officer, who returned fire and took 
cover behind his car. The car rolled forward, however, exposing Pagliotti, who 
was then shot in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliotti, 28, had been a police officer 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
Belvin is awaiting trial on a murder charge. He was 17 years old at the time of 
the shooting but is being tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Mixon's attorney, Robert D. Rentzer, said proving a murder based on a 
conspiracy would have been especially difficult because Mixon and Belvin did 
not know each other particularly well. 
</P>
<P>
"Logically, it's really reaching," Rentzer said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also were reluctant to spend the time and effort that would have 
been required to bring Mixon to trial on a charge they believed tenuous, Speer 
said. Mixon and Belvin would have had to be tried separately, she said. 
</P>
<P>
After pleading guilty to the lesser charges on Monday, Mixon faces a maximum 
sentence of eight years and four months in prison when he is sentenced June 8 
in San Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Speer said she will seek the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the charge of selling cocaine, Mixon admitted Monday to an 
assault that was not related to the shooting of the police officer. Shortly 
before the shooting, Mixon beat up a man who had come to the area to buy drugs, 
Speer said.

BUGGED BY WATER ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding water conservation. The people are asked to cut back on our water 
usage, which we do, and as a result, we save a certain percentage of water from 
our efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But when people OK new housing and continue to allow more and more new homes to 
be built, all that we conserve then goes to these new homes. Where is the logic 
in this? 
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later the building will have to stop because there just will not be 
enough water, no matter how much we conserve. I hope someone opens their eyes 
to this obvious future problem.

BUGGED BY WATER ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does anyone else out there get angry when they hear requests for water 
conservation? Everyone proposing that solution wants us to believe that it is 
our civic duty as responsible citizens to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
Someone please correct me if my logic is wrong, but I think the water 
conservation option is absurdly unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Is my conserving really going to save water? Of course not. Instead, 
politicians and developers are still going to work together to approve new 
residential or commercial developments. The result is that I give up some of 
the quality of my life (dirtier car, dirtier clothes and dishes, less 
attractive garden, etc.) so that someone else, who already has a home 
somewhere, can now move here instead. 
</P>
<P>
What have I gained by conserving? I'll tell you what: more developments, more 
cars, more pollution and a near guarantee that down the road politicians are 
going to request more taxes to provide more water and better transportation. 
</P>
<P>
If my logic is correct, people should refuse to conserve unless the saved water 
can be used to improve, not destroy, the quality of my life. I don't see how 
politicians can ask people to conserve water and approve new housing at the 
same time.

BLOCKADES OF NARROW STREETS TARGETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to years of complaints about safety hazards created when 
construction projects block the narrow streets of hillside neighborhoods, Los 
Angeles officials are finally preparing for a crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials and hillside residents say that the blockades, particularly in 
the Santa Monica and Verdugo mountains, can prevent emergency vehicles from 
reaching a fire or someone in need of medical aid, and that construction sites 
on their clogged, substandard streets could someday give rise to tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by those concerns, Councilman Michael Woo earlier this month introduced 
a measure in the City Council that would require builders to leave at least 16 
feet of clear roadway on substandard hillside streets while doing construction 
work. The measure also proposes setting up a task force of various city 
agencies to conduct a coordinated review of construction plans before the city 
grants permits. 
</P>
<P>
The current system, Woo said, is a mishmash of confusing city ordinances, 
overlapping jurisdictions and disjointed approval processes that have done 
nothing to fight the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about a situation that is merely inconvenient," Woo said. 
"We're talking about a situation that is life-threatening on these narrow, 
winding streets, where any kind of emergency can quickly become a disaster. 
These streets are dangerous enough under the best of conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Although the proposal is aimed primarily at hillside neighborhoods, it would 
also apply to narrow, substandard streets throughout Los Angeles. Such streets, 
Woo said, are found in parts of Wilmington, Venice and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the city would be empowered to stop work on projects where 
construction blocks the roadway. Woo said builders could meet requirements by 
storing materials off public property, creating alternate parking, stationing 
workers to direct traffic and posting the phone number of a supervisor for 
residents to call when problems arise. 
</P>
<P>
Woo first unveiled the proposal at a news conference he held on a treacherous 
hillside in Laurel Canyon. He said an elderly woman had died nearby while 
paramedics tried to crash through a construction site blocking the road. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials and homeowners confirm that emergency vehicles often have 
trouble getting through construction areas but details of the incident cited by 
Woo are sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
In the late fall of 1988, according to Woo and fire officials, a fire truck 
responding to an emergency call at an elderly woman's house on Bulwer Drive was 
blocked by construction work that spilled onto the street. An ambulance finally 
rammed through an opening, but the woman was dead by the time paramedics 
arrived, Woo and the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be determined whether the extra time spent getting to the woman 
was a factor in her death, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, hillside residents stepped up their lobbying efforts at City Hall 
after the incident, taking particular aim at Woo, their councilman. 
</P>
<P>
"It only added a tragic emphasis to the years of complaints from frustrated 
hillside homeowners," said Jim Nelson, president of the Lookout Mountain 
Associates homeowner group. "For years we'd been saying somebody is going to 
die because there will be no way to get a fire truck or ambulance up there."

S.D.-TUCSON AIR LINK TAKES OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Air Resorts Airlines of Carlsbad has grown steadily since its founding in 1978 
by offering an expanding array of charter flights and freight deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
But founder Ted Vallas, who is also the company's president, says he has been 
itching to make a bold move, one that would allow Air Resorts to move into a 
new market and dramatically increase revenue. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Vallas did just that by launching Air Resorts into the 
scheduled-flight business. The airline now operates flights from San Diego's 
Lindbergh Field to Tucson on twice daily, nonstop flights. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the closely held company posted $7.2 million in revenues, Vallas 
said. But, by adding the San Diego-to-Tucson route and two other scheduled 
flight services, Vallas expects to double Air Resorts revenues by 1991. The 
company owns 14 airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Vallas' decision to begin regular passenger service is an example of how some 
small air-service companies have seized an opportunity to generate revenue from 
minor routes abandoned by major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Recent mergers and acquisitions have consolidated the airline industry, Vallas 
said, leaving the survivors to hold on to heavily traveled routes and to 
discard those that are considered "only marginally profitable." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the major airlines' increasing emphasis on the "hub and spoke" 
system -- funneling shorter flights into one "hub" airport, then loading those 
passengers onto a variety of long-distance flights -- have caused them to lose 
interest in routes that don't feed passengers into their "hubs." 
</P>
<P>
These factors, for example, played a role in the decisions by Republic and 
Pacific Southwest Airlines -- both of which are now defunct -- and Eastern 
Airlines to discontinue service between San Diego and Tucson several years ago. 
Air Resorts is the only airline now providing nonstop service between San Diego 
and Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Air Resorts is offering an introductory, one-way fare of $69 until July 15, 
according to Henry Voss, the airline's general manager and senior vice 
president. Round-trip tickets purchased eight days in advance cost $98 or $108. 
</P>
<P>
Competitor America West Airlines does not offer nonstop service, but it does 
have one direct flight daily between the two cities. The direct flight makes a 
brief stop in Phoenix before continuing to Tucson. A one-way, America West 
ticket purchased three days in advance costs $89. A round-trip ticket purchased 
seven days in advance costs $106. 
</P>
<P>
Air Resorts officials point out that their one-way flight lasts 1 hour, 30 
minutes; America West's flight is 40 minutes longer. 
</P>
<P>
"The only other way is to fly up or drive up to L.A. and then fly from L.A. to 
Tucson," Voss said. "Those are pretty roundabout ways to get to Tucson." 
</P>
<P>
Although the major airlines have abandoned the San Diego-Tucson route, Voss 
said, there is still demand for such service. According to Voss, 102,000 trips 
were made between San Diego and Tucson in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Tucson is a big city with a population over 500,000," Voss said. "This is a 
(route) right in our back yards that provides a needed service for the 
businessman who has to travel from San Diego to Tucson to do a day's worth of 
business and then come home. 
</P>
<P>
"We can break even if we capture 25% of the trips that are taken," Voss added. 
"It makes a lot of sense for us to do this." 
</P>
<P>
The recent mergers and acquisitions that have occurred in the airline industry 
have forced many of the major airlines to reassess existing routes and juggle 
newly acquired planes to the most profitable ones, said Vallas, Air Resorts' 
president. 
</P>
<P>
For example, PSA once offered nonstop service between San Diego and Tucson, 
Vallas said. But, when US Air acquired PSA, the bigger airline decided that 
PSA's use of 135-seat planes for the route was not appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"This route provides a problem for the major airlines that have these big 
planes," Vallas said. "There's a need for this route, but not enough to fill a 
plane with 135 seats. But it's profitable for a 48-seat plane like the ones we 
use. 
</P>
<P>
"When some of these mergers were done, the bigger airlines often picked up 
equipment and used it to concentrate on their growth markets or to better feed 
their hubs," Vallas said. 
</P>
<P>
As the major airlines steer more traffic into their hubs, Vallas says, he and 
other small companies have an opportunity to capture "origination and 
destination" routes -- those that do not travel thorough hubs. For example, a 
flight from San Diego to Tucson is an "O&amp;D" route because it bypasses a 
major city such as Phoenix, which serves as hub for some major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the San Diego-Tucson route, Vallas said, Air Resorts is expected 
to begin regular service between Los Angeles and the Grand Canyon in June, and 
offer a flight between Toronto and New York City in July. 
</P>
<P>
Of the company's 14 airplanes, four are Convair 580 turboprops that are used 
for charter and scheduled flight services. Each Convair 580 seats 48 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining planes are Convair 340s and 440s -- equipped with less powerful 
engines -- that are used for shorter charter flights and freight delivery. Air 
Resorts expects to purchase five more Convair 580s for the expanded schedule.

DEFENDANT SAYS HE QUIT GANG A YEAR BEFORE FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Murder defendant Arnel Salagubang denied in court Monday that he shot and 
killed a gang member in November in Oxnard or that he belongs to a rival 
Filipino gang called the Satanas. 
</P>
<P>
Salagubang, 20, testified that he drove away from Channel Islands High School 
alone before Manuel (Deadeye) Rodriguez was shot to death Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Salagubang admitted that he joined the Satanas, or Devils, in January, 1988, 
but said he "stopped hanging around with them" a full year before Rodriguez's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
His elbows on the witness stand, Salagubang testified in a clear, unhesitating 
voice, addressing lawyers as "sir." He was the first of several defense 
witnesses Monday who contradicted state witnesses' testimony that he shot 
Rodriguez to death. 
</P>
<P>
Salagubang is charged with first-degree murder, inflicting great bodily harm 
and using a weapon in the death of Rodriguez, who died of a .22-caliber gunshot 
wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have testified that Salagubang killed Rodriguez because he was 
voicing racial slurs at members of the Satanas and yelling the name of his 
gang, Lemonwood Chiques, to provoke them. 
</P>
<P>
Salagubang said he dropped off Satanas member Jesse Cortinas at the school, 
then drove away because his Datsun 280ZX wouldn't restart if he turned off the 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
Witness Jamie Johnson, 17, supported his version. She testified that she saw 
Salagubang drive away before she heard the shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Deadeye stopped and said, 'What's up? Lemonwood Chiques all the way,' " 
Johnson said. She said she saw Cortinas and another Satanas member standing by 
Rodriguez's car before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard Arnel's car starting to drive away, and I heard a pop, and I saw Jesse 
had something by the side of his leg, but I couldn't see what it was," Johnson 
said. She testified that a few moments later Cortinas was holding a gun as she 
rode away with them in a pickup truck with several other friends. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson testified that she had lied to police officers after the shooting. She 
said she implicated Salagubang because Oxnard detectives threatened to charge 
her as an accessory to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all they wanted to hear, that Arnel did it," she told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Cortinas testified against Salagubang last week in exchange for the district 
attorney's offer to let him plead guilty to a murder charge in Juvenile Court, 
which would put him under authorities' control only until he reaches age 25. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Greg Asbell admitted during rebuttal testimony Monday that he had 
lied to Salagubang, telling him during interrogation that witnesses had 
identified his license plate at the scene and picked him out of a photo lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors heard a tape recording on which Asbell told Salagubang, "You'd better 
cooperate. . . . Why would somebody positively ID you?" 
</P>
<P>
And Salagubang admitted under cross-examination that he lied when he told 
investigators he had driven by the school without stopping because he saw 
members of the Colonia Chiques gang who had threatened him earlier.

SILBERMAN CASE FIGURE PLEADS GUILTY; 
</P>
<P>
PLEA BARGAIN: DEAL PAVES WAY FOR BANKER TO TESTIFY IN MONEY-LAUNDERING TRIAL OF 
SAN DIEGO BUSINESSMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Norman Myers, a Malibu investment banker accused of being a courier in a 
money-laundering scheme that prosecutors claim was directed by San Diego 
businessman Richard T. Silberman, pleaded guilty Monday to one criminal count 
in the complex case. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plea bargain struck as jury selection in Silberman's trial neared 
completion, Myers agreed to testify against Silberman, who once served as a top 
aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., and to back up his testimony with 
corroborating documents. 
</P>
<P>
In return, prosecutors agreed to dismiss five related charges and to recommend 
that Myers, who has been associated with Silberman since both were active 
political fund-raisers for Brown, receive a maximum sentence of six months at a 
minimum-security federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Myers, 44, who was once married to Los Angeles socialite Lynn Wasserman, the 
daughter of MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman, declined to comment on the deal as he 
walked away -- with FBI agents -- from a brief hearing in San Diego federal 
court. One of Silberman's defense attorneys, George Harris, said Monday that he 
had no comment on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Opening statements in Silberman's trial are scheduled Wednesday. Though 
Silberman was charged with Myers and three other men, he is standing trial 
alone on allegations that he laundered $300,000 in cash that an undercover FBI 
agent portrayed as the proceeds of Colombian drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
One of the three, Terry Ziegler, 45, a Los Angeles investment broker, also 
agreed to a deal last month, pleading guilty to one criminal count of violating 
federal currency laws. It is not known whether Ziegler will testify at 
Silberman's trial. 
</P>
<P>
The two others, reputed mobster Chris Petti, 63, of San Diego and Darryl 
Nakatsuka, 43, of Los Angeles are scheduled to stand trial beginning July 17. 
</P>
<P>
In a written plea agreement filed late Monday with the San Diego court, Ziegler 
said Silberman asked him sometime before November, 1988, for help moving "some 
cash to a foreign bank account" without producing any transaction records. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 30, 1988, at Silberman's direction, Myers and Nakatsuka went to the Los 
Angeles Airport Hilton, where Nakatsuka 
</P>
<P>
picked up $100,000 from an undercover FBI agent, according to the document. 
</P>
<P>
Myers and Nakatsuka took the cash to Ziegler, who admitted in April that he 
broke the money into smaller sums and eventually wired $45,000 of it to a Hong 
Kong bank account that prosecutors contend was controlled by Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the paper work that federal law requires for any transaction over 
$10,000 was not filed for the $45,000, and Myers pleaded guilty Monday to 
failing to file those papers. 
</P>
<P>
Myers also said in the written agreement that he kept $4,000 of the $100,000 as 
compensation for the deal -- $2,000 for himself and $2,000 for Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
Myers had faced a maximum prison term of 75 years. Though prosecutors 
recommended the six-month term, U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving reminded 
Myers Monday that the law permits him to impose a sentence of up to five years 
-- followed by two or three years probation -- and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Myers, who remains free on bail, also agreed to forfeit his share of the cash, 
stocks and bonds that prosecutors contend were central to the scheme. Irving 
set sentencing for Sept. 24.

EXPANDED ROLE SOUGHT AT INS CHECKPOINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal officials are seeking court authority to use two major U.S. Border 
Patrol checkpoints in Southern California for the "dual purpose" of immigration 
and drug checks, a government prosecutor said in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which critics see as a significant expansion of the traditional 
immigration-law role of the checkpoints, has drawn fire from civil libertarians 
and others concerned about a violation of Fourth Amendment safeguards against 
unreasonable searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the "dual purpose" designation, if given court imprimatur, could 
have far-reaching implications at immigration checkpoints throughout the 
U.S.-Mexico border area, and, possibly, at law enforcement checkpoints 
elsewhere in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"They could just set up drug checkpoints anywhere and start inspecting people," 
said Kathryn A. Thickstun, a San Diego attorney who represents a client being 
prosecuted as a result of a drug seizure at the San Onofre checkpoint on 
Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
But Patrick K. O'Toole, assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego, argued Monday in 
U.S. District Court in San Diego that the "dual purpose" designation is 
necessary to combat the ever-expanding volume of drug traffic from Mexico 
through San Diego County. The county shares a 66-mile border with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're saying here is that there's a unique problem in this particular 
district," O'Toole said. "We wouldn't be asking this in Omaha." 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Lawrence J. Irving is expected to issue a ruling in the 
matter within the next two weeks. Any decision on the "dual purpose" checkpoint 
designation is likely to be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy stems from two cases arising out of separate federal seizures 
of loads of methamphetamines from vehicles passing through the checkpoints. 
Defense lawyers are challenging the legality of the seizures. 
</P>
<P>
The checkpoints -- at San Onofre and on Interstate 15 in southern Riverside 
County -- have long been considered key enforcement tools by the Border Patrol. 
Their purpose is to deter the many undocumented immigrants who have managed to 
cross the U.S.-Mexico border and are heading for the Los Angeles area and 
elsewhere in the U. S. interior. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, the checkpoints have also been the sites of rising 
numbers of drug seizures and narcotics-related arrests, facts that U. S. 
authorities say attests to the increased transport of illicit drugs from Mexico 
via the two north-south California freeways. 
</P>
<P>
A Supreme Court decision in 1976 gave the government broad authority to briefly 
detain motorists for possible immigration offenses at the checkpoints. In the 
current case, prosecutors are seeking similar power to briefly detain and 
question suspected drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Now, checkpoint authorities seeking to 
</P>
<P>
detain motorists for possible drug-related offenses must demonstrate what is 
known as "founded suspicion" -- a standard of proof that may involve, for 
instance, nervousness on the part of the driver, or the appearance of drug 
paraphernalia or other apparently incriminating evidence in the suspect 
vehicle. Under the "dual purpose" proposal, the "founded suspicion" standard 
would be dropped and the broader standards for immigration stops would apply, 
more easily facilitating drug-related detentions.

MURDER DEFENDANT LABELED A MENACE AND JAILED BY JUDGE 
</P>

Pacific Beach real estate broker Howard F. Barton Jr. was ordered Monday to 
stand trial for murder in the shooting of Marco Sanchez after a traffic dispute 
between Sanchez and Barton's daughter. Barton's $500,000 bail was revoked by a 
judge who called him "hot tempered and a danger to the public." 
</P>
<P>
"The killing was committed without any cause, without justification. . . . It 
was an uncalled for, premeditated, unlawful killing," said Municipal Judge 
Rafael A. Arreola. "The killing was unnecessary to prevent death or great 
bodily injury to you or your daughter," he told the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Barton, 47, is charged with murder in the 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 22 shooting death of Sanchez, 24, a National City resident. He was taken 
into custody and put in the County Jail after Monday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred in Pacific Beach, after a minor traffic altercation 
between Sanchez and Barton's daughter, Andrea Barton. 
</P>
<P>
After the altercation, Andrea Barton drove to her father's nearby real estate 
office. The Bartons then went looking for Sanchez and found him shopping in a 
store on Garnet Avenue. Witnesses said a series of arguments ensued, with 
Sanchez walking away from the Bartons each time. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses testified that Howard Barton followed Sanchez to his car and shot him 
once in the back, while Sanchez was sitting inside. A wounded Sanchez exited 
the car and ran down the sidewalk, before collapsing and dying inside a store. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Clyde Munsell argued throughout the five-day preliminary 
hearing that Barton shot Sanchez in self-defense, claiming that Sanchez 
attacked Barton with a knife. However, none of the witnesses testified to 
seeing a weapon in Sanchez's hands. Munsell also attempted to justify the 
killing on grounds that Barton believed his daughter was in imminent danger. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Arreola lectured Barton that "there was no justification" for him to 
get involved in his daughter's argument with Sanchez. The judge said "a 
reasonable" person would have called the police instead. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument, Munsell asked Arreola that, if he found it necessary 
to order Barton to stand trial to bind him over on a charge of voluntary 
manslaughter or at the very most second-degree murder, and throw out a 
first-degree murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty Lisa Chappell pointed out to Munsell that the district 
attorney can merely charge Barton with murder, and that it is up to a jury to 
decide whether to convict him of first- or second-degree murder or 
manslaughter, or to acquit him. 
</P>
<P>
Munsell made a final appeal to have Barton remain free on bail pending his next 
hearing May 25, but Arreola turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is his temper and danger to the public. . . . I don't know if it's 
(the shooting) an isolated incident. But I don't want to have another isolated 
incident," said Arreola.

2 CHARGED IN BOY'S DEATH BY DRINKING; 
</P>
<P>
ALCOHOL: THE THOUSAND OAKS BROTHERS FACE INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER COUNTS. THEY 
ARE ACCUSED OF DARING LELAND SCOVIS, 14, TO CHUG WHISKEY.

<P>
Two Thousand Oaks brothers were charged with involuntary manslaughter Monday in 
the death last month of a 14-year-old boy whom they allegedly goaded into 
chugging part of a bottle of whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
David Campbell, 29, and Patrick Campbell, 23, were expected to turn themselves 
in to Los Angeles County authorities this week for arraignment in the 
alcohol-poisoning death of Leland Scovis, the youngest of a group of five 
teen-age boys the brothers were chaperoning on a camping trip at Leo Carrillo 
State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Campbells were each charged with one count of involuntary manslaughter, 
four counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor and four counts of contributing to 
the delinquency of a minor. Bail for each is expected to be set at $5,000, said 
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
Another chaperon, Priscilla Vernon, 21, of Newbury Park, also is expected to 
surrender for arraignment on one count of being an accessory to involuntary 
manslaughter and four counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. 
Vernon's bail is expected to be set at $5,000, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon is engaged to David Campbell and is the sister of one of the teen-age 
boys who attended what was to be a two-day camping trip, said Detective Jerome 
Beck of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
On April 14, the adults took the group -- whose members ranged in age from 14 
to 17 -- from their campsite to the beach about 10:30 p.m. and gave them 
whiskey and beer, said sheriff's Detective Jerome Beck. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, the two brothers bet Scovis -- the youngest member of 
the group -- that he could not drink the 2 to 3 inches of alcohol left in a 
gallon jug of whiskey without getting sick, Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
Scovis allegedly drank the alcohol rapidly and collapsed about 15 minutes 
later, Beck said. Two of the adults left the beach while one remained with 
Scovis for the next two hours, Beck said. The boy threw up and eventually began 
having trouble breathing, Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Campbell brothers, whom investigators would not identify, carried 
Leland Scovis back to the campsite and began attempts at cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation, Beck said. Members of the group called rescue workers, and 
Scovis was taken by helicopter to the Westlake Medical Center in Westlake 
Village, where "his prognosis was very bad from the beginning," Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
Scovis, who was 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighed 155 pounds, had a 
blood-alcohol level of .46 when he arrived at the hospital April 15, said Bob 
Dambacher, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. The legal 
limit for a driver in California is .08 and a level above .35 "could be fatal," 
Dambacher said. Scovis died two days later of acute ethanol intoxication, 
Dambacher said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gordon said the charges surrounding Scovis' death were filed 
more than a month after the event because the district attorney's office needed 
time to carefully investigate the case. 
</P>
<P>
The adults had told authorities that two unfamiliar men walking along the beach 
gave Leland Scovis the alcohol while the rest of the group was at the campsite, 
Beck said. The teen-agers backed up the story until investigators began to 
question them individually, Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
Involuntary manslaughter is punishable by a maximum prison term of four years, 
and accessory to involuntary manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of three 
years. Each misdemeanor count carries a maximum one-year penalty.

WATER CUSTOMERS TO PAY ABOUT 8% MORE

<P>
Casitas water bills are scheduled to rise an average of 8.2% after July 1, 
according to the proposed 1990-91 budget for the Casitas Municipal Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The average residential bimonthly water rate would go up $2 from the current 
figure of $27.14, district Auditor Ron Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to the 2.75% increase adopted last month. 
</P>
<P>
The district supplies water to 2,400 residential customers and 400 other users, 
including the city of Ventura. The other agencies could pass on the rate 
increases to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
The scheduled increase, which is expected to raise $258,000, is needed to 
offset the cost of inflation in water deliveries, said district General Manager 
John Johnson. The earlier rate increase was needed to cover future operating 
costs for a new water treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, residential rates would go up 5% for those who use less 
than 7,500 gallons a month and 10% for those who use more. Commercial and 
agricultural rates would rise between 6.5% and 10%, depending upon the category 
of service. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the district board is expected to consider the rate increase and 
schedule a public hearing on it. THIA BELL

Pruner Ambulance Co.'s fourth ambulance station in eastern Ventura County, 
where it has a county contract to answer emergency calls, opens today to serve 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The station at 2201 Olsen Road is expected to answer about 40 calls a month, 
company owner Don Pruner said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The company has provided Moorpark with emergency ambulance service through 
stations in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Camarillo. Ambulances respond to 
more than 5,000 calls each year from the Thousand Oaks station and more than 
4,000 from Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The new station, which is within two miles of Moorpark, is expected to trim 
three minutes off the average response time of 11 minutes, Pruner said. PSYCHE

A Normal Heights man was arrested after attempting to shoot a police officer, a

<P>
Bragg Parker, 29, is being held in County Jail on suspicion of theft, resisting 
arrest and assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said Parker was driving erratically at 6th and 
Robinson avenues shortly after 5 a.m. Monday when Officer Frank Thornquest 
stopped him for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said Parker grabbed the officer's handgun, and the two struggled for 
control of the weapon. The gun was dislodged, and Parker grabbed it and fired 
at Thornquest, missing him, Robinson said. The bullet reportedly hit a window 
at a nearby gas station. Parker was seized by Thornquest and backup officers, 
Robinson said.

WOMAN QUITS ANNAPOLIS OVER 'ASSAULT' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old Encinitas woman has resigned as a second-year midshipman, 
sparking an inquiry into an alleged incident of harassment at the Naval Academy 
at Annapolis, Md., in which the woman was handcuffed to a pipe above a urinal. 
</P>
<P>
Gwen Dreyer tendered her resignation last week, citing "some very serious human 
relations problems" at the Naval Academy, which prepares professional officers 
in the naval service. 
</P>
<P>
Dreyer -- a third-generation midshipman at the academy -- said she will now 
intern at General Dynamics in San Diego and pursue mechanical engineering 
studies at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
The incident that sparked her resignation occurred in December when a snowball 
fight apparently got out of hand at a co-ed dormitory. Academy officials said 
that, after one of Dreyer's snowballs hit a male midshipman in the face, he and 
another man forced Dreyer into a men's restroom, where she was handcuffed to 
the pipe. She was taunted and photographed before her friends pleaded with the 
midshipmen to give up their keys to the handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
All the participants in the incident were clothed, and Dreyer was not 
physically hurt, academy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The snowball strike "certainly did not justify the action taken by the male 
members," said Cmdr. Ed Kujat, an academy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Dreyer's stepmother, Carolyn Dreyer, told reporters: 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't believe that they understand that it (handcuffing) was in fact 
an assault -- an assault. And it would have been treated that way in any other 
school, in any other situation." 
</P>
<P>
She declined further comment, and Gwen Dreyer could not be reached Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two male midshipmen were punished with demerits and a loss of vacation time 
by Rear Adm. Virgil Hill Jr., the academy's superintendent. He called the 
incident "dehumanizing" and said the offending students "clearly went beyond 
the bounds of acceptable behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Hill said the punishments were among the more severe he has meted out during 
his tenure at the academy. 
</P>
<P>
Kujat, an aide to Hill, said that, because of the incident, the academy will 
reconvene its Women Midshipmen Study Group to review recommendations made three 
years ago for better treatment of women at the academy. About 10% of the 
academy's 4,500 students are female. 
</P>
<P>
Kujat also said the academy's Human Relations Council will be replaced with a 
review board in which officers -- and not midshipmen -- will first hear of 
discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Kujat said the incident seemed to be more a spontaneous reaction to the 
snowball fight -- an act of "oneupsmanship," and not a premeditated form of 
hazing. 
</P>
<P>
In her resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Capital, an 
Annapolis newspaper, Dreyer wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"What disgusts me most about the Academy is to see people who once had 
tremendous drive and determination feel crushed and therefore satisfied with 
just getting by. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that steps are now being taken to correct some very serious human 
relations problems. However, after what I've been through and seen, not only 
because of what happened to me personally, I have decided to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Dreyer's resignation letter also reportedly said that "a portion of the academy 
leadership has done me an injury" by its handling of the incident, and said she 
was further troubled that classmates taunted her for reporting it.

COUNCIL DELAYS WATER-LIMIT VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council delayed action Monday on the County Water 
Authority's request that the city join the growing number of Southern 
California municipalities that have responded to the drought by limiting when 
residents can water lawns, wash cars and fill swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the Water Authority's 24-member agencies in San Diego County 
already have adopted water-use restrictions designed to reduce water 
consumption by 10%. The Water Authority and the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan 
Water District, which imports most of the water used in Southern California, 
have asked their member agencies to adopt the mandatory restrictions called for 
in a Stage 2 water alert. 
</P>
<P>
But the City Council, which seemed to be split on the need for mandatory water 
restrictions, on Monday postponed a vote on a Stage 2 alert until next Monday's 
regular council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Lester Snow, the Water Authority's general manager, said Monday that smaller 
municipalities in San Diego County would have "second thoughts" about the need 
for conservation should San Diego, which uses 40% of the water in the county, 
fail to adopt mandatory restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Snow said that the Water Authority's decision to push for mandatory 
restrictions was "very rare and unusual," but that mandatory controls are 
needed if the county is to be assured of adequate water next year. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor Maureen O'Connor maintained that, with proper education, San 
Diegans will voluntarily cut their water use by 10%, eliminating the need for 
mandatory controls. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a history of answering the call," said O'Connor, who referred to hefty 
water use cuts San Diegans achieved through voluntary efforts in 1957 and 1977. 
"We're going to do it, we're going to get 10% from the people of San Diego," 
O'Connor said. "I'm going to put my reputation on the line." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor described mandatory water conservation rules as placing a "water 
pistol" to the heads of San Diegans. "You get more out of everybody by asking 
them instead of telling them," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
According to O'Connor's proposal, the city would ask San Diegans to voluntarily 
follow the Stage 2 alert restrictions limiting when residents can water lawns, 
wash cars and fill swimming pools. O'Connor suggested that the city consider 
mandatory controls only if, after 90 days, it is clear that voluntary 
conservation has failed. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Ron Roberts, who last week proposed the prompt adoption of a 
Stage 2 alert, complained that "in 90 days, the summer will be over" and the 
city will have missed a significant chance to cut water use. Monday's vote, 
Roberts said, will determine "whether we step up our (conservation) efforts . . 
. or try to slide by with a minimal effort." 
</P>
<P>
A voluntary program "would be wonderful except for the fact that recent history 
shows that it hasn't worked," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bob Filner suggested that San Diego's image will take a beating if 
it turns out to be the only major city in California that does not respond to 
the drought by adopting the mandatory controls.

The new general plan, approved on a 4-1 vote by the Regional Planning 
Commission, would allow developers to build less than a third of the 38,000 
housing units they have proposed. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would uphold a county policy to limit the Santa Clarita Valley's 
population, now about 150,000, to a maximum of 270,000 by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
The plan must still be approved by the Board of Supervisors, and developers 
whose projects were not included in the plan Monday said they would push for 
their projects during public hearings before the supervisors, possibly in late 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners said the plan would provide a good foundation for management 
of future growth in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Betty Fisher, who cast the lone dissenting vote, said she approved 
of the plan's goals but questioned how strongly it would be implemented. Rather 
than develop a firm plan, she said, the county had produced an advisory 
document that could be amended later. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have a problem with putting this plan into action," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly not perfect," said Commissioner Sadie B. Clark, "but nothing 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Almost two years in the making, the new general plan sets broad guidelines for 
development in the booming Santa Clarita Valley, one of the fastest-growing 
regions in the county during the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners decided to create a new general plan in 1988 because the 
Department of Regional Planning was struggling to process a backlog of 43 
proposed amendments to the old general plan. 
</P>
<P>
Those proposals, for more than 38,000 units, would have pushed the Santa 
Clarita Valley's population past 270,000 residents in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
County planners said the valley does not have the infrastructure, from roads to 
fire stations to libraries, to support such rapid growth. "We just can't add 
more and more residential developments in the Santa Clarita Valley for a number 
of reasons," Jack Edwards, administrator of regional planning, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The new general plan does not reject or approve specific developments, but 
instead designates whether land is appropriate for residential growth, parks, 
industry or other uses. Developers would still be able to ask the planning 
commissioners to hold hearings on each of the 43 development proposals. 
</P>
<P>
But the land-use designations approved Monday indicate where development is 
most likely to be allowed. Planning Director James E. Hartl said the guidelines 
separate viable projects from others unlikely to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Even some potentially desirable projects were not included in the general plan 
because they would overload the current infrastructure, planner Lee Stark said. 
One project not included is a proposed 1,157-space mobile home park needed to 
accommodate mobile homes from parks that are expected to close in the next 
several years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At a series of well-attended hearings on the plan that began in December, 
developers promised that their projects would pay for roads, schools, parks and 
other amenities in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Among the potential winners in the aftermath of Monday's action was Newhall 
Land &amp; Farming Co., the valley's largest developer, which would be allowed 
to build about 6,000 of nearly 9,000 units it had proposed in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Among the losers was the Dale Poe Development Corp., which had hoped to build 
4,632 units, but would be allowed about 1,200 under the new plan. But Jeff 
Stevenson, a Dale Poe vice president, said the company would stress the 
potential benefits of the project to the Board of Supervisors.

POWAY CENTER EARNS POP KUDOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
POWAY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opening nights aren't supposed to go this smoothly, particularly the premiere 
production in a brand-new venue. 
</P>
<P>
You always expect at least some complications: a malfunctioning sound system, 
an out-of-sync spotlight, a problem with getting people seated on time, a 
miscued curtain drop. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Poway Center for the Performing Arts celebrated its grand opening 
Saturday night with a black-tie benefit concert by pop singer-songwriter 
Melissa Manchester, patrons were treated to a remarkably glitch-free 
production, from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
It was as much a tribute to the staff's careful prep work as a good omen for 
the facility's future as a cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
The sound system worked perfectly, beaming Manchester's voice into every nook 
and cranny of the 800-seat theater, regardless of whether she was belting out 
her parade of late-1970s, early-'80s Top 40 hits with full-band accompaniment 
or singing softly into the microphone, a cappella. 
</P>
<P>
The spotlight tracked her every move, even when she was rapidly pacing the 
stage during an inspired rendition of the gospelish "Oh Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
The lobby lights flickered on and off a few minutes prior to show time, giving 
lollygagging patrons a little encouragement to step along. 
</P>
<P>
Flashing their tickets to the ushers, they were then promptly directed, and 
sometimes escorted, to their seats -- the ushers having a good handle on the 
floor plan. 
</P>
<P>
And, at the end of the concert, the curtain came down at precisely the right 
moment, just as Manchester and her band members were taking their final bows. 
</P>
<P>
Even the pre- and post-concert receptions went off without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
Before the show, there was an ample supply of Champagne, wine and hors 
d'oeuvres. And exiting patrons were handed boxes of truffles as they made their 
way into the lobby for a nightcap of fresh-brewed coffee and cookies. 
</P>
<P>
The only complaints heard all night were that the "Telephones" sign in the 
lobby pointed to an empty hole in the wall and that the absence of working 
doorstops somewhat impeded the exodus. 
</P>
<P>
And these were but minor, easily resolved annoyances with the facility itself, 
which was built at a cost of $8.4 million by the city of Poway, the Poway 
Unified School District, and the nonprofit Poway Foundation for the Performing 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Manchester's 90-minute performance was almost as flawless as the production. 
Her middle-of-the road repertoire and Las Vegasy delivery might not be for 
everyone, but anyone who caught her show must concede that she's extremely good 
at what she does. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief orchestral overture consisting of several bars of her best-known 
hits, Manchester came on stage wearing a sequined, black dress and immediately 
sat down behind a grand piano for a seductive rendition of "Easy," a 
quintessential torch song. 
</P>
<P>
She then chatted with the audience ("You all look absolutely stunning") before 
resuming her set with a pair of originals, "Shine Like You Should" and 
"Midnight Blue," her first big hit, which peaked at No. 6 on Billboard's Hot 
100 chart in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
As the evening progressed, it became increasingly apparent that Manchester has 
matured considerably as a singer in the eight years since her last chart hit, 
1982's "You Should Hear How She Talks About You." 
</P>
<P>
Her earlier recordings were too often marred by excessive vocal histrionics, 
but singing them here on stage, many years later, she exercised a lot more 
restraint, allowing the purity and clarity of her rich, rangy voice to shine 
through at last. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Manchester's four big hits -- the other two are "Don't Cry Out 
Loud," with which she ended the show, and "Just You and I," her encore -- 
sounded a lot better live than they did on record. 
</P>
<P>
Manchester also sang compelling versions of Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By" and 
"Whenever I Call You Friend," the smash Kenny Loggins-Stevie Nicks duet she 
co-wrote in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Her finest vocal performance, however, was reserved for a medley of vintage pop 
classics from her recently released comeback album, "Tribute." The album 
consists entirely of covers of songs made famous by legendary female singers 
she cites as her early influences, including Billie Holiday, Judy Garland and 
Rosemary Clooney. 
</P>
<P>
Manchester did these songs justice. Her version of Garland's "Over the 
Rainbow," in particular, was simply superb.LINDA HECHT / Photo for The Times

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $1 MILLION OKD FOR FAMILY OF MAN SLAIN BY 
DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Claims Board approved a $1-million settlement Monday of 
a wrongful death suit filed against the Sheriff's Department by the family of a 
man killed by deputies after a traffic stop in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Under county policy, settlements of more than $100,000 are not final until 
approved by the Board of Supervisors, which will be May 29 at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Auditor-Controller Nancy Singer, who has been a member of the Claims Board for 
five years, said it was the largest settlement she can remember. 
</P>
<P>
The family of Hong Pyo Lee, 21, filed a $5.7-million suit in U.S. District 
Court alleging the Sheriff's Department tried to cover up the March 8, 1988, 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said Lee, of Cerritos, ran a stop sign in Compton and led 
deputies on a 15-mile chase. Deputies opened fire after Lee tried to run them 
down after he was cornered on a dead-end street, officials said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 MEN FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three men were found dead Monday night in the apartment they shared in the 3200 
block of South Main Street in Los Angeles. Police said their initial 
investigation indicated it was a murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
No weapon was found, however, and police declined to say whether the deaths 
were shootings or stabbings or which one may have killed the others. All of the 
men were partially clothed, two of the bodies were on the floor and another on 
a bed, police Lt. Vic Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors told police that the men -- who were in their 30s -- generally 
associated with homosexuals and that two of them often went to bars attired in 
women's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had determined no motive for the killings but there did not 
appear to be any gang connection. Identification of the men was withheld 
pending notification of their relatives.

SCHOOL HONORED AS AMONG U.S. BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Chatsworth private elementary school where classes are small, students learn 
Spanish in kindergarten and nature walks are a regular part of the curriculum 
was the only California private school to win national honors this year from 
the U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The 400-student Sierra Canyon School, located on six acres at the base of the 
Santa Susana Mountains, also is the only for-profit school to be among the 221 
public and private schools to win the department's annual Distinguished School 
Award, said Dorothy Vuksich, deputy regional representative for the Education 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We challenge students," said Principal Ann Gillinger. "We have a school full 
of achievers, many reading two to three levels ahead of their grade." 
</P>
<P>
But, she said, students "do not learn in stressful situations. They learn best 
in a nurturing environment, and we provide that." 
</P>
<P>
The school will charge $5,700 annual tuition plus $195 per month for 
transportation for the 1990-91 academic year. Officials said that 20% of the 
student body are members of minority groups and 11% attend with the help of 
full or partial scholarships. The school was notified of its award Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gillinger said that when she heard the school had won she "ran into each 
classroom. You would have thought the students had won the Super Bowl. They 
screamed and waved their fists. Because they knew we had been nominated." 
</P>
<P>
The school sits next to 36 acres of open land where students take nature walks 
and study plants, trees, insects and soil. The campus includes an amphitheater, 
two swimming pools and a small orange tree orchard shading an outdoor area 
where students eat lunch. 
</P>
<P>
An Education Department spokesman said public and private schools were 
evaluated on equal criteria, including visionary leadership, academic 
achievement, parent involvement and programs that challenge students and enable 
teachers to grow and teach effectively. 
</P>
<P>
But Gillinger said the school has many amenities that are beyond the reach of 
public schools. Its faculty includes 18 full-time teachers with full-time 
assistants in addition to specialists in Spanish, music, art, math and science 
and physical education. 
</P>
<P>
Each time a class goes to a specialist, classroom teachers are freed to hold 
conferences and prepare lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Gillinger said the school started 12 years ago when Howard Wang, Mick Horwitz 
and herself -- all of whom were public school teachers -- decided "that there 
was a way we would like to do things." 
</P>
<P>
She said the average class size at the school is 24, which allows students to 
study in small groups and get extensive individual attention. 
</P>
<P>
In one first-grade class on Monday, redheaded, freckle-faced Derek Snyder, 7, 
slouched in his chair as he used a computer game to learn to read. Derek didn't 
spell influenza -- the word he was studying. In fact, he said, he didn't even 
know what it meant. But he wasn't discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this game," he said. "You could learn lots of different words. Most of 
the time you get stuck. But it's fun to figure out how you got stuck."

EASY TARGETS FOR AN EARTHQUAKE; 
</P>
<P>
PASSAGE OF PROP. 122 WOULD GET STATE BUILDINGS INTO BETTER SHAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Seismic Safety Commission has been pushing the Legislature for 
several years to begin repairing and retrofitting state buildings and local 
government buildings that might collapse or suffer serious damage in a moderate 
or severe earthquake. The state owns 16,000 structures throughout California, 
many of which need to be upgraded to modern earthquake-safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
The commission estimates that there are another 3,000 local government-owned 
structures that need retrofitting, including many police and fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing all the publicly owned buildings in the state up to earthquake-safety 
standards will cost $1 billion or more, according to state officials. Prodded 
by last October's Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern California, the 
Legislature has at least taken the first step toward dealing with the problem 
by putting a proposed $300-million bond issue on the June 5 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The issue comes before California voters as Proposition 122. Statewide bond 
issues require a majority vote of the electorate before the money can be raised 
and spent. 
</P>
<P>
Over the decades, public schools were rebuilt or reinforced under the Field Act 
to make them earthquake-safe. So was the state Capitol in Sacramento. Similar 
action for other public buildings is past due. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers, students and consumers of state and local public services 
are put at potential risk every day because they must occupy, or do business, 
in unsafe public structures, such as old courthouses or Department of Motor 
Vehicle offices. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $300 million in general obligation bonds authorized by Proposition 122, 
$250 million would be used to rehabilitate or rebuild state buildings. The 
other $50 million would be set aside to help local governments do the same for 
fire and police stations, hospitals, emergency-operations centers and other 
public-safety facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Times urges California voters to approve this essential bond issue.

China has told the United States that it is pulling out of a $550-million arms 
deal that has been the linchpin of efforts at military cooperation between the 
two countries over the last decade, the Pentagon confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
China's decision represents an important break in the series of strategic and 
military ties it had built with the United States. Although President Bush 
suspended military sales and deliveries to China after the pro-democracy 
movement was crushed in Beijing last June, he had carefully allowed work to 
continue on long-term military programs. 
</P>
<P>
Under the mammoth arms program, known as Peace Pearl, Grumman Corp. of 
Bethpage, N.Y., has been working with the Chinese air force to modernize 
China's F-8 jet fighters, providing the planes with sophisticated electronics, 
navigation and radar equipment. 
</P>
<P>
It was by far the largest in a series of arms deals concluded between Beijing 
and Washington during the 1980s, a time when China and the United States saw 
strategic benefits in cooperating with one another against the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The People's Republic of China has decided not to proceed beyond the 
development phase of the F-8 avionics modernization program at this time," a 
Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist, said in response to queries 
from The Times. " . . . This was terminated by the Chinese. They made the 
decision (that) they didn't want to proceed with the production phase." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials declined to say what reason China had given, and the Chinese 
Embassy in Washing ton would not comment. But sources in the U.S. defense 
industry and Washington's diplomatic community said that China has been 
concerned for some time about the prospect of burgeoningcosts on Peace Pearl. 
</P>
<P>
"This was China learning about the American defense industry and its cost 
overruns," said one source. 
</P>
<P>
Some sources speculated that China's decision may also reflect internal 
politics and a cooling of interest in doing business with the United States. 
Several years ago, the Chinese air force, led by Cmdr. Wang Hai, overcame 
considerable resistance from more conservative leaders when it persuaded the 
regime to seek American help in modernizing Chinese planes. 
</P>
<P>
The Peace Pearl program was first offered to China by Secretary of Defense 
Caspar W. Weinberger during a trip to Beijing in 1983. The deal was concluded 
amid considerable fanfare three years later. 
</P>
<P>
On April 8, 1986, when the Reagan Administration announced the huge arms deal, 
the Pentagon said that the sale would help U.S. foreign policy "by helping to 
improve the security of a friendly country which has been an important force 
for political stability and economic progress in Asia and the world." 
</P>
<P>
After the People's Liberation Army's deadly assault in Tian An Men Square last 
June, Bush suspended not only arms sales but military contacts with China. At 
that time, about 40 Chinese military officers who had come to the United States 
for the F-8 modernization program were told to stop reporting for work, both at 
Grumman's Long Island facility in Bethpage and at Wright-Patterson Air Base 
outside Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
However, last fall, as part of a series of overtures to the Chinese leadership, 
the Bush Administration allowed the Chinese military officials to return to 
work on the Peace Pearl project in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't proceed without the participation of some Chinese engineering and 
maintenance personnel," Lundquist said at that time. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon spokesman said Monday that the development phase of the project 
will end sometime this fall. He said he is unsure what the impact will be on 
Grumman or whether there will be any layoffs. A Grumman spokesman, Miriam Reid, 
said she has been instructed to refer all questions to the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
China's F-8 fighters are based on the design and technology of Soviet MIGs. One 
Asian diplomat here said he believes Grumman ran into problems in seeking to 
fit its advanced electronics onto the Chinese planes. 
</P>
<P>
"The MIG didn't have enough space in the nose for this kind of equipment," this 
diplomat explained. "That's one of the problems you have sometimes when you 
seek to overhaul old planes instead of buying new ones." 
</P>
<P>
The program originally had called for the modernization of 55 Chinese jets, at 
a cost of about $10 million per plane. But one defense industry specialist said 
that by some recent projections, the cost overruns could have run as high as 
35% to 40%, for a total of as much as $200 million extra. 
</P>
<P>
Lundquist could not say Monday how much of the total cost China has paid for 
development work.

<P>
Year in and year out, it is perhaps California's most persistent and 
intractable problem. Although the state's overall crime rate fell 11% in the 
last decade, it is still the fourth-highest in the nation -- and violent crime 
continues to rise. 
</P>
<P>
California's crime-wary electorate has sent unmistakable signals to lawmakers 
-- and they have responded with tough new laws that are sending more and more 
criminals to prison. And with huge numbers of parolees going back behind bars, 
mostly on drug-related charges, the number of felons in prisons has leaped from 
22,500 to 88,000 in only 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, California's crime problem has taken on new dimensions, posing 
costly challenges as the state faces the prospect of overflowing corrections 
facilities, even with the projected expenditure of billions of dollars in new 
prison and jail construction. Authorities say California has reached a pivotal 
point -- and the search is on for new alternatives to conventional imprisonment 
and more effective ways to combat crime. 
</P>
<P>
A blue ribbon state commission studying the problem concluded earlier this year 
that the criminal justice system in California is "out of balance" and that 
innovative steps must be taken to reduce prison and jail overcrowding while 
protecting public safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a critical period," says the commission chairman, Riverside County 
Dist. Atty. Grover C. Trask. "If we don't do something, the consequences will 
be that the crime rate will rise, the drug problem will continue to devastate 
our society and members of the law-abiding public will be even more upset with 
the system than they are now." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities envision a wide array of tools and techniques -- some as newfangled 
as high-speed, computerized criminal identification systems and some as 
conventional as expanded drug-treatment programs, intensive probation 
supervision and putting more cops on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
These emerging strategies would cost the taxpayers, of course. But experts say 
that effectively fighting crime in the '90s -- and contending with the vexing 
related problem of illegal drugs -- will require far more than just building 
more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
"The criminal justice system is just overwhelmed," says Jerome H. Skolnick, 
professor of law and social policy at UC Berkeley and a longtime specialist on 
crime and law enforcement. "Whatever we do, there are going to be costs. The 
question is where do we put our money?" 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, the immediate focus for California voters will be two 
measures on the June ballot that will expand prison facilities and harshen 
punishment for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 115, the far-ranging anti-crime initiative, would lengthen terms 
for murderers and criminals who torture their victims, increase the number of 
crimes subject to the death penalty or life in prison without parole, limit the 
state constitutional rights of defendants and try to reduce delay in criminal 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 120 would provide another $450 million in state bonds as part of a 
long-term, $6-billion plan for more prison facilities to house 145,000 inmates 
by 1995 -- six times the number imprisoned in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian is supporting an initiative for the November ballot that 
would allow prisoners to work at private-sector jobs to pay restitution to 
their victims and help defray the costs of incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a Democratic candidate to succeed 
Deukmejian, is promoting another anti-crime initiative in the fall that would 
fund a $1.7-billion program to expand police patrols, establish new 
drug-treatment programs and build low-cost, minimum-security "cocaine prisons" 
for drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
And Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy advocates a "safe streets" initiative for the fall 
ballot that would impose a half-cent sales tax to raise $1.6 billion for law 
enforcement and drug-treatment programs and effectively lengthen prison terms 
for violent criminals and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
In the Legislature, two key measures have been introduced that would implement 
some of the blue ribbon commission's recommendations for providing new options 
for handing criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation sponsored by Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) would provide $15 
million for community corrections facilities for counseling, drug 
rehabilitation, and literacy and mental health programs for as many as 1,000 
parolees, probationers and parole violators. A similar bill by Sen. Bill 
Lockyer (D-Hayward) would provide state funds to counties for jail 
rehabilitation and counseling programs for offenders who otherwise would be 
sent to state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Crime rate data in recent years has provided Californians with good news and 
bad news, with certain types of crime fluctuating greatly. Much of the drop in 
California's overall crime rate has been attributable to a steep drop in 
property crime. Burglary, for example, dropped nearly 34% over the last decade, 
while motor vehicle theft increased 28%. And, for reasons not clear to experts, 
rape in California decreased by more than 22%. 
</P>
<P>
But official data may not indicate the full extent of crime. As Skolnick points 
out, crime rates reflect only offenses reported to police. Public opinion 
surveys may reveal more victims of crime, but those who engage in drug 
transactions, for example, are highly unlikely to reveal it to a questioner. 
</P>
<P>
The stage was set for a steady growth in prison population in 1976, when 
California adopted new determinate-sentencing laws, setting down specific terms 
for judges to impose rather than giving them wide discretion in issuing 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Other changes brought more mandatory sentences, increased burglary terms, 
stiffer penalties for rape and additional prison time for using a gun during 
commission of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the voters approved Proposition 8, the Victims Bill of Rights 
initiative, which among other things, provided for additional five-year terms 
for convicted felons who previously had been found guilty of a serious crime. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in the prison population explosion is the growing number of 
parolees returned to prison for violating the conditions of parole or 
committing new crimes. In 1978, there were barely 1,000 parole violators 
returned to prison, according to the blue ribbon commission. That number jumped 
to 34,000 in 1988 -- representing 45% of the total admissions to prison -- and 
is projected to increase to 83,000 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, drug charges are a primary or contributing factor in nearly 
two-thirds of all parole revocations. One survey in 1988 showed that 92% of the 
parolees sent back to prison from Los Angeles had tested positive for drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"We're running the largest revolving door system in the world," says state 
Assistant Atty. Gen. Brian Taugher. "We give (parolees) $200 when they go out 
the door. That's not enough to make the first and last month's rent. It's only 
enough for one thing: to party." 
</P>
<P>
The ineffectiveness of the parole system is matched by the ineffectiveness of 
the probation system, authorities say. Caseloads are so high, overworked 
probation officers retain only minimal contacts with probationers and many 
officers are forced to "supervise" these released offenders by monitoring 
police reports to see if they have been rearrested. 
</P>
<P>
Sending offenders to prison has logical and political appeal, but it also has 
its limits. Even with the current expansion program, the prison system will 
remain full beyond capacity for at least another five years. And not only is 
prison construction costly, it almost inevitably encounters local opposition 
when a specific project is planned for a specific area. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County, for example, has no state prison but produces about 40% of 
California's inmate population. The Legislature three years ago authorized 
construction of two facilities in the county. But local legislators, citing 
community opposition, have succeeded in blocking the projects. 
</P>
<P>
No one is arguing against placing the most dangerous offenders and career 
criminals in state prisons. But increasingly, the call is heard for expanded 
use of so-called "intermediate" punishments for other offenders, including drug 
abusers, that would provide more flexible and more effective alternatives to 
incarceration. Such options, for example, include: 
</P>
<P>
Intensive-supervision probation. In these programs, certain high-risk offenders 
are subject to rigorous supervision, required to contact their probation 
officers up to five times a week. 
</P>
<P>
Drug rehabilitation. The blue ribbon commission, calling substance abuse the 
"most significant contributing factor" to prison and jail overcrowding, urged 
the development of programs that would ensure that every incarcerated drug 
abuser be required to participate in an anti-drug program. Felony drug arrests 
in California climbed 116% in the past five years and in 1988 surpassed the 
total number of arrests for all property offenses, such as burglary and 
larceny. 
</P>
<P>
House arrest. After conviction, the offender is sentenced to confinement at his 
residence, with exceptions made for employment, medical treatment or religious 
services. Electronic devices may be used to monitor the whereabouts of the 
offender. 
</P>
<P>
Under a program in San Diego, the first of its kind in the state, probationers 
wear an electronic transmitter strapped to their ankles that emits an inaudible 
sound picked up by a receiver connected to their residential telephones. 
Eighty-seven percent of 633 offenders successfully completed court-ordered home 
confinement, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Boot camp. For some offenders, military style regimentation, emphasizing 
physical fitness and hard work, is the alternative to jail in this type of 
program. Such facilities would be less costly to operate and perhaps more 
effective than conventional incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
Community service. These programs have been used for drunk drivers, drug users 
and other nonviolent offenders. Typically, community service is imposed as a 
condition of probation or parole and the offender works for a nonprofit or 
public service organization. 
</P>
<P>
Those and similar options, of course, would be applied after the offense, with 
the aim of reducing the chances of repeated crimes. Some experts also call for 
new emphasis at the "front end" of the system -- with an expanded role for 
police in community efforts to prevent crime. 
</P>
<P>
USC law professor Susan Estrich, a specialist on crime and dangerous offenders, 
would give first priority to expanding police patrols in crime-ridden 
communities -- not only as a deterrent to crime but also as a psychological 
boost to residents. 
</P>
<P>
"The fear of crime can be as big a problem as crime itself," says Estrich. "If 
we get police out on the streets, it introduces a sense of order. You will get 
more people out on the streets and that in itself can make things safer. . . . 
And with more policing, you increase the rate of apprehension." 
</P>
<P>
The oft-made plea for more police has considerable support. But in a time of 
tight fiscal restraints on local governmental budgets, it is far from easy to 
accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, for example, city officials are contending they can no longer 
afford to fund a popular, $3-million-a-year program that established police 
foot patrols in 13 high-crime areas. Preliminary studies found an 11% drop in 
violent crimes in areas where the patrols were deployed. 
</P>
<P>
Many California police departments, in addition to budget restrictions, report 
they also are having trouble recruiting qualified applicants to fill the vacant 
slots. Many applicants cannot meet the mental, physical and background 
requirements. And departments often find themselves competing with each other 
-- or employers in other fields -- for the remaining candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of 100 applicants, you will be lucky if you get three or four who will 
make it through their probationary period," said Norman C. Boehm, executive 
director of the state Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training. 
</P>
<P>
While authorities have yet to find the ultimate weapon in the war on crime, 
they are at work developing and expanding a wide variety of technological 
innovations to help identify, apprehend and convict criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made strides in identifying people that are absolutely astonishing," 
says state prosecutor Taugher. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, he observes, police in the next decade will be able to 
carry a high-tech "little black box" in their squad cars that will enable them 
to electronically scan the fingerprint of a suspect on the scene and within 
moments learn from a centralized computer system who he is and whether he has a 
criminal record or is wanted by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Such devices would help ensure that fewer wanted suspects evade detection -- 
and those who are not being sought would spend less time in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen C. Helsley, assistant director of the state Department of Justice 
investigation and enforcement branch, envisions a much wider use of 
computerized information files, collecting data on everything from evidence 
stored away in police property rooms to laboratory analyses of fuels used in 
arson fires. 
</P>
<P>
A ski mask confiscated for use as evidence against a rape suspect in one locale 
may prove to be the key evidence that could tie the suspect to similar crimes 
in other locales. But at present, he points out, without computer technology, 
police in other jurisdictions would be unaware of the existence of such 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most promising advanced criminal-identification techniques currently 
under development are: 
</P>
<P>
DNA fingerprinting. In this widely hailed innovation, investigators can 
identify suspects by comparing their unique individual genetic codes with the 
code found in samples of hair, blood, skin and semen left at the scene of the 
crime. Although the technique has been challenged in court, its use has won 
preliminary acceptance in California and elsewhere. Supporters cite its value 
in exonerating suspects as well as identifying them. 
</P>
<P>
State officials see the technique as especially valuable in tracking down 
violent criminals -- particularly sex offenders, who tend to repeat their 
crimes. Authorities hope that within five years, DNA samples will be taken from 
every inmate in jail or prison and filed in a data bank of genetic codes for 
quick identification in future cases. 
</P>
<P>
Photo identification. Legislation is pending that would establish a statewide 
computerized photograph system, enabling investigators to identify suspects 
through digitized, electronically transmitted photos. The system would operate 
much like the statewide computerized fingerprint system, credited with solving 
thousands of crimes in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
At present, there is no way to get photographs of suspects, kidnap victims or 
missing children quickly into the hands of authorities throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
Violent crime information. This system is being designed to collect a broad 
range of data on violent offenses -- particularly so-called "serial" crimes, in 
which a single assailant attacks multiple victims over a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Computers will store detailed information on victims, weapons, vehicles, 
physical and forensic evidence and the modus operandi of the attacker. Data 
also will be kept on registered sex offenders and serious habitual criminals. 
As new cases arise, they will be compared by state analysts with existing 
records to see if there is a connection with previous offenses. 
</P>
<P>
But in a revolutionary era, new technology is not only in the hands of the 
law-abiding. Authorities say they will be increasingly challenged in the coming 
decade by the growing use of computers and other new techniques by lawbreakers, 
ranging from embezzlers to drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"Criminals have picked up on the new technology," says Edwin Zedlewski, a crime 
analyst for the National Institute of Justice. "What we're realizing is that to 
pull off certain crimes, you don't have to have a heck of a lot of 
sophistication." 
</P>
<P>
A study by the institute of computer crime noted, for example, how a $3 
million-a-year prostitution ring operated in one metropolitan area with five 
computer workstations, 38 telephone lines and a data base including the names 
and backgrounds of some 80,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
There also are calls for a reinvigorated attack on the underlying, root causes 
of crime and for bolder policies and programs that would confront the problem 
at the basic level of the home, the family and the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not doing a very good job of parenting our children," says Jack Dugan, 
head of the crime prevention center for the state Department of Justice. "We're 
not educating parents on what it takes to rear a child these days. . . . In 
some instances, we have children raising children." 
</P>
<P>
Dugan favors community-based, parental-instruction programs that would help 
attack the fundamental social problems that ultimately lead to crime, 
particularly among juveniles. Such programs, he says, should be offered in the 
public schools, with teachers receiving special training to deal with those 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
All three current candidates for governor -- Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson 
and Democrats Van de Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein -- 
have favored some form of expanded social programs tied to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency looked at the 
prospects of the future generation and found the emerging trends "not 
encouraging." The report predicted the crime problem will become "considerably 
worse" in the next decade, especially within inner-city communities. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited data showing that one in five U.S. children live below the 
poverty line, that increasing numbers of children are being born to unwed 
teen-agers and that the vast majority of single mothers work outside the home, 
leaving large numbers of children without parental supervision much of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, demographic analyses show that in the mid-1990s the children of the 
so-called "baby boomers" will be reaching the crime-prone ages of 16 to 24, 
threatening a new surge in crime rates, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"More of these kids will get in trouble if they are trapped in poverty or 
institutional racism," says Michael E. Jett, a state crime prevention program 
supervisor. "If nothing is done, we're going to develop an underclass of 
deprived and violent people . . . and they will turn this violence on 
themselves or turn it on us." 
</P>

WORST FIRE SEASON IN DECADES SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prolonged drought, bark beetles and a rare fungus are drying out and killing 
brush and trees that surround many Southern California neighborhoods, creating 
the potential for one of the worst wildfire seasons in decades, fire officials 
warned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A map released Monday by the Los Angeles County Fire Department showed that 
some of the most vulnerable fire zones can be found this summer in 
chaparral-covered foothill and mountain-canyon slopes beside densely developed 
residential districts of Los Angeles and its suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
The map was released as the state Department of Forestry officially opened the 
region's 1990 fire season, which means its firefighting crews have been placed 
on higher alert and various fire prevention regulations are now in effect. 
</P>
<P>
While the fire-season announcement came only two to three weeks earlier than 
usual in the vulnerable foothills, it was a full two months ahead of schedule 
in the heavily wooded mountain terrain of Southern California's national 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
"The last really good rainfall was back in '82-83, so our brush really hasn't 
recuperated in seven years," said Gordon Rowley, a fire management specialist 
with the U.S. Forest Service. "Unless we get a hurricane or something -- and 
that's not very likely -- we're going to have a very bad year." 
</P>
<P>
Rowley said other Western states also are experiencing drought, "which means 
they won't be able to send us the firefighting forces they normally can deploy 
out here. . . . It doesn't look good." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, which has an annual average of 14.93 inches of rainfall, has 
received 6.18 inches so far this season, promising to make this the driest 
season in 30 years. The rainfall season, which runs from July 1 to June 30, is 
almost over for 1989-90, and Southern California seldom gets much measurable 
rain in late May and the month of June. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982-83, 31.25 inches of rain fell on the city, more than twice the seasonal 
average. But since then, the annual rainfall here has averaged only 11.57 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
Rowley said the long drought has weakened the vegetation in Southern 
California, making it more vulnerable to disease and infestation by pests. 
</P>
<P>
He said that with normal rainfall, pine trees are vigorous enough to fight off 
bark beetles, which bore into trunks and limbs to lay their eggs. He said 
healthy trees repel the insects with a flow of pitch that suffocates them and 
forces them out of the bark. 
</P>
<P>
But during the current dry spell, the trees haven't been able to produce enough 
sap to rid themselves of the beetles. Rowley said the insects have 
proliferated, killing vast stands of pines and leaving tinder-dry fuel for 
fires. The problem is acute in the Cleveland and San Bernardino national 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
In foothill districts closer to Los Angeles, a fungus that preys upon 
drought-weakened brush has killed as much as 60% of the chaparral in some 
portions of the Santa Monica and San Gabriel mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The fungus, first observed about eight years ago, attacks broad-leafed plants 
such as mountain lilac, manzanita and sumac, some of the more fire-resistant 
species of brush. Officials said large patches of this dead and dying brush now 
mottle the hillsides, ready to burst into flame at the slightest spark. 
</P>
<P>
And because of the drought, even the live brush is more incendiary than usual, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Scott Franklin, a vegetation management officer with the county Fire 
Department, said the dead trees and dry brush combine to form a fuel source so 
volatile that "any ignition now could become a major fire." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials generally have responded to the threat with increased training 
and requests for federal money to pay for extra firefighting personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Each densely thicketed acre of hillside chaparral contains about 60 tons of 
brush, he said, and that 60 tons has about the same fuel energy as 3,750 
gallons of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, if you put 80 m.p.h. winds -- the kind of Santa Anas we get in September 
-- behind all that, a fire can consume 100 acres a minute and keep right on 
going," Franklin said. "You're talking an energy release equivalent to several 
nuclear events, the energy of a number of Hiroshimas." 
</P>
<P>
The county Fire Department map shows that the most threatened residential areas 
include a number of hillside and canyon communities within the city of Los 
Angeles, including parts of Baldwin Hills, Hollywood, the Los Feliz district, 
Tarzana, Encino, Sherman Oaks, Sunland and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Especially threatened suburban communities include portions of Rolling Hills, 
Rancho Palos Verdes, Beverly Hills, Glendale, Pasadena, Altadena, Arcadia, 
Monrovia, Bradbury, Duarte, Azusa, Glendora, Claremont and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Allen, a fire prevention officer with the state Division of Forestry, said 
residents should clear tall grass, brush, trash, firewood and other 
combustibles at least 30 feet from any building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FIRE STRESS AREAS 
</P>
<P>
 Map shows largely undeveloped land where dead brush and a lack of leaf 
moisture in live brush create high fire hazards. Fire officials say these are 
areas where blazes can start and expand rapidly, spreading from open land to 
homes and other structures. 
</P>
<P>
What You Can Do 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials have a number of recommendations for residents of areas where 
the wildfire danger is high: 
</P>
<P>
Clear brush and grass a minimum of 30 feet away from any buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Do not not store firewood, trash or other combustibles within 30 feet of any 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Do not smoke, barbecue or build a campfire outdoors until the rainy season 
resumes in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Do not drive motor vehicles in off-road areas where brush and grass grow. 
Exhaust sparks and hot mufflers start many wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
Do not use an indoor fireplace that is not equipped with a spark-arresting 
device. 
</P>
<P>
In case of fire, turn off all tap water unless instructed otherwise. 
Indiscriminate use of water can lower the pressure to those who need it to 
fight the blaze.

CALIFORNIA'S HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATE FALLS TO 20.4%; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE DECLINE CONTINUES A TREND. SCHOOL CHIEF HONIG CREDITS CAMPUSES 
THAT 'GOT ORGANIZED' TO COMBAT THE PROBLEM.

<P>
Although California continued to chip away at its troubling high school dropout 
rate last year, one in five students from the class of 1989 failed to graduate, 
a state Department of Education report showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Yet schools chief Bill Honig noted the three-year, 20.4% dropout rate for last 
year's graduating class shows steady progress from the 24.9% rate for the class 
of 1986 and the 22.1% for the class of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide average was improved largely by schools that "got organized" to 
do something about their dropout problems, Honig said. He added that many 
schools with no stay-in-school programs saw their rates climb by 10% or more. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a state-funded project in about 200 high schools and other intensive 
efforts to keep youngsters in school, Honig said he is confident the state can 
reach its goal of bringing the dropout rate to no more than 10% by the end of 
the decade. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty happy," Honig said at El Monte High School, where he released 
this year's report in tribute to the school's success in bringing down a 27.5% 
dropout rate while its students, nearly 40% of whom are not native 
English-speakers, increased their scores on the California Assessment Program 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
Using funds provided by a special state program begun about four years ago, El 
Monte hired a dropout-prevention counselor to work intensively with students 
deemed on the verge of quitting school. Through this and other measures, the 
school shaved the rate to 25.6% for the class of 1989, bringing it to within a 
few points of the El Monte Union High School District's average, 22.7% 
</P>
<P>
The state measures the dropout rate by seeing how many youngsters who entered 
the 10th grade left high school without a diploma or its equivalent by the end 
of the 12th grade. A school has 45 days to account for a student who has left 
its campus; if it cannot, the youth is counted as a dropout. 
</P>
<P>
Dropout expert James Catterall of UCLA's Graduate School of Education said the 
new numbers are encouraging. But he cautioned that they do not give a complete 
picture since they do not include the junior high school level, where there has 
been evidence of an increasing dropout problem. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the inevitable variation in the ways individual schools report 
their statistics to the state and the fact that the percentages of students 
earning diplomas each year has remained about the same "makes this a puzzle . . 
. the (decline in dropout rates between 1988 and 1989) could be just a wobble, 
or it could be a good sign," Catterall said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, where the dropout rate overall decreased from 31.8% in 
1986 to 26.4% last year, there were some big trouble spots. In the Lynwood 
Unified School District, more than half of the class of 1989 -- 54.5% -- quit 
before graduation. That gives the 14,000-student district the second-highest 
dropout rate in California. 
</P>
<P>
The district has undergone dramatic changes in its student population, and in 
the last year or so has suffered from some turmoil in its administration. Its 
new superintendent could not be reached for comment on the dropout statistics 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the Compton Unified School District, where officials recently started an 
anti-dropout program that targets children as young as 5 years old, the rate 
climbed to 39.7% for the class of 1989. It was 27.6% for the class of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Other schools or districts posting increases included Alhambra City High 
School, up from 14.6% in 1986 to 20.3% last year, and the Glendale Unified 
School District, up from 12.9% in 1986 to 19.1% last year. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, districts such as Oxnard Union High School in Ventura County used 
state funds and a full-court press by school and community officials to turn 
around a 30.1% dropout rate for the class of 1986, cutting it to 7.8% for the 
class of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Improvements were posted by the financially strapped and overcrowded Los 
Angeles Unified School District and by several smaller Los Angeles County 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
At Belmont High School near downtown Los Angeles, for example, a multifaceted 
program brought the dropout rate from 44.8% in 1988 to 27.7% in 1989. Belmont 
Principal Marta L. Bin, whose 4,500 students represent 80 nationalities and 
speak 26 languages, said progress came "by strengthening the liaison between 
the school and the home." 
</P>
<P>
"We've made many home telephone calls and visits," said Bin, adding Belmont has 
its own dropout counselor, an after-school tutoring program and special 
elective classes. 
</P>
<P>
Some other schools or districts slid badly in their efforts to see that 
students finish high school. Among them was the Oakland Unified School 
District, where the state has stepped in to try to help solve problems ranging 
from poor student achievement to allegations of corruption among 
administrators. The dropout rate climbed from 19.7% in 1986 to 28.4% last year. 
</P>

VAN DE KAMP TRIES TO CAPITALIZE ON FEINSTEIN COMMENTS;

interviewed by The Times figured that Feinstein at least broke even with Van de 
Kamp in Sunday night's little-watched televised debate, and may even have won 
the confrontation.

her," said veteran Democratic political consultant Joseph Cerrell. "That's 
based on style over substance. I just think she came across better." 
</P>
<P>
Ratings for the debate were extremely low. In San Francisco, where the one-hour 
program originated and where it was aired on the NBC affiliate, the debate 
received an overnight rating of 5.4 and a 9 share -- meaning about 120,000 
households tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the debate was carried on public television station KCET and 
received a 0.4 rating and 1 share -- meaning fewer than 20,000 households of 
nearly 5 million in the region tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp conceded to reporters that he had been "a little stiff . . . a bit 
more tense in the beginning than I would have liked." But with only three weeks 
remaining before the primary election and trailing in the polls, he wasted 
little time reflecting on his TV presence. The state attorney general tore at a 
couple of wounds he figured the former San Francisco mayor had inflicted on 
herself in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
One was Feinstein's comment that although she believes in a woman's right to 
choose whether to have an abortion, having an abortion merely for gender 
selection "is a misuse of the right to choose." Later at a press conference, 
Feinstein said she does not consider abortion for gender selection to be "a 
major problem, (but) if it became a major problem, I might very well" sign 
legislation outlawing such abortions. On Monday, she backed away from this 
notion. 
</P>
<P>
Another Feinstein debate gaffe, in Van de Kamp's view, was her comment that she 
would place on the state budget negotiating table the automatic annual cost of 
living adjustments (COLAs) for welfare recipients and the aged, blind and 
disabled. "I found this to be incredible coming from a person who regards 
herself as a Democrat," Van de Kamp told a press conference in Los Angeles on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp also said he was "astounded" at Feinstein's position on abortion 
for gender selection, which he first learned about when it was reported in The 
Times Sunday, hours before the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Feinstein repeatedly has insisted that a woman governor can best be 
trusted to protect abortion rights, Van de Kamp asserted that "what she would 
do is basically get a state police corps, an inquisitor -- you name it -- 
asking women, interviewing women to determine whether or not their reasons for 
abortion are proper. I think that belongs out of government. It's a private 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp clearly relished turning the tables on Feinstein, who for months 
had questioned his commitment to abortion rights because, as a Catholic, he 
personally opposes abortion. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Feinstein was out of public sight. At her San Francisco home, she 
met at length with her campaign staff and then issued a statement trying to 
quell the storm that was building over her remarks on abortion and gender 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
"I am firmly and unequivocally pro choice," she declared. And contradicting her 
earlier, post-debate comment, Feinstein promised that "as governor I would veto 
any measure designed to whittle away at the availability of abortion or to 
infringe upon a woman's right to choose." 
</P>
<P>
She said abortion "is an intensely personal decision that every woman must be 
allowed to make with respect to her own personal and moral beliefs. Government 
should not interfere." 
</P>
<P>
Abortions for gender selection, although believed to be extremely rare in 
California, emerged as a powerful theoretical issue in the gubernatorial race 
as the result of a Times survey of the three major candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The Times asked all three candidates this question: "Do you see any role for 
government in the regulation of abortion beyond the terms of Roe vs. Wade? What 
about some of the ideas now being proposed by the anti-abortion movement -- 
required counseling before abortions, new rights for fathers to contest 
abortions, a ban on abortions for sex selection, a ban on abortions for birth 
control. Could you support any of these?" 
</P>
<P>
It was during this survey that Feinstein said for the first time that abortions 
for sex selection would be an "abuse" of abortion rights. Feinstein told The 
Times she believed these kinds of abortions were not prevalent in the United 
States, as they had been in China. But she added, if they did become numerous 
here, "Government could take a look at it" -- meaning consider new, 
groundbreaking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Feinstein offered this explanation: "Recently, I was asked my 
personal opinion on whether abortion should be used for sex selection as it is 
in China. The U.S. is not China and I do not believe it is an issue here. I see 
no reason for government intervention. I regret that my opponent is once again 
trying to distort my position." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's comments in The Times, during the debate and at the subsequent 
press conference, caused an uproar among abortion rights activists Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was quite shocked," said Robin Schneider, director of the Southern 
California Abortion Rights Action League, which sent Feinstein a letter urging 
her to reconsider her debate stance. "This position came out of nowhere. That 
troubles me." 
</P>
<P>
Norma Clevenger, lobbyist for Planned Parenthood of California, said "everybody 
abhors the thought of selecting a child based on gender. Nobody supports sex 
selection. But a law like that would be impossible to enforce. (Feinstein) did 
catch me off guard because she has been making all the right noises lately. I 
was startled." 
</P>
<P>
One politically neutral academician, Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the Center for 
Politics and Policy at Claremont Graduate School, described the new abortion 
flap as "a little hairline fracture" for Feinstein. "We don't know how severe 
it is yet. . . . We won't know what impact it has until we see how the media 
plays it, how Van de Kamp's campaign uses it and how she responds." 
</P>
<P>
She added that "it may be neutralized by the fact she's a woman." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffe scored the debate overall "a draw." 
</P>
<P>
Larry L. Berg, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC, 
said Feinstein "won in terms of personality. . . . She didn't come across as 
not knowing anything, as some people thought she would. But Van de Kamp didn't 
lose badly because he wasn't as dull as people thought he would be." 
</P>
<P>
Berg added that lawyers, such as Van de Kamp and U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the 
prospective Republican gubernatorial nominee, "do have difficulty talking in 
plain language. . . . Somehow when lawyers talk, very few of them are able to 
communicate what's on their mind and be informative. It doesn't add to ongoing, 
common-sense dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Cain, assistant director of the Institute of Government Studies at UC 
Berkeley, said he "thought Van de Kamp lost some visual points by glancing down 
at the lectern and looking like a dog being beaten" when Feinstein addressed 
him. "He looked dejected, flustered or embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
Several political consultants thought Van de Kamp opened himself to criticism 
as a liberal "tax-and-spender" by advocating higher taxes for high income 
earners. "I kept seeing Walter Mondale up there saying, 'We're going to raise 
your taxes,' " said Ron Smith, a Republican consultant. "My gut reaction was 
she came out a little ahead." 
</P>

Times political writers John Balzar and Cathleen Decker and staff writer Daniel 
M. Weintraub contributed to this article.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE DEBATES 
</P>
<P>
 In their debate Sunday night, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp raised questions and made points that were not 
fully explained. Several of these issues are discussed below, with an analysis 
of each by Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
Issue: Van de Kamp said Feinstein is "backed by the same legislative leaders 
who have blocked" ethics reform in the past and who have "put on the ballot an 
ethics measure that is cynically tied to a huge legislative pay increase." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein has been endorsed by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) and Senate Leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who helped draft 
Proposition 112. The measure could lead to a pay raise, but does not guarantee 
one. Among other provisions, the proposal would create a commission to examine 
legislators' $40,816 annual salary and $88-a-day tax-free living allowance and 
grant a raise if the panel determines it is needed. Supporters of the ethics 
package have suggested tying legislative salaries to the income of Superior 
Court judges, who earn $94,344 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Issue: Feinstein said Van de Kamp "tried not to reveal" the investments of his 
family trust fund and, when the trust's holdings were disclosed, they included 
"14 companies doing business" in the apartheid nation of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Van de Kamp in 1988 fought a Fair Political Practices Commission 
order to fully disclose the details of the trust's investments. Van de Kamp 
lost that battle, and, after the investments were disclosed, he asked the 
trust's administrators to divest their holdings in companies doing business in 
South Africa. "I did not know which ones had any business there, but I asked 
the investment counselor to divest of that stock within a reasonable time and . 
. . he has," Van de Kamp said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Issue: Van de Kamp said that the average prison time served by female felons 
dropped by more than 30% during Feinstein's four years on the Board of Women's 
Terms and Paroles. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: In the 10 years before she was appointed in 1962, the average term 
for female felons dropped from 26 months to 20 months, according to the 
California Department of Corrections. While Feinstein was on the board, the 
average term dropped further to 17 months in 1962, 15 in 1963 and 12 in 1965. 
In her final year on the panel, the average term climbed back to 14 months, and 
it continued to climb steadily after she left the board in 1966. (In a 1964 
memorandum to then-Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, a prison administrator reported 
that the reduction in terms between 1959 and 1963 had prevented overcrowding 
that would have forced the state to build a new women's prison. The memo said 
the recidivism rate "had not increased" and the rate of new prison commitments 
had dropped during that period.) 
</P>
<P>
Issue: Van de Kamp, focusing on the financial background of Feinstein's 
husband, asked, "Why no taxes in '85?" 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein and her husband, investment banker Richard Blum, paid no 
taxes in 1985 because their income of $206,000 was offset by a $319,000 loss 
associated with Blum's investment in the Hotel Carlton in San Francisco, 
according to their accountant. In addition, losses from an investment in 
Farrell's Ice Cream parlors offset other income to a partnership of which Blum 
has a share. Although they paid no taxes in 1985, the couple paid combined 
state and federal taxes of $37,000 in 1986; $80,800 in 1987; $569,000 in 1988, 
and $2.5 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Issue: Feinstein accused Van de Kamp of being lax in investigating and 
prosecuting those who illegally haul and dump toxic waste. She said she told 
Van de Kamp that there were "50 drums of cyanide at loose in the state" but he 
"simply sent that letter to the D.A." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein was referring to 55-gallon drums of cyanide solution from a 
North Hollywood metal-plating company. The cargo was described in apparently 
phony shipping documents as "new products" destined for Mexicali, Mexico. But 
the address listed turned out to be a wheat field. Van de Kamp has referred the 
matter to Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Issue: Van de Kamp said while Feinstein was mayor of San Francisco, the city 
dumped so much sewage into San Francisco Bay that he had to fine her $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Van de Kamp's office in 1985 negotiated a settlement between the 
Regional Water Quality Control Board and the city of San Francisco. The city 
was fined $40,000 for dumping untreated sewage into the bay. The discharges 
occurred while the city, at Feinstein's urging, was building a new sewage 
treatment plant.

I confess I came up here with purposes cynical. It was my aim to attend the 
first-ever television debate between Democratic candidates for governor and 
examine the entrails for evidence of shallowness and lack of the vision thing. 
It looked like an easy day's work. 
</P>
<P>
I was encouraged in my truth-squadding by a colleague who has labored long in 
the political fields. "C'mon up," he said with a wink. "You can't miss. They'll 
never mention Medfly. They'll ignore our crumbling infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, goody, I thought. I would pillory The Feinstein and The Van de Kamp for 
their miserable failure to produce Medfly commentary and infrastructure hoopla. 
I would make ironic contrasts between these etherized candidates and the likes 
of, say, Vaclav Havel in poor but now-ascendant Czechoslovakia. Havel, of 
course, will discuss infrastructure at the drop of a hat. 
</P>
<P>
There was potential here. 
</P>
<P>
So I came to San Francisco, turned on my tape recorder, and waited for all the 
stuff that wouldn't get talked about. Only, it turns out, that wasn't the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, they did talk about it. And talk, and talk, and talk. 
</P>
<P>
OK, maybe they did ignore Medflies. Surely no other subject was spared by these 
two people, who sounded like they had been deprived of Wheaties as children and 
fed shredded Caltrans reports instead. How did they learn to talk like that? 
</P>
<P>
Want some examples? I got examples. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein announced herself aggressive on appointive gender balancing and 
foursquare behind preservation of set-asides for municipal contracts. She 
fence-straddled on indeterminate sentences, warned that the possibility of 
judicial commutation should be expunged, and really pounded COLAs. This last 
item was not a reference to Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp liked Propositions 68, 98, 111, 112, and several others yet to be 
numbered. (Pop quiz: Tell me all you know about Prop. 68.) He grew lyrical over 
Transitional Assistance from the Peace Dividend. And, in fiery defiance of 
Feinstein, he announced his loyalty to COLAs. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what Feinstein said when asked if she would cut COLAs to meet a possible 
state shortfall of $3 billion. This reply, incidentally, was the first question 
of the night and came at the moment when most viewers were trying to decide 
whether to stick with the debate or switch to the Simpsons. Here it comes: 
</P>
<P>
"Let me try to answer this way. I think if the shortfall is $3.3 billion, even 
if Prop. 111 passes, the upward computation will only allow about a billion 
dollars of additional spending. Consequently, $1.5 billion will have to be cut 
from the budget." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Van de Kamp thought this response was "absolutely wrong." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the whole thing was not as bad as that exchange makes it sound. For 
the hundred or so viewers who stuck it out past the first question, the debate 
did have its moments. And it proved why these events, as awkward and clumsy as 
they are, can sometimes provide the turning point in a political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of their hour, Van de Kamp turned to Feinstein and played a card 
he had been holding back. He referred to comments that Feinstein had made to 
John Balzar, a political reporter for this newspaper, that suggested she might 
support laws banning abortions performed for the purpose of sex selection. 
</P>
<P>
A touchy business. The notion of sex selection abortions obviously was 
repugnant to Feinstein, but freedom of choice for women has formed a 
cornerstone of her campaign. If she admitted during a live debate that she 
favored calling in abortion cops to interrogate women about their motives, she 
was running the risk of losing a chunk of her support. 
</P>
<P>
So she waffled. Such abortions were wrong, she said, but pointed out that her 
comments had been made in response to a question about China, where the 
practice was once widespread. The question of an abortion inquisitor for 
California was left unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
Was a lot of damage done? Probably not, because such abortions are still rare 
in this country. But if you watched the debate, you got to see this weak point 
develop in Feinstein's campaign armor and you got to see the uncertainty and 
ambivalence in the candidate's face as she tried to grapple with it. 
</P>
<P>
And that is the value of the debates. Almost alone among all modern campaigning 
devices, debates create an environment of true risk. They are unpredictable and 
dangerous. And that makes them worth watching, even if the candidates don't get 
to the Medfly, even if they seem, sometimes, to speak in a foreign tongue.

<P>
Even for Manila, it was an incongruous scene Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street from the U.S. Embassy, about 2,000 angry demonstrators shouted 
"Yankee go home!" and faced hundreds of helmeted police armed with truncheons, 
tear gas and water cannons. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, scores of visa applicants watched and waited patiently under a shady 
tree outside the U.S. consular office for their chance to join the 40,000 
Filipinos a year who visit the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It was another example of the sometimes surreal love-hate relationship between 
the United States and its former Asian colony. But the increasingly troubled 
alliance will be vital as the two nations square off to decide the fate of six 
American military facilities, and ultimately the future of economic and 
political relations between Washington and Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators will meet today behind closed doors in a wood-paneled conference 
room at the Central Bank for the first round of substantive talks on the bases. 
But remarks made Monday in opening ceremonies suggested that arguments over 
history, pride and money may outweigh those of strategic military needs in the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine chief negotiator and Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, for example, 
ridiculed "elected American officials" who utter "the caustic taunt: How much 
must America pay the Filipinos to protect the Philippines?" 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he argued, the United States has used the Philippines for its own 
military purposes ever since seizing the colony from Spain in 1898. Poor U.S. 
planning, he said, meant that "defeat and devastation were inevitable" when 
Japan invaded the Philippines in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
"Tens of thousands of us were called to the American colors, not to save the 
Philippines . . . but to keep the war from reaching Australia and eventually 
the American mainland," he said. "Even before the Filipino soldier had finished 
fighting and dying for America, he was judged by the American Congress to be 
worth only one-half the pay of the American soldier." 
</P>
<P>
Most galling, Manglapus said, the U.S. Congress has reneged on a 1988 executive 
agreement to pay $481 million a year in military and economic aid to use the 
facilities. The current shortfall, he claimed, is $222.58 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Dollars are important, but it is the solemn word that is here at issue," he 
said. "The bilateral relations of any two nations can look forward to no 
significant future if one cannot count on the other's word." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials insist that the 1989 shortfall is $96 million, and that military 
credits or other arrangements may yet make up the difference. In any case, they 
argue, the bases provide jobs to 68,000 Filipinos, second only to the 
Philippine government, and pump $1 billion into the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
When it was his turn, U.S. special negotiator Richard L. Armitage mixed kind 
words with veiled threats. "It troubles me," he said, "when I hear some 
Filipinos assert that American use of Philippine military bases can only be a 
vestige of the colonial relationship, that the Philippines can never be truly 
free, truly independent and truly democratic until the Americans are gone, once 
and for all. 
</P>
<P>
"It troubles me because it understates, for reasons I cannot fathom, the 
contribution the Philippines has made and still makes to peace and stability in 
Asia," Armitage added. "It troubles me because it suggests a belief that our 
mutual sacrifices have been essentially meaningless." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, the United States is prepared to leave if asked. If no mutual 
interests are found, he said, "then we have precious little to discuss other 
than the terms of an amicable separation." 
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, if separation is your desire, let us move to that end with speed, 
confidence and goodwill," he added. "If our mutual interests cannot sustain us 
as partners, let us part as friends." 
</P>
<P>
Current leases for the bases, which include giant Clark Air Base and Subic Bay 
Naval Base, expire in September, 1991. The "exploratory" talks will determine 
whether to start formal negotiations to extend or modify the leases. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the talks was overshadowed by the shooting deaths of two Air Force 
enlisted men Sunday night by suspected Communist guerrillas outside Clark. The 
dead airmen were identified as John H. Raven, 19, of Delta Junction, Alaska, 
and James C. Green, 20, of Craig, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Defense Fidel V. Ramos said he had ordered an "extensive manhunt" 
for the killers. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist New People's Army, in a statement, stopped short of claiming 
responsibility for the killings, the British news agency Reuters said, but 
warned "national traitors" such as President Corazon Aquino that they will be 
tried and punished for having "sold your nation to U.S. imperialism." 
</P>
<P>
Reuters also reported that at least 25 police officers and 30 anti-base 
protesters were hurt in several violent clashes. At least 80 people were 
arrested near the site of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, United Press International reported, a coalition of church 
groups and a retired naval officer urged the United States to give up the bases 
and arrange a two- to three-year transition to ease the shock to the nation's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Church Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines and retired Adm. Gene 
La Rocque, head of the Center for Defense Information, said at a news 
conference that Clark and Subic Bay do not serve the defense interests of 
either the United States or the Philippines.

Weeping Lebanese women, with photographs of their relatives pinned to their 
chests, held a protest Monday to plead for release of their family members from 
Israeli jails. 
</P>
<P>
They said they want Western hostages in Lebanon freed only if their relatives 
are also released. 
</P>
<P>
At least 50 women, many aged and shrouded in black chadors, marched to a south 
Beirut house belonging to the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon to plead for 
their relatives, hundreds of whom are held in Khiam prison in Israel's 
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen and heard how the world was moved and the West enraged about a 
few Westerners who were kidnaped in Lebanon," cried one woman marcher who 
refused to give her name. "But unfortunately, we have not seen or heard the 
least interest in our . . . sons held hostage in Zionist prisons." 
</P>
<P>
At least 15 Westerners, including six Americans, are held hostage by extremist 
groups in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. hostages were released last month. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, senior Irish diplomat Antoine Mac Unfraidh arrived in Beirut to 
pursue efforts to secure the release of Brian Keenan, a Northern Irishman with 
dual Irish-British citizenship kidnaped in 1986.

their relatives, demanded the release of their family members from Israeli 
jails. The protesters in Beirut urged that Western hostages in Lebanon be freed 
only if their relatives are also let go. Said one marcher: "We have seen how 
the world was moved and the West enraged about a few Westerners who were 
kidnaped in Lebanon. But unfortunately, we have not seen the least interest in 
our . . . sons held hostage in Zionist prisons." Reuters

ISRAEL TO REOPEN 6 UNIVERSITIES IN WEST BANK AND GAZA STRIP

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Monday ordered the gradual reopening of six 
Palestinian universities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that 
have been closed for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
The move is likely to improve Israel's relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
They have been strained in recent weeks over Shamir's increasing Jewish 
settlement activity in the occupied lands. 
</P>
<P>
The army closed the six universities shortly after a Palestinian uprising broke 
out in December, 1987. The government said the universities were hotbeds of 
anti-Israeli violence. The United States and Western Europe had sharply 
criticized the measure as collective punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said Monday that the prime minister instructed his 
adviser for the occupied lands, Shmuel Goren, to meet with the heads of the 
universities to discuss conditions of the reopening. 
</P>
<P>
Goren said the first university will open within two days. There are five 
universities in the West Bank and one in the Gaza Strip, with a total of 18,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said authorities were encouraged by the declining bloodshed in 
recent months, Goren told reporters that if violence recurs, the facilities 
will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
Pazner and Goren denied that the decision is aimed at appeasing the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope it will bring us a good reaction from the United States and Europe, 
but our main consideration was security," Goren said. 
</P>
<P>
The six universities are Bethlehem University, Islamic University, Birzeit 
University, Hebron University, An-Najah University and Jerusalem University.

The United States and Iran have signed an agreement settling 2,795 small U.S. 
claims, as well as a few U.S. government claims against Tehran, with a lump-sum 
payment of $105 million to the United States, State Department officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed Sunday at The Hague after nine years of talks, will allow 
U.S. and Iranian negotiators to concentrate on large financial disputes dating 
to the 1979 Islamic revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major disputes yet to be settled by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal at 
The Hague is Iran's claim of more than $10 billion for undelivered U.S. 
military goods and services.

4 KILLED IN ATTACK ON HIGH-STAKES TEXAS DICE GAME

Masked men wearing camouflage clothes and ski masks burst in on a high-stakes 
dice game and opened fire Monday, killing four people and wounding three. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfire erupted at the Glass Key Cafe, a bar in a poor neighborhood known 
to police as a gambling and drug hangout and the scene of a similar attack last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Four men broke into the game, shouted "task force," and began shooting, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 15 people were inside. 
</P>
<P>
Some scrambled into a back room, and others ran outside to escape the gunfire, 
Police Chief Thomas Windham said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to have been a robbery of a gambling game," Windham said. "We have 
information that it was an extremely high-dollar gambling game with tens of 
thousands of dollars involved." 
</P>
<P>
The chief did not know if the gunmen got any money before escaping in a car. 
</P>
<P>
The clothes and "task force" reference could have been intended to make the 
gamblers think they were being raided by police, Police Capt. Randy Ely said. 
He noted similar tactics were used in a March attack on another gambling spot 
in which one person was slain. 
</P>
<P>
The bar's owner told reporters that two men entered the lounge, robbed several 
patrons who were sitting around drinking coffee and then began firing what he 
described as semiautomatic weapons.

STAR MIX-UP SNAGS TELESCOPE FOCUSING

The Hubble Space Telescope's gaze was diverted to an unexpectedly bright star 
during its first test-focusing, so the observatory's first picture-taking has 
been delayed again, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5-billion telescope, which officials had hoped would snap its first 
image of the heavens by Friday, will not be ready to take a picture before 
Saturday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, NASA astronomer Edward Weiler said, the telescope's myriad electronic 
systems were operating properly and other work necessary to activate it was 
running ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
In five attempts over the weekend, the telescope failed to find and lock onto 
certain "guide stars" to fix its position for a 36-hour focusing process, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA engineers believe that the unexpected brightness of one star in its view 
caused the telescope to mistake it for one of the guide stars. 
</P>
<P>
After the problem was discovered, engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center 
in Greenbelt, Md., and Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., 
instructed the telescope to ignore that star so the focusing procedure could be 
resumed, and it was repeated successfully Monday night.

The drivers' union striking Greyhound Lines Inc. scored a victory Monday when a 
federal investigator said that the company engaged in unfair labor practices in 
the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
That finding, if upheld by the National Labor Relations Board, could result in 
the company being forced to give the striking drivers their jobs back. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Hunter, general counsel for the NLRB, on Monday authorized the board's 
regional office in Milwaukee to file an unfair labor practice complaint against 
Greyhound, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
If the NLRB files the complaint and it is eventually upheld, it could force 
Greyhound to give back to union members the 3,000 jobs that the company has 
given strikebreakers since the strike began March 2.

WHITE HOUSE EASES OFF THREAT TO VETO MAJOR CIVIL RIGHTS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The White House began backing away Monday from a veto threat against a major 
piece of civil rights legislation now before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in the bill are "moving in the right direction" White House spokesman 
Marlin Fitzwater said shortly before President Bush met with a coalition of 
civil rights leaders. "The President would like to sign a civil rights bill," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Administration officials earlier this month had downplayed the changes 
that Fitzwater touted Monday. The officials had told key members of Congress 
that the amendments were not sufficient to bring Administration support for the 
bill. But the veto threat issued last month by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh has 
put the White House in a politically difficult position and Bush has become 
increasingly eager to find a face-saving compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have the votes, there's not a lot you can do," said one 
Administration official who opposes the bill. Very few members of Congress are 
willing to go on record as opposing a civil rights measure, the official noted, 
and "it obviously will be very difficult to veto." 
</P>
<P>
The bill will be a "litmus test" for Bush's commitment to civil rights, NAACP 
President Benjamin L. Hooks said after meeting with the President. 
</P>
<P>
The bill in question would reverse several major Supreme Court decisions that 
significantly weakened federal laws barring racial discrimination on the job. 
It also would significantly expand at least one aspect of the job 
discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
Business groups say that it would greatly increase the costs of complying with 
anti-discrimination laws and could lead to quota systems. Civil rights groups 
deny that, saying the bill is needed to restore protections. 
</P>
<P>
At his hour-long meeting with heads of several major black organizations, Bush 
asked that civil rights groups send a team of lawyers to meet with Justice 
Department officials to work out compromise language. Black leaders who 
attended the meeting left in high spirits. Bush plans similar meetings 
Wednesday with leaders of organizations representing women, disabled persons, 
religious minorities and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"We're optimistic" about the chances of working out a deal, said John Jacobs of 
Black Leadership Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone really wants to be on the same side," said Thaddeus Garrett, a 
Washington consultant and former Bush aide. 
</P>
<P>
Some hard bargaining will be necessary, however. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous gap" that remains between what the Administration has 
supported so far and what civil rights leaders want, said Drew Days III, a 
former assistant attorney general for civil rights who now teaches at Yale Law 
School and who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation sponsored by Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. 
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), would cover five major civil rights issues. So 
far, the Administration has been willing to discuss only two of them and on 
those two issues has taken a far more restricted position than the civil rights 
groups support. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial involves employment practices such as screening tests or 
hiring standards that have the effect of reducing minority employment, even if 
they were not intended to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, those practices are illegal unless there is a "business 
necessity" for them. Since 1971, the employer has had the burden of proving 
that the practice under challenge is necessary for a nondiscriminatory reason. 
But in a major case last year, the Supreme Court said that it would now be up 
to plaintiffs to prove the practice was not necessary. That burden is far more 
difficult for plaintiffs to meet. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would reverse that ruling, but business groups and civil rights 
lawyers have been deadlocked in trying to redefine how the "business necessity" 
defense should work. If the defense is not strong enough, business 
organizations say, the only safe practice will be to hire by quota to ensure 
that suits will not be brought.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER;

GARAMENDI OBJECTS TO FORMAT; DEBATE CANCELED 
</P>

<P>
An apparent last chance for a televised debate in the Democratic and Republican 
primary contests for insurance commissioner has disappeared with a decision by 
KCET, the Los Angeles public station, to cancel plans to air such a debate six 
days before the June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Thompson, KCET's director of news and current affairs, said Monday that 
arrangements by the station to put on a program featuring the two leading 
candidates in the polls in both parties collapsed when state Sen. John 
Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) said he would not appear unless all seven Democratic 
candidates and five Republicans were on the show. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said the station felt that with so many candidates, any opportunity to 
make the show "a meaningful exchange of ideas" would be lost. On the Democratic 
side, he said, "The polls all told us this was clearly a two-person race, 
between Bill Press and John Garamendi." 
</P>
<P>
The news director acknowledged that the Press campaign was "very, very, very 
strong in their opinion they wanted it to be a two-person debate," and had made 
such a request, but he said the station had decided on that approach on its 
own. If there had been a third candidate in one of the parties up near the 
leaders, "we would have invited him," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
A California Field Poll released at the end of last week showed that among 631 
registered Democrats surveyed, 16% favored Press, 13% Garamendi, 4% Walter 
Zelman, 3% Ray Bourhis, 2% Conway Collis, 2% Larry Murphy and 1% Michael 
Blanco. The other 59% were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Among 550 registered Republicans, 9% favored Wes Bannister, 9% John Hardin, 5% 
Joseph Dunlop, 4% Tom Skornia and 4% John Perise. 
</P>
<P>
KCET's decision to abandon both sides of the debate because one of the leading 
Democrats would not go along was criticized Monday by Zelman, who said that the 
station is allowing itself to be "manipulated" and should have invited 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Democratic contest, letters surfaced giving new indications 
that Garamendi has important insurance industry support and Press important 
trial lawyer support in their respective campaigns. The insurers and the trial 
lawyers are the two groups with the greatest financial stake in regulation by 
the new commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to attorneys whose practice is defending insurance companies, 
Michael J. Brady, an officer in the Assn. of Defense Counsel, backed Garamendi 
and asked insurance defense lawyers to contribute to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Describing Garamendi as a "conservative Central Valley Democrat," Brady called 
him the "one candidate in this race whose goal is to maintain a healthy 
California insurance industry while at the same time looking out for the 
interests of California consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Brady said in an interview he had told Garamendi of his plans to send the 
letter and the senator had no objection. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, in a letter to lawyers who file cases against insurance 
companies, J. Gary Gwilliam, a former president of the California Trial Lawyers 
Assn. and long one of its most influential members, said that Press is the best 
candidate and called upon trial lawyers to each give him $250 or $500.

S.F. CHINATOWN SHOOTINGS MAY BE TIED TO GANG

Police say a Monday morning street shooting near Chinatown that left one man 
dead and a pregnant woman and six others injured may be related to Asian gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Inspector Art Gerrans said several of the victims, all of them Asians, had a 
"history of gang-related activity," but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the victims were former employees of an Emeryville gambling 
establishment popular with Asians. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, all San Francisco residents, had just left the Purple Onion 
nightclub at the edge of Chinatown at about 2 a.m. when they were fired upon as 
they entered two cars parked about a block from one another, police said. 
Michael Bit Chen Wu, 35, was killed by the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are looking for two suspects. The gunmen simultaneously 
approached each car and began firing shots through the windows while circling 
the vehicles, officers said. They said at least one of the suspects was Asian. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the injured were hospitalized. Margaret Lee, 26, who is four months 
pregnant, was listed in serious to critical condition after undergoing surgery 
for a hip wound. A seventh victim was treated at the scene for a minor injury. 
</P>
<P>
Police also speculated that the shootings may have stemmed from a gambling 
dispute. Three of the victims worked at the King Midas Club, which offers the 
popular Asian game pai gow, Gerrans said. Played with a form of dominoes, the 
game often has stakes as high as $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wu oversaw three pai gow tables until he quit more than a month ago, said Mike 
Connolly, King Midas security supervisor. Margaret Lee and her brother, Raymond 
Lee, 40, who was also wounded in Monday's attack, had been dealers at the club 
until quitting four months ago, Connolly said.

MODEL CITIZEN SEIZED AS ONE OF 10 MOST WANTED IN MARYLAND

A convicted rapist and bank robber who was one of Maryland's 10 most-wanted 
fugitives apparently lived as a "mild-mannered, polite" model citizen in 
Southern California for nearly 10 years -- even helping set up a neighborhood 
crime watch -- until his capture Monday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Moses Herman Fisher, 45, using the alias Michael E. Johnson, worked as an 
appliance salesman and had no criminal record in California, police said. 
</P>
<P>
His wife of four years, who is seven months pregnant, was stunned when she 
learned that her husband was a wanted man after police and FBI agents knocked 
on the door of their Sun Valley apartment in the northeastern San Fernando 
Valley at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"She had no idea," Detective Eugene Edwards said. "She was quite surprised and 
upset. So was he." 
</P>

Fisher has been sought by Maryland authorities since October, 1980, when he 
fled from the Brockbridge Correctional Facility in Jessup, Md., while on a work 
detail, Edwards said. Fisher was placed on the the state's 10 most-wanted 
fugitives list this year and described as possibly armed and dangerous, Edwards 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher had been serving a life term plus 15 years for two rapes, a bank robbery 
and three counts of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police found him after authorities in Maryland received an 
anonymous tip on his whereabouts, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher had lived at the apartment for two years and recently started work as a 
salesman at a discount store in Sun Valley, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Art Michener, manager of Discount Sales, said he hired "Johnson" earlier this 
month and was shocked to learn Monday that his new employee was a fugitive. 
"Surprise is not even close," to describing his reaction, Michener said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a mild-mannered, polite guy. He would do anything I asked him to do. I 
thought I had found the ideal employee." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Fisher previously worked for several years as an assembler for 
Xerox in El Segundo and may have lived in that area and possibly San Diego, 
where a driver's license under the name Michael E. Johnson was first issued in 
1981. A Xerox spokesman, however, said "Johnson" worked there for only two 
months last year. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley Gibson, Fisher's next-door neighbor, took him to Discount Sales to apply 
for a job after he was laid off from Xerox. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very shocking. I can't believe he is who they say he is. People change 
and I don't see Mike as being what they say he is. If it is true, it's a 
Jekyll-and-Hyde personality. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, he is an outstanding citizen. We were setting up a community 
watch program at our complex. Everybody knew that if they had a problem they 
could come to him to get it fixed." 
</P>
<P>
He said Fisher put up signs in the complex encouraging residents to join the 
crime-watch group. "He has been a very good tenant," said Jaga Ostapowicz, 
manager of the apartment complex where Fisher lived. "This is shocking. I said, 
'No, no, no, this can't be,' when I heard." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher was being held without bail in the Parker Center jail.

NEA ADVISERS NIX GRANTS AFTER MAPPLETHORPE; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: $80,000 FOR A UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE IS THREATENED DUE TO THE PHOTO 
CONTROVERSY. AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON THE ARTS DEFERS A DECISION ON THEATER 
AID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The advisory body to the National Endowment for the Arts has recommended denial 
of two grants totaling $80,000 to the University of Pennsylvania's Institute 
for Contemporary Art, which last year was swept up in the controversy over work 
by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, the National Council on the Arts voted to defer a 
decision -- perhaps until August -- on 18 theater grants characterized as 
potentially controversial. 
</P>
<P>
The votes were seen by NEA sources as a victory for endowment opponents and as 
setting up an even more fractious debate over whether the NEA has caved in to 
political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions, contended one council member, opened divisions within the arts 
council, apparently splitting it into two factions. 
</P>
<P>
One includes members who favor clamping down on the content of NEA-funded art. 
The second faction contends that the crackdown may destroy the NEA's 
traditional strong support for cutting-edge artists. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob Neusner, a conservative member of the national council, characterized the 
vote to turn down the two grants to the Pennsylvania institute as "an enormous 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
Sources indicated that the recommendation to reject two of three grants to the 
ICA may have been invalid because fewer than half of the national council 
members were present. Apparently intent on avoiding parliamentary mistakes that 
could invalidate council actions, NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer briefly 
halted the council meeting on Friday because a quorum was not present. 
</P>
<P>
The action of the National Council on the Arts took place in closed session 
Sunday after a weekend open meeting at which council members heard that the 
14-month-old political campaign against the NEA has apparently inflicted major 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the secret actions emerged Monday morning. Ironically, in its open 
sessions, the council had voted to hold future grant deliberations in public. 
</P>
<P>
The actions came as the NEA faces deterioration in its political support. 
Endowment staff members warned the council Friday that opposition may be 
insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
The council was told the NEA's political situation has deteriorated so 
significantly -- at least in the House of Representatives -- that it may be 
nearly impossible for the agency to undergo renewal of its legislative mandate 
to exist this year without Draconian controls being placed on the content of 
art it can fund. At the same time, the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies 
circulated a proposal to strip the NEA of much of its ability to support 
working artists and transfer 60% to 65% of its money to state arts councils. 
</P>
<P>
The vote against ICA was reportedly 6-to-5. The council has a total membership 
of 26 but there are three vacancies. The 11 people participating in the ICA 
vote fell short of a majority even of the 23-person current membership. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, sources said, the council voted 8-to-4, with three 
abstentions, to defer action on 18 proposed recipients of solo performance 
fellowships. 
</P>
<P>
The vote to delay action on the theater fellowships until the next scheduled 
meeting of the NEA advisory board in August came after conservative columnists 
Rowland Evans and Robert Novak attacked New York performance artist Karen 
Finley. 
</P>
<P>
The Evans and Novak column characterized Finley as a "nude, chocolate-smeared 
young woman" who would use her $12,000 fellowship to create an offensive and 
possibly obscene performance. They contended that other troublesome grants were 
about to be approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
The columnists objected in particular to a performance piece by Finley called 
"We Keep Our Victims Ready," a feminist diatribe in which Finley ends up 
partially naked, smeared with chocolate intended to simulate cow dung and 
festooned with alfalfa sprouts playing the role of sperm. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared for this," she said in a telephone interview of her role in the 
controversy. "What I'm doing and thinking about as an artist -- but really 
first as an American citizen -- is (that this is) a problem of freedom of 
expression. For me as a female it would be outrageous that I am not allowed to 
talk about or make work deconstructing feminist imagery and trying to challenge 
the fact that there has been oppression of women for generations." 
</P>
<P>
In the closed session, it was learned, four solo performance fellowship 
applicants were attacked. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA declined on Monday to confirm details of the council votes on rejected 
or deferred grants applications. However, Judith Tannenbaum, assistant director 
of the ICA, provided details of all three, concluding that the council action 
is "quite terrifying." 
</P>
<P>
Tannenbaum said the rejections are a clear indication the NEA has buckled under 
pressure to function as a guarantor that publicly funded artworks will 
studiously avoid controversial content. "It's an enormous loss for the cultural 
life of the country," Tannenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
ICA came to prominence in the arts endowment controversy last year as the 
organizer of a show of work by Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS in March, 1989. 
ICA received a $15,000 national endowment grant to support the show's 
catalogue. When the images emerged as a focal point of the congressional 
firestorm over the NEA, the House and Senate voted to require the endowment to 
notify Congress specifically whenever a grant for ICA or the Southeastern 
Center for Contemporary Art was to be awarded. 
</P>
<P>
SECCA -- ironically headquartered in Winston-Salem about 5 miles from where the 
National Council on the Arts met -- was a role-player in the crisis over its 
role in organizing a show including a photograph of a crucifix immersed in 
urine. 
</P>
<P>
NEA sources said the endowment's museum program recommended approval of three 
grants to ICA -- for $40,000 each -- but decided to recommend funding for just 
one, though it was not immediately clear which of the three was accepted. The 
council's recommendations are not binding on Frohnmayer, who was reported in 
Chapel Hill, N.C., on personal business Monday and unavailable.

LA JOLLA OFFERS AN 'ORCHARD' WORTHY OF THE MASTER

<TEXT>
<P>
It's really very simple. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that a production need do no more (and no less) than be faithful to 
a great play tends to be viewed either as self-evident or merely simplistic and 
gets regularly ignored. But the greatest wisdom quite often lies in the most 
obvious course. If anyone wanted proof, they need look no further than the La 
Jolla Playhouse's new production of Anton Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard." 
</P>
<P>
Two things predominate in the staging that opened Sunday at the Mandell Weiss 
Theatre: judgment and talent. One thing is missing: gimmicks. From Elisaveta 
Lavrova's silken translation of the text, to director Tom Moore's passionate 
take on the play and the enchanted trees and tracery of Heidi Landesman's set, 
this inaugural production of La Jolla's 1990 season is a feast for the heart -- 
measured, graceful, eloquent. 
</P>
<P>
The play is set in its own time and place: turn of the century Russia, where 
serfdom was a thing of the past and revolution still a thing of the future. On 
the Ranevsky estate, past and future meet in an uneasy present. The aristocracy 
is superannuated and the sons of serfs are feeling their new muscle. Time and 
money are running out. But still the balalaikas play, and even though there are 
no rubles with which to face the music, no one wants to acknowledge the coming 
of the ax. 
</P>
<P>
Chekhov's symbolism is broader here, in his last play, than in any other. The 
magnificent cherry orchard, renowned for its vastness, surrounds the house like 
a fortress. It is the silent watchman in whose fall dynasties will collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Within the house, Chekhov has woven his usual intricate tapestry of 
interrelated lives -- the old guard and the new. Mistress of the mansion, the 
giddy Ranevskaya (Lynn Redgrave), is newly returned from Paris where she has 
squandered love and money. Like her effete and ineffectual brother Gaev (Bill 
Ball), she can't cope with impending financial disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Ineptitude and paralysis will lose them the estate. An elaborate retinue of 
offspring, tutors, servants, friends and other neighbors takes part in this 
final, mirthless and tragically comical dance of death. In the end, when the 
shrewd and stolid Lopakhin (Mark Harelik) acquires the orchard at auction, we 
watch the new order triumph inexorably over the old as this former serf, drunk 
on new-found wealth and sudden power, brings down the emblematic trees. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever suspense was intended in watching the mighty fall has long given way 
to marveling at how skillfully Chekhov has etched these interconnecting lives. 
Nowhere is good acting more crucial than on this kind of chessboard where 
portraiture is everything. 
</P>
<P>
Casting is exemplary in this "Orchard." Aside from the actors already mentioned 
(who deliver burnished and distinctive characterizations), it is the blending 
of strongly individual performances at the heart of a beautifully orchestrated 
ensemble that places this production near the top of a handful of memorable 
American stagings of Chekhov -- including the Old Globe's "Uncle Vanya" earlier 
this year. (How lucky can San Diego get?) 
</P>
<P>
Ball, who is the former artistic director of San Francisco's American 
Conservatory Theatre and has been away from the stage for 28 years, delivers a 
pathetically weak, tenderly modulated Gaev. Redgrave's tremulous Ranevskaya 
makes it easy to see why no one resists her -- and Molly Hagan is a daughter 
worthy of this mother as the beautiful Anya, richly detailing a role too often 
left unexplored. 
</P>
<P>
Mia Dillon's unhappy Varya, Peter Frechette's "moth-eaten" tutor, Robert 
Cornthwaite's graceful Firs, Cheryl Giannini's sturdy and amusing Charlotta, 
William Youmans' haplessly comical Yepikhodov and Tracey Leigh's Dunyasha all 
stand out. Harelik's final intoxicated rantings over his purchase of the estate 
is as harrowing as it is impotent and explosive. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, it is director Moore who deserves a large portion of the credit for 
having chosen so well. There is not a wrong move in this "Orchard," from Robert 
Blackman's lavish costumes, to Peter Maradudin's mood-setting lights, John 
McKinney's and Mel Marvin's original music and Jean Isaacs' dances. It's one 
not to miss. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mandell Weiss Theatre, La Jolla Village Drive and Torrey Pines Road, 
Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; matinees Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m., until 
June 17. $20-$26; (619) 534-3960.

ALAN PARKER'S SENTIMENTAL 'PARADISE' A HIT IN CANNES; 
</P>
<P>
FESTIVAL: AFTER 'MISSISSIPPI BURNING,' THE ENGLISH DIRECTOR SOFTENS HIS 
APPROACH IN DEALING WITH THE U.S. INTERNMENT OF JAPANESE-AMERICANS DURING WORLD 
WAR II. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it was announced that Alan Parker was going to follow his hotly debated 
"Mississippi Burning" with a story about the internment of Japanese-Americans 
during World War II, the general reaction among film journalists was: "Here we 
go again." 
</P>
<P>
While the historical and cultural accuracy of "Come See the Paradise" will have 
to wait until Columbia Pictures opens the film in the United States late in the 
year, the only debate prompted by its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival 
Sunday was whether Parker has gone soft. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the film is much softer in attitude than my earlier films," Parker 
said after the first screening of "Come See the Paradise." "I deliberately 
wanted to do something that would show the more mellow side of me." 
</P>
<P>
Parker, an English director living and working in Los Angeles, acknowledged 
that the sting of criticism he felt over "Mississippi Burning" influenced the 
way he approached the subject of his newest film. 
</P>
<P>
"It was deliberate, sure, it must have been," Parker said. "I knew there would 
be a strong reaction to 'Mississippi Burning,' but the controversy got so out 
of hand that the film got left behind. I have to be much more sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
What fueled the backlash to "Mississippi Burning" was Parker's depiction of 
white FBI agents as heroes in the investigation of Klan killings of civil 
rights workers in the South in the early 1960s. Although many critics thought 
that film was brilliantly made, most agreed with black leaders who accused 
Parker of turning history on its head, and the white heat of the debate took 
"Mississippi Burning" out of an Oscar race it otherwise might have won. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of that film -- it did a lot of good (by creating that debate)," 
Parker said. "But the criticism was valid." 
</P>
<P>
Yet if Parker -- who considers his views to be on the political left -- let a 
good story get in the way of the truth on "Mississippi Burning," he wasn't 
about to repeat the mistake with "Come See the Paradise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new film condemns something few rational people would condone and is told 
in a way that seems about as provocative as "Love Is a Many Splendored Thing." 
</P>
<P>
In "Paradise," Dennis Quaid plays an angry pro-labor Irish-American whose 
marriage to a young Japanese-American woman is interrupted by World War II and 
the internment of his wife and her family in a camp in the desert of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the film deals with the developing love story; the second 
half deals with the effects of the internment on his wife's Japanese-American 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Parker said he set out to show the cultural conflicts in an interracial 
marriage of first generation Americans, then decided to set it against the 
backdrop of the camps. 
</P>
<P>
Critics here were divided by the film's unabashed sentimentality, but one-third 
of the way into the 12-day festival, "Paradise" has easily been the biggest hit 
with general festival-goers. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm getting old," Parker joked when asked at a press conference why he 
had abandoned the violence and hard-edged tone of such films as "Midnight 
Express" and "Angel Heart." "Normally, the question is, 'Why do I show so much 
violence?' This is the first time I've been asked why there isn't more." 
</P>
<P>
People looking for contemporary issues in "Paradise" will be making work for 
themselves too, said Parker. Although the film clearly points up that the 
internment of the Japanese-Americans was as much an act of economic racism as a 
response to the paranoia about Japanese agents in our midst, he said he did not 
intend it as a comment on the current wave of anti-Japanese xenophobia. 
</P>
<P>
"The parallel may be there," he said. "Certainly, the Japanese-American 
community was gaining up economic strength when the war broke out. But we can't 
overlook the obvious -- the U.S. was at war with Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Parker said that, partly because of the "Mississippi Burning" experience, he 
sought out the opinions "of thousands" of Japanese-Americans across the country 
before finishing his script for "Paradise" and that he's confident of its 
accuracy. Three of the Japanese-American actors -- Tamlyn Tomita, who plays 
Quaid's wife, Sab Shimono, her father, and Stan Egi, one of her screen family 
brothers -- agreed with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Alan made such an effort to tell the story truthfully and correctly," said 
Shimono, who spent part of his early childhood in an internment camp. "It's not 
just a movie for a movie's sake." 
</P>
<P>
Parker said that he doesn't expect a backlash to "Paradise" but that he isn't 
taking anything for granted anymore. "In the end, it's the members of the 
Japanese-American community who will make the judgment (about the accuracy of 
the movie)." 
</P>
<P>
"Come See the Paradise" is the third Alan Parker film to compete for the Palm 
d'Or Award. The others were "Bugsy Malone" and "Midnight Express." 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference here, Parker joked that he envisions himself at age 80 
being presented with a special Palm d'Or "for the most films ever at Cannes 
never to win." There are many here who think his losing streak is about to end. 
</P>
<P>
Does watching foreign-language films at Cannes sound like fun to you? Consider: 
When non-French language films are shown here, the subtitles are in French and 
English-only viewers follow along with earphones through which a translator 
relays information and dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the sanitized slang ("Oh you jerks, oh you darn jerks!"), the 
translators often forget to turn on their microphones, leaving English speakers 
wondering what's being said. 
</P>
<P>
At a screening of the Soviet film "Taxi Blues," the translator lapsed into a 
recitation of the Mt. Fuji episode of "Akira Kurosawa's Dreams" before righting 
herself and returning to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"Come See the Paradise" is the early audience favorite here, but critics have 
been more taken with Pavel Lounguine's "Taxi Blues" and Ryszard Bugayski's "The 
Interrogation." 
</P>
<P>
"Taxi Blues" is a Soviet film about a taxi driver who develops an odd 
relationship with a passenger who runs off without paying. "The Interrogation" 
is an 8-year-old Polish movie about a woman wrongfully imprisoned as a spy 
during Stalin's inquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"The Interrogation" was banned in Poland and smuggled out on videotape by 
Bugayski when he defected to Canada several years ago. The film finally 
premiered in Poland last fall. Krstyna Janda, who plays the imprisoned woman, 
is the early favorite here for the best actress award. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the most anxiously awaited film of this year's festival -- at 
least for Americans -- is David Lynch's "Wild at Heart." 
</P>
<P>
The success of Lynch's "Twin Peaks" TV series has pushed the quirky director 
into the spotlight, and "Wild at Heart" is his first feature film since "Blue 
Velvet." 
</P>
<P>
"Wild at Heart" stars Nicolas Cage and real-life mother and daughter Diane Ladd 
and Laura Dern. Interest in the film was further piqued here Monday with rumors 
that Lynch is headed for a fight with the MPAA ratings board over the specter 
of an X-rating.

SLOW TICKET SALES THREATEN 'AIDA' AT COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
What has been billed as "the breathtaking, world renowned production" of 
Giuseppe Verdi's "Aida" is having some trouble filling the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum on June 29 and 30. The first performance was canceled last week, 
according to a spokesman for the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The highly publicized $7-million production has so far sold only about 6,000 
tickets, said Robbie Williams, production manager for Montreal-based 
International Opera Festival, which has been producing the event around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by telephone in Toronto, Williams, said: "At this point we have not 
reached a final decision. Ticket sales have been slightly disappointing to date 
and we obviously are reviewing the situation." 
</P>
<P>
He said productions scheduled for June 1 and 2 in New York and July 13 in San 
Francisco are going ahead as planned. 
</P>
<P>
While Williams denied that a decision had yet been made, William Hall, music 
director of the Master Chorale of Orange County, said he received a call from 
producers' Montreal offices Monday morning saying the Los Angeles production 
had been canceled. Hall said he was hired to assemble choruses for Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Williams would only say that the June 29 performance "has been put on hold and 
we are concentrating our resources on getting a good crowd in there for 
Saturday night. Because the Los Angeles Coliseum is such a large venue, we 
could open up more seats and put 45,000 people in there. It seemed not a lot of 
good sense to do two shows if we could put everybody together there for one 
night."

What to splash? 
</P>
<P>
The morning is passing quickly, and the editors of the tabloid Daily Mirror 
can't find a story worthy of a screaming front-page headline -- the "splash," 
in Fleet Street-speak. 
</P>
<P>
"This is truly one of the worst days," says a perplexed Steve Lynas, the 
Mirror's news editor. He has already spent considerable time combing the news 
wires and dispatching reporters to chase down leads. Nothing looks promising. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Collins says she wants to get out of Los Angeles and move back to London. 
The Mirror has photos of her lounging around her mansion. It'll make a nice 
spread inside the paper, but not on Page 1. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they've identified a suspect in the George Harrison death threat 
case. But the Mirror splashed the story on the ex-Beatle when it first surfaced 
and wasn't going to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the government charge that poor people's homes are being repossessed 
in court cases that last less than 90 seconds. Lynas sends reporter Bill Akass 
off to observe some of the lightning foreclosures and to interview the 
dispossessed families. But it's unclear where these court cases take place, and 
it's already getting late in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, everyone wonders what they're planning in the newsroom of their 
archrival, the Sun. 
</P>
<P>
It's another day in the Tab Wars, as Britain's brassy working-class papers 
fight a never-ending battle for scoops, readers and the catchiest splash. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mirror and the Sun are not only the top tabloids, they're the biggest 
of all Britain's newspapers. While the daily circulation of each paper -- the 
Mirror count includes the readers of its Scottish cousin, the Daily Record -- 
hovers at around 4 million, the Sun has the edge. The biggest daily 
"broadsheet," or full-size paper, the Daily Telegraph, has a circulation of 
just over 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
A smashing lowbrow success for owner Rupert Murdoch, the Sun is the place where 
the Page 3 girl was invented and continues today in all her toplessness. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mirror, owned by media baron Robert Maxwell, dropped Page 3 girls as 
a regular feature some time ago, but by no means has the paper barred nudity 
from its pages. 
</P>
<P>
"There's certainly no ban on long legs and slim figures," says Brian Bass, the 
Mirror's bow-tied assistant to the editor. "But we like to have them in the 
context of a story." 
</P>
<P>
In this day's paper, the Mirror and most of the other tabs have just such a 
story -- and accompanying photo. A nurse is filing a lawsuit because she caught 
a bad case of food poisoning in a hospital cafeteria. The illness allegedly 
caused her bust to shrink, ending her "lucrative" part-time career as a topless 
model. Her picture appears to have been taken before she caught the bug. 
</P>
<P>
The tabs are racy, opinionated and purple, filled with tales of sex, crime and 
Hollywood. Human interest stories are a major staple, and there are always lots 
of contests. The tabs routinely run their front-page photos in color and 
sometimes print color inside as well. 
</P>
<P>
Each page is crammed with stories, headlines, boxes, photos and drawings. "We 
never waste an inch of space anywhere," says Mirror Art Editor Ric Papineau. 
"You cram everything in to give it a feeling of newsiness. There has to be a 
feeling of energy about the paper." 
</P>
<P>
In an industry where terseness counts in headline writing, the British tabloids 
are nevertheless in a class by themselves. Always short and punchy, their 
headlines descend at times into bursts of slang and shorthand that would leave 
a non-tabloid reader thoroughly mystified. 
</P>
<P>
"Beats Rocked by Clash Backlash" (the Daily Mirror): A legal dispute between 
two rock 'n' roll groups, Beats International and the Clash. 
</P>
<P>
"Sex-Swap Girl Tula in Wogan Show KO" (the Sun): A woman named Tula who 
underwent a sex change faints while waiting to appear on a television show 
hosted by Terry Wogan. 
</P>
<P>
"Dog Women in Cat Fight" (the Mirror again): Two rival female dog breeders 
tussle at a canine competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Sotheby's Ms. Gross Nets Her Piers of the Realm" (Today): Pamela Gross, 
secretary to the chairman of the Sotheby's auction house, will marry Piers 
Butler, son of Lord Mountgarret, thereby gaining a title. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike American supermarket tabloids such as the National Enquirer, the British 
tabs contain serious news as well as more frothy fare. It's just handled 
differently than the treatment one finds in what the Brits call "the quality 
papers." 
</P>
<P>
World and national events are generally encapsulated into a few paragraphs. The 
headlines are often larger than the stories. In headline shorthand, Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is always "Gorby." 
</P>
<P>
At the Mirror, the editors try to create a balance in the types of stories they 
present. "The story you do biggest is the one they're going to talk about in 
the pub that night," says Bass. "Then we put Gorbachev on Page 2 to make sure 
we've got him covered. Page 3 is always light-hearted and fun -- the bride 
whose knickers fell down on the way to church, that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
The tabloids are politically opinionated in a way that would shock American 
readers accustomed to detached, objective journalism. The Sun, which supports 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative Party, makes every effort 
to find stories that boost Thatcherism while ridiculing the opposition Labor 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
The Mirror has taken the opposite stand. "I'm determined that this newspaper 
will do all it can to evict Mrs. Thatcher from her current job," says Mirror 
Editor Roy Greenslade. But he says the Mirror is not "slavish" to the Labor 
Party. "We can be critical." 
</P>
<P>
"If they get a bit loony, we tell them," Bass says. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:15 a.m. the first "news budget" meeting begins, with the top editors 
piling into Greenslade's office to offer potential stories for the next day's 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
The editors discuss the day's events. Trouble with the Iranians. Victims of a 
Royal Air Force plane crash have been identified. Serious complaints against 
the police are up 11%. 
</P>
<P>
At first the meeting sounds positively un-tabloidish. Is this the same 
newspaper that is running a story with the huge headline "Britain's Fellas are 
a Flop in Bed"? 
</P>
<P>
But there's other kinds of news in the hopper as well. A bride was left in 
tears when her boss ruined her wedding reception. Back in America, Madonna has 
told Arsenio Hall that she likes to be spanked and has made a nasty crack about 
Joan Collins. The editors ponder whether to place the story alongside their 
Joan Collins photo spread but decide against it. 
</P>
<P>
News Editor Lynas has come across something: A woman in Gloucester learned she 
had cancer when she was 27 weeks pregnant and was told by her doctors that she 
could extend her life by aborting the baby. She refused and delivered a 3-pound 
boy prematurely by Cesarean section before she died. 
</P>
<P>
"Gosh, that's an amazing story," Greenslade tells his staff. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Greenslade comments that tabloid journalism is not as racy 
as it once was. 
</P>
<P>
"There were threats of Parliament restricting our rights," he says. To stave 
off government action, Britain's newspapers adopted a code of ethics earlier 
this year that frowns on practices such as paying for stories and conducting 
interviews without identifying oneself as a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Greenslade, erudite and reserved, believes that some papers have gone too far 
in pursuing sex scandals and similar stories. He doesn't approve of 
kiss-and-tell exposes and says he recently turned down a story from a male 
prostitute ready to reveal his involvement with a well-known Hollywood actor. 
</P>
<P>
The Mirror editors like to think their readers are more thoughtful and literate 
than readers of the Sun. "We've got to entertain them," says Lynas. "But we've 
got to inform as well or we'll lose a lot of readers." 
</P>
<P>
Mirror readers, he says, want to know that they're not the only people who 
think a certain way or are interested in certain subjects or have a certain 
sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very comforting to a lot of readers," says Lynas. "We reassure them." 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime, the pub downstairs is packed with reporters, editors and 
photographers gripping pints of bitter. No one is eating. The pub's clientele 
long ago stopped using the real name of the place and routinely call it "The 
Stab" -- short for "Stab in the Back." 
</P>
<P>
Reporter Don MacKay leans against the wall drinking his lunch with 
entertainment reporter Richard Wallace, who is taking a break from work on the 
Joan Collins story. MacKay says the pub's nickname goes way, way back to the 
night when an editor brought the staff down here and fired half of them. Other 
Mirror employees, as it turns out, have their own versions. 
</P>
<P>
MacKay has spent the morning polishing a package of stories on a horrifying 
subject, a child who was battered to death -- a story all the more tragic 
because welfare officials were warned that the child was in danger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very sad story of despair," he says with a thick Scottish accent. 
</P>
<P>
MacKay, who has been in the British tab business for years, is enthusiastic 
about his current employer. "There's great pride in being a Mirror man," he 
says. "If we turn up on a story, you can actually see the other reporters 
looking over their shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the newsroom, usable stories are surfacing at a good clip, and the 
editors seem pleased. "For the Mirror, tomorrow's going to be a great day," 
says Lynas. 
</P>
<P>
Released American hostage Frank H. Reed reports that British hostages John 
McCarthy and Brian Keenan, who have not been heard from in Lebanon for some 
time, are alive and well. A British tourist is shot by muggers outside Disney 
World in Florida but survives. 
</P>
<P>
A dog jumps into a Jeep and releases a hand brake with its teeth, sending the 
expensive vehicle coasting downhill to crash. Two years ago, the same dog was 
banned for life from a local McDonald's for stealing a child's hamburger. "He's 
been in trouble before," a copy editor notes dryly, giving the story his 
blessing. "Gnash Bang Wallop! Dog at the Wheel," the headline will read. 
</P>
<P>
Lynas and picture editor Len Greener are working feverishly to put together the 
story about the mother with cancer (the "cancer-stricken mum" in 
tabloid-speak). Getting the story is no problem, but it won't be exclusive. 
Greener thinks he might have a national exclusive on photos, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy here is 'Be quick and think big,' " says the picture editor. The 
local Gloucester paper has announced, via the news wire, that it would sell 
photos of the baby and the family to any paper that wanted them for 80 pounds 
($132). Greener immediately calls the local paper and arranges to pay 800 
pounds for exclusive rights to the pictures. Just as he had anticipated, his 
move sends photographers from the other national newspapers scrambling to the 
hospital to shoot the baby in the maternity ward. But the hospital turned 
everyone away. 
</P>
<P>
As a last check on the Mirror's exclusive access to the photos, Greener calls 
the hospital and, not identifying himself as the paper's picture editor, offers 
to make a monetary donation in exchange for photo access. The hospital isn't 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, the tabloids Daily Star, Daily Express and Today all splashed 
the British hostage story. "ALIVE!" yells the Star. The Sun goes with the 
headline "Dead -- But You Still Owe Poll Tax," over a story about an allegedly 
heartless Labor-controlled town council. It also included a front-page story 
about a woman who is bitten on the thigh by a snake while she sunbathed 
topless. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mirror runs a color blowup of a wrinkly baby on a respirator topped 
by the line "Picture Exclusive on a Story to Touch the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
Underneath, in bold black letters, the splash: "MUM WHO DIED TO SAVE HER BABY."

'FORTRESS EUROPE': THE FEAR FADES; 
</P>
<P>
LOOKING AHEAD TO 1992, EUROPEANS HAVE SPUN OUT REAMS OF RULES TO DEFINE THE 
UNIFIED MARKET. AND DESPITE SOME NAGGING CONCERNS, THE U.S. IS LESS NERVOUS 
ABOUT ACCESS AND PROTECTIONISM. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Visions of a Fortress Europe -- the fear that the European drive to create an 
integrated market by 1992 would lead to increased protectionism -- have abated, 
but some nagging problems remain. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a few skirmishes at the start, U.S. policy-makers and businessmen agree 
that the Europeans by and large have kept their promises to make the new 
"single market" open to Europeans and foreigners alike. 
</P>
<P>
While there are "some serious concerns and problems with specific EC (European 
Community) policies, . . . they are overshadowed by the growth opportunities 
presented by the EC market," a new report issued by the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers concludes. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Calingaert, a Brussels-based EC-watcher for the Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers Assn., said: "I always thought that 'Fortress Europe' was a 
rather silly dialogue on both sides. I think the whole discourse has moved into 
the background." 
</P>
<P>
That buoyant assessment has been borne out in practice by the burst of 
directives and regulations that the EC has issued to lay the groundwork for 
1992. About 145 of them have been formally adopted so far -- out of 282 
originally expected -- and more are coming each day. Stanley Crossick, a 
partner in Belmont, a Brussels-based consulting firm that keeps tabs on the 
1992 effort for U.S. corporations, says the consensus is that both on these and 
on larger issues, the EC "has been sensitive" to U.S. concerns. 
</P>
<P>
A banking directive was drastically overhauled after Washington complained it 
might discriminate against U.S. financial institutions. And Eurocrats are 
giving U.S. firms an early look at new regulations so that they can voice any 
complaints before the rules are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American firms are riding a wave of trade with Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The $22.6-billion trade deficit the United States ran with EC countries in 1986 
has turned into a $1.5-billion surplus. "The growth in EC demand for U.S. 
exports should continue," the NAM report says. 
</P>
<P>
American investment in Europe is also accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, even the most optimistic Eurowatchers concede that the road to 1992 
will not be entirely bump-free. The Europeans are playing much tougher with 
Japan, forcing Tokyo to set stiff export limits on cars and insisting that 
Japan buy parts and labor in the 12 EC nations. 
</P>
<P>
And U.S. officials point out that while the policy-making European Commission 
may seem open-minded in setting broad policies on 1992, there still is a danger 
that it will succumb to demands for protection from individual industries 
before a new, integrated market is in place. "What we're concerned about is not 
Fortress Europe," an American-based EC-watcher for a major U.S. corporation 
declared. "What we're concerned about is the (European) Commission giving 
relief to specific industries." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. firms are also nervously eyeing a spate of second-level issues, from 
buy-European provisions in government procurement guidelines to regulations 
governing local content and place of origin. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern of people now is to see how the nitty-gritty things work out," 
said Eamonn J. Bates, a partner in Bernard Krief Europe, another Brussels-based 
EC-watching firm that represents American corporations and other foreign-based 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items on current U.S. watch lists: 
</P>
<P>
Standards, testing and certification. The Europeans, by promising to show 
Americans proposed new standards earlier and permitting U.S. testing labs to 
act as surrogates in certifying products, have gone a long way toward meeting 
earlier U.S. fears that the certification process would act to bar U.S. 
products. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue remains far from fully resolved. While Europe has consolidated 
its testing into two or three laboratories that serve the entire continent, the 
U.S. system involves separate, industry-run labs for each sector. American 
industry is divided over whether the United States should make its system more 
compatible with Europe's. 
</P>
<P>
Rules of origin, local content and sectoral issues. Although the EC has no 
broad-scale policies mandating that goods be produced either partly or largely 
in Europe, it has moved toward minimum requirements for TV program production, 
electronics and autos. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. strategists fret that the number could grow before the 1992 process is 
fully in effect. The European Commission ruled last February that microchip 
makers will have to fabricate their wafers in Europe to qualify for new EC 
trade preferences. 
</P>
<P>
Subsidies. Despite all the rhetoric, the commission appears still wedded to 
continuing the widespread subsidies that European governments traditionally 
have provided to businesses on the Continent for research and development, 
investment and exports. 
</P>
<P>
To U.S. business, these grants and aid -- much more than the United States 
provides for its businesses here -- are unfair. Washington is trying to 
persuade Europe to reduce them as part of the current round of global 
trade-liberalization talks, but success seems unlikely.

GUNMAN MISSES MAN IN 3RD FREEWAY SHOOTING THIS MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the third shooting incident this month on Southern California freeways, a 
Costa Mesa man narrowly missed being shot Monday while driving on the Santa Ana 
Freeway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Mooradian, 25, was driving northbound near the Lincoln Avenue exit in 
Anaheim about 10:30 a.m. when the passenger of a car passing on the left 
suddenly thrust a handgun out of the window and shot at him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet lodged in the left door post a couple of feet from Mooradian's head, 
Sgt. Ken Brott said. Mooradian told police that there was no incident that 
provoked the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just driving along," Brott said. 
</P>
<P>
Mooradian told police that the man who shot at him was a passenger in an older 
yellow Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
Mooradian was the second man shot at on freeways in Anaheim in the last three 
days. On Saturday, Gilberto Valenzuela, 27, of Los Angeles was shot in the head 
while he was a passenger on the Riverside Freeway. Valenzuela was listed Monday 
afternoon in critical condition at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
On May 7, a 29-year-old Los Angeles man was killed after apparently cutting in 
front of another car on the Harbor Freeway in Los Angeles.

NEW DIRECTOR IS NAMED FOR HOOVER INSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Raisian, acting director of the politically influential Hoover Institution 
think tank at Stanford University since last September, has been given the job 
permanently, officials announced Monday. The move ends the search for a 
successor to W. Glenn Campbell, the outspoken conservative who headed Hoover 
for 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
Raisian, 40, has a Ph.D. in economics from UCLA and taught at the University of 
Washington and the University of Houston. He held several posts in the Ronald 
Reagan Administration, including director of research and technical support in 
the U.S. Department of Labor. He later headed a consulting firm in Los Angeles 
and went to Hoover in 1986 as a senior research fellow, eventually rising to 
second in command under Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Symbolic of Hoover's unusual ties with Stanford, Raisian's appointment was 
announced jointly by Stanford President Donald Kennedy and Robert H. Malott, 
chairman of the Hoover Board of Overseers. Though Hoover is within the purview 
of the university, it operates independently, a setup that critics contend 
allows the think tank to be controlled by conservative donors. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said Monday that he hoped Raisian's appointment, effective immediately, 
will improve "the relationship between Hoover and the rest of Stanford 
University." Campbell fought with Kennedy over the terms and timing of his 
retirement and argued with liberal critics. Campbell remains at Hoover as an 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Several sources at Stanford said the first choice to succeed Campbell was 
Michael Boskin, the Stanford economics professor who is chairman of President 
Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. But Boskin is said to want to stay in his 
Washington job. 
</P>
<P>
Although Campbell praised Raisian's appointment, John F. Manley, a Stanford 
political science professor and critic of Hoover, said: "A new director doesn't 
change the old problem. . . . Hoover continues to be an independent think thank 
pushing right-wing causes."

DECLINE IN DROPOUT RATE CREDITED TO 4-YEAR EFFORT;

<P>
STATE REPORT: OXNARD IMPROVES DRAMATICALLY, BUT IN VENTURA THE NUMBER OF 
STUDENTS WHO QUIT REPORTEDLY DOUBLED.

Oxnard education officials said Monday that a state Department of Education 
report showing a dramatic decline in high school dropout rates is an 
encouraging result of a four-year effort by parents, educators and community 
groups aimed at keeping students in school. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Ventura Unified School District, where, according to the report, the 
dropout rate has more than doubled in the last three years, administrators 
questioned the accuracy of the state's figures. 
</P>
<P>
In the Oxnard Union High School District, the number of dropouts decreased 
dramatically from 30.1% in 1986 to 7.8% in 1989. The decline was so marked that 
the Oxnard district was one of two in California singled out Monday by state 
Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig as exemplary for its efforts to keep 
potential dropouts enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a big deal in our district," said a delighted Oxnard Union High 
Superintendent Bob Carter. 
</P>
<P>
For the past four years, a special committee of principals, parents, students 
and local groups, including the NAACP and the Assn. of Mexican-American 
Educators, has set up programs to keep kids in school, he said. Improvements 
include a full-time psychiatrist on each campus and community workers to call 
parents when their children miss school. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, the report released today shows a 29.9% decrease in the number of 
high school dropouts since 1986, compared with an 18% drop statewide. About one 
in five students dropped out statewide in 1989, while in Ventura County the 
rate was about half that, 11.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The state defines a dropout as a student who has been absent for 45 days or 
more with no record of enrollment in another school or continuation program. 
</P>
<P>
Honig and Oxnard officials also credited Oxnard's gains to money from a state 
program designed to motivate students. The district received a total of $80,000 
from the Maintenance and Motivation Program, which was used to hire outreach 
consultants and fund programs for "at risk" students. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard is one of only two high school districts in Ventura County, and 41 
districts statewide, to receive money from the program, said Susie Lange, a 
spokeswoman for the Department of Education. The other county district, the 
Santa Paula Union High School District, receives money under a joint 
application with the Santa Paula Elementary School District, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Paula high school district, however, dropout rates increased from 
20.9% for the class of 1988 to 28.4% the following year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
While the report has encouraging news for Oxnard school officials, the number 
of dropouts it shows for Ventura schools has given officials "a real sense of 
concern," said Jeffrey Davies, director of Evaluation and Informational 
Services for the Ventura district. 
</P>
<P>
The number of dropouts in Ventura schools more than doubled between 1986 and 
1989, from 9.4% to 19.5%, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that cannot be the case," Davies said. "We don't think it is accurate. 
We don't think it has increased dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
According to the district's own tally, the annual dropout rate has been in the 
6% to 7% range, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davies also questioned the state's figures from 1986, which state officials 
acknowledge are estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Despite questions over the report's accuracy, however, Ventura officials are 
taking the report seriously, Davies said. The district's three high school 
principals, Assistant Supt. of Educational Services Joseph Spirito and Davies 
met Monday to discuss the figures, Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
The district will attempt over the next three weeks to assess the accuracy of 
the report, Davies said. As part of its efforts, officials will attempt to 
track the 262 students that the state said dropped out in 1989 to find out 
whether they in fact dropped out altogether or enrolled elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take a more aggressive stance toward pursuing them and find out where 
they did go," Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
Other districts that show significant changes in the dropout rate include the 
1,350-student Oak Park Unified School District, which had a dropout rate of 
6.8% in 1986, but only 2% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park officials said only one student dropped out of Oak Park High School's 
90-person senior class last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark Unified School District cut its dropout rate nearly in half, from 
30.5% in 1986 to 15.8% last year. 
</P>
<P>
In the Simi Valley Unified School District, the 1989 dropout rate of 14.3% is 
still well below the state average, but the number has increased a third over 
1986 figures, the report showed. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't determined the cause of the problem, and we're not going to be 
helped next year with the budget cuts," said Allan Jacobs, associate 
superintendent of Instructional and Educational Services in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley district faces an $8.5-million projected deficit in the next 
school year. Because of budget cuts, the student-to-counselor ratio will 
increase next year from 600 to 750 students per counselor, Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said the district has special programs to provide alternatives to 
at-risk students, including independent study, an adult school program and a 
program for pregnant minors. 
</P>
<P>
But in a few cases, even with school officials, teachers, parents and 
counselors working to keep a student in school, it is not enough, Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of things we're working on," Jacobs said. "But the way it 
is today, when a kid decides to leave school there isn't much you can do about 
it . . . If they decide they're going to go somewhere else, they go."

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;

<P>
WESTLAKE FINISHES 3RD IN GOLF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The way Westlake High golf Coach Lorin Maygren looks at things, some days a 
team puts the heat on opponents and sometimes it gets smoked. 
</P>
<P>
After Costa Mesa Estancia fired a sizzling 371 at Canyon Country Club in Palm 
Springs on Monday to win its second consecutive Southern Section team title, 
Maygren shrugged and waxed philosophical about getting waxed. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get nipped, that's for sure," Maygren said. "But that's the way it 
goes. Some days, a team shoots rounds like that." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake didn't exactly fall over, however, finishing third with a 394. The 
Warriors, in fact, recorded their fourth top-three finish in five seasons, 
which includes section titles in 1986 and '87. 
</P>
<P>
By finishing in the top four, Westlake advances to the California 
Interscholastic Federation-Southern California Golf Assn. championships June 11 
at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. Teams from the Los Angeles City, San 
Diego and Central sections also will participate. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills, second at 389, and Palm Desert, fourth at 396, also advance to the 
CIF-SCGA event. Even though Westlake did not win the team tournament, it marked 
a turnaround: last season the Warriors failed to advance beyond the team 
regional. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to come back," Maygren said. "And I don't think we're through yet." 
</P>
<P>
Hart, which tied Servite at 376 in the Central Regional last Monday at 
Montebello Country Club, finished fifth at 399, but missed qualifying for the 
CIF-SCGA tournament. Hart was led by sophomore Jason Gore's one-over 73 and 
junior Mike Miller's 74. 
</P>
<P>
Juniors Shane O'Brien (83), Chad Butler (86) and Jason Black (83) completed 
Hart's scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park, third in the Northern Regional last week, fired a 407 and 
finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's Charlie Wi, the two-time defending Marmonte League individual 
champion, fired the day's low round with a three-under 69. Wi's round included 
four birdies and a lone bogey. 
</P>
<P>
"He played close to perfectly," Maygren said of Wi, a senior who will attend 
Nevada Reno next year. Jerry Chang (75), John Talifer (81), Mark Buntz (84) and 
Aaron Brady (85) rounded out the Westlake scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia blew away the field with a depth charge. Using the standard format in 
which the best five of six individual scores count toward the team total, each 
Estancia player broke 80 and a round of 78 was tossed out. 
</P>
<P>
For Marmonte League champion Newbury Park, which finished second to Estancia in 
the team tournament last season, sophomore Keith Ealy fired the low round of 
79, followed by Darren Humphrey (80), Genio Borghi (82), Steve Holmes (83) and 
Brad Bronk (83). 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, which finished second to Newbury Park in the Marmonte team finals two 
weeks ago, tied Sunny Hills for first in the Northern Regional last week at 
Olivas Park Golf Course in Ventura with a 371. 
</P>
<P>
BOYS' TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 28 1/2, Washington 1 -- David Schwartz, Bobby Butler and Tony Yen all 
were unbeaten in singles play to lead top-seeded Kennedy in a first-round City 
Section 3-A Division playoff match at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 doubles team of Josh Etting and Che Naveja did not lose a game for 
defending champion Kennedy, which plays the winner of the Marshall-Franklin 
match at CSUN on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 21, Venice 4 -- Chul Uh and Khoi Doan led Cleveland with three wins 
apiece in singles play in a first-round 3-A match at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 18 1/2, Grant 11 -- Fueled by its doubles teams, Chatsworth recorded 
a first-round 4-A upset of second-seeded Grant at the Racquet Centre in Studio 
City. 
</P>
<P>
The doubles teams of Philip Tietjen and Tony Joseph, John Butiu and Mike 
Carone, Fred Wiener and Aron Haaz all were 3-0 to lead Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Taft 22 1/2, North Hollywood 7 -- John Rom, David Alderman, Mikail Rudolfsen, 
David Goldman all went 3-1 in singles play to lead fourth-seeded Taft in a 
first-round 4-A match at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Halpern and Dvir Levy were 3-0 in doubles for Taft.

BRANTLEY, LATTIMORE TO PLAY BASKETBALL FOR CSLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling the offer a "great package deal," Granada Hills High point guard 
Jermoine Brantley and forward Aaron Lattimore have signed letters of intent to 
play basketball next season at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Brantley, who led the Highlanders to a second-place finish in the City Section 
4-A Division North Valley League, averaged 20.2 points, 9.0 assists and 3.8 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
A 5-foot-10 senior and a three-year letterman, Brantley set single-season and 
career marks in assists and orchestrated a fast break that handed Cleveland its 
only defeat in two years of league play. Brantley also considered walking on at 
Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great package deal for both of us," Brantley said. 
</P>
<P>
Lattimore, who started at small forward, emerged as an inside and outside 
threat last season, averaging 14.4 points and 10.2 rebounds. Lattimore (6-5) is 
expected to play at off-guard at Cal State Los Angeles, a member of the 
Division II California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Lattimore said he received little interest from college recruiters until after 
the season ended. Brantley said that Lattimore was spotted by the CSLA staff 
during a recent postseason all-star game and that the staff asked Brantley to 
forward film of his teammate. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of wondering why nobody was looking (at me)," said Lattimore, who 
plans to study engineering. "I knew I wasn't going to play inside, but I 
thought I could play at two-guard." 
</P>
<P>
So did CSLA -- which snared two guards at once.

BIRMINGHAM FINDS CONDITION OF STAR PITCHER A SORE SUBJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Birmingham High's baseball team, whose 13-game winning streak was stopped last 
week by Monroe, is preparing for the City Section 4-A Division playoffs with 
another dose of reality: ace right-hander Josh Brown (11-2) has developed a 
sore shoulder muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who defeated Sylmar in a regular-season game this season, will pitch 
against the Spartans in a first-round game Friday at Birmingham -- provided his 
shoulder can handle the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a little bit of a question mark with Josh," Birmingham Coach Wayne 
Sink said. "But the doctor said he could throw this week. It shouldn't be a big 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
Or so Sink hopes. This year's playoff berth marks the final run for Sink, who 
will retire at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had such a good season that anything we do in the playoffs is icing on 
the cake," he said. "But we're capable of putting some good icing on the cake. 
In fact, I'm looking for a big mound of whipped cream." 
</P>
<P>
Good news, bad news: While Birmingham worries over the state of its arms, Poly, 
the top-seeded team in the 4-A, is rejoicing. 
</P>
<P>
After spending the past four weeks without the services of No. 2 pitcher 
Rodrigo Dorame (3-0, 2.41 earned-run average), who had a tender elbow, Coach 
Jerry Cord is welcoming Dorame back. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodrigo's starting to throw some," Cord said. 
</P>
<P>
While Cord will rely on senior Eddie Castellanos (12-0) in Friday's opener, 
either Dorame or spot starter Raul Torres (5-1) will serve as backup. 
</P>
<P>
Lone star: North Hollywood's wild-card berth in the 4-A playoffs can be viewed 
as a tribute to shortstop/pitcher/catcher Erik Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who threw his second one-hitter of the year in the season finale 
against Grant last week, has posted statistics worthy of All-City 
consideration. He leads the team in batting (.507), runs scored (15), hits 
(34), runs batted in (15) and stolen bases (seven). 
</P>
<P>
He's also thrown three shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who likely will attend Mission College next year, is scheduled to 
pitch Wednesday against Granada Hills at North Hollywood in a wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
Not so grand: It was the shot heard 'round the high desert. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley's Jack Cox belted a dramatic seventh-inning grand slam Friday 
against Palmdale, but it didn't alter the Golden League playoff picture one 
iota. 
</P>
<P>
Cox's one-out blast tied the score, 8-8, before the Antelopes added a run to 
win, 9-8. 
</P>
<P>
Win or lose, however, Antelope Valley (8-7) would have entered the playoffs as 
the league's No. 3 team behind Palmdale (8-7) and Saugus (14-1). 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley was assured of the third playoff berth when Canyon (7-8) lost 
to Saugus on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the junior catcher's third home run of the season will long be 
remembered by those in attendance -- especially Antelope Valley Coach Mike Van 
Cheri. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him stepping out of the batter's box and giving me a big grin and 
then stepping back in and hitting it out," Van Cheri said. "It was like he knew 
he was going to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the biggest one of the season without a doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Deja vu: If history repeats itself, perhaps Palmdale's three-game losing streak 
is a good omen. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale, in fact, has lost four of its past five league games -- a repeat 
performance from last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost to the exact same teams in the exact same order," Coach Terry Vernor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale closed the regular season this year and last with a loss to Quartz 
Hill, a win over Ridgecrest Burroughs, and losses to Saugus, Canyon and 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale rebounded in the playoffs last season, winning two games before losing 
to Tustin in the Southern Section 3-A Division quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Sudden death: Glendale took more time to warm up than a vintage television, but 
Coach Chris Axelgard found a motivational tool to spark his players: fear. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the Dynamiters were 3-3-1 in Pacific League play, but the team 
went 7-1 after spring break and finished second in league play at 10-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Axelgard says his team will be acclimated to the do-or-die nature 
of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We backed ourselves into such a corner that every game we played was a 
must-win game." 
</P>

Graduates Urged to Consider Manufacturing Jobs: Sony Corp. Chairman Akio Morita 
told graduates of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School that 
manufacturing is the foundation of a nations's economy, and he urged them to 
consider jobs in that sector. "I am not a believer in the idea of a 
post-industrial society," said Morita. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the very essence of business . . . is manufacturing." When Morita 
asked how many of the 840 recipients of Masters of Business Administration 
degrees from the prestigious business school planned to enter manufacturing, 
only about 50 raised their hands. "I would hope half of the MBA people would go 
into manufacturing," Morita told reporters at a news conference following his 
commencement address. Morita received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from 
the Ivy League university.

MICHIGAN TO OPPOSE PENSION BOOSTS AT GM 
</P>

<P>
A controversial plan by General Motors Corp. to boost the pensions of retiring 
chairman Roger B. Smith and other executives is provoking criticism from an 
unlikely source -- the state of Michigan, the auto maker's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan treasurer Robert Bowman said Monday that he plans to vote the state's 
8.8-million GM shares -- 1.5% of the world's largest auto maker -- against the 
proposed pension increases. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think it's the best use of $42 million," said Bowman, who oversees 
the Michigan State Retirement System, one of GM's largest institutional 
shareholders. That is how much GM would spend to increase the pensions of 3,350 
of its senior executives. 
</P>
<P>
"Research and development and plant investments, among other things, are a 
better use of their money," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan's decision is significant because it is usually a loyal supporter of 
GM. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, we've been supportive of management, but on this one we've had 
to part ways," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which will nearly double Smith's pension -- to $1.2 million -- 
has been lambasted as both excessive and ill-timed. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders will vote on the plan Friday at GM's annual meeting in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The United Auto Workers union said Smith's compensation is lavish and 
unwarranted given GM's poor performance in the United States the past decade. 
Smith will retire Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said the timing of the proposal is poor because it comes just months 
before auto makers and the UAW begin talks on a new national labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
GM said the increases are necessary to continue to attract top talent. It says 
GM pensions have lagged those of other companies. 
</P>
<P>
Some influential voices are throwing their support behind GM. Institutional 
Shareholder Services Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm that 
advises many institutional investors, is telling clients to vote for the 
pension increases.

TWO OF AN ELITE KIND, IN SHARP CONTRAST;

<P>
COTTON FITZSIMMONS: LAST SEASON'S COACH OF THE YEAR IS CASUALLY INTENSE WHEN 
EXPRESSING HIS VIEWS ON HIS WEEKLY TV SHOW. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Klieg lights burn on Cotton Fitzsimmons' already reddened forehead. He sits 
rigidly on a backless stool in front of a thrown-together set at Max's Sports 
Bar, awaiting the cue to start reciting ads for his weekly television show. 
</P>
<P>
All Fitzsimmons has to do is read a few lines, and then they will move on to 
taping the show itself. But the Phoenix Suns' coach keeps flubbing the lines. 
The smile remains pasted on his face. The studio audience nervously titters. 
Finally, he makes it through, almost screaming into the camera . . . 
</P>
<P>
 So, watch the Suns on Channel 10, and we'll beat L.A. together. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It is obvious, to anyone who knows him, that Fitzsimmons cannot be scripted. 
He is most at ease, most natural, when he is allowed, as he puts it, to run his 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I open it," Fitzsimmons said recently, "and I don't know what's 
coming out." His weekly show here, which airs Sunday nights at 10:30 and 
reportedly draws high ratings, is loosely formatted and often irreverent. One 
hundred percent Cotton, in other words. You could call it off the cuff, except 
Fitzsimmons doesn't wear them. He wears a T-shirt and a relaxed manner. 
</P>
<P>
His show, "The Cotton Express," which is taped on Friday nights, best shows 
what separates him from the generic NBA coach. Fitzsimmons can X and O with the 
best of them, but he would rather talk about something else. 
</P>
<P>
He won the league's coach-of-the-year award last season for leading the Suns to 
a 27-game turnaround from the previous season, but characteristically downplays 
his influence. 
</P>
<P>
At 58, and with his fifth NBA team, Fitzsimmons says in the next couple of 
years he will move upstairs and turn over the Suns to assistant Paul Westphal. 
</P>
<P>
That day, however, seems far off now. Fitzsimmons, who will bring his Suns to 
the Forum tonight for Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals, says he 
never frets about games. To quote one of his favorite aphorisms, "The only game 
you worry about is the one where you wash the socks and jocks afterward." 
</P>
<P>
Although a native Missourian, Fitzsimmons' accent is hard to place. It is as if 
he has combined the dialects from all the cities where he has coached -- 
Phoenix, Atlanta, Buffalo, Kansas City, San Antonio -- and blended them into a 
gravely, twangy, not-quite-Southern delivery. It is not a classic television 
voice, not even the standard deep and authoritative tone of a coach. But such 
qualities are unimportant in this atmosphere of unconventionality. Al McCoy, a 
Suns' broadcaster and co-host of the show, said Fitzsimmons has been chased 
around the set by the Gorilla, the team's mascot, and has traded on-air insults 
-- in fun -- with star guard Kevin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"When we went to Cotton about doing this show, he said he didn't want to do an 
X-and-O thing or have boring talk like all the other guys," said James LeMay, 
the show's executive producer. "It certainly isn't that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEGMENT 1: LIVE ON TAPE, IT'S . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons, wearing a white "Cotton Express" T-shirt and faded blue pants, 
stands between two members of a studio audience numbering about 40. He could 
post-up the teen-age girl, who stands about 5 feet, but is overshadowed by a 
male fan, about 5-8. 
</P>
<P>
Smiling, Fitzsimmons gets the nod from the floor manager and, with a swell of 
applause, starts in. The smile fades, however, and Fitzsimmons waves it off. 
</P>
<P>
"No red light," he says, smiling. "I saw that. You want me to waste my time, 
don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
Take 2 goes more smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to another playoff edition of 'The Cotton Express.' Stay with us for a 
good show . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons tells the viewers that, on this show, Westphal will be the guest 
and they will hear taped interviews with Laker Coach Pat Riley and guard Magic 
Johnson. Normally, Fitzsimmons has at least one Sun as a guest, but since it 
was taped Friday night, he wanted his players to rest for Saturday afternoon's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
They go to the break, and someone in the audience asks when Riley will be 
there, and Fitzsimmons says, "They are on tape. They are taking it easy at 
their hotel." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone laughs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BETWEEN-TAKE INTERLUDE 
</P>
<P>
Max Beyer, the Max of Max's Sports Bar, mingles with the fans and local VIPs, 
including Fitzsimmons' wife, JoAnn. The burly Beyer is a big figure in the 
Phoenix sports scene, and he has a story for everything. 
</P>
<P>
Beyer says of the set, which includes the front of a freight train with "Cotton 
Express" and, in slightly smaller letters, "Max's Special" stenciled across it: 
"You know, that's half the size of an actual train. We had a real hard time 
doing that to specification. We got pictures of trains, and they were all 
different. . . . But it looks nice, though." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEGMENT 2: COTTON'S VIEWS 
</P>
<P>
An attendant dabs the perspiring forehead of Fitzsimmons, who has changed into 
a purple T-shirt bearing the logo "Beat L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons, now joined by McCoy on the other stool, is pointed at by the floor 
director, who signals to the audience for applause. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy: "Well, Cotton, this must have been a busy week for you . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Cotton: "It certainly is. But I'm surprised you still have a voice left, Al." 
</P>
<P>
Big laughs. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy: "We've talked so much about how to get the club ready for 82 games in a 
season. Now, it's the playoffs. How do you get them ready for that?" 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons: "Oh, yes, it's much different. You play the same team, night after 
night. Sometimes, during the regular season, you don't see a team in a month. 
But in the playoffs, you have time to prepare and it all comes down to 
execution, Al." 
</P>
<P>
McCoy: "There have been some surprises lately, the biggest to a lot of people 
being Jimmy Rodgers (who was fired) at Boston." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons: "I don't feel too sorry for the Boston Celtics. . . . (Laughs) It 
might be a downward fall for the Celtics now. I thought Jimmy Rodgers would be 
there for years to come . . . the coach there for a decade." 
</P>
<P>
The two continue to discuss the numerous coaching vacancies for several 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy: "Yes, Cotton, and who knows what the Clippers will do?" 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons: "Who does? Who knows what the Clippers will ever do?" 
</P>
<P>
McCoy introduces a regular feature, Cotton's "Slam Jam of the Week." This week, 
it is Detroit's John Salley dunking after getting a pass from Bill Laimbeer. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's Salley going in for the dunk," Fitzsimmons says, looking at the replay 
on a monitor. "A dunk is always better when you're fouled." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BETWEEN-TAKE INTERLUDE 
</P>
<P>
JoAnn Fitzsimmons is sitting beyond camera range talking with Westphal. When 
Westphal leaves to prepare for his segment, JoAnn tells a friend and a visitor 
the horror of watching her husband wear a golf shirt with a fly-away collar in 
Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons had forgotten his shirt, and borrowed trainer Joe Proski's golf 
shirt for the game. He made the mistake of wearing a tie. That night, he ended 
a personal 37-game Forum losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
JoAnn Fitzsimmons says that, as she watched the telecast in Phoenix, she paid 
more attention to her disheveled husband than the game. "I kept saying to him 
through the TV, 'Honey, fix your collar,' " she says. "By halftime, it had 
gotten worse. Both sides of the collar were standing up. On TV, they kept 
switching back and forth between Cotton and that shirt and perfect Pat (Riley) 
and his suit. Then, I started yelling to Paul, 'Tell him to fix his collar.' 
Finally, I noticed there were no cuffs, so I knew it wasn't his shirt." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEGMENT 3: COTTON AND HIS SUCCESSOR 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons, who announced before last season that Westphal will eventually 
take over, is joined on stage by his top assistant, a former Sun and Celtic 
guard. McCoy sits between. 
</P>
<P>
Westphal wears a plaid shirt, not a T-shirt. He wants Cotton's job, not his 
fashion sense. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons: "Paul, let me ask you a question. When you won that championship 
in Boston -- I know they've won many -- but what did it mean to the city?" 
</P>
<P>
Westphal: "The city just goes nuts. The politicians get on the platforms, and 
everybody gets involved when you win." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BETWEEN-TAKE INTERLUDE 
</P>
<P>
The problem with Fitzsimmons, someone facetiously says to his wife, is that 
he's just too shy. That remark is made just after Fitzsimmons laughs heartily 
at a remark on the set. 
</P>
<P>
JoAnn Fitzsimmons, as extroverted as her husband, replies: "He loves doing that 
show. It's fun for him. When that camera goes on, he's on. But at home, I have 
trouble getting him to open his mouth sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
She says she isn't joking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEGMENT 4: Q &amp; A 
</P>
<P>
"Cotton, you'll open with a two-shot to Al," the director instructs before the 
red light comes on. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons does not wait for the applause to die. He jumps right into the 
question-and-answer session. 
</P>
<P>
One man asks about the importance of Mark West, and Fitzsimmons gives the same 
answer he gives reporters. "We need production from him to win." The fan, in 
appreciation, then gives Fitzsimmons a wooden "Cotton Express" train whistle, 
on sale at Max's. 
</P>
<P>
Another man asks why assists are so readily awarded in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons leaps at this question. This is one of his peeves. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, in the NBA, we think they are much too liberal with the 
assists. You throw the ball into the post. He holds it, holds it, like James 
Worthy, then spins and scores and the guy who passes it gets an assist. It's 
too liberal." 
</P>
<P>
A fan named Amir, from Israel, asks: "If you pass the Lakers, what do you think 
you will do in the conference championships?" 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons says: "If we beat the Lakers, we'll be so (happy), I don't think 
we'll be able to come down for the Western Conference finals." 
</P>
<P>
Big laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons squares to the camera. 
</P>
<P>
"We thank you for being with us. We hope you can join us next week because we 
want to still be around to have another edition of 'The Cotton Express.' "

JIM MURRAY: HE'S STILL DEDICATING HIS LIFE TO FIGHT GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I know Babe Ruth once promised a sick kid in a hospital he'd go out and hit a 
home run for him. And then did it. 
</P>
<P>
I know Notre Dame won, by last count, at least 43 games for the old Gipper. 
</P>
<P>
But I believe I'm the only guy in the history of sports who ever had a 
two-round knockout dedicated to him. 
</P>
<P>
It happened a very long time ago. I wasn't on my deathbed. I didn't even have 
heartburn. I was having a beer and a hot dog at the time, as I remember it. 
</P>
<P>
My benefactor was a pugilist whom fate tried to conceal by naming him John 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
You probably don't remember Johnny but I do. Johnny was, as it happened, a very 
good fighter. He was too good for his own good, if you know what I mean. None 
of the registered heroes of the day wanted to fight him. He hit too hard. He 
moved too fast. He couldn't get a fight with a leopard. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he couldn't get a fight with a Tiger -- Dick Tiger, that is, who was 
middleweight champion at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnny could handle anything that didn't bite first. The night he dedicated 
the fight to me, they put him in with someone or something I think they found 
in a tree in South America. I've forgotten the guy's name but I remember that, 
without his tattoos, you'd swear he escaped from the circus or the zoo. You 
looked at him and you wanted to ask who left the cage door open. 
</P>
<P>
He just looked like a sucker for the left hook to Johnny, who stepped to the 
center of the ring and announced he was going to knock this guy out for me. I 
was embarrassed. I tried to talk Johnny out of it. I told him I didn't have a 
spot in my trophy case for an unconscious fighter but Johnny knocked him out in 
two rounds anyway. It was up to me to get him mounted. 
</P>
<P>
I hadn't seen much of Johnny Smith till the other day, when I ran into him at a 
Mike Tyson press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The years have treated Johnny kindly. In fact, if you were to look at the two 
of us, you'd be hard put to tell who was the fighter and who was the writer. 
Johnny has all his eyes, teeth, ears -- and most of his hair. 
</P>
<P>
Which is kind of ironic because Johnny and I met as adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
"You're trying to get boxing outlawed," he accused the first time we met. 
</P>
<P>
"No, Johnny," I told him, "all I do is count the dead. Boxing will outlaw 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
"Over my dead body," he growled. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope not, Johnny," I told him. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Johnny is alive and well and promoting fights. His first card will be 
held May 23, featuring Larry Musgrove and Roberto Rosiles in a middleweight 
elimination bout at the Hyatt Airport hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny hasn't had a career so much as a chase. When he won the California 
middleweight championship -- by knocking out Tiger Al Williams -- he thought he 
was on his way to money and title. 
</P>
<P>
But the big names wanted no part of him. Johnny had to take the act to 
Tasmania, Mexico, Italy, Japan and parts of North Africa to get fights. Johnny 
had to go where they not only had never heard of him but, more important, had 
never seen him. Johnny lost more bookings by just showing up in a local gym. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled opponents suddenly came down with what Johnny remembers as "a rare 
form of yellow jaundice" when their handlers got a load of Johnny's right cross 
in a workout. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny got so he would take fights on an hour's notice. A middleweight, he 
fought heavyweights in Italy, light-heavyweights in New Zealand and once a guy 
who later became a first minister of Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have a mark on him so I thought he must be a good fighter and I took 
no chances with him," Johnny recalls. "I knocked him out right away." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny later found out that the reason the guy was unmarked was because he was 
unfought. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd (in Italy) looked at me as if I pulled wings out of a butterfly." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny became probably the only fighter in history to be the promoter and main 
eventer on the same card. That was in Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
He spent so much time flying back and forth between Mexico and L.A. that the 
only heavy bags he got around were under his eyes. The ringside doctors almost 
didn't OK him to fight and, after they did, Johnny had more trouble staying 
awake than beating his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny decided a nickname might help. But the one the fight mob picked out for 
him, "Killer," didn't help much. No one wanted to find out exactly how he came 
by it. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny ended up fighting -- and kayoing -- only fighters no one else wanted to 
fight -- Hank Casey, Neal Rivers, after Rivers fought a draw with Gene Fullmer. 
When he wanted to fight the champions his record merited, they told him, "Get a 
reputation," and Johnny asked "How?" That was really his trouble, his 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
He broke his hand in a fight in Sacramento once, but when he went to his corner 
and told his trainer, Duke Holloway, the Duke was unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you got another one, knock him out with the left," Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
So Johnny did. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny thinks fighting is in danger of dying out, not from violence but from 
indifference. 
</P>
<P>
"Television doesn't make fighters, it gets in on it," he said. "It's up to 
promoters and managers. The fighters today have it too easy. They're giving 
money away and the fighters are too lazy to pick it up. They disappear from the 
gym for months at a time after a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I drove a gravel truck out here from Louisiana for 50 cents a day and I had to 
sit in the truck at restaurants while they went in and got food for me. So when 
I got to the ring, I was hungry and mad." 
</P>
<P>
The fighters today don't dedicate knockouts the way they used to. They don't 
even dedicate split decisions. It's a lost art, like the hook off the jab. 
Johnny retired it with him.

TWO OF AN ELITE KIND, IN SHARP CONTRAST; 
</P>
<P>
PAT RILEY: THE JOY OF BEING VOTED THIS SEASON'S COACH OF THE YEAR IS DAMPENED 
BY THE LAKERS' NEED TO WIN GAME 5 AGAINST PHOENIX TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leave it to Laker Coach Pat Riley, always seeking motivational material, to 
turn his long-delayed award as the NBA's coach of the year into a challenge 
going into Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals tonight against the 
Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Only this time, Riley used it as motivation for himself rather than his team, a 
loss away from early elimination after finishing with the NBA's best 
regular-season record. 
</P>
<P>
"I am ready now to see if I can coach," Riley said, smirking. 
</P>
<P>
What should have been a joyous occasion for Riley, who had been routinely 
overlooked by sportswriters for the award while guiding the Lakers to four of 
their five NBA titles in the 1980s, was tempered considerably by the Lakers' 
plight. 
</P>
<P>
At a Forum news conference Monday morning, the dapper Riley wryly noted the 
irony of receiving the award the day before the Lakers face early elimination 
from the playoffs for the first time since the Houston Rockets ousted them in 
the 1986 conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was walking into a gas chamber when I walked in here today," Riley 
said. "I know it's ironic right now with our backs against the wall, but it 
does not minimize exactly how I feel. I will cherish this award." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, whose 533-194 record in nine seasons is the best in NBA history, 
received 52 of 92 votes from selected sportswriters and broadcasters in each 
NBA city. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Lynam, who led the Philadelphia 76ers to the Atlantic Division title, 
finished second with 14 1/2 votes, and Rick Adelman of the Portland Trail 
Blazers finished third with 12 1/2 votes. Chuck Daly of the Detroit Pistons had 
five and Larry Brown of the San Antonio Spurs had four. Voting was done at the 
end of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Riley has led the Lakers to nine consecutive Pacific Division titles. In a 
milestone this season, Riley reached 500 victories quicker than any other 
coach, and he has more playoff victories, 102, than any coach. 
</P>
<P>
Riley had often joked that he had received more recognition for never having 
won the award than he would have if he had won it. Last season, for instance, 
Phoenix Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons won the award, and Riley received one of a 
possible 88 votes. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Lakers' first in 14 without Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, they finished 
63-19, the franchise's third-best record. But the Lakers have faltered in the 
playoffs, losing once to Houston in the first round and three of four games so 
far to the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, admittedly distracted by the Lakers' predicament, nonetheless was 
gracious and, at times, self-deprecating in accepting the honor Monday. When 
Jerry West, the Laker general manager, introduced Riley by saying how proud he 
was of his coach's record, Riley quipped, "What, 533 wins or 1-3?" 
</P>
<P>
In an odd way, winning the award has been a detriment to some. Five of the last 
10 recipients are no longer head coaches. The last coach of the year whose team 
went on to to win the championship that season was the Lakers' Bill Sharman in 
1971-72. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry told me last week, so I've been carrying this ever since we got beat the 
very first game against Phoenix," Riley said. "I was thinking about all the 
history of the coaches of the year getting fired immediately after that." 
</P>
<P>
Riley expressed his thanks to Laker management for supplying talent, Laker 
players for performing consistently well and assistant coaches Bill Bertka, 
Randy Pfund and Jim Eyan for their support. 
</P>
<P>
The last three seasons, there has been speculation that Riley would leave the 
Lakers to become a broadcaster. Rumors persist that he is a candidate for a 
commentator's role next season when NBC takes over coverage of the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Riley denied having talked to NBC. Sunday, he confirmed that Jerry 
Buss, the Lakers' owner, has expressed an interest in extending Riley's 
contract, which runs another two seasons. Riley said he and Buss will talk 
after the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I read, like Chuck Daly reads and like everybody else, who (the networks) want 
to work for them, and my name keeps coming up all the time," Riley said. "So, I 
just have to answer questions about it. It makes interesting reading and, 
believe me, it doesn't help in any type of contract negotiations with Jerry. At 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody assumes (he is leaving). Why are you assuming that? That I'm fed up? 
I've never said that." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he remains interested in coaching the Lakers mainly because he still 
feels an emotional charge. 
</P>
<P>
"The passion and the intensity of the job is what makes me feel alive," he 
said. "I can do without the travel and a lot of the things on the periphery 
that get in the way of the joy. But it's what I do best right now in my life. 
It's what I love to do. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of myself being anywhere else. But I can't specifically say, 
because things change. The only thing you can count on in life is the 
permanence of change. So, I can't say I'll coach here the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said that, despite coaching the same core of players for nearly a decade, 
he can still relate to them and they still listen to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there's always something you hear about, that they're tired of the same 
old song," Riley said. "As long as you keep staying truthful and dealing with 
the present moment -- I know I get accused of conjuring up all these 
motivational ploys and all this stuff -- you can stay connected. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it's a little different. The routine has set in. But it's not less 
exciting. The thing that really ignites myself . . . is the competition, being 
down on the floor, the intensity. That's where it is right now. (Tonight) will 
either bring out the best in the Lakers or the worst."

HERSHISER SAYS HE IS PLEASED BY PROGRESS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: DODGER STAR IS UPBEAT DESPITE FACING A LONG ROAD TO REHABILITATION 
AFTER SURGERY ON HIS RIGHT SHOULDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only certainty about the rehabilitation process that Orel Hershiser has 
begun is that it will be comparable to an amusement park thrill ride. 
</P>
<P>
Same highs, same lows -- an emotional roller coaster, Hershiser said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen John Tudor go through it and I've seen Gibby (Kirk Gibson) go 
through it," Hershiser said. "One day Gibby thinks he can fly, and the next day 
he isn't sure that he can walk." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after a new form of surgery designed to reconstruct his right 
shoulder, Hershiser is riding the first high. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. (Frank) Jobe seems to think I'm making rapid -- if not remarkable -- 
progress," Hershiser said in his first public comments since the surgery April 
27 left the 31-year-old Dodger right-hander on a 12-month recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Dodger Stadium, Hershiser said everything has been positive, that 
he is making great strides. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, even if I'm ready to pitch in November, I don't know who will be 
playing baseball then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if I set a land-speed record, we have nothing but time. It's not like the 
operation was done on the last day of the season to get me ready at the 
All-Star break. It was done early in the season to get me ready at the start of 
next season." 
</P>
<P>
It was done, of course, with more than 1991 in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser's career rests on the success of the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The chances that he would be able to pitch again without it were slim, Jobe has 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Frank that I had 99 wins and didn't want to be stuck on that, so do it 
right," Hershiser said, laughing. "I want to get 100 at least, and I'm 
confident I'm going to be able to pitch again. Not because of the way my arm 
feels now but because all the people who know think I'll pitch again." 
</P>
<P>
Among them, Hershiser said, are Jobe and the Dodgers' physical therapist, Pat 
Screnar, who will supervise his recovery. At this point, therapy consists of 
isometrics four times a day, elbow extensions and the use of a light barbell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strange," he said. "Everything I've ever done was to stretch and get 
loose. This rehab is entirely the opposite. . . . Let's tighten up and get it 
healed before stretching it again." 
</P>
<P>
There is no definitive timetable, but Hershiser said he hopes to be able to 
throw a baseball within three months. He made a windmill motion with his right 
arm, raised it at a 90-degree angle and said he has to be cautious and not take 
it back farther in the motion required to throw a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
The obviously chipper Hershiser said he agreed with Jobe's opinion that the 
physical damage stemmed from a long period of wear and tear, that his loose 
body structure led to a pounding of the soft tissue by the shoulder bones, that 
the pain didn't really develop until this year and that for a long period he 
felt it was normal spring training discomfort -- a result, perhaps, of the 
short spring -- until he realized the pain was not diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had no regrets about not speaking up sooner or requesting a break in 
his string of 195 consecutive starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to compete, and Mr. (Peter) O'Malley pays me to go out and pitch," he 
said. "He pays Tom Lasorda and Ron Perranoski to decide who pitches and when. 
If I feel I can pitch, I'm going to do it. I'm not a hero because of that, nor 
am I the only pitcher who has pitched with pain occasionally." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser said that he has not, and will not, dwell on the possibility that his 
career might be over. 
</P>
<P>
He said his energies and thoughts are on complete recovery and that he is not 
concerned about the physical regimen because he has always worked hard. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest part, he said, will be sitting and watching, and he has tried to 
avoid that, knowing his competitive juices will flow and that he "will get the 
itch to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been tuning in to see how my friends are doing out of curiosity," he 
said. "But once I get the score, I turn it off because I know I'll just get 
frustrated. The toughest thing about pitching has always been the four days in 
between." 
</P>
<P>
The frustration has increased because of the Dodgers' current struggle, but 
Hershiser said he didn't think an injured player should dissect his team's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with the theory that a person on the disabled list is still part of 
the team but not really part of it," Hershiser said, knowing he faces a long 
process until he feels part of it again.

STEINBRENNER MEETS WITH WINFIELD; HEARING TENTATIVELY IS WEDNESDAY

A hearing on Dave Winfield's refusal to accept a trade to the California Angels 
from the New York Yankees for pitcher Mike Witt is tentatively scheduled 
Wednesday before baseball arbitrator George Nicolau. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner met with Winfield and his agent, Jeff Klein, 
on Monday but was vague about details. 
</P>
<P>
Another meeting is scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
Angel General Manager Mike Port hinted at a contract extension to entice 
Winfield to accept the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"California sits here as a club willing to go to whatever lengths it has to to 
bring Dave Winfield here," Port said. "Is it our plan to have Dave around in a 
longer term rather than a shorter term? The answer is yes." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is Winfield's insistence of veto power over trades as a 10-and-five 
player, 10 or more years in the majors, the last five with the same club. 
Winfield has refused to report to the Angels since the deal was announced 
Friday.

Easy Goer, runner-up to Sunday Silence for 1989 horse of the year, will make 
his 4-year-old debut Wednesday in the seven-furlong Gold Stage Stakes at 
Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's Belmont Stakes victory denied Sunday Silence the Triple Crown. Easy 
Goer finished second to Sunday Silence in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and in 
the Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's race is a prep for the $500,000-added Metropolitan Handicap May 28. 
</P>
<P>
Said Shug McGaughey, Easy Goer's trainer: "If I had to, I would have run in the 
Met without a prep. It wasn't essential that this race go, but win or lose, at 
least we're getting a good, solid race into him."

UCLA WOMEN ROW TO ACCLAIM ON A SHOESTRING; 
</P>
<P>
CREW: SALONITES BUILDS NATIONAL PROGRAM, BUT SHE IS CRITICAL OF SCHOOL'S 
DECREASING FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Kelly Salonites, the women's crew coach at UCLA, was not having a great 
morning. It was barely daybreak at the university's Marina del Rey boathouse, 
and Salonites had just told her team that, because of tight money, they would 
not race at Oxnard that weekend. Sending 35 women, plus boats, there for two 
days would cost several thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as she took her varsity women for a workout in two boats of four rowers 
each, the engine on her coaching launch threatened to quit. Using her blue UCLA 
megaphone, she told the athletes to carry on without her if she could not make 
it up Ballona Creek to the turnaround point at the Lincoln Boulevard bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, a quarter mile up the creek, the old 25-horsepower engine wheezed, 
coughed and stopped cold, enveloping Salonites in a cloud of noxious white 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The coach, oarless, calmly started paddling with her megaphone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my life," she shrugged, displaying a measure of the stoicism she gets 
from her Cherokee father. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily we're drifting backwards," she said. "This has been a good year. I've 
only broken down eight times." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the shells came back. One was maneuvered into position to tow 
Salonites to the dock. She directed the rest of the workout from a bicycle on 
the bike path parallel to the waterway. 
</P>
<P>
It was perhaps fitting that rowers dragged the helpless launch and its disabled 
engine to safety. The human element is what keeps the UCLA women's -- and men's 
-- crew programs afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of crew at UCLA believe that the university's athletic department 
has a faint-hearted commitment to rowing. 
</P>
<P>
The program has been building since Friends of UCLA Rowing (FOUR) hired Polish 
defector Zenon Babraj as coach in 1986, and, judging by results, UCLA crew has 
made it to the big leagues. Except for the University of Washington and 
occasionally California, West Coast crews have never been taken seriously by 
Eastern schools. 
</P>
<P>
But now, UCLA's men and women are ranked second or third in the nation; both 
are threats to win West Coast championships at Sacramento's Lake Natoma this 
weekend -- it would be the fourth consecutive year for the men -- and national 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
The women need a victory at Sacramento to earn a trip to the national 
championships in Madison, Wis., June 2-3, since the regatta organizers will pay 
expenses only for the Pac-10 winner. Other boats pay their own way. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't win, we don't go," Salonites said. "UCLA isn't providing any money 
for us to go the national championships." 
</P>
<P>
Besides success in collegiate crew, UCLA is adding to the pool of Olympic level 
rowers. 
</P>
<P>
"What they don't understand in the athletic department is that we are producing 
world-class elite athletes here," Salonites said. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Korzeniowski, national technical director of U.S. Rowing, spotted several 
new candidates for the national team in Salonites' boats and has invited them 
to development camps. 
</P>
<P>
In the varsity eight, besides stroke Cathie Heacox, a member of the national 
team, are two U.S. Olympic Festival medalists -- Catriona Fallon of Burlingame 
and Leslie Lewis of Torrance. Coxswain Katy McMahon of San Francisco competed 
in the World Championships as a member of the U.S. junior national team. 
Leilani Johnson of Malibu attended the U.S. pre-elite camp in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A lightweight four is training under Salonites as well. Leslie Lewis of 
Torrance, Kim Cramer of Clayton, Heacox of Agoura and Kerry Conway of South San 
Francisco hope to earn the right to compete at the Goodwill Games or at the 
World Championships next fall in Tasmania. 
</P>
<P>
Korzeniowski also said he would like to recruit Salonites to coach a national 
team boat. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's a rising coaching star," he said, noting that all rowers in her 
boats use the same technique. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a fluke," he said. "It's the sign of good coaching." 
</P>
<P>
But just as the effort is paying off, the UCLA athletic department is backing 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"We've moved the machine to the level of make or break," Babraj said. "The 
profile of athletes has changed. There's tremendous momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Salonites' husband, Robert, a former UCLA oarsman and a fund-raiser for the 
program, said: "Kelly and Zenon will need double next year to sustain what 
they're doing here. The game's changing." 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches said it isn't fair to expect the athletes to put out the kind of 
effort they do to support the program -- some work three jobs -- while training 
at such a high level and going to school. 
</P>
<P>
Said Judith Holland, assistant athletic director in charge of 23 sports, among 
them crew: "We will continue with the core funding for rowing. It will not be 
(downgraded to) a club sport. It will not be discontinued. We will try to find 
ways to help. But our hands are tied." 
</P>
<P>
Such sentiments don't impress Salonites, who feels strongly that UCLA should 
encourage and support the program. 
</P>
<P>
"The chancellor said he wanted to maintain the integrity of the athletic 
department, that education is the most important thing." Salonites said. "But 
small sports are suffering, not just rowing. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to hear about rowing. But how many sports is it going to take to 
become extinct before people notice what's going on at universities? 
</P>
<P>
"The money is there," she said. "They choose to put it somewhere else. It's a 
policy decision. UCLA rowing is getting less than UC Davis and other California 
schools. We have developed the program to one of the best in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"And we don't ask for scholarships or any special help. It is not fair to place 
the burden on the athletes, their parents, the coaches and the alumni. We do 
all the work and the athletic department is taking all the credit when we do 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Rowing is not an NCAA sport. It is not a revenue sport. Except in the Ivy 
League and at the Division III level, it generally is low profile. And women's 
crew, at most schools in existence not more than 15 years, is even less 
visible. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $1.6 million designated for sports from student registration fees, the 
UCLA crew program receives $55,000 a year from the athletic department -- 
$25,000 of which is for the women. Four years ago, the figure was $150,000 for 
men alone. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent regatta at UCLA, Salonites could be seen dashing from her 
coaching duties on the launching dock to hawking wares at the T-shirt stand to 
checking yogurt supplies at the refreshment table. 
</P>
<P>
Alumni groups, parents, rowers and coaches make up what the university fails to 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
The men's allotment from the athletic department goes strictly to support the 
boathouse. Salonites is paid $12,000 from the women's allotment and $8,500 from 
FOUR. She raises the money to pay her freshman-novice coach, Marisa Hurtado, 
$6,000 for travel, insurance, gas and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Among the expenses the crew program sustains is the rental of trucks from UCLA 
to tow the boat trailer. The women pay their own expenses at regattas, buy 
their own uniforms and pay their air fare. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Salonites, despite spending 70% of her time raising money for the 
women's program, has produced a first-class crew. 
</P>
<P>
On April 7 the varsity eight won the prestigious Whittier Cup at the San Diego 
Crew Classic, outclassing Cal, Stanford, Washington, Wisconsin and 
Pennsylvania. The women's junior varsity boat also won. 
</P>
<P>
"They were so busy celebrating it took a week for them to settle down," 
Salonites said of her crew. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks later, at Redwood Shores near San Francisco, UCLA added Radcliffe 
to its hit list. Then, facing Princeton in the final, the Bruin women suffered 
their only defeat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Princeton Coach Curtis Jordan, who is also U.S. national team men's coach, 
later wrote to Salonites: 
</P>
<P>
"I was truly impressed with your crews' rowing and more importantly their 
racing. . . . I was envious of the style you have taught them. It is a bold and 
powerful stroke that I think is very effective with women. It is difficult to 
teach properly, but you have done it. It took some courage to even try. 
Congratulations." 
</P>
<P>
Salonites, 28, is a bit overwhelmed by such accolades, since she is rather new 
to coaching. A 1985 graduate of UCLA with a degree in psychobiology, she rowed 
under coach Jean Riley, later training with national team coach Bob Ernst of 
the University of Washington. She won a gold medal at the U.S. Olympic Festival 
in Baton Rouge, 1985, in a pair with Heidi Hook. 
</P>
<P>
She was assisting Riley and had been accepted to graduate school when Babraj 
asked her to coach the women. 
</P>
<P>
"She had instinct," Babraj said. "And trust from the athletes. She was 
energetic and willing to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Salonites said that Babraj taught her almost everything she knows about 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always been very generous with his time, whenever I have a question," she 
said. "He's my encyclopedia of rowing." 
</P>
<P>
Salonites was named Pac-10 women's coach of the year in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But as one of her athletes said: "They said if we won, things would change. 
Well, we're winning, and things are the same."

Ruling Could Hamper Maxxam Refinancing: A Humboldt Superior Court judge has 
ruled that any prospective buyer from or lender to Maxxam Inc.'s Pacific Lumber 
forest products unit must be told that a pending lawsuit could award Pacific 
Lumber's estimated $2.5 billion in timberland to the filer of the suit, Robert 
Martel of Redway, Calif. The ruling denied a motion by Maxxam to remove from 
the suit a lis pendens, or notice of pending action. The presence of such a 
notice makes it more difficult for Maxxam to sell or refinance its subsidiary.

S&amp;P DOWNGRADES RATING ON WELLS FARGO DEBT; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: THE MOVE IS A BLOW TO CALIFORNIA BANKS' EFFORTS TO COUNTER FEARS THAT 
THEIR REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS ARE VULNERABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded $3.7 billion in Wells Fargo &amp; Co. 
debt Monday, citing concerns over the San Francisco banking firm's high 
concentration of real estate and corporate-buyout loans. 
</P>
<P>
The move is another blow to recent efforts by California banks to counter fears 
that their real estate loan portfolios are vulnerable. Monday's action by the 
New York rating agency is especially jolting because Wells Fargo has been the 
strongest performer among California's largest banks and is generally the most 
highly regarded by investors and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the decision, S&amp;P cited Wells Fargo's "high-risk profile in 
an increasingly difficult business environment." The lower ratings makes it 
more expensive for Wells Fargo to raise money when issuing bonds and short-term 
debt instruments called commercial paper. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about California real estate lending have increased sharply in recent 
weeks as real estate problems have worsened in other areas of the country, 
particularly New England, Arizona, Florida and areas along the Eastern 
Seaboard. Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service, another rating agency, 
lowered the debt ratings of Great Western Financial in Beverly Hills, citing 
concerns over the thrift's real estate lending in California. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman 
shocked the state's bankers last month when he listed California's six largest 
metropolitan areas as places where real estate problems could be lurking. 
</P>
<P>
California banks such as Wells Fargo argue that the state's economy is stronger 
and more diverse than economies in other states, adding that California has not 
been plagued by overbuilding, a particular problem in New England. They have 
been supported in that position by California banking regulators, who earlier 
this month took the unusual step of publishing a study challenging many of 
Seidman's points. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings change for Wells Fargo includes the lowering of its senior debt to 
A+ from AA- and its commercial paper rating to A1 from A1+. S&amp;P left 
untouched the debt of the Wells Fargo Bank subsidiary -- a reflection of the 
fact that creditors of a bank unit have a higher priority in the case of a debt 
payoff problem than creditors of a bank holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being lower, the Wells Fargo ratings are still considered strong. They 
lag only Security Pacific among the state's largest banks. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wells Fargo Chairman Carl E. Reichardt called the move "inappropriate" 
and accused S&amp;P of overreacting to real estate problems of other banks 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe they are using a broad-brush approach rather than looking at 
companies on a case-by-case basis," Reichardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Rodney L. Jacobs added that he believes 
that the rating drop indicates that S&amp;P is uncomfortable with the banking 
industry as a whole and is not related to any developments at Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Azarchs, an S&amp;P analyst, said the rating agency is not trying to 
judge California's real estate market, but is concerned specifically about the 
concentration of Wells Fargo's loans. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo, one of the state's biggest real estate lenders, also is one of the 
nation's most active lenders to corporate buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Wells Fargo's loan portfolio totaled $41 billion. 
About $11 billion was in commercial real estate loans, such as those used to 
finance construction of housing tracts, office buildings and shopping centers. 
Another $7.6 billion was in home mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wells Fargo had about $4.2 billion in loans used to finance 
corporate buyouts, which are known as "highly leveraged transactions" in the 
banking industry. Some of those loans are looking increasingly risky. In March, 
for example, a company headed by financier William Farley defaulted on a 
$796-million loan provided by a group of banks led by Wells Fargo and Bankers 
Trust. Farley used the loan when buying West Point-Pepperell last year. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas K. Brown, a bank analyst at PaineWebber Inc., strongly disputed the 
S&amp;P action, saying Wells Fargo remains financially sound. He said the move 
was prompted by criticism that ratings agencies were slow to spot real estate 
problems at New England banks. 
</P>
<P>
Others are bearish, however. George Salem of Prudential-Bache Research, one of 
the most pessimistic of banking analysts, said he believes that California real 
estate prices are grossly inflated, which does not bode well for banks such as 
Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the news from S&amp;P, Wells Fargo's stock, like most issues Monday, 
rose in New York Stock Exchange trading. It closed up $1.375 to $73.50.

PAGING FIRM'S STOCK SPURT CALLED A SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission says it now knows why the stock of Santa 
Ana-based Southland Communication Inc. nearly doubled in price a few weeks ago 
despite the company's dreadful performance: a massive stock market manipulation 
scheme by the firm's president. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC filed a civil lawsuit Monday in federal court in Manhattan, accusing 
Southland Communication President and Chief Executive Ahmad N. Bayaa, as well 
as Atlanta stock broker Shaw Tehrani and four others of artificially driving up 
the price of the company's stock to $16.75 per share from $8.75 between March 
13 and April 3. Southland Communication, which does business as National 
Paging, provides electronic paging services. 
</P>
<P>
The remarkable run-up and exceptionally heavy trading volume puzzled stock 
analysts and traders because it coincided with reports that the company was in 
severe financial trouble. The bizarre activity led the SEC on April 3 to halt 
trading in the stock. It hasn't been publicly traded since. 
</P>
<P>
In the 28-page lawsuit, the SEC claims that Bayaa, Tehrani and other friends of 
Bayaa's bought up large amounts of the thinly traded stock to thwart 
"short-sellers" who were attempting to profit from an expected drop in the 
stock's price. They also hoped to keep the stock price up long enough that a 
private placement of additional stock and an acquisition of another paging 
company could be completed. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that the swift, sharp price run-up was intended in part to 
punish short-sellers, who were then forced to cover their short positions at 
substantial losses. Short-sellers borrow stock and sell it, hoping the market 
price will go down. They can then return the stock by buying shares back at the 
lower price and pocketing the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that Bayaa and the other defendants opened numerous brokerage 
accounts around the country to make it appear that there was heavy demand for 
the stock. They also allegedly engaged in sham trades and ran up an unpaid bill 
of $11.6 million from buying thousands of shares on margin -- that is, without 
immediately paying the full purchase price of the stock. Southland 
Communication's stock was traded in the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC asked that the six defendants be ordered to give up all profits from 
the allegedly illegal activity. The suit didn't specify an amount. But Daniel 
R. Schnipper, senior special counsel in the SEC's New York regional office, 
said it could total in the millions of dollars. The SEC also asks the court to 
freeze the personal assets of Bayaa and Tehrani, except for what the men need 
for essential living expenses and attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
Schnipper refused to say if there is any parallel criminal investigation under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
James J. Carroll III, a Los Angeles lawyer whose firm, Sheppard, Mullin, 
Richter and Hampton, represents both Southland Communication and Bayaa, said he 
hadn't seen the SEC lawsuit and couldn't comment on specific charges. But he 
said: "We were very surprised that Mr. Bayaa was named as a defendant. We don't 
think he's done anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Bayaa himself did not return a telephone call to his office. 
</P>
<P>
Tehrani, a stock broker at B.C. Financial Corp. in Atlanta, also did not return 
a call to his office, as did a New York lawyer said to be representing him, 
Jeffrey Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
The other defendants couldn't immediately be located for comment. They are 
Francois Alhaj and Abdul Rahman Deeb, described as self-employed oil 
consultants; Ramzia Kriedly, described as co-owner of an oil company in Dubai, 
and Ziad Twal, who the suit says "appears to be" a financial adviser employed 
by Security Pacific Bank. David Garcia, a Security Pacific spokesman, said, "We 
have no employee by that name." 
</P>
<P>
The SEC charges that the scheme began at least as early as January, 1989, when 
Bayaa and Tehrani allegedly joined together in a plan to control the market 
price of Southland Communication's stock. The suit charges that by the middle 
of last month, the two, through various accounts, came to control 89% of the 
company's publicly traded stock. 
</P>
<P>
The control enabled the firm to dramatically boost the stock price even though, 
the SEC says, the company "is in grave financial condition." For its fiscal 
first quarter ended Jan. 31, the company reported a loss of $323,529 on revenue 
of $1.9 million, compared to a net loss of $258,975 on revenue of $1.4 million 
for the same period a year ago. The SEC suit noted that Southland 
Communication's own first-quarter statement warned investors that "the 
company's recurring losses from operations and working capital deficiency raise 
substantial doubts about (the company's) ability to continue as a going 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that Bayaa had hoped to keep the stock price elevated long 
enough to complete a private placement of new stock that would have brought in 
$5 million in new capital and to complete the planned acquisition of another 
paging company, A+ Beepers of California. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says that when Tehrani learned by phone on March 3 of an anonymous 
report recommending short sales of the company's stock, he became so angry that 
he threw a telephone through his office window.

MCA STOCK PAID TO GEFFEN WORTH LESS THAN REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Geffen may want to take stock of his MCA Inc. holdings. 
</P>
<P>
In a report filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the 
entertainment company says the MCA shares that Geffen received when he sold his 
record company last month are worth about $110 million less than their widely 
reported value. 
</P>
<P>
By purchasing Geffen Records, MCA obtained a roster of artists that includes 
Guns N' Roses, Don Henley, Whitesnake and Cher. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen's 1 million shares of convertible preferred stock are valued at $435 
million in MCA's quarterly report. When the deal was announced, however, the 
shares were said by analysts to be worth about $545 million. 
</P>
<P>
Harold M. Haas, MCA vice president and chief financial officer, said the 
discrepancy is due to the encumbrances placed on the stock. "It is basically 
discounted to provide for the restrictions," Haas said. "It has restrictions on 
how and when he can sell it." 
</P>
<P>
This is no surprise to Geffen, Haas added, saying, "He knows exactly what he's 
getting." 
</P>
<P>
Geffen, however, questioned MCA's explanation. He said he attributed the lower 
stock value to the fact that he had distributed a portion of the shares to his 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the deal, which was widely criticized as overly generous at 
the time, MCA issued Geffen 1 million shares of a new preferred stock that can 
be converted into 10 million shares of MCA common stock. Each preferred share 
pays an annual dividend of $6.80 -- or 10 times the dividend on a common share 
-- but carries only one vote. 
</P>
<P>
The preferred stock was valued by analysts at $545 million based on the closing 
price of $54.50 a common share when the deal was announced. MCA, however, said 
the price was reduced by a provision that prevents Geffen from converting more 
than a small portion of the shares into common stock for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen remains unfazed. "I got paid 10 million shares of stock," he said in a 
telephone interview Monday. "Whatever it was worth is what it (the stock) was 
worth at the closing that day."

Playboy Dressing Up Its Stock: Playboy Enterprises will replace the image of a 
nude woman on its stock certificates with a clothed one in conjunction with a 
recapitalization plan unveiled last week. The change is expected to save the 
Chicago-based company about $100,000 annually, which is what it costs to 
service the accounts of about 14,000 single-share stockholders who bought the 
issue just to get the racy stock certificate.

Treasury Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $8.4 billion of new three-month 
bills at an average discount rate of 7.67%, down from 7.79% last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury also sold $8.4 billion of new six-month bills at an average 
discount rate of 7.68%, down from last week's 7.84%. The rates were the lowest 
since Feb. 12, when both three-month and six-month bills sold for 7.65%. The 
discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.93% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,806.10, and 8.10% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,611.70. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value.

Fired Exxon Manager Charges Kickbacks: Bill Alexander of Baton Rouge, La., 
fired for taking gifts in the first days of the Alaskan oil-spill cleanup, said 
company officials commonly received them for granting lucrative boat-charter 
contracts, according to the Seattle Times. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon chartered boats ranging from small fishing vessels to a 350-foot factory 
ship to help in the cleanup. Alexander said that in the beginning, kickbacks 
were "flagrant," but that they tapered off as rules were tightened. Jan Cool, 
of Exxon, said there was no widespread gift-giving.

2 TESTIFY IN BUSINESS WEEK INSIDER TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: A PRINTER AND HIS BROKER SAID THEY WERE UNAWARE THAT TRADING ON 
TIPS GLEANED FROM ADVANCE COPIES OF THE MAGAZINE WAS ILLEGAL. 
</P>

<P>
The first two men to stand trial in the nationwide Business Week insider 
trading scandal took the stand Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
both claiming they were unaware that what they had done was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged in a civil insider-trading 
lawsuit that Brian J. Callahan, a former broker in the Anaheim office of 
Prudential-Bache Securities, and William N. Jackson, a former quality-control 
analyst at a Torrance printing plant, got early copies of Business Week and 
then bought stock based on recommendations in the magazine's "Inside Wall 
Street" column. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC claims that Callahan, 30, of Anaheim, and several brokerage clients 
made $19,684 in illegal profits while Jackson and two of his brothers racked up 
$19,506 in ill-gotten gains. Jackson and Callahan, however, are the only two 
defendants named in the SEC lawsuit, which is seeking to recover damages equal 
to three times the amount of profits the two men made. 
</P>
<P>
This one of several apparently unrelated cases around the country in which the 
SEC alleges that several individuals made illicit trades using advance 
information from a Business Week stock column. This is the first of the cases 
to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 34, of Long Beach, testified Monday that he did pick up a copy of 
Business Week at his employer -- R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons -- at about 2 a.m. 
on Thursday mornings between September, 1987, and July, 1988. He said he would 
then read the magazine -- including "Inside Wall Street" -- and place orders 
through Callahan several hours later after the stock markets opened in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"I traded Business Week stocks to try and make money," Jackson testified. 
"Nobody said it was illegal." 
</P>
<P>
SEC attorneys showed Jackson a copy of a confidentiality agreement he signed 
that forbade him from trading on information he learned from the company's 
financial printing business. Donnelley had posted numerous warnings to 
employees around its plant about insider trading, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he never saw those posters and said he didn't think that Business 
Week was considered financial printing because Donnelley didn't increase its 
security provisions, such as cordoning off certain areas, when producing the 
magazine as it did with annual reports or proxy statements. 
</P>
<P>
He further testified that he noticed the prices of stocks in the magazine's 
column often went up on Thursdays when he was buying the stock, so he assumed 
that the recommendations he was using were public knowledge and not inside 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sure it had reached the public because the stock prices went up at least 
one dollar in some cases," Jackson said. "It was clearly legal." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Callahan testified that he thought Jackson was getting the 
recommendations from a computer program. He said he didn't know where Jackson 
worked until just a few weeks before he was questioned by the SEC in the summer 
of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock broker is first and foremost an order taker," Callahan told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson and a mutual friend -- who introduced the two men -- both testified 
that they had told Callahan about Donnelley and the early copies of Business 
Week. Callahan said they were "lying."

Kidder, Peabody Group Inc. may lay off up to 10% of its 5,600 employees to cut 
costs, a newspaper reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The company denied that sizable layoffs were in the works, however. 
</P>
<P>
Peabody Group's investment banking division, with about 400 employees, may be 
one of the job-reduction targets, sources told the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Investment banking has been hit hard by a decline in merger and acquisition 
activity on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman said Kidder is not planning widespread layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Along with every firm on Wall Street, we're looking at ways to reduce costs," 
she said. "There may be some further routine streamlining throughout the year."

THAT'S THE WAY IT IS: When Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev wanted to get 
the word out about the Baltic states Monday night, his statement was read on 
the Soviet national news program Vremya (A1), a show that up until recently had 
been broadcast in Orange County, too. . . . It was on Huntington Beach's 
KOCE-TV Channel 50 for three weeks in February and was offered to PBS stations 
nationwide for a trial run. But it has yet to become available on a permanent 
basis. . . . Proponents say they need to raise $1 million a year in donations 
to make the show available for American viewers. David Reyes and Jim Newton

POSSIBLE DEFECT GROUNDS NAVY, MARINE COPTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Marine Corps and Navy Monday announced suspension of all flight operations 
worldwide by CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters because of a possible mechanical 
defect. 
</P>
<P>
The move effectively grounds 342 helicopters -- 261 used by the Marines and 81 
by the Navy. Sixty of the aircraft are based at the Tustin U.S. Marine Corps 
Helicopter Air Station, a major Sea Knight base. The Vietnam-era helicopter, 
long considered a workhorse for the military, is used to transport troops and 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The grounding order came 10 days after a Sea Knight based in Tustin made a 
"hard landing" in the California desert, injuring the 17 Marines aboard, the 
Navy said Monday. Senior Navy officers in Washington said the helicopters were 
grounded because of a transmission problem that could lead to a loss of power 
to the rear rotor. 
</P>
<P>
Although the CH-46 has been involved in fatal accidents, it is considered one 
of the military's most reliable. In 1984, Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology 
magazine listed it as having one of the lowest accident rates of aircraft the 
Navy flies. 
</P>
<P>
However, more than 30 Marines around the world have died in Sea Knight 
accidents since 1980. The most serious occurred in the Atlantic in 1986, where 
a crash killed 15 Marines. A number of Marines based in Orange County have been 
killed in Sea Knight crashes. The most recent incident involved two from the El 
Toro Marine Corps Station who died in May, 1989, when their craft collided with 
another helicopter near Reno. Four Tustin-based Marines were killed in March, 
1989, when their Sea Knight crashed in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, the most recent reported crash of a Sea Knight was at Camp Pendleton 
in March, 1988; four Tustin Marines were injured. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation into the possibility of mechanical problems is expected to 
take several weeks to complete, a Navy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you ground a fleet of aircraft, it's not something you do on a whim," 
said Senior Chief Petty Officer Bob Howard, a Pacific Fleet spokesman in San 
Diego. "It's a very serious thing. But the most important thing is the safety 
of the crew." 
</P>
<P>
The grounding will have a major effect everywhere the helicopter's squadrons 
are based. "We have other helicopters, but the Sea Knight is our main assault 
helicopter," said Marine Lt. Gene Browne, a spokesman for the squadrons. "This 
is going to have a serious impact on flight operations." 
</P>
<P>
The 35 Sea Knights based at the North Island Naval Station on Coronado Island 
are not the most used aircraft, spokesman Fred Wilson said, and the Navy will 
rely on other helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
In the May 4 incident, the Sea Knight made a hard landing while participating 
in a warfare exercise in the desert at the Marine Air Ground Combat Center in 
Twentynine Palms. The three crew members belonged to the 3rd Marine Aircraft 
Wing headquartered in Tustin; the others on board were from Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The military believes that the cause of the accident was a problem in the rotor 
and transmission the craft. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky with the last one that there were no fatalities. What we are 
trying to avoid is being not so lucky the next time," Browne said. "This is 
basically a precautionary measure. You've got problems that are inherent to one 
aircraft . . , so if we need to ground the aircraft to find out, it's an 
inconvenience; but the lives are more important." 
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine tandem-rotor Sea Knight operates with a three-man crew and can 
carry 17 men. It weighs 15,000 pounds, can attain a maximum speed of 166 
m.p.h., and has a rear landing ramp that allows rapid loading and unloading of 
cargo and supplies. It also has an external hook to carry loads beneath its 
belly. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was first built by Boeing Vertol Co. of Philadelphia in 1965.

COMMUTER TRAIN GETTING ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All aboard! 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Only 20 of the 140 or so daily passengers on Orange County's new commuter train 
to Los Angeles have actually been persuaded by the new service to forsake their 
cars for the train, county transportation officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining passengers, officials said, had been regular Amtrak riders 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Although this means it's costing taxpayers more than $130 to subsidize each 
one-way trip made by the 20 new train commuters, Orange County Transportation 
Commission officials remain optimistic that ridership will soar once the word 
gets out. 
</P>
<P>
Total cost of the rail service, which began April 30, is about $1.5 million, 
with first-year revenue from passengers expected to reach $1.1 million. 
Officials are hoping to attract 350 daily commuters within 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
Total ridership is impressive so far, given that the new commuter train 
currently seats only 197 passengers, said OCTC Executive Director Stanley T. 
Oftelie. 
</P>
<P>
OCTC plans to market the new service via direct mail to commuters who have 
already expressed an interest in rail projects and in ride-sharing. Names of 
those people have been collected by the commission and by Commuter Network, the 
computerized ride-sharing match-up program operated by the Orange County 
Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
The new rail service involves one train each morning that departs from San Juan 
Capistrano and stops in Santa Ana, Anaheim and Fullerton on the way to Union 
Station in Los Angeles. There is a return trip in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the service is to relieve congestion on the Santa Ana Freeway 
during a massive, $1.6-billion widening project. A portion of the project is 
under way between the junction of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways in 
Irvine and the interchange for the Santa Ana and Costa Mesa freeways in Santa 
Ana.

COURT COMMISSIONER ASKED TO RESIGN AFTER DRUG ARREST 
</P>

<P>
A Municipal Court commissioner arrested last week on drug charges was asked 
Monday to resign his office. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Linda Lancett Miller said she and the other 11 judges on the 
North Municipal Court bench agreed that Commissioner Robert K. Tuller Jr. 
should submit his resignation effective July 1. Miller said it is the first 
time a commissioner in North Municipal Court has been asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
If he does not resign, state law empowers the judges to fire him from the 
position, which is appointed. The court will select a commissioner to take his 
place, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuller, 46, sought treatment Saturday for drug dependency at the Betty Ford 
Center in Rancho Mirage and was not available for comment Monday, according to 
his father, Robert K. Tuller Sr. The younger Tuller posted a $5,000 bond after 
his arrest last Friday in a cocaine sting operation staged at an Anaheim hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Undercover agents invited Tuller to a "party" at the Anaheim Sheraton, police 
said. Tuller was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession; his arraignment 
is set for next Monday in Central Municipal Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police, the district attorney's office and the state Bureau of 
Narcotics Enforcement launched an investigation of Tuller six months ago after 
police received a tip alleging that Tuller was using cocaine on a "regular 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said Monday that she and the other judges regretted asking Tuller to 
leave. "The unfortunate incident of last Friday made this action necessary but 
unpleasant, given the good service he has provided to this court," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said Tuller had been presiding over all the court's misdemeanor 
arraignments this year, after having spent 1989 handling the traffic calendar. 
The judges appointed him to the bench in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Miller declined to elaborate on what transpired at the Monday morning meeting, 
other than to say she and the other judges were not happy about having to take 
action against a man described as well-liked in the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sad and disappointed," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuller's father decried the decision and said the judges should wait until his 
son completes his treatment at the Betty Ford Center before deciding his fate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're acting in haste," said the elder Tuller, who is a Fullerton 
lawyer. "He is still a valued employee. In this modern day, most employers see 
how their man performs in the rehabilitation and if he comes out a better man 
than before." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer friends of Tuller also rose to his defense Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to have given him an opportunity to present his side," Marshall M. 
Schulman, a prominent criminal defense lawyer in Santa Ana, said of the judges. 
</P>
<P>
Schulman suggested that Anaheim police were conducting a "vendetta" against 
Tuller. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't help but wonder why they had to work this man for so long," Schulman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Schulman described Tuller as a well-respected member of the Orange County legal 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always a gentleman, fair to all sides," Schulman said. "I know he will 
get this behind him and will continue to be a fine contributor to the system." 
</P>
<P>
Tuller's father said the drug-use allegations came as a shock to the family. 
The younger Tuller is married and has two children. He served as a bailiff and 
attorney before being named to the Fullerton bench. 
</P>
<P>
The father said that, after Friday's arrest, his son acknowledged to him that 
he had a drug problem and that he needed help. The judge decided to check into 
the Betty Ford Center, which charges $8,500 for a 28-day drug and alcohol 
treatment program and which is popular among celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not so sure he needed the help, but he thought it was the best thing to do 
to guarantee he would get over the problem," the elder Tuller said.

BROWN'S WIFE TELLS OF THEIR EARLIER AFFAIR

When she was an 11-year-old girl with no place to go, Patti Bailey testified 
Monday, her brother-in-law took her into his home and talked of marrying her 
someday. Fondling soon followed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At age 15, Bailey said, she and brother-in-law David Brown, then 31, began 
having sexual intercourse -- usually once a week, while her sister was in the 
shower or out shopping. 
</P>
<P>
And at 17, Bailey said, she was so devoted to the man who gave her "everything" 
that she stood over her sister's bed one night in 1985 in their Garden Grove 
home and pointed a loaded handgun at the sleeping woman, prepared to shoot her 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey didn't pull the trigger. "I couldn't do it," she testified. But a month 
later, 14-year-old Cinnamon Brown, David Brown's daughter, did. Brown's fifth 
wife was dead, and Patti Bailey was finally able to "keep David for myself," 
she testified. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, now 22 and incarcerated at the California Youth Authority at Camarillo 
after pleading guilty to murder for her participation in her sister's 1985 
killing, took the stand Monday as a star witness against the man who is now her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
David Brown, 38, is now in his second week of trial in Superior Court on murder 
charges for allegedly masterminding the killing of his wife, 24-year-old Linda 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
After his wife's death, Brown collected $835,000 on his wife's insurance 
policies and then secretly married Patti Bailey. The couple, who lived together 
in Anaheim Hills until their joint arrest in September, 1988, have a 2-year-old 
daughter. The child now lives with David Brown's parents in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting her husband an occasional glance as she testified in a shaky voice, 
Bailey said that Brown filled a void in her life when he took her into his 
home. She had left her poverty-ridden Riverside home because of problems with 
an alcoholic mother and a brother who molested her, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
"He was everything," she said of Brown. "He was warm, he was loving, he was 
sensitive when I needed someone." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey conceded that she was confused about the idea of having sexual 
relation's with her sister's husband but said David Brown never forced her. 
After her experience with her own brother, Bailey testified, "I just thought 
that's the way it went . . . in a normal house." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey's version of events in her daylong testimony echoed many points made 
under oath last week by Cinnamon Brown. Among the points she corroborated were 
Brown's instructions to use a pillow to muffle the sound of the gunshot and his 
wake-up call on March 19, 1985, with the words: "It has to be tonight." And 
like Cinnamon Brown, Bailey also testified that David Brown convinced her that 
his wife was plotting to do him harm -- ostensibly to take over his lucrative 
business. She helped kill her sister, Bailey testified, "to protect David." 
</P>
<P>
But under cross-examination, which will continue today, defense attorney Gary 
Pohlson sought to show that his client was not the instigator of Bailey's 
jealous plot and that she was only pinning the blame on him now to reduce her 
time behind bars.

COMPANY FINDS AN ALLY IN FORMER FOE

<P>
Three months ago, Councilman Robert A. Curtis was battling for his political 
life against the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
The giant development company was a major financier of the failed campaign to 
recall Curtis, contributing more than $350,000 and a high-paid political 
consultant to the effort. And Curtis fought back, accusing the Mission Viejo 
Co. of trying to buy City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Now, these bitterest of foes have become unlikely allies. On Monday, the 
developer released a statement announcing Curtis' endorsement of a 
controversial 719-home development proposed by the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We see it as glasnost," said Wendy Wetzel, Mission Viejo Co. spokeswoman. 
"It's time to put the disruptions behind us and go on with what's good for 
Mission Viejo." 
</P>
<P>
After a series of meetings with company President Jim Gilleran over the 
weekend, Curtis said he gave his endorsement in exchange for the company's 
promise to abandon several housing projects totaling 392 units and to give the 
city a potential City Hall site that both sides said is worth several million 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"They blew me away," Curtis said. "This proposal is an example of what can be 
achieved through good faith cooperation and compromise rather than polarization 
and confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which would still need to be approved by the Planning 
Commission and the City Council, the city would be deeded seven acres of prime 
commercial land near Crown Valley Parkway and Interstate 5 for possible use as 
a City Hall site. 
</P>
<P>
The land is next to a proposed major commercial center planned by the Mission 
Viejo Co. that would include a million square feet of high-rise office space, 
restaurants, hotels and theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 719-unit housing project would result in the destruction of 
Naciente Ridge, the city's last undeveloped hilltops near Olympiad Boulevard 
between Oso and Alicia parkways. The development plans have drawn intense 
criticism from neighbors concerned about imperiled views, traffic and other 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said he tried to address the ridge issue, winning a concession from the 
company to build a slope above 40 of the 49 proposed ridge-top homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially it will be a manufactured ridge," he said. "Those who feel there 
should be no homes at all will not be satisfied. But that hope is unattainable 
and unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Milt Jacobson, a member of the Citizens to Save the Ridge, said he has mixed 
emotions about the deal negotiated by Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel betrayed, but I also don't feel that the city of Mission Viejo 
has won a victory," Jacobson said. "I kind of feel lousy about it, even though 
we got more than I thought we would from the Mission Viejo Co."FRANK MESSINA

RULING BACKS DISTRICT IN SCHOOL CLOSURE

<P>
A judge has cleared the way for the Fountain Valley School District to sell or 
lease Fountain Valley Elementary School, despite efforts of a parents group 
that tried to keep the school open. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam ruled that the school 
district did not act illegally when it voted to close the school June 30. 
</P>
<P>
In February, a 40-member parent group, the Future Education Protection 
Committee, filed a lawsuit contending that the school district did not properly 
conduct its environmental impact study and that the closing would waste public 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also included warnings about Roch Courreges Elementary School, one 
of three schools the relocated Fountain Valley Elementary students would be 
attending. The parents believe Roch Courreges is too close to high-tension 
electrical lines. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids will never attend that school," said Barbara Emerson, a plaintiff in 
the case. "If we have to, we'll send them to a private school." 
</P>
<P>
Since April 25, the school district was under a temporary restraining order 
prohibiting the lease or sale of Fountain Valley Elementary until the judge 
made his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Brandt, attorney for the parents, said a decision about whether to appeal 
the case has not been made. 
</P>
<P>
School district Supt. Rubin L. Ingram said the district has never had plans to 
sell the school but may lease the property.ERIK HAMILTON

CHURCH, DEVELOPER AGREE TO LAND SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Officials at the Saddleback Valley Community Church and Hon Development have 
agreed to a land swap that will move a proposed $55-million church complex out 
of the rural foothills below Cleveland National Park and nearer to El Toro, 
county officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The church, with one of the county's fastest-growing congregations, will take 
over a 60-acre industrial site between El Toro Road and the proposed Foothill 
Transportation Corridor. In return, Hon will get the church's hilly, 113-acre 
parcel off Santiago Canyon Road near Live Oak Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, officials at the Environmental Management Agency signed a notice of 
preparation on the new church site, which in effect starts the county's 
land-use planning study. It will begin an environmental impact report and 
eventually conduct public hearings before the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Kruen, executive pastor of the Saddleback church, said that a verbal 
agreement has been reached on the swap but that it will not take place until 
the county grants approval of the church complex at the new site in the 
2,700-acre, $2-billion Foothill Ranch planned community. 
</P>
<P>
When church officials initially proposed building a Trabuco Canyon complex that 
called for lighted softball fields, 84 rooms for Sunday school and parking for 
2,200 vehicles, critics complained that it would generate too much traffic and 
ruin the rural flavor of the area that stretches toward the Santa Ana 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, the church would build a 2,800-seat fellowship hall, a 
32,000-square-foot school building that could double as a day-care center, 
parking lots and baseball parks during the first phase of construction at the 
site near El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
In the second and third phases, a main church capable of seating 4,800 would be 
built, along with two more large school buildings and a gymnasium. The building 
plan could take up to 10 years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely everyone is a winner," said County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who 
brought Hon Development and Saddleback Valley Church together to begin 
negotiations. "It relieves a lot of people of a major issue." 
</P>
<P>
Hon Vice President Chris Downey said the company has no immediate plan to 
develop the 113-acre parcel. Company officials, he said, intend to hold the 
property as an investment for a couple of years.GEORGE FRANK

<P>
In spite of last-minute appeals from residents, City Council gave final 
approval Monday to plans for a 8.5-acre hilltop park with a regulation-size 
baseball field and six tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the park, planned for the north end of Alta Laguna Boulevard in 
the Top of the World neighborhood, say they now will take their case to the 
state Coastal Commission, which will consider the park in July. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Alta Laguna park has from the beginning been a source of 
controversy. While athletic boosters maintain that the recreation facilities 
are needed, some residents have said the park is too big for their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Robert May, a Top of the World resident, filed an appeal of the 
design review board's approval of the park. Another appeal had been filed by 
the city staff, who anticipated a last-minute appeal by park opponents and were 
eager to obtain a hearing before the Coastal Commission as soon as 
possible.LESLIE EARNEST

HIGH COURT DELAYS KRISHNA CASE RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court has delayed a decision whether to hear the Hare 
Krishna's appeal for relief from a $5-million judgment involving an Orange 
County mother and her daughter, who had once been a member of the religious 
sect. 
</P>
<P>
The court also refused to hear an appeal by Marsha George and her daughter, 
Robin George Westerkamp that it restore part of the nearly $10-million Orange 
County Superior Court judgment. But Westerkamp said the family had not had high 
expectations of success. 
</P>
<P>
The big disappointment, she said, is waiting for the high court's decision on 
the Hare Krishnas' appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"We've waited seven years, I suppose we can wait a few more weeks, or even 
months," Westerkamp said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County jury in 1983 had awarded $32.5 million to the Georges, who 
claimed that the Hare Krishnas had coerced Robin into running away from home 
and joining the sect at age 14, then had hidden her away from her parents, who 
lived in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
The trial judge, James A. Jackman, reduced the award to about $10 million, and 
the 4th District Court of Appeal further reduced it to $2.9 million. The 
interest on that amount puts the total at about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Hare Krishnas claim that the only way they can raise enough money would be 
to sell some of their temples, including the one in Laguna Beach, where Robin 
George had spent time as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
The Hare Krishnas argue that sales of the temples would destroy the sect and 
would be an interference of its religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Hare Krishna leadership in San Diego issued a news release stating 
that the high court's decision to delay a ruling "is a positive sign." 
</P>
<P>
"The longer the justices have to examine the facts surrounding this case, the 
more obvious it will become that the lower courts have trampled on the 
religious freedom of hundreds of thousands of people," according to its news 
release.JERRY HICKS

FERTILIZER'S FUTURE IN CLEANUP IS DEBATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a year after the Exxon Valdez spilled about 11 million gallons of oil 
off the coast of Alaska, experts are debating whether a French fertilizer that 
helped clean up the spill should be used at other toxic-waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of microbiologists convened to discuss the fertilizer at the annual 
meeting of the American Society for Microbiology at the Anaheim Convention 
Center on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The process, called bio-remediation, involves the sprinkling of the fertilizer 
to stimulate naturally occurring toxic-munching organisms to devour toxic 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will work in other situations . . . and have many future uses, said 
Ronald M. Atlas, a University of Louisville biologist who was a consultant for 
the Exxon Corp. during the initial post-spill cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Some possibilities include unleashing the organisms on landfills, toxic-waste 
sites and contaminated ground-water basins, Atlas said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that it is cost-efficient because the fertilizer helps the organisms 
multiply. 
</P>
<P>
Bio-remediation is at least 20 years old but gained notoriety after being used 
on the Alaska spill. 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists maintain that the efficiency of the fertilizer, called Inipol, 
cannot be simply duplicated in any environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something you can just pull off the shelf and say, 'Let's use this,' 
" said Hap Pritchard, an Environmental Protection Agency official who has been 
involved with the ongoing cleanup efforts in Alaska. "You still have to take it 
on a site-by-site basis." 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard said Inipol must be used minimally to avoid further pollution of the 
environment by the fertilizer itself. He also said the organisms were less 
effective in breaking down larger clumps of crude and did not work well in deep 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
"The question now is really how best to apply the fertilizer and what are the 
long-term effects," Pritchard said. LISA MASCARO

<P>
ANGELS: JACK HOWELL MAY NOT SHOW IT, BUT HE GETS FRUSTRATED WHEN HIS BAT ISN'T 
CONTRIBUTING AS MUCH AS HIS GLOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Throwing helmets or bats to vent frustration is not Jack Howell's style. The 
Angel third baseman prefers to keep his feelings to himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't say much, but he thinks a lot," Angel hitting instructor Deron 
Johnson said. "He's a thinker." 
</P>
<P>
Thinking that he wasn't contributing has nagged Howell in recent weeks. He has 
endured a one-for-26 slide that sent his batting average plummeting from .292 
April 29 to .200 Saturday and led to him being removed in the lineup against 
tough left-handed relievers such as the New York Yankees' Dave Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
Though he is more noted for his fielding than his hitting -- Howell's .974 
fielding average last season was the best among major league third basemen, but 
his .228 batting average was the lowest of his career -- Howell ached to regain 
the touch that he had found during spring training and the first two weeks of 
the season when he went six for 15. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not because I haven't tried," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His determination paid off against Boston Sunday, when Howell went two for four 
and drove in two runs for a team that was starved for run production and still 
digesting Bert Blyleven's criticism of the offense Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only go so far until you hit the breaking point," said Howell, who is 
hitting .213 with nine runs batted in as the Angels begin an eight-game trip 
tonight in Milwaukee. Curiously enough, given his career .179 average against 
left-handers, he's hitting .250 this season (six for 24) against lefties and 
.200 (13 for 65) against right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been frustrating, the slump I've been in the last two or three weeks," 
Howell said. "The last few games, I was swinging the bat well but had nothing 
to show for it. It tends to get frustrating. That's what everybody here's been 
going through." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven chose to work off his anger in a public statement, an avenue Howell 
isn't likely to choose. But he couldn't dispute the accuracy of the message. 
</P>
<P>
"I was brought up to believe that you can't argue with the truth and that's 
definitely the truth," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
That the Angels scored more runs in their 8-4 victory over Boston Sunday than 
in their previous four games combined doesn't mean their problems are over. In 
the same vein, Howell knows that one productive day doesn't mean he soon will 
be a .300 hitter. But Howell saw the team's success and his own Sunday as a 
start toward regaining equilibrium and fulfilling their potential. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to contribute," said Howell, who had 20 home runs last season, 
the second-highest total on the team, but also struck out 125 times, second 
only to Devon White. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're nine games under .500, you don't think if you come out and win 
today you'll be at .500," Howell said. "The bottom line is that in the next 
week, week and a half, we have to go out and play good ball. To say we're going 
to win 20 in a row is unrealistic. We just have to play as well as we can. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, if we're going to win this thing, each individual has to 
do his job, and if it's meant to be, it's meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader knew that Howell was agonizing during his slump, 
despite presenting a quiet front. 
</P>
<P>
"As hard-crusted . . . competitive as most of us are, we've got very thin skins 
and are sensitive and it doesn't take much for us to lose faith in what we're 
doing," said Rader. "If you don't experience a certain degree of success and 
contribute, it just continually lowers your sense of self-worth. It seems like 
a never-ending spiral." 
</P>
<P>
Rader doesn't consider Howell's offensive output secondary to his defensive 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's vitally important to contribute offensively, to feel that you're part of 
the program and pulling your weight," Rader said. "It's important no matter who 
you are and where you play." 
</P>
<P>
Howell has made five errors at third in 28 games this season, including errors 
in three consecutive games for the first time in his career last week. He made 
only 11 errors last season. However, injuries have unsettled the Angels' 
infield this season and have kept shortstop Dick Schofield -- another defensive 
stalwart -- out of the lineup entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"You could go four months and play great and then you go through a little 
period where you get a couple of tough hops," Howell said. "Then you could go 
the next month and not make one (error). It's tough to talk about because you 
play 130 games and there are so many different situations . . . 
</P>
<P>
"(Winning a Gold Glove) is something I don't have control over. The only thing 
I can control is the figures I put up. The bottom line is the lowest number of 
errors and that I led both leagues in fielding percentage. There's still a lot 
of things other than the error total to think of when you're out there." 
</P>
<P>
Howell didn't consider it an insult when Rader had him bat ninth against Boston 
Sunday. "The next day, I might be hitting fourth," Howell said. "I just want to 
do the best I can and do whatever it takes to get us going. . . . We aren't 
looking at the standings. Right now, we have to deal with the thing at hand, 
and that's obviously that we have to start winning some ballgames and start 
producing some hits and runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in my career have I given up and I never plan on giving up." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels recalled right-hander Willie Fraser Monday from triple-A Edmonton 
and optioned left-hander Cliff Young to the Trappers. Fraser, 25, was optioned 
to Edmonton April 30 when the Angels reduced their rosters to 25. He was 1-0 
with a 3.21 earned-run average in three appearances with the Trappers and was 
1-0 with an 11.81 ERA in six outings with the Angels. Young, who was recalled 
May 12, did not pitch for the Angels. . . . Dante Bichette leads the team with 
18 RBIs, but only four of those have come on the road. . . . Wally Joyner has 
an eight-game hitting streak and is 11 for 24 (.458) in that span. . . . Lance 
Parrish has 14 hits in his last 41 at-bats (.341). . . . Devon White is one for 
17 over his last five games and two for 21 over six. . . . Kent Anderson, who 
has played in 22 games, has yet to drive in a run this season.

Interactive Data Systems, an Irvine software company, said Monday that it has 
created a software program that translates proprietary programs run on 
computers made by MAI Basic Four into a standard language compatible with most 
business computers. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Tsumpes, president of Interactive Data, said the company's new software 
translates Business Basic software, which runs on MAI's business-oriented 
minicomputers, to the "C" language that can run on Unix-based computers. 
</P>
<P>
"The beneficiary is the Business Basic user because it allows him to use MAI's 
software on computers made by other manufacturers," Tsumpes said. "This gives 
flexibility to users" by making MAI systems compatible with software programs 
written in languages other than Business Basic. 
</P>
<P>
Interactive Data, founded in 1984, has 11 employees and reported $2 million in 
sales in 1989. Officials of MAI Basic Four of Tustin did not return calls for 
comment.

2 INSIDER-TRADING DEFENDANTS TAKE THE STAND; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: A STOCKBROKER AND A PRINTING COMPANY EMPLOYEE IN ONE OF THE CASES 
INVOLVING ADVANCE INFORMATION FROM BUSINESS WEEK TESTIFY THAT THEY DID NOT 
THINK THEIR ACTIONS WERE ILLEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The first two men to stand trial in the nationwide Business Week insider 
trading scandal took the stand Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
each claiming that he was completely unaware that what he had done was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged in a civil insider trading 
lawsuit that Brian J. Callahan, a former broker in the Anaheim office of 
Prudential-Bache Securities, and William N. Jackson, a former quality control 
analyst at a Torrance printing plant, obtained early copies of Business Week 
and bought stock based on recommendations in the magazine's "Inside Wall 
Street" column. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC charges that Callahan, 30, of Anaheim and several brokerage clients 
made illegal profits of $19,684 and that Jackson and two of his brothers made 
illegal profits of $19,506. Jackson and Callahan, however, are the only two 
defendants in the suit, which is seeking to recover damages equal to three 
times the amount of the profits the two men made. 
</P>
<P>
The case is one of several around the country in which the SEC is alleging that 
individuals made illicit trades using advance information from a Business Week 
stock column. This is the first of the cases, which appear to be unrelated, to 
go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 34, of Long Beach testified Monday that he did pick up a copy of 
Business Week at his employer -- printer R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons -- about 2 
a.m. on Thursdays between September, 1987, and July, 1988. Jackson said he then 
read the magazine, including the "Inside Wall Street" column and then would 
place orders through Callahan several hours later, after the stock markets 
opened in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I traded Business Week stocks to try and make money," Jackson testified. 
"Nobody said it was illegal." 
</P>
<P>
SEC attorneys then showed Jackson a copy of a confidentiality agreement that he 
had signed which forbids Donnelley employees from trading on information 
gleaned from the company's financial printing business. Donnelley had posted 
numerous warnings about insider trading to employees around its plant, the SEC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he never saw those posters. He also said he did not think Business 
Week was considered financial printing because Donnelley did not take the kind 
of extra security precautions such as cordoning off certain areas that it did 
with annual reports or proxy statements. 
</P>
<P>
He further testified that he noticed that the prices of stocks in the 
magazine's column often went up on Thursdays when he was buying the stock, so 
he assumed that the recommendations he was following were public knowledge and 
not inside information. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sure it had reached the public because the stock prices went up at least 
$1 in some cases," Jackson said. "It was clearly legal." 
</P>
<P>
Callahan testified that he thought that Jackson was getting the recommendations 
from a computer program. Callahan said he did not know where Jackson worked 
until just a few weeks before the SEC began questioning him in the summer of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The stockbroker is first and foremost an order taker," Callahan told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson and a mutual friend who introduced the two both testified that they 
had told Callahan about Donnelley and the early copies of Business Week. 
Callahan said they were "lying." 
</P>
<P>
The SEC produced a Prudential-Bache new-account form that falsely states that 
Jackson, rather than working for Donnelley, was employed by Crucible Steel. 
Callahan said Jackson told him that; Jackson said Callahan wrote that on the 
form. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kon, a Prudential-Bache broker and former colleague of Callahan, 
testified Monday that he went to Prudential-Bache's management after he noticed 
that Callahan's stock tips were often the same ones that appeared later in 
Business Week. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan, however, testified that he was the individual who notified his 
supervisor and that he did so after Jackson told him where he was getting his 
information. Callahan was dismissed by Prudential-Bache in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan is a prominent Orange County figure. In the mid-'80s, he contributed a 
weekly "Hot Trades" stock summary to the Orange County Register. He has been 
fascinated with the stock market since age 11, when his father got him started 
with eight shares of Walt Disney Co. He attended Servite High School, a 
Catholic boys school in Anaheim, and was graduated from UC Riverside, where he 
started an investment club. He and Jackson met in 1985 at the graduation 
ceremony of a mutual friend in Long Beach.

ON 6TH DAY OF SCHOOL, KIDS LEARN THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY; 
</P>
<P>
CLASSES: THOUSANDS OF YOUNGSTERS SPEND HALF-DAYS ON SATURDAYS LEARNING THE 
CUSTOMS OF COUNTRIES THAT THEIR FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ten-year-old Albert Kuo would rather spend Saturday mornings watching cartoons 
or flying his kite with friends from Serrania Avenue Elementary School in 
Woodland Hills. Instead, he is drawing Chinese characters, speaking Mandarin 
and perfecting a mean game of Ping-Pong at the Chinese School conducted at 
James Monroe High School in Sepulveda, where he is known as Kuo Chun-Yu. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of thousands of youngsters in the San Fernando Valley who take part 
in half-day Saturday classes that teach the customs in countries that their 
families have left behind. 
</P>
<P>
On any given Saturday, students might be preparing for the Chinese dragon boat 
festival, celebrating the Korean New Year of Sulnal, making meals for a Jewish 
Seder or folding paper for Japanese origami. These nonprofit classes meet on 
public school campuses and focus on language, history, dance and the art of 
ethnic communities. 
</P>
<P>
Programs are as diverse as the Valley populace. Social clubs and ethnic 
churches offer information about classes for children who are African, 
Armenian, Dutch, Filipino, French, Greek, Hebrew, Iranian, Irish, Nicaraguan, 
Palestinian, Russian, Salvadoran, Thai, Vietnamese and many others. Classes 
cost $5 to $10 each day. 
</P>
<P>
"This keeps some kind of cultural identity so our heritage is not lost," said 
Sue W. Fan, principal for the 240 children who attend the Chinese School 
sponsored by the San Fernando Valley Chinese Cultural Assn. in Northridge. "It 
gives a better self-image to know their origin." 
</P>
<P>
Young children often rebel against a sixth day of school, which requires a good 
share of homework. Even Fan's two children complain about Chinese School. She 
reminds them that in China or Taiwan they would be required to go to a sixth 
day of school. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes my mom happy, but I'd like to be out with my friends playing video 
games," said Fan's son, Kevin, 9. 
</P>
<P>
So teachers try to make the cultural classes fun with crafts, contests, 
performances and sports. Some students get credit for high school language 
classes by coming to Saturday schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think 'what a dud' when I first came here, but now it's typically 
weird because I want to learn more," said Luice Hwang, 16, who grew up as a 
Valley girl but who, unlike most of her classmates at Van Nuys High School, can 
speak and write Chinese. "I know one of the most difficult languages in the 
world. I can't wait to go to Taiwan someday." 
</P>
<P>
The classes also help Hwang understand her parents' strict moral upbringing. 
"Like when they give me a curfew or say that I can't have a boyfriend until I'm 
78," she joked. 
</P>
<P>
"This makes good communication with parents because so many times parents don't 
speak so good English," said In-Sook Cho, principal of the Korean Institute of 
Southern California, which has 160 students at Parkman Junior High School each 
Saturday in Woodland Hills. "We have two handicaps with our children -- 
different generation and different culture -- and these classes help make an 
understanding from both sides." 
</P>
<P>
Cho's school offers specialties such as tae kwon do, abacus and Korean 
traditional dance. Girls in the dance classes wear long dresses -- called 
han-bok -- in pink, yellow, green and blue silk with gold lace. 
</P>
<P>
After practicing the fan dance with two pink feathered fans and the silk dress 
her grandmother made in Korea, Jeannie Kim, 11, explained how the dance uses 
traditional Korean steps. 
</P>
<P>
"The music doesn't have much of a beat," Kim said about the steady droning of 
Korean music. "I'd much rather be listening to Bobby Brown, the New Kids on the 
Block or Milli Vanilli." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers' salaries barely cover gas money at the Korean School, Cho said, but 
the educators command respect that teachers in public schools might not get. 
</P>
<P>
"Respect and good attitude make a good student," said Cho, who added that 
students in Korea are told not to step on a teacher's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
Parkman Junior High School Principal Andrew Anderson welcomes schools such as 
the Korean Institute to his campus. His school enrollment is only 14% Asian, 
but he knows that many academic awards at the end of the year will go to that 
community because of its intense ethnic training. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no more ability than any other student, they just enjoy learning," 
Anderson said. "Sometimes they grumble about spending four hours Saturday 
morning in school, but it is good to preserve traditions. And, it is good for 
the whole community because we all learn from them." 
</P>
<P>
Students rarely learn about their culture in school, said Principal Gabriel 
Injejikian, whose Ferrahian High School in Encino is one of five Armenian 
schools between Canoga Park and Glendale that offer after-school language 
classes. "Armenian is just not taught very much in public school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday schools offer immediate practical applications, such as a recent 
computer class demonstrating software using Chinese characters, Chinese 
Cultural Assn. President Steve Yang said. His school also teaches kung fu and 
flute and reminds families of traditions such as dabbing rice wine to the 
forehead of children to ward off bad luck and eating a tamale-like dish with 
rice wrapped in bamboo leaves. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the time, the classes have simpler applications. 
</P>
<P>
"These schools are nice because now my children can write to their 
grandparents," Yang said.

One of the most provocative and least visible local architects is Eugene Ray, 
head of the environmental design program at San Diego State University for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, a multidisciplinary thinker in the tradition of R. Buckminster Fuller, 
hasn't found widespread acceptance for his ideas, yet he remains committed to 
new materials, forms based on nature, a sensitivity to the environment and also 
to his strong belief that each project is a chance to invent something new. 
</P>
<P>
He is a veteran advocate for architecture as art, for buildings that serve a 
higher purpose than solving functional problems. 
</P>
<P>
That explains why the graduate and undergraduate programs in environmental 
design at San Diego State are part of the art department. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt art departments were the more creative places," said Ray, who 
noted with pleasure that Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry turned down a 
position as dean of the architecture school at USC a few years back when 
administrators wouldn't move it to the art department. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of his peers on the cutting edge, Ray has found much of his praise 
abroad, in Japanese design journals such as A+U and Domus, and in exhibitions 
such as the 1985 Paris Biennale. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll find that there is a broader appreciation of design in places like 
Italy, Japan and France," said Ray, a compact, humble man who doesn't get 
overtly emotional about the slights he's felt in his own country. "There isn't 
this hesitancy to try something new simply because it's new." 
</P>
<P>
Ray's large classroom and adjacent office are filled to the rafters with 
drawings, models, books, magazines and other items collected during his career. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the artifacts, you sense a different aesthetic at work. Ray's 
commitment to non-rectilinear forms extends to the way he displays colorful 
architectural drawings and photographs -- on sheets with rounded edges he trims 
with a coffee can. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that curves are more soothing than angles. Cones and spheres make 
the most pleasing environments for humans, he says, partly because they 
minimize the impact of electromagnetic radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Ray's lectures ramble freely over many disciplines, from art to architecture to 
pop culture to the recent Earth Day -- he and his students built a dome from 
recycled carpeting tubes for the on-campus celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in improving realities," he tells a small group of 
environmental design students gathered to hear one of his talks. "Movies show a 
reality above and beyond real life. Our goal is to make real life as exciting 
as movies." 
</P>
<P>
The projects he and his young proteges dream up have assorted domes, 
combinations of spheres and cones, houses with walls made of compacted earth, 
frameworks built from PVC pipe, lightweight environments of thin, taut fabric, 
prototypes for housing using new materials being pioneered by the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Ray's design philosophies are broader-based than most. He was talking about the 
environment and energy conservation before the first Earth Day. He sees a 
personal significance in the fact that the Whole Earth Catalog -- a bible of 
'60s alternative living -- won a Pulitzer Prize in 1969, the year he came to 
San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
His conversations are peppered with terms he has either invented or picked up 
from visionaries such as Fuller: radiant architecture (which takes into account 
light, color and electromagnetic radiation), synergetic environments (which 
combine elements in such a way that the sum is greater than the parts), 
biomorphic (designs based on nature) and biotronics (a happy marriage between 
biomorphic forms and electromagnetic radiation). 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he's been more of an academic than a practicing architect, but 
he has a lengthy resume of building credits dating back to the houses he 
designed in New Orleans -- his hometown -- after he earned a master's in 
architecture from Tulane University. 
</P>
<P>
"Silver Ship" is what he calls his home on Nautilus Street in La Jolla, which 
clings to its steep hillside like a space station, or, as Ray would probably 
prefer it described, a large living organism. Canopies resemble eyelids, curved 
windows on hinges flap up and down like wings. Using economical yet 
eye-catching materials such as corrugated aluminum, Ray built it over several 
years, with the help of students, at a cost of $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
He still finds time for the occasional design job. Students are collaborating 
with him on a master plan and building designs for Madre Grande, an alternative 
community in Dulzura in East County. A Native Indian Cultural Center with a 
tent-like conical form awaits a San Diego site and funding. And Ray's 
lightweight fiberglass covers for an archeological excavation in Presidio Park 
are also waiting for funding. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ray's designs often seem futuristic or even timeless, completely 
outside architecture's mainstream, he is also committed to architectural 
history. He's written letters and reports in favor of saving such local 
landmarks as architect R.M. Schindler's El Pueblo Ribera apartments in La 
Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Ray's students have gone on to productive careers in architecture or 
other design-related fields, even though his lack of emphasis on such practical 
matters as drafting and management can leave them scrambling for supplemental 
education once they graduate. 
</P>
<P>
"His classes were eye-opening," said San Diego architect Kotaro Nakamura, who 
earned a master's degree under Ray and is now a fellow professor at the 
university. "I had strict engineering training in Japan. Eugene opened my 
creative side, and I owe him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
"The program was so loose that it didn't constrict me," said local artist Mario 
Lara, best known for his temporary architectural installations. "I was 
encouraged to go in my own direction, as opposed to other programs, where they 
make you fit a cookie cutter and you get squeezed out the other end." 
</P>
<P>
With energy conservation, low-cost housing, and environmental concerns all 
coming belatedly into the limelight, San Diegans, especially architects, could 
do well to take another look at Ray's ideas. 
</P>
<P>
His buildings are unconventional and not elegant in traditional ways, but his 
concern for humanistic values over materialistic ones seems more timely than 
ever.

ADMINISTRATION: THE LAGUNA ART MUSEUM CREATES AN ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR'S JOB. THE 
DIRECTOR WILL DO MORE CURATING.

<P>
Bonnie Brittain Hall, outgoing development director at South Coast Repertory, 
has been named associate director of administration at the Laguna Art Museum in 
a restructuring that will free museum director Charles Desmarais to assume more 
curatorial responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Desmarais said that Hall, who announced her resignation from SCR last month, 
will assume about a third of his administrative duties when she begins the 
newly created job in Laguna on July 15. Hall and an assistant development 
officer still to be hired will work on fund raising and other short- and 
long-term development activities such as establishing an endowment, Desmarais 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The changes in management structure prompted the museum's current development 
director, Lynn Kirst, to resign, Desmarais added. Kirst was unavailable for 
comment. She has been at the museum about a year, and Desmarais said she will 
leave May 22. Asked whether the museum had been dissatisfied with Kirst, 
Desmarais replied: "I'd say (instead that) there are a lot of (fund-raising) 
opportunities we want to pursue. That's why we're beefing up the development 
side." 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring also springs from the museum's failure to find a chief 
curator to replace Michael McManus, who resigned in March, 1989. Although about 
70 applications were received and several candidates interviewed, none seemed 
just right, Desmarais said. 
</P>
<P>
"So," he continued, "the next approach became: Perhaps the best thing would be 
to beef up the administrative side and work on the curatorial myself." The 
search for a chief curator has been abandoned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Desmarais said the changes will not affect his annual salary of $60,000. 
Neither he nor Hall would disclose her salary. Desmarais said it will be more 
than the $26,000 paid to McManus, and he would not say how much Kirst has been 
making. 
</P>
<P>
Desmarais said the decision to restructure was his and that the response from 
the museum board executive committee has been "extremely enthusiastic. I 
haven't talked to anyone that doesn't think (hiring Hall) is a real coup for 
the museum," he said. Board President Claudette Y. Shaw was unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
During Hall's seven years at SCR, the theater company raised $9 million in 
capital and endowment funds and more than $7 million in operating funds. She 
has not worked in the visual arts before, but she noted that her new 
responsibilities "are primarily administrative." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who had said she was leaving SCR because there was no room for 
advancement there, said Monday that she is undaunted by the Laguna museum's 
deficit of about $72,000. Desmarais said he thinks that the 71-year-old museum, 
which has an annual operating budget of $1.2 million, can end the present 
fiscal year in the black through substantial grants, donations and a "tight 
control" on expenses. Hall, however, said, "I think we can eradicate the 
deficit within a year to 18 months." 
</P>
<P>
Since being named museum director in September, 1988, Desmarais, 41, has helped 
curate and organize exhibitions at the museum's main quarters in Laguna Beach 
(now exhibiting a major career survey of Ilene Segalove that Desmarais curated 
by himself) and at its South Coast Plaza satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Desmarais said Monday that he will continue to curate exhibits at both sites, 
emphasizing art produced since World War II. He stressed that the curatorial 
change won't curtail associate curator Susan M. Anderson's exhibits of 
pre-World War II art or the shows of curator of collections Bolton Colburn from 
the museum's permanent collection of California art. Desmarais has a master's 
degree in fine arts from the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he 
concentrated in museum studies and criticism.

President Bush and leaders of Congress began negotiations today aimed at 
finding a way to break a political deadlock over next year's federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle and top Administration officials were joined by 
congressional leaders of both parties in the White House Cabinet Room. They sat 
at a long table adorned with plates of pastries but answered no questions 
before their talks. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who 
heads Democratic participants in the negotiations, predicted that the talks 
will fail if participants use them to seek political gains. 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody tries to politicize this, nothing will be accomplished," Gephardt

STRIKE PARALYZES NEW CHAMORRO GOVERNMENT

Thousands of striking workers paralyzed the government today, and Vice 
President Virgilio Godoy said the opposition Sandinistas were "trying to 
overthrow President Chamorro." 
</P>
<P>
It was the most serious threat to the 19-day-old government of President 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who defeated the leftist Sandinistas at the polls 
Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Riot police fired tear gas into the Foreign Ministry building to disperse 
workers who occupied the building, but state employees retook the premises 
immediately and pushed out the police. Strikers ignored threats of massive 
firings from the government. 
</P>
<P>
It was just one of several government buildings occupied by strikers. 
Chamorro's whereabouts were not immediately known. At most buildings, police 
merely stood outside. There was no sign of any army presence. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone, telegraph and telex communications went dead, cutting off Nicaragua 
from the rest of the world. Workers threatened to cut off electricity to the 
city in the afternoon, then to shut off the water supply. Both electrical and 
water ministries were occupied by strikers. 
</P>
<P>
An angry mob rushed Foreign Minister Enrique Dreyfus and a group of Nicaraguan 
ambassadors who were standing in the porch of a restaurant across the ministry 
parking lot. Police protected them from the mob. 
</P>
<P>
The strike was for higher pay, but it became increasingly clear that the 
stoppages were a political confrontation between the government and the 
Sandinistas. In addition to their economic demands, the strikers issued a new 
demand that the U.S.-backed Contra rebels immediately demobilize. 
</P>
<P>
Tires were set ablaze in front of about six government buildings, while 
loudspeakers at the gate blared Sandinista revolutionary slogans against 
Chamorro and her government. 
</P>
<P>
"Violeta, start packing your bags!"; "The people own the government, not the 
bourgeois!" and "Not one step back!" were some of the slogans chanted by 
strikers at government buildings.

A federal judge today declared unconstitutional mandatory drug testing for 
attorneys applying for jobs in the Justice Department's antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell came in the case of Carl 
Willner, who filed suit after the Justice Department tentatively accepted him 
for employment and then asked him to submit to a urine test. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell said testing Willner would infringe on the right of any citizen not to 
be searched without a reasonable basis of suspicion. The antitrust division 
requirement "offends the Fourth Amendment," Gesell said. 
</P>
<P>
The case is the first major federal decision on applicant drug testing

Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today that he will apologize for Japan's 
wartime aggression when he meets South Korea's president next week, but the 
government is less willing to have the emperor make a similar statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I should express frank regret about our mistakes in the past and 
apologize for them," Kaifu told Parliament.

He was responding to an opposition question about news reports that South 
Korean President Roh Tae Woo expects an apology from Emperor Akihito during the 
president's three-day trip to Japan, which begins May 24. 
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled Korea as a colony from 1910 to 1945, and Koreans have bitter 
memories of harsh treatment under the Japanese, along with the legacy of their 
country's division since the war's end.

5 ABORTION FOES ARRESTED AT GA. CLINIC; 
</P>
<P>
PROTEST: THE OPERATION RESCUE ACTIVISTS HAD CHAINED THEMSELVES TOGETHER IN THE

Five Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters were arrested today after they 
entered an Atlanta abortion clinic and chained themselves together, defying a 
court order upheld this week by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the Atlanta Surgi-Center and arrested the five after 
cutting their chains. Maj. W. W. Holley said that they would be charged with 
criminal trespass and that information about the violation of the order would 
be turned over to the court. 
</P>
<P>
An Operation Rescue spokeswoman, Jane Shepherd, said the protest was not a 
response to Monday's U.S. Supreme Court decision to uphold the court-ordered 
ban on demonstrations by the group within 50 feet of any Atlanta abortion 
clinic. But she acknowledged that it violated that ban, imposed by a Superior 
Court judge in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"When we do a rescue in the city, it does not matter whether there's an 
injunction or not," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic's director, Beth Petzelt, said the protesters pushed their way into 
the clinic about 8:30 a.m., as patients were being admitted, and scuffled with 
four or five staff members who tried to keep them out. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile today, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., was told that Operation 
Rescue spent more than $50,000 for November demonstrations that kept women out 
of Washington-area clinics in violation of a court order. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Larry Eisenstein, who represents the National Organization for Women 
and Planned Parenthood, said Operation Rescue and its leaders should be found 
in contempt of a Nov. 8 order that prohibited blockades of abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
He asked that they be fined "a large enough figure to deter them from returning 
in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested more than 700 protesters during a Nov. 17 demonstration on 
charges that they violated a new District of Columbia law. 
</P>
<P>
At today's hearing before U.S. District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer, Eisenstein 
showed videotapes of three November demonstrations in an effort to prove that 
Operation Rescue, Project Rescue and their leaders violated Oberdorfer's 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenstein said he would show that Organization Rescue, which says it is in 
debt, spent "well in excess of $50,000 and maybe well more than $100,000" on 
the November operations 
</P>
<P>
He said that 1989 donations to the two organizations exceeded $700,000 and that 
they deposited more than $1.1 million in bank accounts.

near the road to Jerusalem, tried to yank Arabs out of their cars and disrupted 
traffic," a police spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the settlers stoned houses in the Arab villages of Eizariya and 
Isawiya outside East Jerusalem. The army clamped a curfew on Eizariya, a 
frequent ambush spot where a Jewish cabdriver was stoned and injured Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Five employees of the Arabic Al-Fajr newspaper were injured by flying glass 
when 50 settlers yelling "Death to Arabs!" stoned their car, an Arab journalist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, Palestinians staged a general strike in the occupied territories on 
the 42nd anniversary of the establishment of the state of Israel. Two more 
Arabs died from Israeli gunfire in uprising-related incidents. 
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank village of Qalqiliya, 14-year-old Samih abu Sheikh died from 
wounds received when he was shot in the head by an Israeli motorist Sunday, the 
army said. Palestinians said a settler shot him. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, border police shot and killed Khamis abu Khousa, 19, in a 
clash with masked activists in an orchard in the Gaza Strip, military sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the village headman of Balaa in the West Bank was stabbed to 
death by militants who accused him of collaborating with security forces. The 
army said it has found the body of an Arab man and is nvestigating. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip closed their shops, 
halted transport and stayed home to protest the anniversary of Israel's 
establishment. Israelis celebrated the anniversary April 30 according to the 
Hebrew calendar.

Taiwan's foreign exchange market plunged into chaos in the last 10 minutes of 
trading today as the local dollar sharply depreciated in its biggest fall ever, 
dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
They said in the last 10 minutes government banks, which in the past had tried 
to slow the depreciation, changed and started to encourage it. 
</P>
<P>
"The market was in chaos. It was a change of policy," said Tarsicio Tong, chief 
dealer at Banque Nationale de Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The local dollar closed at 27.50 to one U.S. dollar from 26.4351, a 
depreciation of about 4%. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure had built up for too long because of capital outflow," Tong said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two months more than $4 billion has flowed out of the country for 
investment, migration, travel and speculation, bankers said.

INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT PLUNGES .4% IN APRIL; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: AUTOMOBILE PRODUCTION, WHICH WAS OFF 14% FOR THE MONTH, IS BLAMED FOR 
SHARP DECLINE.

<P>
U.S. industrial output plunged 0.4% in April, due primarily to a sharp decline 
in automobile production, after registering a healthy gain in March, the 
Federal Reserve said today. 
</P>
<P>
Private analysts had expected a decline of about 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
"It is consistent with all other economic data that point to weakness," said 
Mickey Levy, chief economist for First Fidelity Bancorp in Philadelphia. 
"Things are very sluggish." 
</P>
<P>
The report also said American industry operated at 83% of capacity last month, 
a decrease of 0.5% from March. 
</P>
<P>
"A sharp drop in the production of motor vehicles and parts, affecting both 
consumer goods and business equipment, accounted for the April decline in 
industrial production," the Federal Reserve said. 
</P>
<P>
In March, industrial production increased by a revised 0.5% and factory 
operating capacity recorded a revised increase of 0.3 percentage point, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicle production was off by 14% for the month. But excluding autos and 
parts, total industrial production remained unchanged in April, the Federal 
Reserve said. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial production report "reflects a great deal of unusual conservatism 
on the part of the auto industry," said economist Cynthia Latta of the private 
consulting firm DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"Their policy in the past has been to produce, produce, produce and then push, 
push, push -- and that hasn't been too good for profits," Latta said. "They 
have bitten the bullet this year." 
</P>
<P>
The 0.4% in output was the first since a January drop of 1% in the wake of 
December's big freeze, which crippled all types of business activity across the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"That decline is consistent with the very weak employment number (for April) 
that included a decline in manufacturing employment and hours worked," Levy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Latta suggested the economy "is a little weak, but not quite as weak as the 
0.4 decline suggests." 
</P>
<P>
By industry, manufacturing production was down 0.6% in April, production of 
durable goods -- items made to last three or more years -- was off 1%, and 
nondurable goods fell 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
"Apart from autos and trucks, production of durable consumer goods declined 
0.7% owing mainly to a drop in output of appliances," the report said. "The 
output of nondurable consumer goods remained sluggish in April."

Chrysler Corp. will begin limited production of a two-seat, high-performance 
Dodge Viper car that reportedly will rival the Chevrolet Corvette, a Chrysler 
source said today. 
</P>
<P>
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an announcement that the 
No. 3 auto maker will begin production of the car in late 1991 will be made 
Friday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Such an announcement seems unusual for a company battling shrinking profits and 
market share, and working to cut $1.5 billion from its standing costs by the 
end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The source declined to say where the car would be built, but said that all 
major components would be made by Chrysler. The price of the car will not be 
announced until just before it becomes available, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The car will be powered by a V-10 engine, according to the source. There have 
been reports that the car may carry a V-8, but the source said a major aim of 
the Viper project was development of the V-10, originally conceived for truck 
use. 
</P>
<P>
According to next Monday's edition of AutoWeek magazine, the V-10 engine is 
capable of reaching 100 m.p.h. from a standing start in less than 10 seconds. A 
Corvette ZR-1 takes about 11.5 seconds, according to a road test in Road &amp; 
Track magazine.

<P>
The author will be a fellow for three years at Berkeley College, one of Yale's 
12 colleges for undergraduates, the university announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He will teach a course on creative writing in the fall and on nonfiction next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian-born author is the first Rosenkranz writer in residence, named for 
the new $1-million endowment created by 1962 Yale graduate Robert Rosenkranz 
and his wife, Margaret. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta, a naturalized American who holds degrees from Harvard and Oxford, has 
written books on history, theology and linguistics. His most recent book, "The 
Stolen Light," published in 1989, is his sixth in an autobiographical series.

More than 160 young girls were treated for hysteria and fainting at a New Kids 
on the Block concert in London Sunday night, which had to be rescheduled from 
Friday because of a power outage. The girls were passing out even before 
members of the Boston-based group came on-stage, but the supervisor of the 
arena said the scene still didn't compare to Beatlemania. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nowhere near it," he said. "If there wasn't any Beatles I should 
imagine this would have been in the history books." . . . The greatest show on 
Earth isn't a rock group. The band Kiss says it will no longer advertise its

and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.

Zsa Zsa Gabor, after being mercilessly teased by Hollywood celebrities Monday 
night at a Friars Club roast in Beverly Hills, lashed out at her legal problems 
and her tormentors in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to her court-ordered community service at a shelter for homeless 
women -- penance for slapping a Beverly Hills traffic cop -- Gabor said, "I 
don't have to clean toilets. 
</P>
<P>
I know seven languages and was raised as a princess. There are other people to 
clean toilets; Judge (Charles) Rubin can clean toilets." 
</P>
<P>
Many in the audience of several hundred at the Beverly Hilton Hotel booed and 
got up to leave when Gabor, the guest of honor, rose to speak. She angrily 
yelled after them, "You don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
There were few printable jokes as a lineup of veteran comedians including Henny 
Youngman, Milton Berle and Pat Buttram, took turns ripping into Gabor. 
</P>
<P>
"She's so old that when she orders a three-minute egg, they make her pay up 
front," Youngman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a black, puff-sleeved taffeta gown, Gabor sat blushing, flailing her 
hands and arguing with the other celebrities as the biting, often sexual, 
ripostes rolled on. 
</P>
<P>
In reference to Gabor's sentence, Berle said, "Zsa Zsa, you got community 
service. You'd really do the community a great service if you'd get the . . . 
out of town." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor became only the second woman to be roasted by the Friars. Phyllis Diller, 
in 1987, was the first.

Jane Pauley will take a shot at the newsmagazine format this summer, but she 
said she'll have lots of help. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be 'The Jane Pauley Show,' " the former "Today Show" host 
said in the May 19 issue of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to take advantage of NBC correspondents. I'm not going to be the 
sole talent." 
</P>
<P>
The unnamed show will premiere on NBC on June 27, with a summer run of five 
shows. If it becomes a regular series, January, 1991, would be the earliest for 
a regular time slot, she said. 
</P>
<P>
NBC anchor Tom Brokaw won't be one of those on the show, Pauley said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom pointed out that his plate was pretty full," she said. "So he couldn't 
make an additional commitment to our show." 
</P>
<P>
She laughed off rumors that she would join Brokaw on "The NBC Nightly News" as 
co-anchor. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look to me like 'Nightly' needs any help," she said. "As far as I'm 
concerned it's moot -- as delicious as that prospect might sound."

The world rights to Nelson R. Mandela's memoirs have been acquired by Little, 
Brown and Co., the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, was released from a 
South African prison three months ago after nearly 28 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
A week and a half after his release, he met at his home in Soweto with William 
D. Phillips, vice president and editor in chief of Little, Brown, the company 
said. Mandela's lawyers, the London firm of Meer, Care and Desai, then 
negotiated on Mandela's behalf to conclude the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said in a statement that the book, not yet titled, will be a political 
memoir about his fight against apartheid and a personal story. It is planned 
for publication in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how or where this book will end," Phillips said. "This is not a 
man in retirement." 
</P>
<P>
The statement did not say how much Mandela would receive for the memoirs.

CAN WE write an entire column about the good guys? Let's see. 
</P>
<P>
It was very fine news to hear that Playboy is making that super-civilized 
talker -- Larry King of USA Today, Mutual radio and CNN -- its interview for 
August. Excerpts from the talk show King's fourth book, "Larry King: Tell Me 
More," will be seen in the September issue of Penthouse, and the tome has been 
accepted as an alternate for the Book of the Month. 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked me this very week -- Why is Larry King so popular? Here are a few 
reasons -- he is a truly nice human being, he listens, he is intelligent, he 
has a brilliant sense of humor. He is kind, he is fair-minded, he is on top of 
his life and gives us confidence that we might be that way as well. 
</P>
<P>
SELDOM HAS my faith in a public person been so well placed as in Connie Chung. 
It was great hearing of her recent Nielsen success when CBS moved her "Saturday 
Night" show into the Monday spot for a special. Connie has one of the highest Q 
ratings for popularity in all of TV. 
</P>
<P>
In private life, she is funny, warm, amiable, offbeat, even zany. It is fun to 
see this beautiful woman turn up at stuffy parties and spend most of the 
evening holding hands with her husband, "A Current Affair's" Maury Povich. I 
knew Connie's show was a winner the minute her producers dropped the 
"re-creations" of news and decided to just let Connie be Connie. Her close-up, 
intimate and simple approach is unbeatable. (Who could ever forget her 
bombastic interview with Donald Trump, wherein she trounced him good naturedly 
with remarks like, "Are you kidding?") 
</P>
<P>
Later, I understand Trump said the reason Connie didn't "like" him was because 
she was taking revenge on him for the failure of an early interview with Marlon 
Brando. How's that again? 
</P>
<P>
NORMAN LEAR is the genius who changed the face of television. ("All In the 
Family" and its spinoffs, for example -- in these troubled times, a show so 
frank, funny and daring might not even be able to get on the air.) Anyway, it 
is fitting that Norman also founded People for the American Way. And now Norman 
himself will be honored with that same group's First Amendment Award. 
</P>
<P>
This column has often covered the PFAW benefits, at which such worthies as Bill 
Moyers, Walter Cronkite, Barbara Jordan and Robert L. Bernstein have been 
honored. These nights often make news; last year Cronkite surprised us with his 
paean to liberalism. On Nov. 18, it will be Norman Lear's turn to accept rather 
than present. And they're moving to New York's Waldorf for comfort and class.

More than 20 years after Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his last sermon at 
Ebenezer Baptist Church, one of his daughters stepped up to the same pulpit to 
deliver her first as a minister. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional service Monday that drew more than 300 people, Bernice 
Albertine King, 27, became the second woman ordained at the historic church. 
</P>
<P>
Bernice King, the youngest of King's four children and the only one to go into 
the ministry, also graduated Monday from Emory University with doctoral degrees 
in law and divinity. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most humbling moment for me in my life," King said. "I am not 
worthy of this high calling. No blood, no sweat, no tears could earn me this 
high calling."

<P>
Marco Giovannetti of Italy beat the odds and a field of top international 
cyclists to win the Tour of Spain today after 22 grueling days of racing. 
</P>
<P>
Giovannetti, 28, who has been racing professionally for six years, became the 
fourth Italian to win the 2,292-mile event. 
</P>
<P>
Regarded as a long shot in a field that included such outstanding cyclists as 
Pedro Delgado and Miguel Idurain of Spain, Giovannetti led for 11 legs. 
</P>
<P>
He clinched the victory Monday in the next-to-last leg by repelling repeated 
attacks by Delgado, a two-time winner and Tour of France champion. 
</P>
<P>
"He made me suffer a lot," Giovannetti said. "That was one of the worst 
moments." 
</P>
<P>
The top positions remained the same after the last stage today, a 110-mile 
route that ended along the crowd-lined streets of downtown Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
Giovannetti's total time of 94 hours, 36:40 minutes was 1:28 better than 
Delgado and 1:48 faster than Anselmo Fuerte of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Uwe Rabb of East Germany won the last leg in an unofficial time of 4 hours, 44 
minutes and 24 seconds.

UNBRIDLED MAY LACK VERSATILITY NEEDED TO SUCCEED AT PREAKNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL MORAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The character of the Kentucky Derby winner usually dictates the flavor of the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
There is the charismatic Derby winner. Secretariat, Seattle Slew and 
Spectacular Bid were of this type. They brought to Pimlico the shared 
anticipation of singular accomplishment. A truly special horse can carry 
Preakness week by himself. 
</P>
<P>
On the opposite side of charisma's coin is the type that comes to Maryland 
having to duplicate the success of Kentucky to establish themselves. Winning 
Colors, Alysheba, Ferdinand, Swale, Sunny's Halo, Pleasant Colony and Genuine 
Risk fit beneath this umbrella. Some succeed; most fail. The Derby and 
Preakness may be racing's second-toughest winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
The exceptions are the horses accompanied to Baltimore by the anticipation of a 
rematch. Affirmed was dogged by Alydar, Sunday Silence by Easy Goer. These are 
the most compelling Preaknesses and the most rare. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled fits neatly into the second category. He is a one-paced stayer, 
probably at his best at about 1 1/4 miles, always at the mercy of pace and 
forever dependent upon the ability of his rider to avoid trouble. He was 
clearly the best horse May 5 at Churchill Downs, and he won the Derby 
impressively for 92-year-old owner Frances Genter. But he will not be an 
overwhelming Preakness favorite Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Nafzger was confident throughout Derby week that Unbridled would run his 
race. He was correct. In fact, every horse in the Derby except Summer Squall 
ran Unbridled's race. 
</P>
<P>
Now for the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
This is a different game, and Unbridled must display versatility he may not 
have. Pleasant Colony, Alysheba and Sunday Silence passed this test. Genuine 
Risk, Sunny's Halo, Swale, Ferdinand and Winning Colors failed. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky will be a factor in Baltimore. If he can control the track in a 
field with a good deal less speed than the Derby, where five horses were sent 
after the lead in a suicidal early pace, he threatens to be the Snow Chief of 
1990: incinerated in Louisville, exonerated in Baltimore. He worked five 
furlongs in 59 2/5 seconds Sunday at Pimlico, significantly faster than he 
worked at Churchill a week before the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
But will Mister Frisky control the pace? Kentucky Jazz is the cheap-speed 
portion of Wayne Lukas' entry with Land Rush and has the potential to dictate 
the race's development. Champagneforashley is another ingredient. He has the 
necessary tactical speed. He is fresh and a month off the Wood Memorial. He 
should be suited to the distance and will not lose touch with the pace. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is Summer Squall. Is this where he falls off the table? His 
performance and his appearance were incongruous in Kentucky. He walked sorely 
to be saddled, appearing to favor his left foreleg, was hollow beneath the hip 
bones and with ribs protruding. His connections say there is nothing that can 
be done for his unsightly appearance, but Summer Squall is fine. And he ran his 
heart out as far as he held up in Kentucky, gaining the lead from a tired 
Mister Frisky near the mile mark and holding everyone safe except Unbridled.

WHEN THE GAME IS FINESSE VS. FORCE, THE RULES MUST CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE LITTWIN, THE BALTIMORE SUN

<TEXT>
<P>
Let's try to reduce the discussion to its simplest terms: The incorrect way to 
treat the Mona Lisa is to try to rip the smile off her face. It seems to me the 
same logic should apply to Michael Jordan, another work of art. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia 76ers disagree. These are the guys who never saw a painting 
they did not think could be improved with a spray can. They are not after art. 
They are after putting their own signature on it, and that signature is often 
the bottom of a sneaker on somebody's neck. 
</P>
<P>
Pro basketball is not pro wrestling. It is not indoor lacrosse. It is not a 
tractor pull. It is not even a presidential campaign. It is fan-tastic, though, 
and, in its best form, it is something like another well-known contact sport, 
ballet. I know that because I saw it on one of those fan-tastic commercials, 
although I bet you the only thing Baryshnikov ever dunked was a doughnut in his 
coffee. On the other hand, you know Jordan could tour en l'air all night long. 
</P>
<P>
I love to watch tour en l'air Jordan, and who wouldn't? Well, the 76ers, I 
guess, or any other team forced to play against him. In their series against 
Jordan's Chicago Bulls, the 76ers have declared a no-layup rule, meaning that 
if you come to the basket, you have a better shot of getting laid out than of a 
layup. The idea is to scare Jordan and the Bulls, a finesse team, out of their 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Thorn, director of operations for the National Basketball Assn., has warned 
the 76ers against hard fouls. Charles Barkley, a hard foul waiting to happen, 
put his spin on the directive. 
</P>
<P>
"Rod Thorn said he didn't want us to hurt anybody," Barkley said. "He said he 
didn't want us to maim anybody. But he didn't say he didn't want us to hit 
anybody. You can hit someone without hurting him." 
</P>
<P>
You can. I could hit Barkley all day, and he would never notice unless I picked 
up a hammer. But when Barkley, or his slam-dance partner, Rick Mahorn, hits 
someone, the person tends to remember. 
</P>
<P>
You have to love Barkley. He is a great player and a funny guy. You can like 
Mahorn, too, even if he plays like a thug. He is a bright guy with a great 
sense of humor who has made himself a career out of winning by intimidation. 
They both play by the rules; it is the rules that need changing. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the game special is the play in the lane, the dunk that turns your 
head, the spinning drive to the basket that makes you shake your head. One was 
handed down from Dr. J. to Air Jordan, the other from Earl Monroe to Kevin 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever rule changes the NBA enacts are generally to enable players to get to 
the lane. That is why the zone defense was outlawed. The purpose of the 
three-point shot is to spread the defense, giving players more room to operate. 
Clobbering a guy on the drive, conversely, is designed to shut down the lane. 
It is the same principle as placing land mines -- to discourage movement in a 
certain area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clean basketball," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that this form of defense was the latest in high technology 
and he would adjust. Actually, it's the lowest technology, which is just plain 
old brute force. Why not suit up Lyle Alzado? 
</P>
<P>
So, what do you think happened Sunday? The 76ers did all the talking, and the 
Bulls, not to be intimidated, provided all the muscling. In the fourth quarter, 
Barkley went down hard twice, looking like a bull on the wrong end of a rope. 
He took a swat in the face from Ed Nealy and frowned real hard. Earlier, Bill 
Cartwright had tackled Hersey Hawkins. Mahorn tried to hold up his end, but it 
was too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
But now you have to worry as Game 5 looms Wednesday that the 76ers, after 
watching their star get mugged, will go after Jordan in earnest. Maybe, if they 
do, you will see a rule change. 
</P>
<P>
Once, the Lakers were solely a finesse team. That was until the Boston Celtics 
beat them up in an NBA final, with Kevin McHale's clothesline foul on Kurt 
Rambis the clincher. The Lakers knew they had to get tougher, and no one is 
saying pro basketball should not be a physical game. But now the Lakers, who 
have not been able to control Kevin Johnson, are trying to keep him out of the 
lane by making him pay a toll for entering. That is not the way the game should 
be played. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA has virtually eliminated the dangerous foul on a breakaway by 
legislating against it. If you foul a player on a breakaway, the player gets 
two free throws and his team keeps the ball. That was enough. Unnecessarily 
hard fouls can be treated the same way -- two free throws and possession. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say a player cannot try to block a shot and, in the process, 
knock somebody down, or even out. But you know, I know and the officials know 
when a player simply knocks someone down for effect or hits someone 
gratuitously. Just because a player is attempting to shoot a ball should not, 
at the same time, make him a free target. Let's have a price to be paid in both 
directions. Or do you really want to see someone someday shoot a high-flying 
Jordan right out of the sky?

Fappaburst, a 3-year-old unbeaten in four starts but taking on older fillies

Fantastic Find poised just behind. Fantastic Find first put away Divine Answer, 
then drew even with Fappaburst passing the eighth pole and won going away.

SHEM BITTERMAN SLOWS HIS PACE -- WELL, A LITTLE

<P>
Shem Bitterman claims to be slowing down. There was a time, he says, when it 
took him no more than a day to write a play. Now it takes weeks, sometimes even 
months, to finish a first draft. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the 29-year-old playwright is complaining. By anyone's standard, 
including his own, his recent pace has been torrid. "Three plays opening at the 
same time doesn't usually happen," he acknowledged the other day over a lunch 
of hamburger and ginger ale. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ramp," Bitterman's obliquely drawn Holocaust drama about a romance between 
a Nazi concentration-camp doctor and a young Polish woman, begins previews 
tonight on the South Coast Repertory Second Stage. It premieres Saturday as 
part of SCR's California Play Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, "Self Storage," a Hollywood satire co-written with Tony Spiridakis, 
opened at the Odyssey Theatre in Los Angeles (to a negative review in The 
Times). Next week "Beijing Legends," his epic-size drama about the Chinese 
Cultural Revolution, is to open at the Pacific Jewish Theatre in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Speed aside, can a playwright address so many different subjects and say 
something meaningful about each of them? Apparently a lot of theater experts 
think so. This year alone, three of his plays won major awards. 
</P>
<P>
"Beijing Legends" received a $17,000 grant from the Kennedy Center's Fund for 
New American Plays. "The Ramp" earned second place and $2,500 in SCR's 1990 
California Play Contest. And "Ten Below," a drama about homelessness, took top 
honors in the National Playwrights Competition of the Unicorn Theatre in Kansas 
City, Kan., where a production was mounted in January. 
</P>
<P>
If Bitterman has any doubt about the seriousness or the sincerity of his art, 
he doesn't show it. Pale, thin and blue-eyed, he looks like an intense 
intellectual in his small round tortoise-shell glasses. And he sounds even more 
so as he explains that it was a book -- Robert Jay Lifton's "The Nazi Doctors," 
which documented the participation of the German medical profession in Hitler's 
plan to exterminate the Jews -- that initially compelled him to write "The 
Ramp." 
</P>
<P>
"As a Jew and as a writer, I had to examine how such a thing could happen," 
Bitterman said of the Holocaust. "It's a very tough, personal play. Ostensibly, 
it's about a doctor who selects people to live or die on the ramp at Auschwitz, 
but it's really about waking up to the evil in one's life. What the play tries 
to capture, more than anything else, is the schizophrenia of denial." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its subject, Bitterman notes, "The Ramp" makes no references to 
crematories, ovens, gassings or other evils associated with Auschwitz. The word 
Jewish is mentioned only twice and the camp itself only once in a line taken 
from an actual letter written by a real Nazi doctor: "Auschwitz is a lovely 
place to summer, but in the winter one should really stay at home." 
</P>
<P>
The man and the woman in "The Ramp" suppress so much about themselves, 
Bitterman asserts, that unless playgoers were to read the program (or articles 
such as this one), they might not know until late in the play precisely what 
the protagonist does in his work. "If you know, there's a terrific irony at 
play," Bitterman said. "And if you don't, the whole thing plays out as a love 
story and a mystery." 
</P>
<P>
The oblique abstraction of "The Ramp" is intended not as an evasion of a 
historic reality, he adds, but rather as its psychological reflection. The 
Nazis, after all, preferred euphemisms and the nullifying language of 
bureaucracy for their extermination program. People chosen for the gas chambers 
were being given "special treatment." Those who did the choosing were 
"processing pieces." 
</P>
<P>
"Prisoners at Auschwitz, for example, were not allowed to say what happened 
there," Bitterman explained. "To speak of it was punishable by death. Nobody 
ever said, 'We are gassing people.' We know now that as the trains pulled up to 
the camp, incoming German Jews would see Jewish women with long hair and 
polka-dotted dresses sitting on green lawns, singing and telling jokes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all an instrument of denial and, for the Nazis, schizophrenic denial. 
If you were a political prisoner, you wouldn't be selected for the gas chamber 
even if you were Jewish because you were supposed to be serving a specific 
term. If you contracted typhus in a camp, you wouldn't get 'special treatment' 
until you were cured." 
</P>
<P>
Bitterman contends, moreover, that the veil of hypocrisy enveloping the central 
couple of "The Ramp" is not unlike the sort of contemporary moral blindness 
that enables us to ignore the homeless or to live with environmental pollution. 
"The truth makes us uneasy," he said. "Much better to exist in a dream of 
denial." 
</P>
<P>
Lacking any personal experience of the Holocaust, Bitterman visited Poland and 
the Auschwitz camp, which has been preserved as a memorial to its victims and 
as a warning to the world. Both the camp and the country imparted an 
unutterable "sadness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like "The Ramp," many of Bitterman's plays -- some 30 over the last 10 years by 
his count -- have evoked what he calls "the drama of place." And they 
frequently grow out of his travels. 
</P>
<P>
Two trips to China -- in 1980 and 1985 -- led to "Beijing Legends." His years 
in the graduate playwrighting program at the University of Iowa spurred him to 
write "Iowa Boys," which was developed as part of the Mark Taper Forum New 
Theater for Now program in 1986 and has become his most widely produced play. 
</P>
<P>
Bitterman, who was born in New York, was brought to Los Angeles by the Taper 
that year and recalls being "totally blown away" by the city. "It was my first 
trip out here," he said, "and I thought it was one of the weirdest places 
anywhere." Not surprisingly perhaps, he eventually wrote an evening of three 
short plays about Los Angeles entitled "Tulsa," "Death in Venice, Ca." and 
"Exile in Century City." 
</P>
<P>
But if anything besides a sense of place unifies his work, it would seem to be 
a certain grimness of material. In "Iowa Boys," a man beats his fiancee to 
death and wakes up in the morning with no recollection of having done it. In 
"Self Storage," a psychotic serial killer sells his life story to the movies. 
In "Exile in Century City," the protagonist is strangled by a transsexual. 
</P>
<P>
Bitterman also has written the screenplays for the mainstream gore flicks 
"Halloween IV" (uncredited) and "Halloween V" (credited but rewritten by 
someone else). 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real job," said Bitterman, who moved to Los Angeles in 1988 and now 
lives in the Los Feliz area. "I knocked off the first one in a week. They 
called me the next year and asked me to write 'Halloween V.' I did that one in 
three days. It was like writing a comic book. But it paid the bills." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, his most recent screen-writing effort -- an adaptation of 
another of his plays, "One Plus One Equals Three" -- has persuaded him that if 
he wants to work in movies he will have to become a director. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only way to protect your material," he said. Bitterman said he tried 
unsuccessfully to withdraw the rights to his screenplay after he and the 
producer disagreed over revisions. "I rescinded. He sued. It would have cost me 
a fortune to fight the suit. So I settled out of court." 
</P>
<P>
That movie, entitled "Out of the Rain," has already been filmed with Michael 
O'Keefe and Bridget Fonda in the starring roles but has not been released. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ramp" previews on the South Coast Repertory Second Stage today at 8:30 
p.m., Thursday at 8:30 p.m. and Saturday at 3 p.m. The regular run opens 
Saturday at 8:30 p.m. SCR is at 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $20

</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: AHMAD N. BAYAA WOULD NOT COMMENT ON THE SEC SUIT FILED AGAINST HIM. 
ALTHOUGH HIS COMPANY IS IN TROUBLE, BAYAA IS CONSIDERED A SHREWD BUSINESSMAN.

<TEXT>
<P>
In August, 1988, Ahmad N. Bayaa was relishing the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
In a high-profile ceremony at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point, the 
then-35-year-old Palestinian businessman was wed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson to a 
Jewish woman from Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Before 400 guests, Jackson praised the couple for transcending ethnic 
prejudice, saying, "This marriage is America at its best" because it 
"represents joy in Laguna, hope in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, a $50,000 affair that Bayaa said was something special he wanted 
to do for his fiancee, was a living tribute to the Rainbow Coalition theme of 
Jackson's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Bayaa, a Long Beach resident and the president of Southland Communications Inc. 
in Santa Ana, is in the media spotlight again. But this time, the ceremony of 
the day isn't drawing any praises. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuit against 
Bayaa and securities broker Shaw Tehrani of Atlanta. The suit accuses the men 
of conspiring, along with several of Bayaa's friends, to manipulate the stock 
price of Southland Communications, also known as National Paging. 
</P>
<P>
Through his attorney, Bayaa declined to comment on the action. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit comes a little more than a month after the SEC stopped trading of 
the firm's stock. That action came after the company's stock doubled in price 
within a short period -- March 13 to April 3 -- despite the company's warning 
in its first-quarter report that it might not be able continue much longer as a 
going concern. 
</P>
<P>
Bayaa, whose broad smile and thin mustache make him resemble the rock-star 
Prince, is described by associates as a shrewd businessman. Despite a modest 
$40,000 salary, he had expensive habits: he wore flashy $2,000 suits and drove 
a Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
When co-workers asked about the suits and fancy car, Bayaa would respond that 
they were part of the trappings necessary to making sales to big companies and 
courting rich Middle Eastern investors. 
</P>
<P>
By Bayaa's account, he came to the United States penniless. His family was 
originally from the city of Acre, near Haifa in Israel, but its members fled to 
Jordan in 1948 after Israel became independent. The family later moved to Syria 
and then to a refugee camp near Tripoli, Lebanon, before immigrating to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bayaa says he was graduated from Cal State Long Beach with a major in business 
in 1975 and that in 1981 he launched Southland Communications, a family-run 
company that employed two other brothers. The firm was taken public in 1987 by 
K.A. Knapp &amp; Co., a firm later shut down for securities fraud and then 
purchased in bankruptcy court by John Pehrson. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-March, Bayaa said, he was seeking capital for his struggling paging firm 
through a $5-million private placement of Southland stock with unnamed 
investors. James J. Carroll III, Bayaa's attorney, said the discussions are 
still continuing. 
</P>
<P>
"He boasted a lot about contacts with oil money, but it was all show," said one 
source, who asked not to be identified. "He was courteous and diplomatic, 
though his English was a little broken. He drives a Bentley even though he 
can't afford to be in a Volkswagen." 
</P>
<P>
As a top executive, Bayaa has been described as the quintessential salesman, a 
hard worker who frequently traveled abroad on business. 
</P>
<P>
In a company newsletter in April, Bayaa wrote, perhaps prophetically: "Positive 
motivation results in positive actions, and to me, that is the difference 
between looking at something as a challenge instead of a problem. Problems 
breed anxiety and fear becomes the motivator, inviting us to be more creative, 
assertive and self-assured." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the troubled status of Southland, Bayaa appeared comfortable with 
keeping the company publicly held under family management. 
</P>
<P>
Bayaa acknowledged in a recent interview that he and his older brother, Ziad 
Bayaa, chief financial officer, sold more than $700,00 worth of stock before 
February for personal reasons, but he said they have retained the bulk of their 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in this company for the long term," Ahmad Bayaa said. 
</P>
<P>
In early April, after the SEC suspended trading of Southland's stock and 
launched an investigation, Bayaa said he hoped the investigation would be quick 
so he would be able to speak more freely about the performance of his 
financially troubled company. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he knew of any attempt to manipulate Southland's stock, Bayaa 
grimaced and shook his head. Then, flashing a bright smile and recovering his 
polite demeanor, he said: "Traders make markets. I sell pagers. I don't know 
anything more than what I read in the newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
Bayaa added that he was not aware of any company development that could have 
prompted the trading frenzy in March and April that led to the trading 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
He said that as far as he could tell, most of the trading apparently was 
prompted by a short sale recommendation issued on March 2, but he said he did 
not know who had written the report. Traders say the report was issued by 
Pehrson. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC charges in its suit that Bayaa, Tehrani and other friends of Bayaa 
bought up large amounts of the thinly traded stock to thwart "short sellers" 
who were attempting to profit from an expected drop in its price and that they 
hoped to keep the stock price up long enough so that a private placement of 
additional stock and an acquisition of another paging company could be 
completed.

PRO BASKETBALL: THE BEST PLAY THEIR BEST IN THE POSTSEASON, AND THE SPURS' 
DAVID ROBINSON IS DOING JUST THAT.

<P>
Scenes from a playoff: 
</P>
<P>
 "Timber!" 
</P>
<P>
 Portland's 6-foot-6 Clyde Drexler switches defensive assignments in the lane 
and jumps out to guard 7-1 David Robinson. Drexler takes two steps and runs 
straight into Robinson's side. 
</P>
<P>
Instantly, Drexler's body assumes Nerf ball quality and drops limply to the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Monster Mash 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs are loose in the open court and point guard Rod Strickland sees 
Robinson coming up fast from behind. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland flips the ball to Robinson, who is airborne and nearly horizontal as 
he slams a mighty jam. One rowdy Baseline Bum nearly waves the Lone Star plumb 
off the Texas flag he holds in his shaky hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting Star 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson has the ball near the right baseline with his back to the basket. He 
looks left, then turns right to face the hoop and fires a soft left-hander that 
settles into the net as he drifts ever-so-gently out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
To be continued. The Academy (the motion picture kind) may rest assured that 
further sequences will be available soon, produced by David Robinson, starring 
David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Said Larry Brown, Robinson's acting coach with the Spurs' troupe: "I think the 
guy has been and will be phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
But how phenomenal? Is he the NBA's most valuable player? Robinson is surely a 
candidate, but he isn't sure his time for the league's most prestigious 
individual honor has come. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to commend yourself because you see yourself with your own eyes, and 
you feel like you have so much more to show," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic Johnson, he runs that team. How can I say I'm better than him? Michael 
Jordan. Who can do what he can do? 
</P>
<P>
"But I feel good about what I do for this team. I don't know, maybe in three or 
four years down the road I think maybe I'll be at my peak, coming out and 
playing great night after night. I am feeling good about what I've done so far, 
but this is one year." 
</P>
<P>
The former star of the Academy (the naval kind) has absolutely dominated the 
Portland Trail Blazers in this Western Conference semifinal series, which 
stands at two games each. 
</P>
<P>
Although this is not truly shocking stuff, that the Spurs are back even with 
Game 5 tonight in Portland seems at least sort of remarkable. That's because 
they played so poorly in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
How poorly? Well, Robinson shot an air ball on a free throw. 
</P>
<P>
He had nine points in Game 1, only the second time all season he didn't score 
in double figures. Robinson came back with 31 points in Game 2, but got 20 of 
them after the Spurs trailed by 24. And one last insult: Wayne Cooper blocked 
Robinson's dunk attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, there was fallout. The last time the Spurs were in Portland, down 
0-2 and fading, Brown did the only thing he could. He left his team and flew 
home on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was roasted in the local newspapers after his solo flight, but criticism 
abounded on a lot of levels. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Cummings had scored 33 points in Game 2 only to hear that Brown ripped 
his defensive play. Owner Red McCombs looked more rumpled than usual, probably 
because his team was losing to another team he had already dismissed to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Even backup center Caldwell Jones, at 39 the oldest player in the league, was 
privately mumbling about his lack of playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Against such a backdrop strode David Robinson. There is probably no one else 
whose talents are being revealed in the playoffs more than Robinson's. 
</P>
<P>
Magic, we know how good he is, and the same for Jordan, Isiah Thomas, Charles 
Barkley, Kevin Johnson, Patrick Ewing, Drexler. Even Dennis Rodman and Joe 
Dumars have had a forum for their greatness. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson is new to the scene and so, in that respect, this year's playoffs 
are sort of his showcase. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs, who swept Denver in the first round, have gotten 24.4 points, 10.1 
rebounds and 4.1 blocks from Robinson in seven playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Robinson says he has learned one fact of NBA life: superstars play 
better in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, I know now that the playoffs are not an extension of the season 
anymore," Robinson said. "This is a new level, a whole new level and it's 
something else, I'll tell you." 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers know all they want to about Robinson. In the playoffs against 
them, he is averaging 24.6 points, 10.9 rebounds, 4.1 blocks and about the same 
amount of respect after every game. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing he does, he's so quick, you look and he's gone," said Portland 
forward Jerome Kersey. "You just don't see that in a big man. Nobody runs the 
floor like him except for maybe Akeem." 
</P>
<P>
Said Drexler: "If he already isn't, he is becoming the premier center in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Robinson is a rookie. Without him a year ago, San Antonio was 21-61. 
This year, the Spurs finished 56-26, the biggest one-year turnaround in NBA 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson played in all 82 games, apparently answering the one nagging rap about 
his endurance. He averaged 24.3 points and 12 rebounds and was the only player 
in the league to rank among the leaders in five categories. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, he's the center of the '90s," Laker General Manager Jerry West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In less than one season, Robinson has become the Spurs' most decorated player. 
He was an all-star as well as rookie of the year. He won the Schick Pivotal 
Player award, was named player of the week three times, is a candidate for MVP 
and is a member of the all-rookie team. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers hoped to use their own centers to stop Robinson, but that 
hasn't been easy. If backup center Wayne Cooper cannot play again because of 
back spasms, Coach Rick Adelman must use forwards Cliff Robinson and Mark 
Bryant against David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't regarded as much of an option, though. The Trail Blazers' chances 
rest on the fact that two of the last three games will be played on their home 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's best chance is that his rookie center dominates the game. He is the 
only player on the court who can. 
</P>
<P>
"I told David, there are special players in the league like Magic and Barkley 
and Michael Jordan, and that they play at an unbelievable level," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that if he wanted to be in that level, he needed to take his game 
to another level. Now that's a hell of a burden to put on someone." 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson has pulled through. Maybe it was Robinson's naval training. 
</P>
<P>
From ensign to lieutenant (j.g.), to admiral, to which the Spurs' fans have 
promoted him, Robinson has moved up in rank. Rest assured he is on maneuvers at 
this moment, moving up in rank among his peers.

JUDGE BAIRD NAMED BY BUSH TO FILL U.S. ATTORNEY POST; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRAT WAS RECOMMENDED FOR POSITION BY GUBERNATORIAL 
CANDIDATE PETE WILSON. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lourdes G. Baird, a conservative 
Democrat, was nominated by President Bush on Monday for the coveted position of 
U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, Baird would head one of the 
highest-profile prosecutorial offices in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Central District is the nation's largest federal district, spanning seven 
counties from San Luis Obispo to Riverside and encompassing 14 million people. 
It has experienced massive amounts of drug trafficking, as well as an abundance 
of defense industry fraud and savings and loans scams -- three of the 
highest-priority targets of federal prosecutors in this era. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted," Baird, 55, said in a telephone interview. "I know there are 
incredible challenges out there." 
</P>
<P>
She had been waiting for the announcement for some time. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen Pete Wilson recommended Baird to the Bush Administration late last 
November. Political observers said then that it was a savvy move by 
gubernatorial candidate Wilson that could win him points with women, Democrats 
and Latinos. Baird would be the first U.S. attorney in this district in some 
years who was not a member of the party of the President. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Ecuador, Baird is fluent in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Since November, Baird has gone through a formal background check by the FBI and 
other Justice Department officials. Although no problems arose, it took Bush 
almost six months to nominate Baird, creating what for some prosecutors was a 
frustratingly long transition period. 
</P>
<P>
The position became vacant last June when then-U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner 
became a federal judge. Since then, there have been two interim U.S. attorneys 
-- Gary Feess, and Robert L. Brosio, who is the senior member of the U.S. 
attorney's office in Los Angeles. Bonner was nominated by Bush last week to 
head the Drug Enforcement Adminstration. 
</P>
<P>
Baird said she was told by a Justice Department official Monday that her Senate 
confirmation process is likely to take about a month. 
</P>
<P>
If the one-month timetable holds up and Baird is confirmed, she will be sworn 
in just weeks after standing for reelection on June 5. She is expected to win 
another term on the Superior Court, to which Gov. George Deukmejian appointed 
her in September, 1988. He elevated her from a Municipal Court judgeship to 
which he had appointed her in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Baird raised a family before starting law school in 1973. After graduating from 
UCLA Law School in 1976, she served as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1976 to 
1983 and then spent three years in private practice before becoming a judge. 
</P>
<P>
She was widely praised Monday by judges and lawyers who have worked with her. 
</P>
<P>
"The qualities that she has displayed in abundance on the Superior Court . . . 
will serve her well and ensure her success in her new position," said Paul 
Boland, presiding judge of the dependency court, where Baird has handled 
custody and child abuse cases for the past 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she'll be a great leader," said Assistant U.S. Atty. William F. Fahey, 
who heads the office's government fraud unit and worked with Baird in the 
office in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Brosio said he thought Baird would do an excellent job and expressed the hope 
that the Senate would move quickly on her nomination. He said the job of U.S. 
attorney has changed dramatically as the office has expanded and confronted 
increasingly complex cases, particularly drugs and money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
When Brosio joined the U.S. attorney's office in 1963, there were about 20 
prosecutors, he said. There are now 138 lawyers in the office, and he said he 
expects another 30 or so to be hired within the next year, many of whom will be 
assigned to work on drug and savings and loan cases. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first major investigations Baird will have to review is the ongoing 
federal probe of Mayor Tom Bradley. The mayor has been the subject of a federal 
grand jury investigation since last year, apparently focused on his dealings 
with private banks and stock brokers.
