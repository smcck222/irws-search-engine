A new study found that exercise hastens the clearance of a common form of fat 
called triglycerides from the bloodstream, apparently explaining how workouts 
reduce the risk of heart attack. The study is the first to separate the effects 
of exercise from changes in the diet and weight loss, said Dr. Jan Breslow, who 
helped conduct the Rockefeller University in New York City study published in 
the American Heart Assn.'s journal Circulation.

NEWSMAKERS: THEY'RE ALL BIG MEN ON CAMPUS

The first men to break the gender barrier at Wheaton College -- that's 82 men 
on a campus of 1,150 students -- say it has been a turbulent year, but they 
will be back. "It was awkward at first, walking into a class of, say, 40 women. 
You feel like a minority, but by the end of the semester everyone was talking 
openly," said Jonathan Hart, a Greenwich, Conn., first-year student at the 
Norton, Mass., college. Hart is a member of a male rock group named, 
appropriately enough, the Outnumbered. Another new male rock band dubbed itself 
the Gentlemen Callers. The decision in January, 1987, to break a 154-year-old 
tradition and admit men outraged some alumnae and seniors who felt the school 
was abandoning its commitment to women's education. In a settlement, Wheaton 
returned $127,000 to 56 donors who wanted their money back. Still, said Sue 
Alexander, dean of students, the overall response was encouraging. While 
enrollment at other women's colleges is slipping, applications to Wheaton are 
up 54% and annual donations have risen 18%. About 400 men have applied to enter 
next year's freshman class. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While the men at Wheaton College are beginning a tradition, Robert Hohman 
was following a longstanding family custom when he received his bachelor's 
degree from Creighton University in Omaha. Hohman's grandfather, mother and 
many aunts, uncles and cousins preceded him. In fact, Hohman is the 57th member 
of his family to receive a sheepskin from the Jesuit school. He got his diploma 
100 years after his great-grandfather, Val Peter, landed in America from 
Germany and enrolled his children at Creighton.

 -- Yevgeny Ivanov, a principal character in Britain's sex-and-spying scandal 
of the 1960s, yearns to revisit England. The former Soviet naval attache's 
alleged affair with Christine Keeler while she also reportedly was involved 
with British War Minister John Profumo hastened the end of Prime Minister 
Harold Macmillan's government in 1964. Keeler is in the public eye again since 
the release of "Scandal," a British film about the affair. Ivanov, who denies 
he was a spy or that he had any liaison with Keeler other than "giving her a 
lift once" to London, said: "I would not care to see this vile creature 
(Keeler) again." Even so, he said he does have fond memories of London, where 
he hobnobbed with VIPs such as Profumo, Lord Astor and J. Paul Getty. SHIRLEY

ONLY JORDAN CAN CONTROL A BULL MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY KORNHEISER, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyrics for $800, please. Answer: "Stephen Sondheim had him in mind when he 
wrote, 'Isn't it rich?-Aren't we a pair?-Me here at last on the ground-You in 
mid-air."' 
</P>
<P>
Who is Michael Jordan? 
</P>
<P>
Yo, Mike, you can come down now. 
</P>
<P>
Last of the Wright Bros., Air Man, Holy Ghost of Hang Time . . . What else can 
we call him? His arms and legs, they're so pliable, and the way he bends them, 
so they look like they're coming at you from 800 different angles -- he's 
Gumby! 
</P>
<P>
Elgin, Connie, Doc, they were all electrifying in their day, but Jordan has 
turned it up a kilowatt with those tongue-wagging, crowd-gagging, arms-waving, 
legs-splaying, morale-shattering, reputation-flattering, bullet-headed tomahawk 
jams. These are indoor gyms; where's the wind beneath his wings blowing from? 
</P>
<P>
Seriously, Mike, did I ever tell you, you were my hero? You're everything I 
would like to be. Part of it, of course, is that you're going bald. Those of us 
who've blazed that trail always appreciate a superstar athlete with faltering 
follicles. You're our first bald sex symbol since Theo Kojak, if you don't 
count Beldar The Conehead. (Kareem is in another category because of those 
goggles. Every time he trots onto the court I keep expecting Han Solo and 
Chewbacca to follow.) That Nike deal is sweet, Mike, but Rogaine would pay you 
billions. Think of it: "Hair Jordan." Be still my foolish scalp. 
</P>
<P>
How do you like his numbers so far? He averaged 39.8 against Cleveland, and 
he's getting 34 against the Knicks -- plus 11.5 rebounds, a preposterous total 
for a guard. Not that it's new ground Jordan's plowing: In a three-game set 
against Boston in 1986, His Airship averaged 43.7 points, and last season in 
five games against Cleveland, he went for 45.2. Only Jerry West (46.3 in a 
six-game series against Les Boulez in 1965) ever averaged higher. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder CBS has devoted so much time and energy to Jordan. With Bird out, and 
Magic, by virtue of so many finals, having become the perennial closing act of 
the playoffs, CBS was eager for a new hook to hang its coverage on. Jordan is 
clearly ushering in the 1990s; if it's time to rock 'n' roll, he's Jerry Lee. 
So each little thing he does attracts camera overload. We see him before the 
game, pulling up to Chicago Stadium and climbing gingerly out of his Testarosa. 
We'll see Michael wanna-bes make their fashion statement wearing black high 
tops. Everyone in Chicago wears them; the Bulls cheerleaders, probably even 
Mike Ditka. We talk to his mother -- (CBS declared her Miller Lite's player of 
the game on Mother's Day. Society's approaching the point where you're nobody 
until you're the Miller Lite something or other; you might as well be dead. Any 
day now CBS Sports will name Noriega Miller Lite's dictator of the hemisphere 
and a $1,000 scholarship will be donated in his name) -- his father, his 
trainer, his doctor. How does he feel? What did he eat for breakfast? 
</P>
<P>
Could he always jump this high, or was he kidnapped by aliens, and injected 
with anti-gravity particles? We see television guys insinuate themselves into 
his life to make themselves invaluable to the hype; for example, Tim Brant 
breathlessly recounted a perfunctory conversation with Jordan: "Michael said to 
me, 'I gotta tell you, Tim' . . . " (Why is it every time Brant reports a 
coach's instructions to his players, someone's always spittin' or bitin' or 
sniffin' or scratchin' or clawin'? He makes every event sound like alligator 
wrestling.) 
</P>
<P>
The further Chicago advances in the playoffs, the more concentrated the CBS 
coverage. By the semis we'll get hour-long specials about where Jordan does his 
dry cleaning, and his exclusive ratings of the seven Santini Bros. If the Bulls 
reach the final, Jordan will anchor the evening news instead of Dan Rather. 
</P>
<P>
Most people can't fathom the Bulls coming this far. Without Jordan, they're 
Charlotte. They don't have any players who'd automatically start on every other 
team. In fact, none would start on more than a handful. Other nondescript teams 
have ridden an irrepressibly hot player to the NBA finals: the Warriors won in 
1975 with Rick Barry; the Rockets reached the final in 1981 with Moses Malone. 
But Barry had Jamaal Wilkes; Moses had Calvin Murphy. No guard has ever done so 
much with so little help as Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Switching Jordan to the point was the smartest thing Doug Collins did this 
season. (It's hard to tell how good a coach Collins is, since all he's required 
to say in huddles is, "Get the ball to Michael.") He has the ball in the middle 
of the court, which means he sees the whole floor. And he initiates the action, 
which means everyone else must react to him. He'll draw defenders to him like a 
magnet, then pitch off to a teammate as wide-open as a car wash. Think what the 
Bulls could do with a drop-dead shooter like the Bullets' Jeff Malone. (Malone 
and Terry Catledge or Mark Alarie for Will Perdue and Chicago's lottery pick, 
provided it's lower than No. 1, 2, or 3, hmmm.) 
</P>
<P>
Even with Jordan, though, it would take a miracle for the Bulls to win the NBA 
title. Which reminds me of a story: At the 1988 Final Four, Oklahoma Coach 
Billy Tubbs was answering questions at a news conference. Sitting next to him, 
moderating, was North Carolina's droll sports information director, Rick 
Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy," Tubbs was asked, "do you think God is on your side?" 
</P>
<P>
"Our side?" Tubbs responded, rolling his eyes. "I've never seen God in an 
Oklahoma Sooners uniform, have you? What number does he wear?" 
</P>
<P>
Quicker than a heartbeat, Brewer said, "No. 23."

PADRES RALLY, GO OVERTIME, DEFEAT EXPOS; 
</P>
<P>
GWYNN'S HITTING REVIVES AND PROVIDES VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MONTREAL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't like the Padres were just one out away from losing a game. They were 
one out away from losing their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight," Tony Gwynn said, "was the night we could have quit." 
</P>
<P>
It was the ninth inning, the Padres had runners on first and third, but there 
were two out and they trailed the Montreal Expos, 4-3. And oh, what a mess they 
had made. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' offense had just failed to send a runner home on an apparent 
game-tying sacrifice fly. Earlier, the defense had given the Expos two runs on 
errors and another run that Montreal literally stole. 
</P>
<P>
Into this carnage stepped Gwynn, who looked at pitcher Tim Burke with one thing 
on his mind: "I thought, 'What are they going to do to me now?' " Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
But then Burke threw him a lovely fastball and Gwynn, who had fought away 
off-speed stuff all night, was caught by a pleasant surprise and took it for a 
strike. And then Gwynn did it, on the next pitch, hitting another hard throw to 
center field for an RBI single to tie a game that the Padres calmly won two 
innings later, in the 11th, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who had lost five of their previous six games, won it with two runs 
in the 11th on Marvell Wynne's one-out RBI double and an angry Jack Clark's 
two-out RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
Wynne had followed a one-out walk to Bip Roberts by loser Andy McGaffigan by 
hitting a two-and-one pitch into right field. And then one out later, Gwynn was 
intentionally walked, which angered Clark, who hit a McGaffigan fastball into 
center field to drive in the second run. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Mark Davis finished it in the bottom of the inning after allowing the 
Expos a run on an RBI single by pinch-hitter Mike Aldrete, just his fifth hit 
of the year. Davis needed to retire Tim Raines (fly out) and Rex Hudler 
(strikeout) to end the game with runners on first and second. 
</P>
<P>
Just another day in the land of the scratching-their-heads Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"A weird game," pitching coach Pat Dobson said. "Man, what a weird game." 
</P>
<P>
This was a game in which Padre catcher Benito Santiago dropped four third 
strikes -- which in all decency should be a major league record, if those 
records were kept. This was also a game in which Padre coaches fought with 
umpires who had accused them of watching the game through a dugout television 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
There was little wonder that by the time it ended, nearly four hours after it 
had started, most of the crowd of 12,110 had gone home. They will watch cleaner 
games in the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
The only sanity was provided by Gwynn, who went three for four with three 
stolen bases to improve another remarkable mark. Since the dome was put on 
Olympic Stadium in 1987, Gwynn has batted .429 (18 for 42) with seven RBIs and 
eight stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
"I just see the ball batter in here now," he said. "Before, the sun would shine 
through funny places. Now, though, I'm seeing the ball so good, my best at-bat 
tonight was my walk." 
</P>
<P>
That came in the eighth inning, when the Padres' rally actually began. At that 
point, the Padres trailed, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that deficit was because Santiago put an attempted pickoff throw into 
right field, leading to a run in the second inning. Another part of it was 
because Garry Templeton booted a double-play grounder that brought about a run 
in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Then a few minutes after that grounder, with Spike Owen on third and Raines on 
first, the Expos pulled a double steal. It worked when Templeton, who was 
thrown the ball by Santiago as a decoy, couldn't get it out of his glove in 
time to throw out Owen at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I made some bad mistakes tonight and if the game had not turned out the way it 
did. . . . " Templeton said. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago was a little more forgiving. As he was walking to the clubhouse after 
getting eight assists, which would have been a club record for catchers if the 
game had lasted only nine innings, he asked onlookers: "Hey, you got a sandwich 
in your pocket? I'm really hungry." 
</P>
<P>
It was after that double steal that the umpires, according to the Padres, 
questioned the coaches about questioning calls after watching the slow-motion 
replays from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"He said we were watching the monitor, but there is no monitor on the bench, 
just a camera," said Dobson, who watched Manager Jack McKeon argue with umpire 
crew chief John Kibler. "And I'm not using any camera. I can watch a game with 
my own eyes better than through some small camera. It was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Thus Gwynn was really caught by surprise when he opened the eighth by falling 
behind 0-and-2 to reliever Joe Hesketh, who just entered the game. But seeing 
the ball well, he watched four straight for a walk. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Tim Burke, the Expos' stopper, who did his job on Clark by getting him to 
strike out, Clark's second of three whiffs this night. But Burke was so worried 
about Clark, he forgot about Gwynn, who stole second. 
</P>
<P>
A Rob Nelson grounder moved Gwynn to third with two out, where he was just a 
hit away from scoring. Santiago did it for him, knocking a Bruke pitch into 
left field. At the time, it was Santiago's fifth hit and sixth RBI in his last 
13 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
The run moved the Padres to within 4-3 and set up another rally minutes later. 
With one out in the ninth, Tim Flannery swung at Burke's first pitch and 
knocked it into right for a single. In came pinch-runner Roberts. Three pitches 
later, he was on third base as Wynne knocked a ball to right for a single. 
</P>
<P>
Still with just one out, it was up to Roberto Alomar to hit a fly ball to score 
Roberts from third and tie the game. And so he did. But Otis Nixon caught the 
ball in medium center field and Roberts was told to hold. 
</P>
<P>
"Nixon was running in and with Tony coming up, there was no way I could send 
him," third base coach Sandy Alomar said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was coming," Gwynn said of Roberts. "When he didn't, I thought, 
'Oh well,' and went back to get my bat." 
</P>
<P>
Within two pitches the score was tied, setting the stage for the winning rally.

BLUE JAYS FIRE WILLIAMS, LOOK FOR A MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jimy Williams was fired Monday as manager of the Toronto Blue Jays, who were 
picked by many to challenge for the division title but currently are sixth in 
the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who is the first major league manager to be dismissed this season, 
was replaced on an interim basis by Cito Gaston, only the fourth black to 
manage in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston, though, is not among the candidates to replace Williams on a permanent 
basis, said General Manager Pat Gillick. 
</P>
<P>
Gillick, who expects to name a manager within a week to 10 days, said: "We're 
not going to choose anyone from this coaching staff. We don't feel it's an easy 
transition to make from coach to manager on our ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
"We think one of the problems was with Jimy making the transition from the 
coaching staff. That's why we would prefer someone with managerial experience." 
</P>
<P>
Gaston, the senior member of the Blue Jays' coaching staff, has been the team's 
hitting instructor since before the 1982 season. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, formerly the Blue Jays' third base coach, was hired as manager on 
Oct. 25, 1985, after Bobby Cox quit to become general manager of the Atlanta 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays, who won the American League East under Cox in 1985, finished 
fourth under Williams in 1986 with an 86-76 record. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, they led by 3 1/2 games with a week to play. But Toronto lost its last 
seven games and finished with a 96-66 record, two games behind the Detroit 
Tigers, who swept a three-game series against the Blue Jays on the final 
weekend of the season. Last season, the Blue Jays tied for third with an 87-75 
record, finishing two games behind the division champion Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
This season, though, the Blue Jays were 12-24 before Monday night's 5-3 victory 
over the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances are such that, after 36 games, we felt it was necessary to 
make a change," Gillick told Associated Press. "We are all disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays had never before fired a manager in midseason. 
</P>
<P>
Among the rumored candidates to replace Williams are Lou Piniella, former 
manager of the New York Yankees, and Dick Williams, former manager of the 
Angels, the Red Sox, the Oakland Athletics, the San Diego Padres, the Montreal 
Expos and, most recently, the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Globe and Mail also reported today that Marcel Lachemann, the 
Angels' pitching coach, was among the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston, who joins Frank Robinson, Larry Doby and Maury Wills as the only blacks 
to manage in the major leagues, said he would do his best to make the 
transition as smooth as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Doby, director of community affairs with the New Jersey Nets, was interim 
manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1978. Wills was manager of the Mariners for 
parts of two seasons before being fired in 1981. Robinson is manager of the 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston, a former major leaguer who once roomed with Hank Aaron when both played 
for the Atlanta Braves, said in past interviews that he wasn't sure he wanted 
to manage permanently in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect that, sooner or later, somebody is going to ask me, and I'm a little 
curious myself how I'll react," Gaston told Ken Fidlin of the Toronto Sun in 
spring training. "I really love my work here and I think I'm pretty good at it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many more demands on your time as a manager, and I just don't 
know if I want to give up what free time I have." 
</P>
<P>
A SUCCESSFUL START

JOYNER GIVES ANGELS VICTORY IN 11; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER YANKEES TIE IT IN 9, HIS SACRIFICE FLY SCORES WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From No Name to No Runs, the incredible Lee Guetterman saga continued long into 
Monday night at Anaheim Stadium, as the New York Yankees' reliever pitched 
three more shutout innings to extend his scoreless-inning streak to 26. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Yankee Manager Dallas Green should have let him go for 27. 
</P>
<P>
But when the 10th inning faded into the 11th, Green opted to rest Guetterman -- 
and the rest is history, in the form of a 4-3, 11-inning Angel victory. 
</P>
<P>
Lance McCullers, Guetterman's replacement in the bottom of the 11th, proceeded 
to match one streak with one of his own, putting the first three runners he 
faced on base. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after finally retiring Lance Parrish on a bases-loaded line out, 
McCullers turned the mess over to Dave Righetti, who yielded a fly ball to 
Wally Joyner, just deep enough to enable Devon White to tag and score the 
decisive run from third. 
</P>
<P>
McCullers (1-1) was charged with the loss, but White's legs should be credited 
with an assist. White used them to first beat out an infield hit and then to 
steal second and third bases. 
</P>
<P>
With White on third, Brian Downing on first and McCullers struggling to a 
3-and-0 count on Chili Davis, Green called for an intentional walk, loading the 
bases, and waved his outfielders in. 
</P>
<P>
That momentarily staved off defeat, as left fielder Rickey Henderson was in 
position to snare Parrish's line drive for the first out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Green called on Righetti to face Joyner. Joyner, who drove in 
the Angels' third run with a seventh-inning single, then brought home the 
game-winner, scoring White with his sacrifice fly to center. The two RBIs gave 
Joyner 13 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
White's run made a winner of Willie Fraser (1-2), who pitched two scoreless 
innings after Bryan Harvey failed to hold a 3-2 lead in the top of the ninth, 
serving up a game-tying home run to Roberto Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
That sent the game into extra innings, allowing Guetterman, who had entered the 
game in the eighth, to extend his club-record streak. Before 1989, Mel 
Stottlemyre's scoreless streak of 22 2/3 innings in 1967 was the longest by any 
Yankee pitcher at the outset of a season. 
</P>
<P>
Guetterman still has yet to yield a run in 1989, retiring the Angels in order 
in the eighth and 10th innings and pitching out of trouble in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, the Angels had Downing on third and Parrish on first with one out 
before Joyner forced Parrish at second and Dick Schofield tapped back to 
Guetterman. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner was in the game at the time only because of an injury to Tony Armas, who 
was back in the lineup after spending more than a month on the disabled list 
with a strained hamstring. Armas started at first base in place of Joyner, but 
lasted less than six innings before re-aggravating the same hamstring after 
committing an error at first base. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, slogging through a five-for-26 slump, took a .218 average into Monday's 
game -- and with left-handed nemesis Dave LaPoint on the mound for New York, 
Angel Manager Doug Rader figured it would be a good night for Joyner to rest. 
Joyner has a career batting average of .174 (four for 23) against LaPoint. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been resting him against the guys he's had absolutely no success 
against," said Rader, who also kept Joyner out of the starting lineup Saturday 
against Tommy John. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to do the right thing for the guy. He's getting close. It'll come." 
</P>
<P>
So Armas started. And he made the move look good, too, homering in his first 
at-bat, sending a LaPoint pitch over the left-field fence in the third inning, 
slicing a 2-0 New York lead in half. 
</P>
<P>
But in the top of the sixth, with Yankee runners on first and second base and 
no outs, Ken Phelps hit a roller to first that Armas bobbled. The real damage, 
however, was done when Armas reached for the loose ball and made a vain attempt 
to tag Phelps with a swipe of his glove. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps was safe on the error, loading the bases, and Armas was sprawled on the 
ground in pain. It was the hamstring again, bringing an abrupt end to Armas' 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner replaced Armas at first base and, after Jesse Barfield forced Sax at 
home, was on the receiving end of an inning-ending double play off the bat of 
Mike Pagliarulo. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after the Angels tied the game, 2-2, in the seventh, Joyner broke the 
deadlock with a run-scoring single off LaPoint in the seventh. Chili Davis had 
singled and advanced to second on Parrish's walk before Joyner delivered his 
one-out single to right. 
</P>
<P>
But the Angels' lead didn't hold up. After seven innings, Angel starter Bert 
Blyleven was out of the game, giving way to Bob McClure, and before the eighth 
inning was complete, McClure had given way to Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
But Joyner bailed out Harvey and the Angels, who extended a little streak of 
their own -- three wins in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel owner Gene Autry underwent successful cornea transplant surgery on his 
right eye Monday at the Estelle Doheny Eye Clinic Hospital in Los Angeles. 
According to the Angels, Autry could be released from the hospital as early as 
today and is expected to be on hand when Jim Fregosi is inducted in the Angel 
hall of fame before Wednesday night's game against the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Globe and Mail, in today's edition, lists Angel pitching coach 
Marcel Lachemann among the candidates to replace fired Toronto Blue Jays 
Manager Jimy Williams. When this was brought to Lachemann's attention before 
Monday's game, the coach laughed. "They might've got me mixed up with Rene," he 
said, referring to brother and former big league manager Rene Lachemann. "I 
don't know where I'd fit in any list of candidates. I think they're just 
picking names." Lachemann said he has not been approached by the Blue Jays, but 
conceded, "I think it'd be ridiculous not to talk to anybody if they did. But 
these people have been very good to me here. My home's here. I've still got a 
lot to learn about the job I'm doing right now." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schofield missed a second consecutive start after sustaining a groin 
injury Saturday, but filled in at shortstop in the eighth inning after Dante 
Bichette pinch-hit for starting shortstop Kent Anderson. Bichette's plate 
appearance, incidentally, was the first by an Angel pinch-hitter since May 4, 
when Wally Joyner batted for Bill Schroeder. Yes, the days of Little Ball in 
Anaheim are long gone.

ANGELS BEAT YANKEES IN THE 11TH;

<P>
JOYNER'S SACRIFICE FLY GIVES CALIFORNIA A 4-3 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From No Name to No Runs, the incredible Lee Guetterman saga continued Monday 
night at Anaheim Stadium, with the New York Yankees' journeyman reliever 
pitching three more scoreless innings to drag his team into extra innings 
against Angels. The Angels ultimately won, 4-3, in 11 innings on Wally Joyner's 
sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Guetterman, whose career record read 12-10 and 5.11 on Opening Day, took a 0.00 
earned-run average into Monday's game, having strung together 23 shutout 
innings, which eclipsed Mel Stottlemyre's old Yankee standard of 22 2/3 
scoreless innings at the outset of a season. 
</P>
<P>
And after Roberto Kelly's ninth-inning home run off Bryan Harvey forged a 3-3 
tie, Guetterman was able to extend that streak to 26. 
</P>
<P>
Guetterman took over for starter Dave LaPoint, who left after seven innings, 
trailing, 3-2. Guetterman worked a perfect eighth inning, pitched out of jam in 
the ninth and retired the Angels in order in the 10th before giving way to 
Lance McCullers in the bottom of the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels threatened in the ninth when Brian Downing led off with a bloop 
single and, one out later, moved to second on a single by Lance Parrish. But at 
that point, Guetterman came back to get Wally Joyner to force Parrish at second 
and Dick Schofield to tap back at the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Through eight innings, the story of this game had been a tale of two first 
basemen. Tony Armas was back in the lineup after spending more than a month on 
the disabled list with a strained hamstring, and Joyner was on the bench, 
sidelined with a strained batting average. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, slogging through a five-for-26 slump, took a .218 average into Monday's 
game -- and Angel Manager Doug Rader figured it would be a good night for him a 
rest with Joyner's left-handed nemesis Dave LaPoint on the mound for New York. 
Joyner has a career batting average of .174 (four for 23) against LaPoint. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been resting him against the guys he's had absolutely no success 
against," said Rader, who also kept Joyner out of the starting lineup Saturday 
against Tommy John. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to do the right thing for the guy. He's getting close. It'll come." 
</P>
<P>
And it finally did -- although not before Armas had homered off LaPoint, 
committed an error at first base and re-aggravated his hamstring, all within 
six innings. 
</P>
<P>
In his first at-bat since April 9, Armas sent a 2-2 pitch by LaPoint over the 
left-field fence in the third inning, slicing a 2-0 New York lead in half. 
</P>
<P>
But in the top of the sixth, with Yankee runners on first and second base and 
no outs, Ken Phelps hit a roller to first that Armas immediately bobbled. The 
real damage, however, was done when Armas reached for the loose ball and made 
vain attempt to tag Phelps with a swipe of his glove. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps was safe on the error, loading the bases, and Armas was sprawled on the 
ground in pain. It was the hamstring again, bringing an abrupt end to Armas' 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner replaced Armas at first base, and after Jesse Barfield forced Sax at 
home, Joyner was on the receiving end of an inning-ending double play off the 
bat of Mike Pagliarulo. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after the Angels tied the game at 2-2 in the seventh, Joyner broke the 
deadlock with a run-scoring single off LaPoint in the seventh. Chili Davis had 
singled and advanced to second on Lance Parrish's walk before Joyner delivered 
his one-out single to right. 
</P>
<P>
The RBI was Joyner's 12th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But the Angels' lead wouldn't hold up. After seven innings, Angel starter Bert 
Blyleven was out of the game, giving way to Bob McClure, and before the eighth 
inning was complete, McClure had given way to Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
And in the top of the ninth, Harvey surrendered a one-out home run to Yankee 
center fielder Kelly to even the score again at 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
For Harvey, it was his second rough outing in as many appearances. After 
blowing a 2-0 ninth-inning lead last Wednesday in Detroit, winding up a 3-2 
loser, Harvey walked the first two hitters he faced Monday -- on eight pitches 
-- and then squandered a second consecutive save opportunity in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, however, had a chance to get Harvey a victory in the bottom of the 
ninth. With one out, the Angels had Brian Downing on second base and Parrish on 
first, but failed to capitalize when Joyner forced Parrish and Schofield tapped 
out to Guetterman. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Angel catcher Lance Parrish ran into a different kind of obstacle while running 
down the line to back up a play at first base in the fourth inning. Parrish and 
the visitors' bat boy got tangled up around the on-deck circle, sending Parrish 
tumbling toward the photographers' well next to the Yankee dugout. Parrish and 
bat boy emerged unscathed and the out was recorded at first base without 
complication.

NEWSWIRE: NFL BANS STANLEY WILSON FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanley Wilson, the Cincinnati Bengal running back suspended for drug use on 
the eve of the Super Bowl, was permanently banned from the National Football 
League Monday for his continuing substance-abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
The action amounts to a lifetime ban for Wilson, 27, who had also missed the 
1985 and 1987 seasons because of drug problems and is currently being treated 
at a Phoenix clinic. 
</P>
<P>
However, league spokesman Joe Browne said it is possible he could apply for 
reinstatement if he presents evidence of his rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of Wilson's history, this permanent ban can't come as a surprise to 
him," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the NFL's drug policy, a player who fails a drug test once is not 
suspended but can be tested regularly for cause. If he fails again, he is 
suspended for 30 days; a third failure means a permanent ban with the option to 
reapply for reinstatement after a year. 
</P>
<P>
Browne would not say, however, if Wilson's suspension resulted from the drug 
policy or from conditions given him in April, 1988, when he was reinstated 
after agreeing to what the league called "certain conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson began last season as Cincinnati's starting fullback but injured a knee 
and lost the job to rookie Ickey Woods.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: AZTECS WIN 2, TAKE SECOND IN WAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its final at-bat in the Western Athletic Conference season, San Diego State 
scored four runs in the sixth inning to defeat Hawaii, 5-1, in the second game 
of a doubleheader Monday at Smith Field. The Aztecs won the first game, 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
The victories leave SDSU (35-23, 17-9) in second place in the WAC. Hawaii 
(36-24, 18-10), ranked 25th in the nation, finishes third, just ahead of 
Wyoming (36-19, 17-10), ranked 17th. Brigham Young (43-14, 21-7) finished 
first. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU plays Hawaii Thursday in Honolulu in the opening game of the WAC playoffs. 
BYU takes on Wyoming in the double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU's Kasey McKeon had the big blow in the nightcap, a two-run double off the 
left-field wall in the sixth. Jim Gibbs (2-2) was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, the Aztecs collected 16 hits and scored seven runs in the 
sixth inning to pull away from the Rainbows. John Hemmerly (6-3), a graduate of 
Mission Bay High, struck out eight and allowed just four hits. Second baseman 
Brian Dunn went two for four with four RBIs and designated hitter Mike McKinnon 
three for three with two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego will play Cal State Stanislaus in a best-of-five baseball series

WESTMONT'S NO-STARS REACH NAIA AREA BASEBALL PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mitch Polin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westmont College Coach John Kirkgard wasn't too surprised when only two of the 
players of his district-winning team were named to the National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics All-District 3 baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
He has become used to it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of surprising when you win the district and have only two players on 
the team, but it's indicative of the balance on this team," Kirkgard said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkgard said his team doesn't usually have the individual talent to receive 
much attention on postseason all-star teams. So, Kirkgard has to console 
himself with team success. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have been the hottest team among College Division schools in the 
Southland since March 17, winning 25 of 27 games. 
</P>
<P>
With three consecutive victories last week, the Warriors won their first 
district tournament title in 23 years and advanced to the NAIA area playoffs 
that start Thursday at Whitworth College in Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Westmont (33-14) will face Linfield of Oregon in its opening game, and 
Hawaii-Hilo meets Whitworth in the other game of the four-team, 
double-elimination tournament. The winner advances to the NAIA World Series 
that starts May 26 at Lewis-Clark State in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkgard said the team is confident after recovering from an 8-12 start. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, losing motivated us," he said. "It's an indication of how hard 
this team's work ethic has been." 
</P>
<P>
Hard working or not, the coach said he couldn't have anticipated his team 
winning 25 of its last 27 games. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipated that we had the opportunity to be district champion," Kirkgard 
said. "I've been here six years and our expectations are always to do better 
than the year before and we accomplished that. But I never expected to do it by 
winning 25 of our last 27 games." 
</P>
<P>
Westmont has four players batting at least .300. There are outfielder David 
Heldoorn and shortstop Tim Kimmel at .321, catcher Jackie Schniepp at .302 and 
third baseman Greg Loewen at .301. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kirkgard is quick to add, "We are without a doubt a pitching and 
defensive-oriented team." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have an outstanding 3.28 team earned-run average and an 
exceptional .965 fielding percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't beat ourselves with mistakes," Kirkgard said. "We don't walk anyone 
to give a team extra chances." 
</P>
<P>
Westmont's top player is Jeff Ludwig, a senior who was selected district player 
of the year. He has a 10-3 record and 2.19 earned-run average, with eight 
complete games in his last nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the closest (to a star) as far as his numbers go," Kirkgard said. "But 
he's really a fine example of the type of talent we have. He's a player who's 
had to do a lot of hard work to get to this point. His work ethic got him to 
where he is now." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo has grown accustomed to winning California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. titles in just about every sport, except baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Before this season, the Mustangs had never won a conference title in baseball. 
In fact, the school's first and only appearance in the NCAA Division II 
playoffs was in 1977, whenthe Mustangs were eliminated in two straight games. 
</P>
<P>
But San Luis Obispo ended its frustration by winning the CCAA title last week 
and will host the three-team Division II West Regional that starts Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked Cal State Sacramento (35-16) will play San Francisco State (31-20) 
in the opening game of the double-elimination tournament at 2 p.m. Friday, and 
the loser faces the sixth-ranked Mustangs (31-23) in the second game at 7 p.m. 
Friday. The tournament continues Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest factor in San Luis Obispo's success this season has been 
its pitching. The leaders are senior Greg Paxton, 9-2 with a 3.45 ERA and 7 
complete games, and junior Dave Wilson, who is 6-5 with a 2.82 ERA and 118 
strikeouts in 108 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
On offense the Mustangs have been paced by junior Rich Shepperd, batting .323 
with seven home runs and 41 runs batted in. First baseman Pat Kirby (.317) and 
outfielder Billy Smith (.305) are next in average, and shortstop Ron Crowe has 
a team-leading 11 homers and 48 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps a preview of the regionals last week, San Luis Obispo and Sacramento 
split a two-game nonconference series last week in Sacramento. San Luis Obispo 
won, 11-2, and Sacramento won, 5-3. However, the Mustangs didn't pitch Paxton 
or Wilson in either game. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive season, Cal Lutheran and Cal State Bakersfield have 
advanced to the national tournament in women's softball. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield (35-22) will compete in the four-team NCAA Division II nationals 
starting Friday at Cal State Sacramento, and Cal Lutheran plays in the 16-team 
NAIA nationals starting Thursday at Emerson Park in Midland, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran will be trying to improve upon its performance in the nationals 
last season, when the Regals were defeated in their first two games of the 
double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Regals, seeded No. 11 in the tournament with a 35-16 record, will meet 
sixth-seeded Kearney State (28-14) of Nebraska on Thursday in their opening 
game. West Florida is the top seed. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran, which won two straight games over Mesa State of Colorado in the 
Bi-District playoffs last week to advance to the national tournament, has been 
led by the pitching of junior DeeAndra Pilkington and sophomore Leslie Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Pilkington has an 18-4 record and 0.99 ERA, with five shutouts in her last six 
games. She is also leading the team with a .413 batting average and 25 runs 
batted in. Stevens has a 12-5 record and 1.15 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bob Coons, coach of the cross-country and women's track teams at Cal State 
Bakersfield for the last 13 years, has announced that he will resign at the end 
of the season. Coons, the school's first and only head coach in women's track, 
guided the Roadrunners to top five finishes in the NCAA Division II from 
1981-83. . . . Brian Newhall, interim men's basketball coach at Occidental last 
season, has been named full-time to the position. Newhall guided the Tigers to 
a 15-10 record -- the team's best since 1980 -- and third place in the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference last season. . . . Mari Uchida, 
who led Claremont-Mudd-Scripps to second place in the SCIAC and competed last 
week in the NCAA Division III individual championships in singles, has been 
named conference player of the year.

AMID THE GLITTER, HELP FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fourth annual Bruin Classic Gala had all the glitzy trappings of any 
black-tie party. But among the sequined dresses and satin bow ties was a subtle 
reminder of why everyone was there: Around the room had been placed large color 
photos of smiling children. 
</P>
<P>
This was a benefit for the UCLA Intervention Program for Handicapped Children, 
a program that works with handicapped kids from birth, teaching them and their 
families to live with their disabilities, eventually "mainstreaming" them into 
regular schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get the flavor of the family," said Dr. Judy Howard, medical 
director of the intervention program, as she pointed to the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:30 p.m., guests were filtering into MGM's Filmland Center, an office 
building in Culver City with an enormous atrium lobby where a pre-dinner silent 
auction was being held. They strolled the aisles of clothes, jewelry, health 
club memberships, cruises, restaurant packages, autographed footballs and more, 
looking for bargains and a convenient way to make a donation to the 
intervention program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entertainment Auctioned 
</P>
<P>
The evening, emceed by former Olympic athlete Bob Seagren, also included a live 
auction (conducted by actor Henry Polic II) of vacations, evenings at the 
Hollywood Bowl and a performance of "Phantom of the Opera." Gala chairman Kathy 
Hampar said the gala would net at least $120,000, which will be used for 
medical care, education and therapy for the children in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Awards were given to Glendale Federal Savings and Loan for its support of the 
program, as well as the Ritter family, singled out, according to the award, for 
"their special example of family unity and love." 
</P>
<P>
The family was represented by Tom Ritter, a documentary film producer and the 
brother of actor John. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom is one of my good friends," Howard said. "We've known each other for about 
five or six years through United Cerebral Palsy." Tom Ritter, who has cerebral 
palsy, has been actively involved in this group. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really struck by the family," she added. "Seeing how their family works, 
what happens -- from that I try to see what we're all about, how we can better 
prepare children to fit into their families. Tom has taught me that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fond of Program 
</P>
<P>
Ritter said he was "really fond of the work (the program) does. The concept of 
mainstreaming is new, within the last decade or so. They use computers, which 
is so fantastic. Socialization is so important -- along with the physical, they 
also assist in the social and emotional aspects. 
</P>
<P>
"For a handicapped child to go to regular schools," he added, "their peers grow 
up with that, so there's no alienation, no fear." 
</P>
<P>
Also present at the dinner were Hampar's husband, Gary; auction chairs Geri 
Gross and husband Herb, Ruth Lebowitz and husband Leonard; dinner chairs Lucia 
Jacobson and Virginia Lee Troesch; and Susan and Bruce Burmester, Sandy and 
Robert Papazian, and Arleen and John Saffro.

U.S. HISTORY AS PROGRESSION OF CORPORATE TECHNOLOGY

American Genesis: A Century of Invention and Technological Enthusiasm 1870-1970 
by Thomas P. Hughes (Viking: $24.95; 349 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The central thesis of Thomas P. Hughes' "American Genesis" is simple and 
compelling. The most distinctive, impressive and important achievement in 
American history is not our political system, he says, but our technology. 
</P>
<P>
We are a nation of builders. We have created modern technology and the culture 
that supports it. "Inventors, industrial scientists, engineers, and system 
builders have been the makers of modern America," Hughes writes. "The values of 
order, system, and control that they embedded in machines, devices, processes, 
and systems have become the values of modern technological culture." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes argues that the modern world is the product of a hundred years of 
invention from 1870 to 1970. It was started by a stellar group of independent 
inventors -- Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Lee De Forest and Orville 
and Wilbur Wright, among others -- who inexplicably emerged in the same place 
and at the same moment in history. 
</P>
<P>
In short order, these rugged individuals gave way to scientists at research 
laboratories sponsored by General Electric, AT&amp;T and other industrial 
giants. It was a subtle but important change. Big companies tend to favor 
conformity over originality, improvements in existing products over boldly 
innovative new ones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Research Organizations 
</P>
<P>
The next stage saw the development of system builders, people like Henry Ford 
and Frederick W. Taylor, the creator of scientific management, who organized 
technologies into units of control. Electric power grids resulted, Hughes 
notes, and so, ultimately, did the Manhattan Project, which created the atomic 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"America's creating, building, and systematizing genius reached its zenith in a 
nuclear enterprise, or technological system, that was a culmination of almost a 
century of ever-expanding invention, industrial research, and system building 
that extended from Pearl Street, Edison's first lighting station in New York, 
to . . . Los Alamos." 
</P>
<P>
No one can gainsay the material benefits that the century of invention has 
bestowed on us. But there was a less-obvious Faustian bargain in the process. 
</P>
<P>
The early shift from independent inventor to industrial scientist presaged the 
loss of individuality that order, organization and control would eventually 
impose on everyone. Most of us today are cogs in the great economic machine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japanese Implications 
</P>
<P>
Hughes doesn't say it, but he might have noted that Japan's ability to beat us 
at our own game stems in large measure from the greater willingness of Japanese 
people to be those cogs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, writers like Lewis Mumford and Jacques Ellul began to call 
attention to the downside of progress. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of seeing and sentimentalizing the United States as essentially a 
nation of democratic politics and free-enterprise economics, the writers and 
philosophers of a counterculture probed the depth and extent of the 
mechanization and systematization of America," Hughes writes. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked what problems arose from the man-made characteristics of built 
America, from -- as Frederick W. Taylor said -- no longer putting man first, 
but putting the system first." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, a historian of science at the University of Pennsylvania, writes with 
sweep and detail. He links diverse phenomena like the military-industrial 
complex and modern art and architecture with his overall vision that order and 
control were the inevitable result of technological progress. His is an epic 
tale told with a rhythm and cadence that match it. 
</P>
<P>
The subtheme of the individual versus the world recurs throughout the story. 
Though it was individuals who kicked off the century of invention, they were 
quickly supplanted by company men, who have remained in the driver's seat ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death of an Inventor 
</P>
<P>
Particularly poignant is Hughes' retelling of the life of Edwin Armstrong, the 
visionary engineer who invented FM radio, only to be fought by RCA and other 
entrenched interests, who did not want their substantial investment in AM radio 
disturbed. After years of legal battles, Armstrong died a suicide in 1954. 
Hughes takes his story as symbolic of the era. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, he does not abandon hope for a change of direction that will 
bring new values to the fore while retaining the benefits that mass technology 
has bestowed. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes recognizes that the current system and the forces behind it have 
tremendous momentum going for them. But, he insists, "Technology can be created 
and can be deployed that would heighten the quality of life, not simply the 
quantity of goods." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. But Hughes' haunting book makes a better case for the problem than it 
does for the solution.

LA JOLLA'S RICH HARVEST OF 'GRAPES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Terry Kinney, playing Jim Casy, stands alone on a stage without color or 
landscape and only a suggestion of barbed-wire fencing. 
</P>
<P>
"The dawn came, but no day," he intones in a voice drained of emotion. "In the 
air the dust hung like a fog. The men came out of their houses, and looked at 
the land. And the women came out of their houses and watched the men, waiting 
for them to break. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
So begins the Chicago Steppenwolf Company's presentation of "The Grapes of 
Wrath," which launched the La Jolla Playhouse's seventh season in the Mandell 
Weiss Theatre on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Adapted and directed by Frank Galati, a four-year company member (brief tenure 
by Steppenwolf standards), it's a tough and richly poetic dramatization of the 
John Steinbeck novel. Emotionally stark, visually bleak and aurally sustaining 
(composer and musical director Michael Smith has created a mood-setting musical 
frame performed on harmonica, a musical harp, banjo, fiddle and guitar), this 
lament for the destitute farmers who left Oklahoma's Dust Bowl in the '30s in 
search of work and survival in California has profound resonances in the 
present. The Okies were the first homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The echoes, however, run even deeper -- backward as well as forward. If the 
itinerant Joads are the quintessence of displaced America, they're only an 
extension of others: the displaced Native Americans and African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the desperation of the Joads, trying to stick together and survive in a 
country that (failing other ideas) can think only of exploiting them, informs 
the larger story of a nation set on a socially tragic course, in which the 
distance between the haves and have-nots relentlessly, endlessly widens. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the general communications. But as the particular informs the general 
best, this family's trials, their losses, their strength and their persistence 
against horrendous odds is the beating heart of the play (and the novel). The 
old truck that transports them becomes all the land they know. The fierce 
matriarchal grip that binds them (Lois Smith as a valiant if perhaps too 
calculated Ma Joad) becomes all the love they know. And the stillbirth of Rose 
of Sharon's baby, symbolically the death of hope, is wiped away by the 
regenerating final image: Rose (Sally Murphy, who knows how to be simple) 
baring her milk-choked breast to feed a starving stranger. 
</P>
<P>
Galati's text is, though not the first, probably the most effective 
dramatization of the novel to date. (Terence Shank had created an only slightly 
more sentimental one for L.A.'s Colony at the Studio Theatre Playhouse in 1980; 
it was later featured at Louisville's annual Humana Festival of new plays.) It 
understands something vitally important: that the only requirement for any play 
is that it be true to its intent. In the case of an adaptation, that means the 
original author's intent. On that level, the Steppenwolf "Grapes of Wrath" 
succeeds better than its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
That is mainly because it doesn't compromise its bleakness and knows how to 
convey the poetry within it -- exactly as Steinbeck has done. The acting of 
this ensemble company ranges from excellent to good, hampered only when a 
clumsier technology gets in the way. Gary Sinise as Tom and Kinney as Jim Casy 
are the most individually memorable in the 35-member cast, which is to be 
commended for being less rather than more distinguishable. This "Grapes" is a 
testament to the rarely seen virtues of ensemble performance. 
</P>
<P>
Also ensemble production. 
</P>
<P>
The torn and faded costumes by Erin Quigley and Kevin Rigdon have the drab 
authenticity of economic condition all over them. The spare lighting and set 
designs by Rigdon create a deft, depressing mood, at once lyrical and stern, 
with clotheslines replacing the barbed wire in the second half, isolating pools 
of light, recessed bonfires, a waist-deep water channel representing the river, 
white lightning and sheets of rain crashing down to the sound of apocalyptic 
thunder during the rainstorm (Rob Milburn designed the sound) -- and of course 
the truck. 
</P>
<P>
This key player in the story has to be moved around on a special 
radio-controlled frame. That's the only time that technology hinders rather 
than helps. But theater is not about realism. It is about poetic illusion. And, 
in this case, it is also very much about words. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbeck's, distilled by Galati (who also did the film adaptation of "The 
Accidental Tourist"), are as potent and invigorating as ever. At almost 3 1/2 
hours, the impact of this transposed "Grapes of Wrath" remains undiluted.

Comic actor Gene Wilder, back on the big screen in "See No Evil, Hear No Evil" 
after a three-year break to help wife Gilda Radner overcome ovarian cancer, 
says the struggle has made him appreciate life much more. "Life is very short. 
Everyone says, 'I know, I know,' but . . . if they knew, they'd stop doing 
what's unimportant and do what is important. There's no time for anything else. 
And it's too sad to learn it when it's too late," Wilder says in an interview 
in the May 29 issue of US magazine. ALEENE MacMINN

A team of elderly Chinese jazzmen who stopped playing their favorite music for 
30 years after their country's communist revolution will be honored guests at 
the 16th Sacramento Dixieland Jubilee, May 26-29. Members of the Peace Hotel 
Old Jazz Band played in Shanghai before the 1949 revolution, having learned 
jazz by listening to Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller records, and from the few 
American bands that visited China. The Chinese group will be one of 15 foreign 
bands playing at the Sacramento jazz show, which began with 21 jazz groups and 
8,000 visitors when it was launched in 1974. Last year it drew more than 100 
musical groups and 110,000 paying guests. The four-day show goes on at seven 
sites, four in central Sacramento and three in outlying areas. The Soviet 
Union's Leningrad Dixieland Ensemble is also due to perform. ALEENE MacMINN

Leading British actors who waged an emotional campaign in London over the 
weekend to save the excavated site of the 16th-Century Rose Theatre, where 
Shakespeare may have performed, got good news Monday. The British government 
temporarily stopped construction of an office tower over the site, and 
Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley told Parliament the dumping of sand and 
gravel over the remains of the open-air theater would be delayed for at least a 
month. This will enable architects and conservationists to discuss how to 
preserve the theater. Developers agreed to negotiations after the actors -- 
including Ian McKellen, Dame Peggy Ashcroft, James Fox and Sir Laurence Olivier 
-- took center stage in efforts to rescue the historic site where Shakespeare 
is thought to have made his debut as an actor in 1592 and to have acted in his 
own play, "Henry VI." The Rose was built in 1587. Plays were last performed 
there in 1603. ALEENE MacMINN

When about 350 members of the Andy Griffith Show Appreciation Society got 
together over the weekend in Winston-Salem, N.C., for their annual convention, 
they took a trip 35 miles up the road to Mt. Airy, said to be the inspiration 
for some of the spots in the show's fictional town of Mayberry. What they 
noticed right off were some differences. Aunt Bea's eatery and Floyd's 
Barbershop had different names, but they did find a Snappy Grill on Main 
Street. Differences or not, one member, Linda Stewart of Dallas, said of the 
visit: "I can die happy now. Mostly I can relate to the life style, because we 
sit on the porch at home and rock, go to church, even eat the same kind of 
foods. I can't relate to shows today because we don't have cocktails every five 
minutes." Stewart, 47, has watched and videotaped all 200-plus episodes of the 
show that aired on CBS 1960-68. ALEENE MacMINN

CHAMBER MUSIC/LA FEST

<P>
It was a fitting way to close the five-program "Affair With Brahms," the fourth 
annual Chamber Music/LA Festival at the Japan America Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The Sextet in B-flat, an early work in which the composer's genius as a 
contrapuntalist is very evident, offers the six musicians significant technical 
and interpretive challenges. Those musicians certainly met the challenges 
Sunday, as they offered an emotionally charged, sensitive and nearly spotless 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
Here was unified, synergetic playing; individual melodic lines emerged clearly, 
instruments blended exquisitely and dramatic statements were uttered uniformly. 
Violinists Paul Rosenthal and Yukiko Kamei, violists Milton Thomas and Marcus 
Thompson and cellists Nathaniel Rosen and Jeffrey Solow delivered an account 
marked by passion, tenderness and drama. 
</P>
<P>
Before intermission, violinist Christiaan Bor, joined by Thompson, Solow and 
pianist Jerome Lowenthal, gave a dynamic, propulsive reading of Schumann's 
Quartet in E-flat, although it took two movements for Lowenthal to shed the 
kinks from his playing. 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon began with a taut, good-natured account of Mozart's Trio in G, K. 
564. Though Kamei played too assertively and thus took away some of the 
elegance of the work, she and the others -- Lowenthal and Rosen -- made a 
sure-footed, alert team. TERRY McQUILKIN

PIANIST HORACIO GUTIERREZ AT AMBASSADOR AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a light introduction to an otherwise demanding recital at Ambassador 
Auditorium Saturday evening, Horacio Gutierrez invited actress Mariette Hartley 
to join him in Satie's "Sports et divertissements" for piano and narrator. 
Hartley charmed and pantomimed her way through the narration (in Virgil 
Thomson's translation) prefacing the 20 satirical sketches, while Gutierrez 
gave the programmatic salon music a tongue-in-cheek seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
But Gutierrez brought true seriousness and utmost integrity to his 
interpretation of Schumann's Fantasy in C. His approach was decidedly 
unromantic, allowing the work's own romanticism to speak instead through 
thoughtful clarity. He permitted himself few liberties with internal tempos. He 
pedaled for delineation and emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
The final movement benefited most from a quiet and simple approach. Modulations 
worked their own subtle effect, imparted by a master of quiet shading without 
the warning flags of prior tempo changes. 
</P>
<P>
The Fantasy is as demanding as it is romantic, but Gutierrez has a facile 
technique that leaves even the devilish coda of the second movement seeming 
naturally effortless. This technique served well for the agonized rumblings and 
frenzied nervousness of Prokofiev's 8th Sonata, which received the same 
attention to melodic delineation and shading that had illuminated earlier 
offerings. SUSAN BLISS

MEXICO MASSACRE;

POTENT MIX OF RITUAL AND CHARISMA

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Other members of the cult called her their witch, a high priestess in a world 
of evil. 
</P>
<P>
Her name is Sara Aldrete Villareal, and she, like the others still alive, is 
accused of murder. 
</P>
<P>
She is a tall, athletic woman who, in one half of her life, was an honors 
student at a Texas college. But in the other, the one few people saw, she was a 
lover and follower of Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, whose legacy is a trail of 
grotesque violence almost beyond imagination. 
</P>
<P>
She said this man, through the sheer force of his personality, held her in his 
grip, just as he did the others who killed for him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Force of Personality 
</P>
<P>
"If he tells you to do something right now, if he orders you, you will do it," 
she said last week. "I don't even know why, but you will do it." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, it would be Aldrete who ran screaming from a besieged Mexico City 
apartment, telling the police that Constanzo was dead, that he had ordered his 
own execution. 
</P>
<P>
It was a lurid ending to a yearlong saga of death precipitated by Constanzo, 
who had convinced his followers that killing was the key to protection from 
being caught smuggling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Mexican police believe that members of the cult killed 15 people in 
Matamoros, just across from the Texas border city of Brownsville. Among them 
was Mark Kilroy, a college student on spring break whose disappearance began a 
manhunt that eventually led to the discovery of the cult and of the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Aldrete, Alvaro de Leon and three other cult members were indicted 
in Mexico City on charges of homicide and related counts in connection with the 
slayings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grisly Trademark 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that Constanzo and his sect may also be responsible for nine 
Mexico City deaths that bore what has become a sect trademark: the removal of 
spinal columns to make good-luck necklaces. 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, the horror resembles the Tate-La Bianca murders by Charles 
Manson's followers 20 years ago and the mass suicide by the followers of the 
Rev. Jim Jones in Guyana in 1978. In both those cases, one man mesmerized 
others into believing that evil is good and into committing diabolical acts as 
a result. 
</P>
<P>
But this case goes further. Constanzo practiced his magic in Mexican high 
society, winning adherents with his ceremonies to drain away evil. And he took 
a religion born in the Congo and changed it to meet his own needs, including 
offering its protective spell to drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The religion, called Palo Mayombe, embraces animal sacrifice. Constanzo 
convinced his followers that human sacrifice was even more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
From the moment he saw the grisly scene at an isolated ranch outside Matamoros, 
Rafael Martinez knew he was looking at Palo Mayombe. The cauldron, the human 
remains and the bow and arrow were all part of the rituals of the religion that 
was brought to the Caribbean during the slave trading days. 
</P>
<P>
At first, police used the terms "voodoo killings" and "satanic murders" after 
discovering the mass graves early last month. But it fell to Martinez, a 
cultural anthropologist from Miami, to tell officials that they had encountered 
Palo Mayombe, to which human sacrifice was added. 
</P>
<P>
With Palo Mayombe in the background, Constanzo must have been used to 
sacrificing goats, chickens and pigs, said Martinez. "To him, sacrificing 
humans was the next logical step," he added. 
</P>
<P>
By Martinez's estimate, there are roughly 40,000 Palo Mayombe followers in the 
United States. Most practice the religion in their homes, where it will not be 
seen by others. And, Martinez said, it is also the religion of choice for many 
drug dealers, who use it to protect themselves and to put curses on their 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"Palo Mayombe is mostly malevolent and evil," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As Martinez walked through the murder site, he saw all the things associated 
with Palo Mayombe: the iron cauldron, called a nganga; the cigars and cheap 
liquor called "firewater"; the candles. Then, too, there was Constanzo's diary, 
in which notations were made in both Spanish and Bantu, the language of the 
Congo tribes that originated the religion. 
</P>
<P>
"He really knew his Palo Mayombe," said Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Constanzo grew up in the Miami suburb of Hialeah, where neighbors said there 
was always something eerie about his family's home. The back yard was filled 
with animals, the yard was often knee-high in weeds and decapitated animals 
were sometimes found on neighbors' front steps after an argument with one of 
the Constanzos. 
</P>
<P>
His mother was once arrested when police found her living in a tiny apartment 
with several children and 27 animals. The floor was covered with blood, urine 
and feces. 
</P>
<P>
Constanzo grew up handsome, with reddish hair and light skin and found 
occasional work as a model. In 1984, he moved from Miami to Mexico City, 
beginning a portion of his life that changed him from an ambitious, 
good-looking young man to an immensely wealthy drug dealer who drove an $80,000 
Mercedes-Benz and bought cars for friends on a whim. 
</P>
<P>
Not much is known about Constanzo during those early years in Mexico City. But 
he is remembered as someone who swiftly developed a reputation as a sorcerer 
skilled at ridding the body of evil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Egg and Fragrant Water 
</P>
<P>
Constanzo performed limpias, or "cleansings," an ancient rite from Mexico's 
Indian and Spanish cultures that is still in use today, even among some members 
of the well-educated Mexican middle class. In one form, the sorcerer passes an 
egg over the client's body, sometimes accompanied by fragrant water or the 
leaves of a plant. Then the egg is cracked into a glass of water, and the 
sorcerer claims to read the patterns of evil that are being absorbed from the 
client's body. 
</P>
<P>
As his fame grew, Mexican movie stars, musicians and other notables turned to 
him for cleansings. Florentino Ventura, the former Mexican head of Interpol, 
the international police agency, has been identified as one of Constanzo's 
clients. Ventura committed suicide last year. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum, drug smugglers would pay him $50,000 to 
provide them mystical protection from the law. And then, at some point, 
Constanzo himself moved into the world of drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
He joined up with a smuggler named Elio Hernandez from Matamoros, then slowly 
became a larger player in the operation, police on both sides of the border 
said. He initiated Hernandez into his bizarre sect of animal sacrifice. By this 
time, Aldrete was already a part of the cult, and she acted as the godmother in 
Hernandez's initiation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Cult members, in their confessions, have said that the first two murders had 
nothing to do with religion but were acts of revenge for drug deals gone bad. 
Lt. George Cavito of the sheriff's department in Cameron County, Tex., said 
that until 10 months ago, Constanzo was merely a drug dealer with a propensity 
for cheating and killing. 
</P>
<P>
He was also someone who demanded strict obedience. Oran Neck, a U.S. Customs 
agent who worked on the case, described an incident in which one of Constanzo's 
followers disobeyed orders by snorting cocaine. "They wasted him right there," 
Neck said. 
</P>
<P>
The ritual killings began early last year. In all, five people were murdered 
and mutilated in cult sacrifices; the other 10 found in the Matamoros graves 
were drug-related murder victims. 
</P>
<P>
"When they needed someone for human sacrifice, they would just go get him," 
said Cavito. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Kilroy and his pals were out late, drinking and carousing in the Zona Rosa 
section of Matamoros. It was spring break, and revelry on the Mexican side of 
the border was something of a rite of passage for Texas college students 
vacationing on nearby South Padre Island. 
</P>
<P>
The group was making its way back to the International Bridge when Kilroy, a 
junior at the University of Texas, fell behind. Mark Huddleston, one of the 
other students, watched from nearby as a pickup truck approached and the men 
inside offered Kilroy a ride. 
</P>
<P>
As the truck sped off, Kilroy jumped out, trying to escape, but was immediately 
run to ground by men in another car that was following the truck. 
</P>
<P>
According to cult members, Kilroy was brought to the Santa Elena Ranch outside 
Matamoros, where caretaker Domingo Reyes gave him a drink of water while one of 
the cult members called Constanzo at the Holiday Inn in Brownsville. He was 
told that his orders had been carried out, that a gringo had been captured. 
</P>
<P>
Kilroy was killed with a machete blow to the back of the head. Later, Constanzo 
ordered cult member De Leon to cut off one of Kilroy's legs. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that each time you do this, you lose a little of your fear until 
you aren't afraid of anything anymore," De Leon said later. 
</P>
<P>
Kilroy was buried, along with the rest of the drug and cult victims, in a 
shallow grave outside the shanty that was the cultists' "temple." 
</P>
<P>
Before Mark Kilroy's murder, the disappearance of the other victims had raised 
hardly a ripple. But this one was different. Kilroy came from a white, 
middle-class family that lived in the tiny community of Santa Fe, Tex. James 
Kilroy, Mark's father, was not willing to sit home and wait for the Mexican 
police to turn up news of his son. 
</P>
<P>
He want to Brownsville and stayed there, first offering a $5,000 reward, then 
raising it to $15,000. U.S. officials joined the search, with U.S. Customs 
doing so, in part, because young Kilroy's uncle was an agent in the Los Angeles 
office. 
</P>
<P>
As is often the case in investigations, luck played a major role in uncovering 
the cult murders. On the night of April 1, Mexican police saw a late-model 
pickup pull off the road to avoid a police checkpoint. They followed the truck 
to Elio Hernandez's Santa Elena Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tracking Phone Records 
</P>
<P>
The police began tracking cellular phone records and interviewed the ranch's 
caretaker. On April 9, the police made four arrests. Confronted with a picture 
of Kilroy, the cult members confessed to his murder, saying they had been 
ordered to do so by Constanzo. 
</P>
<P>
The grim task of digging up the bodies began. Constanzo and Aldrete and three 
others went into hiding. The police in Mexico City also began working the case. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Armando Ponce, one of the capital police officers assigned to the case, 
noticed similarities between the Matamoros murders and another killing he had 
investigated in Mexico City in 1987. A young house servant had disappeared, and 
pieces of her clothing were later found in front of an altar similar to the one 
at the ranch. Later still, her tortured body was found along with seven others 
in the Zumpango River. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
World of Witchcraft 
</P>
<P>
Ponce returned to the world of witchcraft and sorcerers that he had 
investigated in 1987. There, he got his tips. Someone had seen Constanzo in the 
nearby Cuauhtemoc neighborhood. Someone else had an address in the adjacent 
Anzures neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Police Chief Rodrigo Martinez Ramirez put 16 officers on the case to 
comb the area. They turned up a shoemaker who had seen a woman matching 
Aldrete's description. Then, at a supermarket, the police spotted a man trying 
to buy large quantities of groceries with American dollars. 
</P>
<P>
They followed him to an apartment on Rio Sena Street. By the end of the week, 
they knew that De Leon had been the man buying groceries and that Constanzo was 
inside. They surrounded the building and waited for the traffic to thin out 
before making a move. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tossed Gold Coins 
</P>
<P>
Again, fate played a role. A black Chrysler New Yorker pulled up to the 
apartment building. When police walked over to investigate, Constanzo saw them 
from his apartment window. He opened fire. During the gun battle that followed, 
Constanzo heaved gold coins out the window, while inside, huge sums of paper 
money burned on the stove. 
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out lasted 45 minutes before Constanzo ordered his own execution and 
that of his lover, Martin Quintana. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he wanted to be killed, that everything was finished," said Aldrete. 
"He said, 'Let's all die.' But I didn't want to die." 
</P>
<P>
While police mounted the stairs toward the smoke-filled apartment, De Leon did 
as he had always done: He obeyed Constanzo. He shot both men. And Aldrete ran 
from the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"Sara ran out the door screaming," Ponce said. "She screamed: 'He's dead! They 
killed him! He's dead!' "

SLAYING CHARGES AGAINST DEPUTY DROPPED; 
</P>
<P>
NEW TESTS FAIL TO LINK HIS GUN TO MURDERS OF 3 L.A. PROSTITUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Murder charges were dismissed Monday against Rickey Ross, a veteran Los Angeles 
County sheriff's narcotics investigator who had been accused of slaying three 
South-Central prostitutes with his service handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said original ballistics tests linking Ross to the slayings had 
been proven wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The reversal appeared to be a major embarrassment for the Los Angeles Police 
Department, which had arrested Ross after its forensics tests purportedly 
linked Ross' handgun to three in a series of unsolved prostitute slayings. 
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and Sheriff Sherman Block had stood together at a 
press conference in February to announce the startling arrest, which they 
described as a "devastating" blow to the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Elva R. Soper, acting on a prosecution request, formally 
dismissed the three first-degree murder counts against Ross. He faced the death 
penalty if convicted. Prosecutors said Ross remains a "suspect." 
</P>
<P>
"The people hereby move to dismiss the complaint against Rickey Ross," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. William Hodgman told the judge. "We so move because the LAPD 
forensics experts have re-examined the evidence and no longer can be certain" 
that Ross' gun fired the shots. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, 40, an 18-year veteran of the department, was not in court when the 
charges were dismissed. He broke down sobbing and repeatedly said "Praise the 
Lord!" and "Thank God!" when told of his impending release, according to Don 
Ingwersen, Ross' court-appointed investigator. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously," Ingwersen said, "he was in a state of shock. He was just 
emotionally drained." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the afternoon, Ross was released from Los Angeles County Jail where he 
had been held for 81 days. He said nothing to a throng of reporters as he left 
the jail and was driven away in a private automobile to join his wife at an 
undetermined location. 
</P>
<P>
Since his arrest, Ross has been dismissed from the department. Sheriff's 
officials would not respond Monday when asked whether Ross would be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who had built a virtually unblemished record as an undercover narcotics 
investigator and who was described by friends and colleagues as a highly 
religious man, had protested his innocence since his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of his highly publicized arrest, Ross' acquaintances had been 
at a loss to explain his seeming transformation from Bible study leader to 
accused murderer. Some had focused on apparent behavioral changes -- dropping 
out of his Bible class, for example, and breaking off contact with some old 
friends -- as they groped to understand his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Ross had been stopped in South-Central Los Angeles in the early morning of Feb. 
23 on what was described as a routine traffic check. The deputy was seated next 
to a prostitute and he drove erratically away from the curb as officers 
approached the car, police said then. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his arrest, Gates said there was evidence that Ross and the 
woman were smoking cocaine. No drugs, however, were found in his system. 
</P>
<P>
Hodgman explained Monday that Ross' fingerprints were found on a Pepsi can that 
had been used as a crack pipe and was tossed out of one of the car's windows. 
No drug charges will be filed against Ross, he said.. 
</P>
<P>
Police found Ross' 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol in the trunk of his 
county-owned undercover car. 
</P>
<P>
The first firearms tests of the gun were performed by four Los Angeles police 
experts, all of whom said there was a match -- a "make" -- between the gun 
confiscated from Ross' car trunk and the three slugs and a shell casing found 
at the murder sites of Judith Simpson, 27; Cynthia Walker, 35, and Latanya 
Johnson, 24. 
</P>
<P>
After the arrest, a Los Angeles police officer expressed total confidence to 
news reporters that Ross was their man. "We wouldn't put an active-duty 
sheriff's deputy in jail for homicide on an 'iffy make,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday, Hodgman said: "I think we can in all honesty say that is not the 
gun." 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. William Booth, the Police Department's spokesman, said the agency intends 
to continue to investigate Ross as a possible murder suspect and will continue 
ballistic testing of the weapon recovered from Ross' trunk. The LAPD alone was 
equivocal on the accuracy of its ballistics tests. 
</P>
<P>
"The gun has not been ruled in with 100% certainty," Booth said, "and it hasn't 
been ruled out with any degree of certainty." 
</P>
<P>
While he would not concede that the LAPD had erred, Booth acknowledged that 
officials had launched an internal administrative review to determine why the 
department's experts had linked Ross' gun to the murders when examinations by 
other experts could not. 
</P>
<P>
"We all agree, all of experts agree now . . . that the original conclusions 
should have been inconclusive," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent firearms tests by defense expert Charles Morton of Oakland had 
concluded that the slugs were not fired by Ross' weapon. Morton had been 
retained by Ross' counsel, a routine step in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Morton was testing, the prosecutor and co-defense counsel Guy O'Brien 
agreed to a third firearms examination. They selected Al Biasotti of the 
California Department of Justice and John Murdock of the Contra Costa County 
Sheriff's Department who, in Hodgman's words, are "among the best in the West." 
</P>
<P>
Biasotti and Murdock spent 2 1/2 days last week conducting new ballistics 
tests. Their conclusion: The three slugs were all fired from the same gun -- 
but not the one found in Ross' trunk. 
</P>
<P>
"It broke the tie," Hodgman said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, a meeting was held between prosecutors and co-defense 
counsel Jay Jaffe, Los Angeles police firearms experts and investigators, where 
the facts were laid out. Over the weekend, LAPD firearms experts re-conducted 
their tests and backed off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Never Killed Anyone' 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Ross issued his first public statement from his jail cell, 
declaring: "I have never killed anyone. . . . The gun found in the trunk of the 
car was a gun purchased by me, registered to me, and used in the performance of 
my duty as a deputy sheriff for over 15 years. Is it logical that if I were 
killing people, I would use a gun registered to me?" 
</P>
<P>
Ross said he put the gun in the car trunk after he was issued a new weapon and, 
after several months, it became water damaged and rusted. 
</P>
<P>
"By LAPD's own admission," Ross said, "the gun had to be forced open to be 
test-fired." 
</P>
<P>
Ross said he was elsewhere when the killings occurred. "My whereabouts can be 
documented and testified to by witnesses," he wrote, but gave no specifics. He 
did not say what he was doing with the prostitute when stopped Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why her husband was arrested in the company of a prostitute, Ross' 
wife, Sylvia, said Monday: "That's his job. He works with prostitutes. He works 
with everybody." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and some of his top lieutenants met with Los 
Angeles police and their ballistics experts. The decision to dismiss the 
charges, according to one participant in the meeting, was not unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was agreed that we have no choice," the participant added. 
</P>
<P>
Hodgman told reporters that Ross was "still a suspect." After all, he said, 
Ross was "found in a kill zone with a 'strawberry' under suspicious 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"Even now he's the only one (suspect), but it now becomes an open 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that further investigation "may very well result that we can 
dismiss him as a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
But he denied that the arrest was made too hastily. 
</P>
<P>
"No, the arrest was proper," Hodgman said. "I don't think everyone moved too 
quickly at all." 
</P>
<P>
But, referring to Los Angeles Police Department ballistics, he added, "I think 
they're going to re-evaluate their practices." 
</P>
<P>
Ross' attorney had stern words on what the dismissal of charges meant. 
</P>
<P>
"I have said in the past that the appearance of guilt and the fact of guilt are 
two very different things," Jaffe said, "and what this teaches us is that you 
can't rush to judgment on a limited set of facts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing that the dismissal is coming now, rather than a year or 
years down the road. You can just imagine if the defendant is convicted on this 
type of evidence, not to mention if he was executed. What remedy would he 
have?" 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said all along that the gun was the key evidence against Ross. 
There was no blood, saliva, semen or other bodily fluids tests linking Ross to 
any of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Ross' arrest came amid a series of unsolved slayings in the area of as many as 
a dozen "strawberries" -- women who trade sex for drugs -- since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very sad day for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department," 
a grim-faced Block said at the time, standing beside Gates as the arrest was 
announced to media. 
</P>
<P>
Block was out of town Monday and not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from some members of the Sheriff's Department who worked with Ross was 
one of shock that the LAPD could have made such a key mistake in a case that 
was so sensitive in terms of interdepartmental relations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to believe that this has happened," one department official said. 
"I said from the beginning that I hoped they had their (act) together on this. 
It's obvious they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's official added, however, that he sees no permanent damage to 
relations between the two departments. 
</P>
<P>
"It just points out that human beings are human beings and mistakes can be 
made," he said. "If this was an error, I'm confident it was in good faith. 
Realistically, as policemen, these things happen from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
Another senior sheriff's official, who also requested anonymity, said that the 
LAPD's handling of the Ross case from the beginning will make the Sheriff's 
Department reluctant to put its full trust in the LAPD in any similar case in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
"They should do some internal investigation on this," the official said. "I 
think there are 4,000 unanswered questions here. We were led to believe there 
wasn't a shadow of a doubt in the world that those ballistics matched. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a feeling that we take enough heat already and that it's 
terrible this had to happen from another police department. This is one of our 
family. Nobody's perfect, but if you see any of our people accused again, you 
can bet we will want our own experts in there, too." 
</P>
<P>
Even the district attorney's office said it will undertake a review to make 
sure the same problem does not arise again. Sterling E. Norris, the prosecutor 
in charge of special trials, said the district attorney's office needs to 
consider having "our own experts or contracted experts" to perform firearms 
tests in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to have an independent way to verify (firearms) results," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ballistics test conducted by Los Angeles police in the Ross case, Norris 
said, "was an aberration we want to ensure doesn't happen again."

TEACHERS' STRIKE CRIPPLES SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
STUDENTS LEAVE AMID CONFUSION; SOME LEADERS SEE HOPE FOR ACCORD

A teachers' strike crippled the Los Angeles Unified School District Monday, 
with about two-thirds of its 32,000 teachers on picket lines and hundreds of 
thousands of students deserting campuses in an atmosphere of high emotion and 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
However, leaders of both sides in the labor dispute met for several hours 
Monday and reported some hope for a settlement, possibly within a few days. The 
teachers' last strike was for 23 days in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
School board President Roberta Weintraub, emerging shortly before 9 p.m. Monday 
from a 6 1/2-hour closed-door meeting of the board, announced: "We are working 
diligently to resolve this crisis." She said pay remains "the sticking point," 
but refused to offer any details of the board meeting or of talks with the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
The other six board members rushed out of the office of board attorneys on 
Bunker Hill and did not talk to reporters. Weintraub described the meeting as 
heated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Positive' Discussions 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview at his house shortly afterward, United Teachers-Los 
Angeles President Wayne Johnson described his discussions with the district as 
"positive." But he also declined to offer specifics. 
</P>
<P>
Others remained more wary because the school board remained divided on making 
spending cuts in other areas to finance a new pay offer to teachers. They also 
were uncertain of how much extra state money the district could receive in the 
revised state budget Gov. George Deukmejian is expected to announce later this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers' union claimed that about 25,000 of the district's 32,000 
teachers, librarians, counselors and nurses refused to work Monday; the 
district said about 21,000 teachers stayed out. At some schools, as little as 
10% of the faculty showed up as administrators and substitutes struggled to 
keep some educational program going, sometimes reduced to showing videotape 
cartoon shows starring Daffy Duck. 
</P>
<P>
"Given today's experience, it would be very difficult to keep the schools going 
for an extended period of time," Weintraub conceded. 
</P>
<P>
But she and other officials stressed that schools would be open today. As if to 
emphasize that point, the board raised the daily pay of substitutes to $165, up 
from $137, which itself was $39 more than usual. 
</P>
<P>
According to the district, morning taking of attendance found that about 
430,000 of the 590,000 students were in school. But, that quickly plummeted 
during the day as many junior and senior high schoolers simply walked off 
campus, heading for home, parks, video arcades and beaches. At some high 
schools, there were rowdy demonstrations by students. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is leaving," said Kelly Freeman, a 16-year-old Crenshaw High School 
junior said. "All we are doing is sitting in the classroom and doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Wesley Mitchell, chief of the district police, said he would not try to snag 
truants in the 700-square-mile school district, which has the second-largest 
number of students in the nation after New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a problem of such magnitude that it's beyond our resources," he said, 
adding that courts probably would not force parents to send children to the 
strikebound schools and that police cannot sort out which youngsters are out of 
school with parental permission and which are not. Besides, attendance 
counselors who help with truant students were given teaching assignments. 
</P>
<P>
City and school police said there were some verbal confrontations between 
strikers and teachers who went to work. There were no arrests and no reports of 
violence directly related to the strike, although the union said a couple of 
fistfights occurred. Mitchell said he was pleased about the relative lack of 
trouble, "especially given the numbers of people involved and the strong 
convictions on the issues." 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, vandals poured glue in door locks at Birmingham High and 
Nightingale Junior High, but maintenance crews were fixing that, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Schedules Cut Back 
</P>
<P>
Most junior and senior high schools cut back on class schedules, sending large 
groups of students to cafeterias and auditoriums to watch educational films and 
videos. At elementary schools, parents pitched in to supervise the youngsters 
in crafts and games. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred seventh- and eighth-grade students at Reed Junior High School 
in North Hollywood ran from a school auditorium where they had been gathered, 
after they started chanting and throwing paper at the handful of volunteer 
supervisors. Only nine regular teachers and five substitutes, compared to a 
normal staff of 65, were working at Reed, which has a normal enrollment of 
about 1,500 students. By 10 a.m., at least a third of those students had left 
the campus and many others followed later. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't come back if it's going to be like this," Jake Campbell, a seventh 
grader, said outside the Reed auditorium where about 75 students remained to 
watch Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
Union spokeswoman Carey said the district needs to cling to its morning 
enrollment figures because those will be used in state formulas for funding. 
</P>
<P>
Picketing began at 2 a.m. at harbor area warehouses of food and supplies for 
the schools. At 7 a.m., circling lines of placard-carrying teachers marched in 
front of many of the 600 school sites in the district. UTLA President Johnson 
joined the picketers at Hamilton High, where he had taught for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the morning, strikers converged at eight rallies in parks around the 
district. At South Gate Park, UTLA Vice President Frances Haywood told the 
gathering: "We're going to get what we are asking for. We finally sent the 
message to L.A. Unified that teachers are not tall children." 
</P>
<P>
Picketing then resumed at schools until about 4 p.m. and is scheduled to start 
again today at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
On the picket line at Carpenter Avenue Elementary School in Studio City, school 
psychologist Scott Maiman, who has worked in the district for 10 years, said 
the strike will be "tough on the kids and tough on the teachers and parents and 
everybody involved." But he insisted: "I'll be out until we get a fair 
contract. You have to fight for what you believe in." 
</P>
<P>
At Eagle Rock Junior-Senior High, photography teacher and union chairman Ellis 
Kaufman said that 90 of the school's 116 teachers were striking and that they 
were very angry at the ones who went to work. "There will be hostility, 
definitely. It may take 10 to 15 years for those wounds to heal," Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the auditorium, crafts teacher Richard Arpea said he respects what the 
strikers are doing and believes the school board is wrong on many issues. But 
he said he feels compelled to work. "I'm here for the kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Osbaldeston, a Hamilton High School art teacher, said he had no trouble 
crossing the picket line there. "I just drove into the parking lot and walked 
into the school building," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, attorneys for the teachers' union filed a motion for an emergency 
injunction from the state Court of Appeal, asking that it suspend district 
Supt. Leonard Britton's order that teachers must hand in grades by today or 
face withholding of last month's pay. The state Appeals Court did not rule on 
the request Monday. In February, a Superior Court judge ruled on a similar 
order that the matter should be reviewed by the state Public Employment 
Relations Board, not the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The union charges that Britton's order forced it to move its strike date up 
from May 30 to Monday. But the new date could put the union in legal jeopardy 
because a state fact-finder's report on the contract is due on Wednesday and 
courts in some cases have ruled that strikes should not begin before such 
reports are finished. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in Los Angeles Monday, Deukmejian, after a speech to the Japan-American 
Conference of Mayors, refused to comment on how much additional state revenue, 
if any, will be made available to the Los Angeles district when he releases 
updated state budget revenue and expenditure figures later this week. 
</P>
<P>
This year, bank and corporate income tax receipts are significantly higher than 
the estimates Deukmejian used in preparing his initial budget, which he 
released in January. Although preliminary estimates put tax receipts at least 
$700 million higher than budget estimates, costs of health, welfare and prison 
programs are also rising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Governor's Preference 
</P>
<P>
The governor said months ago that he would prefer to spend extra revenue for 
schools to reduce classroom overcrowding rather than give it to local school 
districts for such things as teacher salaries. Kevin Brett, the governor's 
press secretary, said statements by local legislators that the Los Angeles 
school district could get as much as $34 million of the new money are 
"premature." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Los Angeles district teachers annually earn from $23,440 in 
beginning salary to $43,319 to those with doctorates, 98 extra course units and 
19 years experience. 
</P>
<P>
In debates before the strike, only three of the board's seven members -- Julie 
Korenstein, Warren Furutani and Jackie Goldberg -- supported increasing the 
district's salary offer of 21.5% over three years. Another three -- Rita 
Walters, Leticia Quezada and Alan Gershman -- do not support the district's 
current offer, which would require about $80 million in budget cuts next year 
and another $40 million in cuts the following year. 
</P>
<P>
But Weintraub said that she would not be willing to make deeper cuts to support 
an increase over the district's current offer without final word on the state 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
The union is pushing for a 10% retroactive raise this year, between 5.5% and 9% 
in the upcoming year, depending on state surpluses, and 8% the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Other issues include eliminating yard duty for teachers and increasing their 
membership on governing councils which will decide many policies at individual 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Striking teachers, who are not receiving pay for the past month because they 
refused to hand in student grades, may find their finances pushing them back to 
work soon, Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
As officials huddled, the first day of the strike was an emotional one for 
teachers, students and parents around the district. 
</P>
<P>
At Castelar Street School in Chinatown, attendance was down by 200 students -- 
about 10 times the normal, Principal William Chun Hoon said. Twenty-three of 
the school's 33 teachers honored the strike, although not all walked the picket 
line. Several parent volunteers helped out. 
</P>
<P>
Outside on Yale Street, some parents stopped to talk to picketing teachers.

"Why can't teachers get the money they want?" said the mother of a third 
grader, sounding exasperated. To her daughter she said, "I'm going to send you 
(to class) but I'm going to come back later." She said if it looked as though 
no instruction was going on, she would take her child home.

At Carpenter Avenue Elementary School in Studio City, anxious parents remained 
on the school grounds with their children until school started, waiting to see 
how many teachers would show up.

"I'm on the verge of tears," said Mary Ett Brown, holding her daughter, a 
Carpenter school first-grader.

On Lexington Avenue in mid-Manhattan, hundreds of students sat blocking traffic 
one day early this month while others occupied buildings on 15 campuses 
throughout the state in 1960s-style protests against proposed tuition 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
In Elizabeth, N.J., the mayor's house was pelted with eggs and his car stolen 
last month after he laid off 225 city employees, over half of whom were police 
and firefighters. Unless cuts in state aid are restored, Mayor Thomas G. Dunn 
expects more layoffs at the end of this month and said he may have to consider 
declaring the city bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis appears to need nothing short of a Massachusetts 
miracle to salvage his popularity, which is at an all-time low as he squabbles 
with his Legislature over how to close a gaping deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Through six years of intoxicating double-digit economic growth that was the 
envy of the rest of the nation, governors and legislators of the Northeast 
lived it up. They spent lavishly on all sorts of necessities they had long 
neglected, as well as ambitious new programs. And they still had enough money 
left over to slash taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the horn of plenty here," said Rep. Jack Flood, chairman of the 
Massachusetts House Taxation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the party is over, and the region's politicians are waking up with a 
mighty fiscal hangover. Tax receipts are down sharply, but voters are still 
demanding all the services they came to enjoy over the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
With extra money around, "you establish programs that develop constituencies 
who see these programs as absolutely essential," said Rep. Donna P. Sytek, 
chairwoman of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Those are usually the first to be trimmed. "It's been terrible," Sytek said. 
"We had hundreds of people -- thousands -- turn up at budget hearings. People 
came out in numbers I had never seen before." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the states in the region are feeling the pinch. Maine and Vermont still 
seem to be in relatively good shape. 
</P>
<P>
The other states, in some sense, are victims of their own successes. Although 
most are close to full employment, they have continued to base their plans on 
projections that growth would continue at the rapid pace of the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential 'Almost Nil' 
</P>
<P>
"When your state economies have been as robust as these have been, your 
potential for growth is almost nil," said Marcia A. Howard, research director 
of the National Assn. of State Budget Officers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, many are blaming the unexpected effects of the 1986 changes in federal 
tax law. Among other things, the loopholes it closed were expected to increase 
corporate tax receipts. But revenues from business taxes dropped instead, and 
the Northeastern states, more dependent on business taxes than any other 
region, felt the loss the worst. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, see another reason for the sudden turnaround: They accuse 
their leaders of mismanagement, bad planning and outright deception. 
</P>
<P>
The bitterness runs so deep that in several states, governors who once enjoyed 
enormous popularity are drawing sharp fire from their own political party. 
</P>
<P>
Flood has accused fellow Democrat Dukakis of "lying," "stonewalling" and 
"conning" the people of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Touted Recovery in Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis made his state's economic recovery -- the "Massachusetts miracle" -- a 
focal point of his unsuccessful presidential campaign. He had locked up the 
Democratic nomination before it became clear that Massachusetts was staring at 
a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
With each passing month, the news in Massachusetts gets worse. April's tax 
collections were supposed to be up by 13.1%, but they fell 1% instead, giving 
the state a $250-million projected shortfall for the fiscal year ending June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
As Dukakis tries to push more than $600 million in new taxes through the 
Legislature, the lame-duck governor's credibility is plummeting in the face of 
accusations that he distorted the state's fiscal picture last year to further 
his presidential ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
"People are very, very angry that he didn't tell us the truth about the fiscal 
crisis," said Barbara Anderson, leader of the watchdog group Citizens for 
Limited Taxation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Picture Emerges 
</P>
<P>
On the campaign trail for George Bush last year, New Hampshire Gov. John H. 
Sununu lost few opportunities to point out the weak spots in the Massachusetts 
economy, and when he left office last January to become White House chief of 
staff, Sununu boasted in his farewell address that he had built a $10-million 
surplus. But only five hours later, when incoming Gov. Judd Gregg gave his 
inaugural address, the real picture became clear: That comfortable cushion had 
disappeared months before, and what the state was actually facing was a 
$13-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Only a year ago, New Jersey was taking in $600 million more than it was 
spending. Under Republican Gov. Thomas H. Kean, the state more than doubled 
spending on education, substantially increased Medicaid, began an expensive new 
welfare reform program, created a $40-million campaign against AIDS, while 
phasing out inheritance taxes and cutting a variety of business taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Now, even though Kean has proposed the smallest spending increase in two 
decades, the state faces a $498-million shortfall in its $12.1-billion proposed 
budget for next year. Kean is in a pitched election-year battle with his own 
party's lawmakers over a $350-million tax plan that he describes as reform and 
that they see as an increase. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the additional revenues would go to troubled cities such as Elizabeth, 
which requested $33 million in state aid and got only $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
"They've made me the scapegoat of this thing," Mayor Dunn said in an interview. 
He has bugged his own phone amid a stream of anonymous threats. One night, 
hundreds of shouting protesters, about half of them police and firefighters, 
gathered on his lawn shortly before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"The night I was held hostage in my home was the scariest night that I've had 
since World War II," Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut, which got three big tax cuts during the boom years, is also 
engaged in a heated battle over raising them again. Last January, it suddenly 
learned that it was running a $247-million deficit, and even after it passed a 
variety of new taxes in March to plug the hole, next year's deficit is 
projected at $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
New York legislators reached agreement on a $47-billion budget last month, 
struggling three weeks after their legal deadline to close a projected budget 
deficit of almost $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The new budget includes an additional $1 billion in higher fees and taxes, and 
will mean laying off state employees. The necessities of life -- from birth 
certificates to death certificates -- will cost more. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the budget also anticipated raising tuition at state universities by 
$200 a year, to $1,550. The move sparked 11 days of student protests that ended 
only after Gov. Mario M. Cuomo vetoed the tuition increases. But his veto still 
leaves university officials with the problem of how to come up with $45 
million.

Rescue aircraft, taking advantage of a break in a severe Arctic snowstorm, 
managed to land at the North Pole where eight explorers had been briefly 
stranded. The team, led by Robert Swan of Britain, reached the roof of the 
world after a 600-mile, 56-day journey. The rescue planes flew the explorers to 
their base at Eureka on Ellesmere Island on their way home. Because of poor 
weather conditions, the three Twin Otter aircraft had been unable to pick up 
the group as scheduled, and all of the team members suffered frostbite on their 
feet and faces. Members of the expedition, launched to draw attention to global 
pollution, planted a U.N. flag at the North Pole on Sunday, organizers of the 
Icewalk organization said.

The latest achievement test scores indicate that Los Angeles schools have not 
improved, but that those in the San Francisco Bay Area have, state Schools 
Supt. Bill Honig said. At a news conference in advance of Thursday's scheduled 
release of the California Assessment Program tests, Honig said the state's 
public schools generally are improving, but still do not come up to those in 
many other countries. "They smoke us on this," Honig said of other economically 
advanced nations. "We aren't going to quit until we are competitive." No test 
scores for individual school districts were released.

A Roman Catholic worker was shot to death in an apparent sectarian attack in 
Belfast, and the IRA's political wing said that one of its local offices was 
hit by a rocket. The killing, preceding this week's local elections in Northern 
Ireland, sparked fears of more sectarian shootings between militant Catholics 
and Protestant paramilitary groups. Sinn Fein, political wing of the outlawed 
Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to oust Britain from Northern Ireland, 
said no one was hurt by a RPG-7 rocket fired at one of its offices. Police said 
that if confirmed, it would be the first time Protestant militants had used 
rocket launchers.

A provision for creating a nonprofit consumer advocacy corporation to fight for 
"fair" automobile insurance rates was amended into pending legislation by 
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles). The proposal is a 
response to a recent state Supreme Court decision that upheld most of the 
voter-approved Proposition 103, but struck down a provision to create an 
organization which would represent the consumer in state insurance rate 
proceedings. Insurance companies would be required to inform their customers 
that they could become members of the consumer advocacy group, which would be 
funded by voluntary donations. Roberti said the amended bill could come up for 
a floor vote this week.

Prosecutors in the Oliver L. North case advised the court as soon as they found 
out one of their office secretaries was related to the jury foreman, James 
Wieghart, speaking for independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, said. Wieghart 
said the matter was brought to the attention of the U.S. District Court in 
Washington and North's attorneys "when we learned of the relationship from the 
secretary" at the end of North's trial. Denise Anderson, the jury foreman, said 
in an interview in People magazine that she bumped into her cousin Gertrude 
Griffin, but did not discuss the case with her and did not report the meeting 
or the relationship to the court. The jury convicted North, a former National 
Security Council aide, on three felony counts in the Iran-Contra affair.

Nine Royal Navy crew members were killed in a helicopter crash in Kenya, the 
British navy's worst peacetime air disaster, the British Defense Ministry said. 
The Westland Lynx, from the naval frigate Brilliant, crashed 280 miles 
southeast of Nairobi on Kenya's eastern coast, a defense spokesman said. The 
ship was headed to Mombasa for routine maintenance and a two-week leave for the 
crew after patrol in the Persian Gulf. Among the nine killed was Lt. Cmdr. 
Christopher Fessey, 36, a friend of Prince Andrew, the son of Queen Elizabeth

With a firm date for deployment of Arab League cease-fire observers in Lebanon 
still uncertain, diplomats said that hopes of lasting peace rest on next week's 
Arab League summit. Although league envoys, in a week of shuttle diplomacy 
between Beirut and Damascus, won agreement from all parties on a truce and the 
deployment of a 300-member Arab peacekeeping force, diplomats said the force 
can't move in because of continued shelling of Christian ports in Lebanon. "The 
last-ditch . . . chance is the summit," one diplomat said. "If they (Lebanon's 
warring parties) can't come to some meeting of minds, it is hard to see what 
can be done after that."

Two firms involved with creating problem-plagued Rancho Seco have agreed to 
operate the nuclear power plant jointly with the municipal utility that owns 
it, officials said. Sacramento Municipal Utility District officials said they 
would support the proposed 5 1/2-year contract with Bechtel, the plant's 
architect and engineer, and Babcock &amp; Wilcox, which built the reactor. The 
agreement, they said, would lead to greater plant efficiency and savings on 
customers' bills. But opponents maintain that the plant is unsafe and condemned 
the proposal as a political ploy. Voters will be asked June 6 whether the 
district should shut down the 913-megawatt plant.

ON CALIFORNIA: BERKELEY: HOUSING KETTLE AT FULL BOIL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were cruising Berkeley neighborhoods, putting price tags on houses. Marty 
Schiffenbauer pointed to a redwood bungalow of classic Berkeley design. Nice 
house, said Schiffenbauer, probably five fifty. We turned the corner and stared 
at a two-story stucco, circa 1900. Six, he said. Maybe seven. 
</P>
<P>
We've all played this game. Trolling the streets of a neighborhood that has 
captured our attention, wondering about the price of admission. We make 
guesses, tossing off numbers so big they are foreign to the rest of our lives. 
They are numbers that have utility only in this strange game, and they leave a 
residue of uneasiness. 
</P>
<P>
Schiffenbauer knows this game, albeit indirectly. He has lived in Berkeley for 
20 years and watched his college town transform itself into a community of 
property-obsessed burghers. Professors and lawyers whose shingled houses now 
return them more wealth than their professions. Either you have property and 
now regard yourself as a member of the landed class, or you don't. Either you 
can handle the numbers, or you can't. 
</P>
<P>
It is those who can't that intrigue Schiffenbauer. That vast fraternity of 
escrow virgins now consigned, more or less permanently, to a lesser social 
class. Their lack of a strong equity position affects their friendships, their 
marriage potential, and no amount of other personal accomplishments can rescue 
them. They can either remain landless in Berkeley, living with their real 
estate anger, or emigrate to Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
This would be an old story in California, except that Schiffenbauer is not like 
most of us. A shaggy gnome of a man, an old radical whose type has become an 
endangered species outside of Berkeley, Schiffenbauer more or less founded the 
rent control movement here a decade ago. Along with Santa Monica, Berkeley now 
has one of the strictest rent control laws in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
So when Schiffenbauer went running with a friend one morning, the two began 
talking about house prices and the disenfranchised. The situation was driving 
out the minorities and the old, just like the high rents back in the 1970s, 
Schiffenbauer said. He wondered if he should organize a new initiative to limit 
house prices. 
</P>
<P>
Good idea, his friend said. 
</P>
<P>
Then I'll do it, Schiffenbauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few days he had designed an initiative that would restrict price 
increases of Berkeley houses to the national average. Last year the national 
average was 6%; the increase in Berkeley, 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Now most likely you are thinking the same as everyone else when they first hear 
this idea. You think it's illegal. No city would pass such a law, and if it did 
the courts would knock it down. 
</P>
<P>
But consider two points: First, this proposal would be offered as an 
initiative, and in Berkeley the homeowners comprise only one-third of the 
voting population. Two-thirds are renters, most of them filled to some degree 
with real estate anger. 
</P>
<P>
Second, no less than the dean of the Berkeley law school says a limitation on 
house prices just might pass muster in the courts. After all, such a law would 
have the goal of maintaining the ethnic and economic diversity in Berkeley's 
population. That is the same goal espoused by the city's rent control law, 
which was approved by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly, the experts say, the courts would insist that price limitations not be 
so harsh as to deprive owners of a reasonable profit. Schiffenbauer thinks his 
plan would pass this test easily, since his law would put Berkeley on a par 
with other cities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the courts would kick it out, maybe not. What's more intriguing is the 
question of whether we are seeing the beginning of a long struggle over houses. 
When only 10% of the population can afford a house -- as is now the case -- is 
it reasonable to think the remaining 90% will tolerate that situation forever? 
What happens when those numbers go to 95%-5%, then 98%-2%? 
</P>
<P>
Even now Berkeley is showing us what that struggle might be like. In his 
hometown, Schiffenbauer has become a pariah. Damning letters pour in every day 
to the local newspapers, and even Schiffenbauer's old left-wing buddies in city 
politics -- most of them now Berkeley homeowners -- have denounced him in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
The hate is worse than anything that happened during the old rent control days, 
Schiffenbauer says. He has started thinking of himself as the Salman Rushdie of 
Berkeley, ostracized because he has threatened something as precious as 
religion. Salvation through real estate. 
</P>
<P>
And like religious struggles, this one promises its own special ugliness. When 
he went home the other day Schiffenbauer had two messages on his answering 
machine. "You are scum," said one. "Schwein hund," said the other.

FIRST INDICTMENT DUE IN FBI CAPITOL STING 
</P>

<P>
The first indictment of a legislator growing out of a three-year federal 
investigation of political corruption in the Capitol is expected soon -- most 
likely in the next week or two, several sources familiar with the probe have 
told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Almost nine months after FBI agents raided Capitol offices on Aug. 24, scrutiny 
of one lawmaker, Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), has become particularly 
intense, these sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, a federal grand jury subpoenaed legislative committee records 
on at least four bills, including two authored by Montoya and two others that 
went through committees on which he served. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, prosecutors also formally warned a former Montoya aide, 
Amiel A. Jaramillo, that he was a target of the ongoing federal grand jury 
investigation, according to Jaramillo's attorney, Christopher H. Wing. The 
warning came in a letter inviting Jaramillo to testify voluntarily before the 
grand jury -- a request that Wing declined. 
</P>
<P>
The letter meant that Jaramillo was "somebody who at this stage they (grand 
jury members) feel they are looking at as a suspect," Wing said Monday, "but it 
doesn't mean ultimately he ends up being indicted." 
</P>
<P>
Wing said that the fate of Jaramillo, now an attorney in private practice, is 
tied to that of his former boss. "If Montoya gets hammered, my client will as 
well," Wing said. 
</P>
<P>
There are other signs that Montoya has been the subject of much of the grand 
jury's attention. A number of present and former Montoya aides have testified 
before the grand jury in the last several weeks, according to Montoya's 
attorney, Michael S. Sands. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in March, prosecutors obtained a warrant to search the offices of a 
Capitol lobbying firm, Governmental Advocates. Agents were interested in a 
series of bills either authored by Montoya or which went to the Senate Business 
and Professions Committee, which he chairs. To obtain the warrant -- which 
allowed investigators to keep the premises secure during a lengthy search -- 
prosecutors first had to convince a federal judge that they were likely to find 
evidence of violations of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy statutes. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya has repeatedly asserted his innocence of any wrongdoing and referred 
questions about the investigation to his attorney Sands. Sands said the 
slowness of the investigation may be because prosecutors are having trouble 
assembling a case. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. David F. Levi refused to comment on when or if he would ask the 
federal grand jury for indictments growing out of the undercover sting 
operation, called Brispec (for Bribery -- Special Interest). 
</P>
<P>
In the sting, FBI agents posing as businessmen sought help from legislators and 
legislative aides for special-interest bills that would supposedly help them 
set up a shrimp processing plant near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Since the sting came to light last summer, there has been increasing criticism 
of Levi by some legislators and defense attorneys. If he has evidence of 
criminal conduct among legislators, then he should have filed charges long ago, 
they argue. 
</P>
<P>
There is even some sentiment within the FBI's Sacramento office that the 
investigation of possible legislative misconduct has gone on far too long -- 
that Levi had enough evidence to begin taking cases to the grand jury several 
months ago, according to federal sources. 
</P>
<P>
However, Levi has a reputation as a cautious and painstaking taskmaster, 
someone willing to withstand the pressure to move ahead until he is satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'There Is a Tension' 
</P>
<P>
"In all cases, particularly long-term investigations of this nature, there is a 
tension between the U.S. attorney's office and FBI management," said one U.S. 
Justice Department official. The U.S. attorney "has a natural hesitancy to 
indict" until all the evidence is in hand; the FBI "has a natural desire to 
move on to something else." 
</P>
<P>
In recent days the internal FBI criticism has subsided, just as the 
investigation appeared to be quickening. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya was one of four legislators whose offices were raided last August. The 
others were Assembly members Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), Frank Hill (R-Whittier), 
and Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles). State Board of Equalization member Paul 
Carpenter, a former Democratic senator from Cypress, has also been identified 
as a target of the federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya has been the subject of the latest flurry of FBI activity. Last week, 
agents delivered grand jury subpoenas in the Capitol requesting records of at 
least four different bills, each with some connection to the Whittier Democrat: 
</P>
<P>
* A 1981 special-interest bill, authored by Montoya, exempting the proposed 
Bell Mar land development in the Malibu area from review under the state 
Coastal Act. 
</P>
<P>
* A 1987 measure by Assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton) that changed the 
rules governing personnel agencies, exempting certain job-listing services from 
state licensing. The bill was approved by the Senate Business and Professions 
Committee, which is chaired by Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
* A 1988 bill by Montoya that would have given authority over local recycling 
programs to the California Waste Management Board, rather than the Department 
of Conservation, which oversees implementation of the state bottle recycling 
program. The bill, which was opposed by conservation groups, was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
* A 1986 bill carried by Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) for the Recording 
Industry Assn. of America, which affected the terms of individual recording 
contracts. Montoya served on the Senate Industrial Relations Committee and 
voted to approve the measure, which was vetoed by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Only two indictments have been filed so far as a result of the corruption 
probe. Both are spin-offs of the sting and not directly related to it. In 
January, the grand jury charged Yolo County Sheriff Rod Graham with extortion, 
bribery and conspiracy in collecting $3,650 in campaign contributions from an 
FBI informant who was cooperating in the Capitol corruption probe. Graham's 
former top deputy, Wendell Luttrull, has pleaded guilty to extortion charges.

PANEL VOTES COMPROMISE ON ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

A Senate-Assembly conference committee Monday ratified a compromise with Gov. 
George Deukmejian on legislation to outlaw military-style assault weapons, 
clearing the way for expected final approval of the bill by the Legislature on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
All five Democratic members of the committee voted for the compromise. The only 
Republican member, Sen. Edward R. Royce of Anaheim, cast the only dissent as 
the conference report was sent to each house. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, clearly weighted in favor of legislators who oppose assault 
firearms, heard about an hour of testimony from witnesses on both sides before 
approving the compromise, which Deukmejian had insisted upon as his price for 
signing the proposed ban into law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
List of 60 Weapons 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the legislation by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) and 
Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) would make it against the law on 
Jan. 1 to manufacture, sell, import, lend, advertise, give or distribute about 
60 firearms classified as assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of such guns that were legally obtained before June 1 could keep them by 
registering them with the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the owner of a legally acquired assault weapon failed to properly 
register it, he or she could be subject to a fine of $350 to $500 on the first 
offense. Others in possession of such an illegal arm could be charged with 
either a misdemeanor or felony. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said subjecting an otherwise law-abiding assault gun owner to a 
possible felony charge would be too harsh if the owner merely neglected or 
refused to register the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The second major provision of the compromise is aimed at ridding from the 
marketplace facsimile assault arms that are so close to being the real thing 
that they constitute an assault weapon. It would be up to the state attorney 
general to persuade a Superior Court judge that such was the case before the 
facsimile could be added to the list of banned guns. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to adopt the compromise easily, but the vote is certain 
to be much tighter in the Assembly, which previously approved assault gun 
legislation without a vote to spare. Roos said he is "confident" he can keep 
all his favorable votes in line, but Republican Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy of 
Monrovia said efforts are under way to peel away at least one of the two GOP 
members who support the ban.

1 LOCOMOTIVE'S BRAKES WERE DISCONNECTED 
</P>

Four days before a Southern Pacific freight train derailed and slammed into 
seven homes here, the brakes on one of its rear locomotives were disconnected, 
authorities investigating the crash said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the significance of the find was not immediately clear, authorities 
with the National Transportation Safety Board said it could be key, 
particularly if those handling the train believed all their brakes were 
operable. 
</P>
<P>
"The dynamic brakes on one engine were tagged on May 8, meaning they were cut 
out," said NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz. "Why, we don't know. But if the 
crew up front didn't know about it, then that may have been a problem." 
</P>
<P>
In another development on the third day of the NTSB's investigation of the 
devastating wreck, officials said the 69-car freight may not have been weighed 
before it left Mojave with its load of sal soda or trona -- a sand-like 
material that was mined at Owens Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cargo list specifies that 60 tons of material were placed in each 
car when they were loaded in Rosamond, Lopatkiewicz said that "we do not have 
any information yet that suggests this load was ever weighed." 
</P>
<P>
When asked how railroad officials could fill out a cargo list without weighing 
the material first, Lopatkiewicz said, "That's what we want to find out." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, families who were evacuated from 29 homes near the Duffy Street 
crash site after concerns about a gasoline line buried by the rail cars were 
expected to return home late Monday. Fire officials cleared the area Saturday 
because of fears that the 14-inch line might be punctured by machinery dragging 
the mangled rail cars away. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the families were put up in hotels by Southern Pacific officials, who 
have offered to buy the demolished homes and help the displaced residents 
rebuild or relocate. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the worst derailments investigated by the NTSB, the runaway train 
barreled down the 4,200-foot Cajon Pass, plunged off a 30-foot flood levee and 
crumpled a row of homes in a working-class section of town as residents were 
getting ready for work Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the wreck were two trainmen -- the conductor and a brakeman -- and 
two children whose home was crushed by a pile of steel hopper cars. Damage was 
estimated at more than $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the path of devastation left by the Long Beach-bound freight, the 
neighborhood's mood brightened late Friday as one man buried beneath a towering 
pile of rubble was plucked to safety after a 14-hour effort. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Shaw, 24, was transferred out of the intensive care unit at San 
Bernardino County Medical Center on Monday and is fair condition with two 
broken legs and a spinal fracture. Firefighters said he drew air from a pocket 
created by rafters that protected him from the weight of the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are expected to continue prowling the train's remains and 
interviewing crew members until the end of the week. Then, they will analyze 
the data and decide whether to hold a hearing to subpoena witnesses and solicit 
public input, Lopatkiewicz said. 
</P>
<P>
Although no conclusions have been drawn about how the freight became a runaway, 
evidence collected so far points to the possibility that the train was heavier 
than its crew believed and suffered some degree of brake failure. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific workers interviewed by the NTSB have told investigators that 
at least some of the train's open-air hopper cars were full to the brim, 
meaning they carried 100 tons of material, not including the 30-ton weight of 
the rail car. That figure conflicts with the cargo list, which says each car 
carried just 60 tons of sal soda. 
</P>
<P>
If the cargo list weight is correct, the train should have had no problem 
making its way down the grade under normal braking power. Its listed weight of 
6,151 tons was below that carried by most of the 103 other freights that came 
down the track between Jan. 1 and May 10, NTSB officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But if the weight was greater than the crew believed, problems would not be 
unusual. Knowledge of weight bears directly on how an engineer manages the 
braking system, a factor of particular concern on a long, steep grade like the 
Cajon Pass, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the rear dynamic brakes that were disconnected days before the 
crash, NTSB investigators say, the switch controlling a separate rear engine 
was in "isolation" and thus was not providing brake power. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew from the event recorder that there was no amperage coming from that 
engine," Lopatkiewicz said. "Finding the switch in the cab in isolation is 
consistent with that. We just don't know why the switch was in that position or 
how long it had been there." 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB also revealed that the engineer and the brakeman were previously cited 
for safety violations related to excessive speed and failure to properly 
connect brake lines between locomotives. But Lopatkiewicz cautioned that it is 
not uncommon for veteran trainmen to have violations on their record. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific officials have declined to comment on any aspect of the 
investigation. On Monday, spokesman Jim Loveland in San Francisco would say 
only that the busy line carrying the runaway train was built in 1967 to allow 
trains to bypass the congested San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Loveland said the route, known as the Palmdale Cutoff, carries about 15 trains 
a day and is inspected weekly.

All of the nearly 1,400 military dependents sponsored by the U.S. Southern 
Command and living off base in Panama have moved onto U.S. installations as 
ordered by President Bush, the Pentagon said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored dependents are those whose expenses are paid by the Pentagon. Another 
1,685 "non-sponsored" military dependents -- those who paid their own way to 
Panama to be with their spouses -- live off base. They have the option of 
remaining in their homes or moving onto the bases. 
</P>
<P>
After Panama's disputed election and violence last week, Bush ordered the 
military dependents to move to secure housing and dispatched nearly 1,900 Army 
troops and Marines to Panama to reinforce U.S. military personnel already there 
</P>
<P>
Most of the troops had arrived as of Sunday, said a Pentagon spokeswoman, Army 
Maj. Kathy Wood. Wood said these included 150 Marines from the 2nd Marine 
Expeditionary Force from Camp Lejeune, N.C., and 990 soldiers from the Army's 
7th Light Infantry Division at Ft. Ord, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Another 726 soldiers from the Army's 5th Infantry Division at Ft. Polk, La., 
are to arrive this week.

PERONISTS NOW MUST FACE ARGENTINA'S ECONOMIC ILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The party created by Juan D. Peron in the mid-1940s, which won every Argentine 
election it was allowed to contest until its drubbing in 1983, has put to rest 
doubts that Peronism would be able to outlive its charismatic founder. 
</P>
<P>
Invoking the memory of Peron and his famous wife Evita, populist Carlos Saul 
Menem stormed to a stunning victory in the presidential election Sunday. He 
thus capitalized on disgust with the failure of the ruling Radical Civil Union 
to arrest Argentina's economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
Menem now must prove that the Peronist party, which originally won over the 
working class with doses of state largess more than four decades ago, can cope 
with an economic crisis that frustrated the century-old Radicals of President 
Raul Alfonsin. 
</P>
<P>
Menem, a 58-year-old attorney and the governor of La Rioja province, received 
47.4% of the vote Sunday compared with 37% for Eduardo Cesar Angeloz of the 
Radical party, the Interior Ministry reported. That margin gave Menem 310 of 
the 600 presidential electors, nine more than necessary for election. The 
balance of the vote was split among the conservative Center Alliance and minor 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The Justicialist Party, as the Peronists are formally known, also swept into 
control of the lower house of Congress. The party already holds the Senate, so 
Menem will have a supporting Congress when he takes office Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Many saw the result of Sunday's election less as a vote for Menem than as a 
vote against the Radicals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a withering indictment of the Radicals' economic performance," a Western 
diplomat said. "I think most people weren't happy with the choices, but a lot 
of people decided to vote Peronist on the basis that the Radicals were doing 
nothing. They just shrugged their shoulders and said, 'It can't get any worse.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soaring Inflation 
</P>
<P>
Inflation soared to 40% for the month of April -- an annual rate projected at 
up to 3,000%. The currency, the austral, has lost 80% of its value against the 
dollar since February. 
</P>
<P>
When Alfonsin defeated the divided, disorganized Peronists in 1983 in the first 
open election since Peron's death nearly a decade earlier, many Argentines 
thought Peronism was fading. Many saw the party's earlier allure as a matter of 
forbidden fruit: Military governments had banned Peronism for a total of 18 
years after 1955. 
</P>
<P>
But Alfonsin's win over Peronist presidential candidate Italo Luder brought to 
the forefront of the Peronists a group of so-called renovadores (renewers), 
including Menem, who successfully fought for democratic reforms within the 
party. This paid off with impressive Peronist victories in provincial and 
congressional elections in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Menem won the Peronists' presidential nomination in the party's first open 
primary, although some critics have said that he did so with the help of 
remnants of the old Peronist order who had lost out in the reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
Menem insists he owes no political debts, not even to the powerful General 
Confederation of Labor which unleashed its machine on his behalf. The union's 
leaders, including Secretary General Saul Ubaldini, have said they do not 
expect Menem to produce miracles overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts suggest that Menem's strong ties with organized labor will help 
him win its cooperation for potentially painful measures, such as cutbacks in 
the public work force to trim a huge deficit. Alfonsin was plagued by 13 
general strikes, and he met labor intransigence when he tried to privatize 
state enterprises.

ISRAEL ORDERS GAZA CURFEW, SENDS WORKERS HOME

The army Monday imposed an indefinite curfew on 700,000 Palestinians in the 
occupied Gaza Strip, and it ordered all Gazans employed in Israel to return to 
the seaside area immediately, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The army also blew up or sealed the homes of 13 Arabs in the occupied 
territories who are suspected of attacking suspected collaborators and Israeli 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The army command gave no reason for its orders to laborers from Gaza. It was 
the first time such an order has been issued during the Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinians employed in Israel prefer to spend the night near their 
places of work instead of returning home, where they can be caught in 
Palestinian strikes or army-imposed curfews. 
</P>
<P>
"If people are supposed to be under curfew, they should not run around, and 
that pertains to those working in Israel, too," a military spokesman said. He 
said the curfew will remain in effect "until further notice." 
</P>
<P>
The curfew order followed stone-throwing clashes in Gaza. In one clash in the 
Khan Yunis refugee camp, a 40-year-old man was fatally shot in the chest, Arab 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen Palestinians were reported wounded in half a dozen confrontations with 
soldiers Monday in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the Khan Yunis camp, a 6-year-old girl was reported shot in the left 
shoulder and a 50-year-old man was in serious condition with a gunshot wound in 
the back. 
</P>
<P>
Troops demolished four houses and sealed nine others to punish Palestinians 
accused of attacking Israeli troops or killing suspected collaborators with 
Israel, the army spokesman's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the sealed homes are in Nablus, the West Bank's largest city. The city's 
120,000 residents were put under curfew to prevent protests, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
Western nations, including the United States, have condemned house demolitions 
and sealings as a violation of the right to due process because the punishment 
usually comes before trial. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, army commander of the West Bank, defended it as a 
deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
"These are murder gangs, and some of them got their orders from outside to 
carry out murders of people considered to be helping Israel," Mitzna said on 
Israel Radio. "We will punish them severely."

CZECHOSLOVAK OFFICIALS ASSAIL HUNGARY FOR STOPPING WORK ON DANUBE PROJECT

<TEXT>
<P>
Government officials accused Hungary on Monday of violating international law 
by halting work on a joint dam project and said that Prague will seek 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
The regional Presidium in Slovakia, the eastern portion of federated 
Czechoslovakia, said Hungary must finish its section of the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros 
twin dam project on the Danube River. 
</P>
<P>
Budapest said Saturday that it will make a final decision on whether to 
continue work on the Nagymaros dam, about 20 miles northwest of Budapest, after 
a two-month review. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's official MTI news agency quoted a senior Czechoslovak Water Ministry 
official as saying that canceling Nagymaros would cost Czechoslovakia $2.7 
billion and that Prague would ask Budapest for damages. 
</P>
<P>
"The unilateral step of the government of Hungary contradicts valid 
Czechoslovak agreements and international law," the Slovak presidium said in a 
statement carried by CTK news agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The presidium asks the federal government to adopt immediate steps necessary 
for the fulfillment of the valid international agreement between Czechoslovakia 
and Hungary, and requests Hungary to consistently keep the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Czechoslovak Communist Party newspaper Rude Pravo accused 
Hungarian opposition forces of using the dam project as a means to attack the 
Budapest government. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition in Hungary to the Nagymaros project has been mounted on ecological 
and economic grounds, and 150,000 people have signed a petition condemning it. 
</P>
<P>
In Hungary, the dam project has come to symbolize the rift between Premier 
Miklos Nemeth, a reformer who wants to scrap the scheme, and party leader 
Karoly Grosz, who has said he would vote to complete it.

WEAPONS DELIVERIES TO NICARAGUA SUSPENDED, GORBACHEV TELLS BUSH

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev informed President Bush this month that 
all Soviet weapons deliveries to Marxist-controlled Nicaragua were suspended at 
the beginning of 1989 and will not be resumed, an Administration official said 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader's commitment was reconfirmed by Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III when he met in Moscow last week with Gorbachev and Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The United States estimates that the Soviets provided $500 million in various 
forms of military aid, including weapons, to the Sandinista government in 
Nicaragua last year. 
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that Gorbachev's assurances did not foreclose delivery of 
other forms of military assistance, such as vehicles, supplies and clothing. 
Baker did not persuade the Soviet leaders to cut off that assistance as well, 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Soviets declined to suspend their military support of Cuba, their 
other prominent client state in the region, the official said. In the Kremlin 
last week, Shevardnadze reiterated to Baker that weapons deliveries had ceased, 
and Gorbachev underscored the commitment at a 3 1/2-hour meeting with Baker, 
the official said.

CHENEY URGES FLEXIBILITY IN CONFRONTING SOVIET MOVES 
</P>

<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, softening his views on Soviet policy, Monday 
hailed several "encouraging" moves by the Soviets and declared that the United 
States should take advantage of any new opportunities they offer to lessen the 
threat of war. 
</P>
<P>
In a cautiously optimistic view of Soviet policy, Cheney, the Bush 
Administration's foremost hard-liner, suggested there may be emerging "a new 
era of international relations" and said the United States must be flexible 
enough to deal with the changing circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he is encouraged by what has developed in the U.S.-Soviet talks on 
reducing conventional forces in Europe, "and we may reach an agreement" on 
significant reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Although tempered with caution, the overall view of U.S.-Soviet policy, voiced 
during a luncheon interview with reporters, was unusually optimistic for 
Cheney. He recently upset White House and State Department officials by 
straying from Administration policy and predicting that Soviet leader Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev would fail in his reform efforts and be replaced by a leader more 
hostile to the West. The view subsequently was repudiated by both President 
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to be Careful 
</P>
<P>
Declaring he was "trying to be very careful" in answering reporters' questions, 
Cheney said: 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev's stated intentions of reducing the defense budget and pulling 
troops out of Eastern Europe and the fact that they've taken the troops out of 
Afghanistan -- all of these obviously are encouraging, and I think in the West 
we obviously need to do everything we can to take advantage of the current 
circumstances to reduce the overall threat of war and to enhance international 
stability and enter into arms control agreements if they make sense. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
However, Cheney said there is "enough uncertainty" about what will happen in 
the Soviet Union that U.S. decisions now should not be based "upon the hope 
that these changes will be fundamental and irreversible, that we can afford to 
significantly reduce our own military commitments." 
</P>
<P>
He said "the jury is still out" on whether the Soviets will live up to 
Gorbachev's promises of unilateral reduction of Soviet military forces in 
Eastern Europe. The first reductions -- withdrawals of 10,000 men and 1,000 
tanks from East Germany -- were scheduled to begin last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of strategic systems or long-range missiles, Cheney said there has 
been no letup in the modernization or deployment of Soviet SS-24 and SS-25 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
"I could not at this point," said Cheney, "sit down and say to the President, 
'Mr. President, here's all the evidence that shows that, in fact, the Soviets 
are going to implement all the good things that Gorbachev has said he wants to 
do.' But, on the other hand, it's a big cumbersome system and you would expect 
that it will take time before some of that stuff can be accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
Both Cheney and a State Department official also rebuked Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Monday for threatening to break terms of the 
Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty or take a rearmament step if the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization goes through with its plan to modernize its 
short-range nuclear missiles based in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney denounced the threat as an attempt to "create turmoil" within NATO only 
two weeks before its summit meeting in Brussels from May 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze's comments followed a pledge by Gorbachev, during talks in Moscow 
with Baker last week, to reduce the number of its short-range missiles in 
Europe by removing 500 warheads. Both Soviet moves were designed to increase 
the pressure on Western Europe to repudiate a call by the United States and 
Britain to modernize nuclear missiles instead of beginning new negotiations 
with Moscow to reduce short-range nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at a news briefing: "We think 
Shevardnadze's remarks are an outlandish statement. One day the Soviets 
announce small unilateral reductions, the next day they're talking about 
breaking recently concluded treaties." 
</P>
<P>
Baker had called Gorbachev's pledge to remove the warheads "a small step, a 
good step." But Cheney, referring to the pledge as "Gorbachev's latest ploy," 
said the Soviet leader has "got so many rat holes over there in Eastern Europe 
that 500 is a pittance. He's still got an overwhelming preponderance in sheer 
numbers with respect to short-range nuclear forces."

VOTERS BOLSTER GORBACHEV'S REFORM BID; 
</P>
<P>
SETBACK FOR CONSERVATIVES SEEN IN RUNOFF BALLOTING FOR ASSEMBLY

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's chances for pushing through political and 
economic changes were strengthened Monday by election results giving social 
reformers seats in runoff balloting for a newly created Soviet assembly. 
</P>
<P>
A crusading prosecutor who accused conservative Politburo member Yegor K. 
Ligachev of blocking an inquiry into high-level corruption defeated more than 
two dozen other candidates in Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
The editor of the taboo-breaking Ogonyok magazine and some reformers from the 
Baltic states also were on the winners' list after Sunday's balloting for the 
Congress of People's Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Balloting took place in nearly 200 districts where voters in March refused to 
elect the candidates listed on their ballots, showing their displeasure by 
crossing the names off their ballots. In many cases, the defeated candidates 
initially ran unopposed. For Sunday's balloting, in contrast, there was an 
average of six candidates for each seat. 
</P>
<P>
In Leningrad, the Soviet Union's second-largest city, police investigator 
Nikolai Ivanov swept to victory with 60% of the vote, defeating 27 other 
candidates to claim the city's seat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kremlin's 'Right Turn' 
</P>
<P>
Ivanov told Leningrad television in a two-minute campaign speech Friday that 
Ligachev had ordered a corruption probe to be dropped. He criticized what he 
called the Kremlin's "right turn" and "Comrade Ligachev's increasing 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ligachev, the former ideology chief, was ousted from his No. 2 spot 
and given the agriculture portfolio in a Politburo shake-up. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanov and his partner, Telman Gdlyan, are something of heroes throughout the 
Soviet Union for spearheading a lengthy corruption investigation in the 
republic of Uzbekistan that led to the conviction of former Soviet leader 
Leonid I. Brezhnev's son-in-law, Yuri M. Churbanov. 
</P>
<P>
Gdlyan won a parliamentary seat in the March 26 voting, receiving more than 85% 
of the vote in a Moscow district. 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad officials said that Ivanov, a Muscovite, got last-minute backing from 
some undecided Leningrad voters who took issue with criticism of the 
prosecutor, which was published Saturday in the Communist Party daily Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interference in Probe 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper accused Ivanov and Gdlyan of trying to interfere with the work of 
a special commission that has been formed to look into complaints about the 
methods used by the two investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Ogonyok editor Vitaly A. Korotich, a populist who compares himself in style to 
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, won 84% of the vote to 
claim a seat in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkov. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a conservative city of more than a million and a half people, but even 
the conservatives are tired of the old ways," Korotich said in an interview in 
his magazine office Monday. "The local party officials opposed me, but the more 
they tried to discredit me, the more support I got." 
</P>
<P>
Korotich said he plans to help the community start a local newspaper to publish 
complaints and to try to get more supplies into the city's stores. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot be god for them, but they are counting on me. We in the Congress of 
People's Deputies must insist on having real power," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress of People's Deputies is to meet on May 25 to elect a president and 
members to a new Supreme Soviet, the nation's national Parliament, which is to 
replace the previous rubber-stamp body. 
</P>
<P>
It is not yet clear how often the Congress will meet and what its other 
functions may be. But Gorbachev is expected to use the body to help generate 
grass-roots support for his reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,250-member Congress is the centerpiece of Gorbachev's efforts to bring 
political reform to the Soviet Union. Elections to the Congress in March marked 
the first time most voters ever had a choice at the polls and was preceded by 
unprecedented campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
In Estonia, Klara Hallik, who was backed by the nationalist Estonian People's 
Front, won just over 50% of the vote. A lecturer, she is an expert on ethnic 
relations at Tallinn Polytechnical Institute. 
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Latvia, People's Front officials said their candidates won five 
of the six races. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Front movements seek independence from the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
In some of the runoff elections, no single candidate gained more than half the 
votes needed to win a seat, and the Soviet news agency Tass reported that 
elections between finalists will be held May 21.

UNVEILS $1-BILLION ANTI-CRIME PACKAGE; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH VOWS HARSHER PENALTIES FOR GUN VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush on Monday announced a long-anticipated package of measures to 
combat violent crime, sidestepping the controversial issue of gun control but 
pledging to increase penalties for gun-related violence and to spend $1 billion 
on more prosecutors and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to match rhetoric with resources," Bush said, but he did not 
say where the resources are to come from without worsening the federal deficit. 
Nor does the Administration have a detailed plan yet for how to use the extra 
money if it can be obtained, officials conceded. 
</P>
<P>
On guns, Bush rejected the advice of drug policy chief William J. Bennett and 
others who had proposed broad new restrictions on semiautomatic assault guns, 
which have become the guns of choice for many drug gang members and street 
criminals. Rather than limit the guns, Bush proposed to control the clips that 
hold their ammunition -- banning the sale or manufacture of magazines that hold 
more than 15 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Law Governing Imports 
</P>
<P>
Bush pledged to enforce the current law that bans the importation of guns 
deemed unsuitable for sport, a subject under study by the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms. But he rejected the idea of applying the same test to 
domestically produced weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Limiting domestically produced weapons would have required the Administration 
to confront the powerful National Rifle Assn. in a battle over new legislation. 
Foreign-made weapons can be handled under existing law. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's package also contains a series of criminal justice measures long sought 
by conservatives, including a widening of the federal death penalty, which has 
not been used in a generation, and new restrictions on the so-called 
exclusionary rule, which bars prosecutors from using illegally seized evidence 
in criminal cases. Nearly all of the ideas in that portion of the package have 
been proposed -- and defeated -- in Congress several times. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan drew mixed reactions. Gun control advocates expressed 
disappointment that he had not gone further, and several members of Congress 
questioned how Bush planned to fit his new proposal into the budget. 
</P>
<P>
White House aides have been anticipating Bush's crime package, which has been 
under internal debate since March, as the biggest domestic policy initiative of 
the spring. The unveiling of the proposals was repeatedly delayed as Bush 
advisers thrashed out the details and sought an appropriate symbolic backdrop. 
In the end, they chose a Capitol Hill memorial for slain law enforcement 
officers to serve as Bush's forum. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in a slow drizzle on the steps of the Capitol and surrounded by 
uniformed police, Bush called for a "common-sense approach to crime" and 
pledged that the federal government would "lead the way" to "take back the 
streets by taking criminals off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
As Bush spoke, teams of federal marshals fanned out across the capital in the 
first of a series of eviction raids designed to target Washington apartments 
used as crack houses. The federal marshals, who perform the function of county 
sheriff in Washington, had spent several weeks developing the new operation, 
comparing routine housing violation lists with police intelligence about crack 
houses so they could target their eviction efforts to disrupt drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Washington, however, the federal role in crime fighting is far more 
limited, a problem Bush inadvertently highlighted when he cited two 
particularly notorious crimes in his speech. "Whether it's the brutalization of 
a young runner in a park or terrorizing a young man onto a crowded highway," 
Bush said, criminal acts "cannot be excused or explained away." 
</P>
<P>
The two crimes Bush was describing, the recent gang-rape of a young woman 
jogger in New York's Central Park and the death of a black man who was chased 
into the path of a car by white thugs in New York's Howard Beach neighborhood, 
were prosecuted in state, not federal, courts. Neither crime would have been 
affected by Bush's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10-Year Mandatory Sentence 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan would increase penalties for many federal offenses involving guns, 
including a new 10-year mandatory minimum sentence for violent crimes committed 
using a semiautomatic weapon. Those penalties would not apply, however, in 
state courts, where most violent crimes are handled. 
</P>
<P>
Those Bush initiatives that would have the most visible impact -- building new 
prisons and hiring more federal prosecutors and enforcement agents -- may be 
severely constrained by another of Bush's priorities, cutting the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
A senior White House official, speaking to reporters Monday on condition that 
he not be named, said the $1.2-billion cost of the new personnel and prison 
construction could be accommodated by the budget agreement reached earlier this 
year. That agreement allowed domestic spending to increase $3.6 billion over 
current levels. 
</P>
<P>
That $3.6 billion, however, already has been committed to several other 
programs, including other Administration initiatives such as education and drug 
fighting, congressional budget officials said. If Bush is to get his extra 
money for crime without worsening the deficit, "something else will have to be 
cut," a senior House budget staff member said. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal-justice experts agree, however, that new prisons will be a necessity 
if the Administration is serious about crime fighting. "Without increased 
prison space, if you sentence a lot more people, you would simply have to 
release a lot of others," said Philip B. Heymann, a Harvard Law School 
professor who headed the Justice Department's criminal division in the Jimmy 
Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"The question," Heymann said, "is whether they have something intelligent in 
mind to do with the increased resources." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration does not have anything specific in mind yet. Bush plans to 
ask the Justice and Treasury departments to draw up a plan for using the new 
resources to target career criminals, particularly those who repeatedly violate 
federal firearms laws, aides said. But White House officials were so intent on 
keeping details of the package from leaking out early that many law enforcement 
agencies, including the FBI and the Marshals Service, were not consulted before 
it was drawn up, officials said.

CYCLAMATE LIKELY TO BE EXONERATED -- 20 YEARS LATER

Federal health officials, who banned the artificial sweetener cyclamate 20 
years ago in the midst of one of the biggest health scares of the 1960s, are 
now widely expected to reapprove it, possibly this year. Once accused of 
causing everything from bladder cancer to birth defects, cyclamate is now 
widely thought to be harmless. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reluctance in saying that with cyclamate we made a mistake," said 
Robert Scheuplein, acting director of the office of toxicological services for 
the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
A group of monkeys at the National Cancer Institute provides evidence of the 
mistake. Each of them has been fed the amount of cyclamate that would sweeten 
30 cans of diet soda every day, five days a week, for the last 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They're Doing Fine 
</P>
<P>
In February, the institute issued its first progress report: The monkeys are 
doing just fine. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's reversal on cyclamate promises to add to the growing public debate 
about how government health officials evaluate potential health risks. 
According to scientists and industry officials involved in the controversy, the 
evidence exonerating cyclamate was available years ago and the fact that the 
agency took two decades to concede its mistake shows how large a role politics 
can play in decisions presented as scientific. 
</P>
<P>
Cyclamate was one of the world's most widely used artificial sweeteners when, 
in the late 1960s, its safety became a matter of public concern. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, after the completion of a study showing that some rats with cyclamate 
pellets implanted in their bladders were developing tumors, the FDA restricted 
the sale of the chemical. The following year, it was banned entirely.

SEND SURPLUS TO SCHOOLS, SENATOR URGES

The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee on Monday proposed that most of the 
surprise windfall of $750 million in state revenue be funneled to financially 
strapped local government programs and schools. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation by Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose) represented the first 
solid legislative proposal to distribute the money since the "excess" money 
first surfaced late last month. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian reach an agreement on how to 
divvy up the windfall, the lion's share, about $564 million, automatically will 
flow to public schools on July 1, under terms of the Proposition 98 education 
finance ballot initiative enacted in November. 
</P>
<P>
"By insisting on money that legally is due them on July 1, the education 
community easily can be viewed as insensitive and unfair, while other 
communities -- particularly the poor, the old and the infirm -- lack proper 
care," Alquist told the committee. "We cannot afford to let other legitimate 
needs of the state starve while the education community receives an unfair 
proportion of available resources." 
</P>
<P>
Alquist did not offer his plan in the form of legislation but sketched the 
proposal's broad outlines verbally and asked members of the committee to 
consider them and return to him with any comments. 
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats indicated qualified support for the plan, but said they needed 
more details. Republican Sen. John Seymour of Anaheim, however, said other 
major fiscal issues confronting the Legislature remain to be dealt with before 
most Republicans would embrace the Alquist proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Alquist proposed that $300 million of the windfall be channeled to kindergarten 
through community college education. Another $250 million would be handed over 
to counties in no-strings-attached bloc grants. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $200 million would be placed in the state budget's reserve fund 
for expenditure in the new fiscal year starting July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the counties, in turn, would be expected to spend the funds on 
physical and mental health care programs, trauma centers, the medically 
indigent and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The unanticipated revenue was generated chiefly by surprisingly high income tax 
payments for 1988.

THE LOS ANGELES TEACHERS' STRIKE; 
</P>
<P>
AMID CONFUSION, EDUCATION IS SUPPLANTED BY 'BABY-SITTING' 
</P>

<P>
It was 8 a.m. Monday at Joseph Le Conte Junior High School in Hollywood, and 
the word was chaos. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of a districtwide teacher strike, an administrator began his 
day standing on the playground outside the two-story brick school, doing what 
he and others would end up doing most of the day -- trying to keep students 
from skipping out. While he stood there quizzing the kids on the names of 
school administrators to keep them amused, others who had showed up to teach 
massed nearby, waiting for instructions on what to do once the first bell 
sounded. 
</P>
<P>
Like a general in a battle issuing orders to his lieutenants, Principal Dave 
Sowers handed out the day's hastily prepared directives and assignments to his 
corps of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But as teachers and administrators went in all directions to their assigned 
classrooms, few were pretending that much education was about to take place. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't educating; this is baby-sitting," said Oscar Mesta, 35, one of only 
about a dozen regular teachers who crossed the picket line that morning. A 
history teacher, Mesta was assigned to teach English. "We're doing the best we 
can." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confusion Abates 
</P>
<P>
By 10 a.m., most of the confusion had ended, and the relatively few substitute 
teachers and administrators had routed students into the school auditorium, a 
corner of the playground and a few classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 restless youngsters squirming in their seats and chattering in 
several languages sat through a nearly two-hour period with little to do but 
watch cartoons on two television monitors. In a nearby English class, a 
bilingual student interpreted class instructions for a small group of her 
Armenian-speaking friends. 
</P>
<P>
About 950 of the school's 1,500 students -- the vast majority of whom speak a 
language other than English at home -- showed up for class, but if they can 
sway their parents, many said they will stay home today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is totally boring," said Ana Goryam, 13, sitting with a group of friends 
on the playground bleachers where a scheduled physical education class turned 
into informal ballgames on the surrounding blacktop. "We haven't learned 
anything today." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers seemed more concerned with moving students in an orderly fashion from 
one classroom to the next during the day's three periods -- consolidated from 
the usual six -- and in keeping them on campus than with the regular reading, 
writing and arithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
"This is crazy," said teacher's assistant Sandra Campos, 29, directing student 
traffic on the playground. "Our job is to make sure the kids don't escape. But 
they ask us for permission to go to the bathroom, and some don't come back." 
</P>
<P>
Other teachers assistants and security personnel stationed at all doors of the 
school building repeatedly found themselves turning back youngsters who tried 
to go home. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a prison, not a school," said John Oganesyan, 15, who was turned back 
along with two of his cousins. "I'm not going to just sit here and do nothing 
all day. Our parents told us we could go home if we didn't like what happened 
at school today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Pupil's Solution 
</P>
<P>
One of the boy's cousins asked, "Why don't they just pay the teachers and get 
it over with? Why should we suffer?" 
</P>
<P>
Even many of those who managed to make it out of the building did not get very 
far. 
</P>
<P>
Police made at least half a dozen trips to the school to return about 30 
students picked up for truancy, school office personnel said. At one point, 
about a dozen students filed through an open playground gate. A handful of them 
made it no farther than the corner where a passing police car stopped to pick 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
Other students sauntered over to a picket line on a sidewalk outside the school 
for a few minutes to greet one of their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Happy vacation! Happy Mother's Day," the girls chimed as they surrounded 
teacher Mirta McKay, a bilingual teacher at the school for three years. "When 
are you coming back? It's so boring inside," one of them added. 
</P>
<P>
Like the dozens of other sign-carrying strikers who showed up at the school 
Monday morning, McKay said she is prepared to "fight" for as long as it takes. 
For too long, she said, she and other teachers have gone without adequate 
salaries, school materials and books for their classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We want more say in the decision-making process," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Bob McKay, the school's strike coordinator and another Le Conte 
teacher, said the strike is about more than just salaries. "There is a lot of 
pent-up frustration over not being allowed to make decisions about the 
workplace and (teaching) materials," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 14 out of the school's roster of 90 teachers reportedly crossed the 
picket line Monday. Among those who reported for work, several said they did so 
for financial or personal reasons. Some expressed ambivalence. And a few, like 
Mesta, the history teacher, simply said they did not agree with the union's 
call for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
Most asked that they not be identified. "I don't need the hassle," one teacher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Saying she was not proud of crossing the picket lines, one substitute teacher 
said she took the job because she needed to work three more days before the end 
of the school year to qualify for medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"I put on my sunglasses and held my breath when I drove through that picket 
line this morning," the substitute said. "I felt really, really bad." 
</P>
<P>
Striking teachers said they expected little support from their students' 
parents, noting that most are recent immigrants and do not involve themselves 
in school affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the parents interviewed before the strike, however, expressed 
support for the teachers. Ana Medrano, who has a daughter at the school, 
admitted she is not clear on the reasons for the strike and worries about the 
disruption of classes. But, still she believes the strike "is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers salaries are too low for the work they do. Education is the most 
important work of all," said Medrano, a native of Nicaragua and one of the few 
parents who has taken an active role on the school's advisory council.

CONSENT STRESSED AT L.A. CLINICS;

SCHOOL DISTRICT PROGRAM COULD SERVE AS MODEL HERE

<TEXT>
<P>
A student dashed into the nurse's office at Los Angeles High School the other 
morning and asked for an aspirin to relieve his headache. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, the aide said, but the nurse's office cannot dispense medicine. But why 
not try the school health clinic on the other side of the counter, which offers 
a complete menu of medical services? 
</P>
<P>
So the student moved to the other side of the waiting room and asked the clinic 
receptionist for an aspirin. Are you a member of the clinic? Have your parents 
filled out the consent form? she asked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Matter How Simple 
</P>
<P>
No, he wasn't a member, but he was 18 years old. Sorry again, but, even if 
you're an adult, all students who use the clinic must have written permission 
from their parents in advance, no matter how simple or complex the medical 
problem. The student walked away in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
That brief tableau illustrates a key point that Los Angeles city school 
administrators emphasize over and over to critics of their clinics, which could 
serve as a model for San Diego should the Board of Education approve the 
concept today: that the centers are intended not to usurp parental authority, 
but to provide medical care that, for economic and other reasons, the parent or 
legal guardian cannot. 
</P>
<P>
"We see this as a consent program," said Pam Wagner, the Los Angeles school 
district's nurse coordinator. "Parents have the right to tell us what services 
they want their child to have," or even to forbid use of the clinic altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner said state law that allows minors to receive pregnancy-related treatment 
without parental consent applies only when a clinic has agreed to provide it. 
</P>
<P>
The first of three health clinics on Los Angeles high school campuses opened in 
September, 1987, with a complete range of medical offerings, including 
pregnancy testing, contraceptives and counseling -- for diet and weight 
control, drug and alcohol use, pregnancy prevention and mental health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Many Pregnancies 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles city school board, despite strident opposition from the city's 
Catholic diocese and right-to-life pressure groups, authorized the pilot 
projects, saying that too many teen-agers ignore their health and that too many 
girls become pregnant and drop out. 
</P>
<P>
Each clinic is operated under contract by a non-district medical organization, 
which carries the required medical liability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The Watts Health Foundation runs the Jordan High School clinic in Watts, the 
first to open; UCLA's schools of medicine and public health, in conjunction 
with a private health corporation, run the clinic at San Fernando High School, 
and Children's Hospital of Los Angeles operates the Los Angeles High clinic. 
Funding comes from a variety of private foundations -- half from the Robert 
Wood Johnson Foundation of Princeton, N. J., which supports 23 clinics 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The district's latest data shows that parents or legal guardians of 51% of all 
eligible students have given consent to use the clinics, and 92% of those agree 
to all services, including reproductive medicine. Of those students with 
parental permission, 63% have used the clinics at least once. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight percent of clinic visits have been for basic acute or chronic 
medical problems, 19% for mental health problems, 16% for reproductive-related 
matters and 16% for health education information. 
</P>
<P>
Once parents have signed the consent form, they usually are not told of the 
visits, except in cases where their child has a life-threatening illness or 
condition, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think we'd have as much usage as quickly as we did," said Socorro 
Macias, who coordinates the clinic at Los Angeles High. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used by 42% 
</P>
<P>
That clinic opened in January, 1988, as the last of the district's three 
pilots, but already has attracted 42% of all eligible students, a mix of 
blacks, Latinos and Koreans, many of them immigrants and a third of them who 
have English as a second language. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic at predominantly Latino San Fernando High has the lowest rate of 
parent approval, at 41%, mainly because of continued organized opposition by 
Catholic and right-to-life groups who ask parents to boycott use by their 
children. The clinic opened in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics differ somewhat depending on the specific needs of students, but 
all three have either a full-time physician assistant or nurse practitioner, a 
part-time medical doctor and a part-time psychologist and psychology interns. 
</P>
<P>
A student can either come to the clinic directly or be referred by the school 
nurse, who still treats minor injuries and first-aid matters. 
</P>
<P>
Most students use the clinics by appointment. At Los Angeles High, scheduling 
is in 45-minute slots, with certain times set aside for walk-ins or 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
On their first visit, students are given an in-depth evaluation to detect any 
underlying problems behind symptoms such as a headache or earache, Macias said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Make Them More Aware 
</P>
<P>
"We probe so that we can elicit all information," she said, adding that the 
specialty of adolescent medicine has only recently been recognized for its 
importance in treating teen-agers as a group distinct from adults and children. 
</P>
<P>
"And when we need to make referrals to outside agencies, we have sat down with 
the students, explained to them why we are making an appointment to another 
doctor and make them more aware of things so they will be more likely to keep" 
the appointment, Macias said. "Remember, these kids don't have a lot of health 
consumer experience." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles High nurse Barbara King calls the school's clinic a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
"I know my students can now get immediate treatment, whereas before I had to 
make an outside referral for any type of care, and the parent would have no way 
to get the kid there or have no money . . . and I would never know if they went 
or not," King said. "Now I can spend a lot more time making certain that all 
students have up-to-date immunization records and other requirements." 
</P>
<P>
Figures from districtwide clinic coordinator Michael Godfrey show that, of the 
360 students now using the clinics for contraceptive purposes, 183 are 
receiving birth control pills and 177 are receiving barrier devices, including 
condoms. Only 17 students, or 4.7%, have become pregnant while using 
contraception. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that is an excellent compliance rate," Godfrey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dramatic Difference? 
</P>
<P>
The district has no firm data to show whether its program has cut the number of 
pregnancies because it has no figures on how many girls were becoming pregnant 
before the clinics opened. 
</P>
<P>
But Godfrey and King believe there has been a dramatic effect. "I'm certain I'd 
be seeing more pregnant women otherwise," King said. 
</P>
<P>
A harder question to answer is whether fewer teens are sexually active. 
</P>
<P>
"My gut feeling is that we certainly aren't promoting teen sex," Godfrey said, 
referring to criticism from opponents who say the availability of 
contraceptives encourages students to become sexually active. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic staff talks at length with students who come in for reproductive 
services, trying to gauge their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk with them, try to give them accurate information and find out if there 
is a way to make them see the consequences" of sexual activity, Macias said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counseling Encouraged 
</P>
<P>
If the students are sexually active, they are encouraged to come to the clinic 
with their partner for counseling, as well as to talk with a parent, she said. 
The latter is often a difficult proposition, especially when many of the 
teen-agers come from broken families or have a parent in another country whom 
they have not seen for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we try to get them to say no, or at least delay a decision to become 
active," Godfrey said. "But look, these kids don't plan ahead, like coming in 
on Friday afternoon before a Friday night date, and talk about what they should 
do." 
</P>
<P>
The neighboring Culver City School District has established a clinic as well, 
operated under contract with UCLA and with guidelines similar to those in Los 
Angeles. The difference is that it does not dispense or prescribe 
contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic serves all teen-agers from ages 12 to 18 living in Culver City, 
whether or not they attend school in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clinic did not start for reasons of coping with adolescent pregnancy," 
said Vera Jashni, assistant superintendent for educational services. "We were 
seeing primary health care problems and, while people do not think of our city 
as disadvantaged, we have 36% of our students with no health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
Jashni said that 54% of all visits are for illnesses and injuries, with another 
15% for immunizations and about the same for counseling. About 5% are 
sex-related. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Referred to Agencies 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have found emotional and stress problems to be greater than 
originally thought," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic does test for pregnancy, but then refers students to outside social 
service agencies for intensive counseling if they are unwilling to talk with 
their parents or church. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to do some counseling at the clinic and get some changes in attitude," 
Jashni said. "And we stress abstinence in group counseling -- where we have as 
speakers girls who have had children -- to bring a greater sense of reality to 
(being a teen-age mother) than you might get from just a sex education class." 
</P>
<P>
But the clinic still faces opposition from right-to-life groups, who denounce 
the referrals because social-service agencies include discussion of birth 
control and, in some cases, abortion.

MILE OF CARS TOWING-LOT OWNERS FEAR NATIONAL CITY IS AFTER LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Driving down National City Boulevard, passing row after endless row of every 
vehicle imaginable, it is not hard to see why the proudly christened Mile of 
Cars has turned out to be that town's economic salvation. 
</P>
<P>
Quaint cable cars are glorified in San Francisco, but shiny new automobiles are 
revered in National City. And why not? Last year the Mile of Cars generated 
about half-a-billion dollars in sales, which brought the city millions in 
sales-tax revenue. But, despite this glut of tax dollars, the San Diego Assn. 
of Governments said that National City is still the poorest city in the county, 
with the lowest per capita income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Pot of Gold 
</P>
<P>
Enter Tom Moynahan's towing company -- situated on 70,000 square feet of prime 
commercial land -- at the south end of the Mile of Cars, sitting like a pot of 
gold at the end of a rainbow of automobile dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the problem, said Tim Moynahan, son of the towing company's 
founder. City officials have their eye on his choice lot, says Moynahan, and 
would like to see another car dealer there, generating more sales-tax revenue, 
instead of a towing company that only pays property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
To hear Moynahan, 48, tell it, city officials made their intentions known in 
February, when they decided to modify the city's 17-year-old contract with his 
company, which is simply called Tom Moynahan's. Before the City Council voted 
on a new course of action, the Moynahans had enjoyed an exclusive towing 
contract -- renewed every three to five years -- with the city since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
But last month the council split the contract and awarded half of it to the San 
Diego-based A to Z Towing. Both companies essentially have a five-year 
contract. The two companies are not compensated by the city, but are the only 
companies authorized to work with the National City Police Department to tow 
abandoned or disabled cars, or vehicles involved in accidents. It is up to the 
companies to recover their costs. 
</P>
<P>
Moynahan, who was recently voted off the city's Planning Commission, said it 
was by accident that he learned of the city's decision to split the contract. 
While walking into a commission hearing Feb. 6, Moynahan said, he stopped to 
peruse an upcoming council agenda when he noticed an item about the city's 
towing policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Through the Back Door 
</P>
<P>
He interpreted the council's decision to split the towing contract as an 
attempt to force him to sell the family's lot, which he estimates is worth $5 
million, to the city's redevelopment agency. According to Moynahan, agency 
officials had previously expressed an interest in buying the property and then 
leasing or selling it to a car dealer. 
</P>
<P>
"They were working through the back door to get to me. They were trying to give 
me the shaft. . . . I told them, 'If you guys are interested in my property, 
you ought to be up front with me,' " Moynahan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Moynahan family's roots are deep in National City, going back to 1927, when 
Tom moved an auto wrecking business here from San Diego. The elder Moynahan, 
who is 70, still works in the yard. His wife, Ruth, who is also 70, is a 
teacher's aide with the National School District. 
</P>
<P>
"We all work. None of us have any brains. Hell, Tom (his father) and I are here 
seven days a week sometimes," Tim Moynahan said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, when the city outlawed junkyards, the Moynahans began their towing 
business and, in 1968, were awarded half the city's towing contract, which was 
shared with another company. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, they obtained exclusive towing rights for city business and remained 
the only contractor until April, when A to Z Towing entered the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind competition. But they shaft you. They're giving the contract to a 
company that is outside of National City and which won't spend any money here," 
Moynahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Moynahan may see a conspiracy in the making by the City Council, but Mayor 
George Waters and Police Chief Stan Knee said other factors prompted a change 
in the towing policy. 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, a city ordinance requires that the towing contract be 
divided between two companies, Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Times Have Changed 
</P>
<P>
"The Moynahans have enjoyed an exclusive contract for all these years," he 
said. "They've gotten automatic extensions all these years without much regard 
for the ordinance. But times have changed. Twenty years ago our population was 
30,000. Today it's 55,000. . . . Business has quadrupled here. I think there's 
plenty of towing business for both companies.

"We've got people coming to National City from all over the county. The Mile of 
Cars did $500 million in sales last year, while the Plaza Bonita Shopping 
Center did $170 million and Fedco $55 million." 
</P>

Knee, who became chief in December, said it has become apparent that Moynahan 
has more work than he can handle. 
</P>
<P>
"Moynahan did an outstanding job. But there were times when he was not able to 
dispatch a tow truck as rapidly as possible. . . . On rainy days especially, a 
towing company has other responsibilities," Knee said. "Having two companies 
working with us gives us an extra backup." 
</P>
<P>
As for Moynahan's fear that the city is conspiring to take away his property, 
Waters denied that such a move is in the making. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me go on record as saying that the Moynahans can stay on their property as 
long as they wish," the mayor said. "They can stay until the cows come home. . 
. . After 20 years of doing business with them, they can't say that the city 
has not treated them right. I think they're misunderstanding progress. But, if 
they want more reassurance, let me say that nobody will get (Moynahan's) 
property with my vote." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Moynahan does not find reassurance in Waters' pledge and promised 
to fight any attempts by the city to acquire his lot.

14-MONTH PLAN ASKS STEEP RISES IN CITY'S SEWER, WATER RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diegans would face unprecedented increases in sewer and water bills over 
the next 14 months to pay for construction of a host of new projects and 
improve the quality of drinking water under a proposal set to come before the 
San Diego City Council this month. 
</P>
<P>
Developers -- and, eventually, buyers of new homes -- would be socked with even 
larger increases in the one-time sewer and water hookup fees. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, proposed Friday by the city's Water Utilities Department, an 
average family's sewer bill would rise 47%, from $13.52 to $19.87 monthly, 
effective July 1. The charge would then jump an additional 47%, from 19.87 to 
$29.22 per month a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Water rates would increase by 25%, from $16.32 to $20.40 monthly, on Jan. 1, 
1990. All told, the price hikes will raise the average two-month bill for the 
city's 1 million sewer and water users from the current $60 to about $100. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rates Expect to Fall 
</P>
<P>
Planners believe that the monthly rates will hold until fiscal year 1995, 
although they admit that the totals may be changed by inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first of the proposed increases to come, which eventually will 
force many San Diego families into choosing whether to feed the children or pay 
the sewer bills," said an aide to Councilman Bruce Henderson, the council's 
most outspoken critic of the plan to build a new sewage-treatment system. That 
construction project, now estimated at $2.4 billion to $4.2 billion, is 
responsible for much of the sewer-rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
Even Councilman Ron Roberts, a key supporter of the upgraded sewer-treatment 
project required by federal law, expressed concern that water utilities 
officials want residents to absorb the full increases so soon, especially when 
a construction timetable for the system has yet to be set. The city and the U. 
S. Environmental Protection Agency are locked in a federal court battle over 
that timetable. 
</P>
<P>
When planners released the price estimates for the system in March, Roberts and 
others assumed that the rate increases would be phased in by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were anticipating a gradual increase of prices," he said. "It 
concerns me when we see such an aggressive program of price increases." 
</P>
<P>
Home builders face even larger price increases as the city implements its plan 
to force new growth to pay for itself. Under the proposal, one-time sewer 
hookup fees would rise 75%, from $1,617 to $2,903, July 1. They would jump 
another 75%, from $2,903 to $5,385, a year later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water Rates to Go Up 
</P>
<P>
Water hookup fees for new homes would skyrocket, increasing 160% from $616 to 
$1,651 on July 1. Unlike the residential sewer and water rates, however, the 
hookup fees would continue to increase yearly. Sewer hookup fees would reach 
$6,587, and water fees would be $2,985 by fiscal year 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the development industry said that, under current market 
conditions, in which demand is outstripping supply, those costs would certainly 
be passed on to buyers of new homes, probably growing even larger by the time 
they show up in the final price tag of a home. 
</P>
<P>
Residential water rate increases are needed to pay for a $32.9 million 
upgrading of water treatment required by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 
and could go higher if consultants conclude that an $100 million to $150 
million more in technology is required, said Henry Pepper, assistant water 
utilities director. 
</P>
<P>
The rate increase will also pay for $23.5 million in water main replacements, 
$16 million in pipeline improvements and a new, $4.5-million charge imposed by 
the County Water Authority. 
</P>
<P>
The sewer rate increases will pay for the $68-million to $89-million annual 
cost of planning, designing and starting construction of the new sewage 
treatment system; the $97-million cost of extending the Point Loma treatment 
plant's ocean outfall by 8,000 feet, as required by the state ocean plan; the 
$30.6-million cost of sewer main replacements, and the $30-million cost of 
removing sludge-drying beds from Fiesta Island, among other projects.

PARENTS WILL STAND TRIAL IN ATTEMPT TO DEPROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a criminal case that attorneys say is unique in California for its 
prosecution of parents, a Santa Cruz couple was ordered Monday to stand trial 
in Vista Superior Court on felony charges that they kidnaped, falsely 
imprisoned and beat their adult daughter, who they believed was in the grips of 
a religious cult. 
</P>
<P>
The pending trial is expected to pit the principles of religious freedom 
against parental concern for the well-being of their children. The defense 
expects to produce a parade of former members of the religious group, who are 
expected to testify that they were brainwashed by the group's leader and were 
under his control until being rescued. 
</P>
<P>
The case centers on 23-year-old Ginger Brown, a member of Great Among the 
Nations who was abducted in Encinitas last May and held for five days in an 
Escondido house while her parents, sisters and others tried to deprogram her. 
On the fifth day, Brown was released and returned to the organization, a 
16-member fundamental Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry based in 
Coronado that critics claim is a cult. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sole Witness 
</P>
<P>
Brown was the sole prosecution witness against the five defendants in the case: 
her parents, Earle and Dorothy Rae Brown, both 57; her sister, Holly Rae Brown, 
24; Clifford Daniels, 34, of Los Angeles, a self-proclaimed deprogrammer, and 
Hank Erler, 22, in whose Escondido home the deprogramming effort occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys tried to show during the preliminary hearing before Vista 
Municipal Judge Michael Burley that the Browns and the other defendants 
believed that Ginger Brown had been brainwashed and that she was rescued for 
her own good. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown testified that she is a dedicated member of Great Among the Nations 
by her own free will and had begged her parents to let her live her own life, 
no matter how religiously fanatic it might seem to them. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Benjamin Altschul, who leads the organization, testified that he 
held no control over members' actions, and that his only requirement of them is 
that "they believe in our Lord Jesus Christ." 
</P>
<P>
One of the defense attorneys, John Patterson, said he might appeal Burley's 
decision because the judge stifled interrogation into the group's behavior on 
the grounds that a person's religious practices and beliefs cannot be put on 
trial. That area of questioning was important to the defense, however, in its 
effort to show that members of Great Among the Nations were brainwashed into 
following Altschul and financing what critics say is his lavish life style. 
</P>
<P>
Another defense attorney, Saul Wright, said afterward, "Previous cult members 
will testify 100% to the contrary" on Altschul's benign characterization of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Answered Deputy Dist. Atty Gary Rempel: "This is just a bunch of fundamental 
Christians being persecuted by well-financed deprogrammers who are themselves 
what they condemn. They (the defense) won't be able to provide a single witness 
who hasn't himself been brainwashed by a deprogrammer." 
</P>
<P>
The five defendants are scheduled to be arraigned in Superior Court on June 5, 
although Earle Brown notified the court on Monday that he faces hospitalization 
for cancer treatment.

Homicide detectives Monday were investigating a drive-by shooting in Southeast 
San Diego that left a 24-year-old pregnant woman dead. Police are searching for 
the occupants of two vehicles involved in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer heard a number of gunshots about 12:30 a.m. Sunday in the 2600 
block of L Street shortly before he found the body of Sheri A. Gibson slumped 
behind the wheel of her 1979 Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's spokesman said Gibson, of the 2000 block of Franklin Avenue in 
Logan Heights, died of a shotgun blast to her head. Her car crashed into a 
fence in the 2500 block of L Street after two vehicles pulled up alongside it 
and opened fire, police said.

<P>
An Assembly committee Monday defeated a bill by Assemblywoman Lucy Killea 
(D-San Diego) that called for an advisory vote of San Diegans on the proposed 
merger of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Killea was able to muster just six votes for the bill in the Assembly Utilities 
and Commerce Committee, where seven votes are required for passage. Although 
Assemblyman Bill Bradley (R-San Marcos) supports the bill, he missed Monday's 
hearing because he is hospitalized in San Diego with a bleeding ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
The committee granted Killea the right to bring the bill up for another vote 
when Bradley returns to the Capitol.

The driver of a speeding motorcycle pursued by a California Highway Patrol car, 
which later crashed into a bystander's car, killing a woman, pleaded no contest 
Monday to vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Omar Ulysses Martinez, 26, of Rancho Bernardo, faces a year in County Jail and 
a $10,000 fine at his July 13 sentencing in an agreement with the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was riding a motorcycle on Jan. 19, 1988, when a CHP car began to 
pursue him because of speeding. As Martinez attempted to escape, the officer's 
car struck a car driven by Donna Lovett, 23, of Poway, killing her. 
</P>
<P>
The crash took place on Clairemont Mesa Boulevard, between Kearny Mesa Road and 
Mercury Street, at 7:05 p.m., according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez set sentencing for July 13. 
</P>
<P>
He dismissed other charges, including evading a police officer and being 
unlicensed to drive a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
A wrongful-death suit against Martinez; Robert Cobb, the CHP officer who was 
driving the police car, and the state of California is pending. The suit was 
filed by Lovett's parents, Joel and Sylvia Lovett, in Superior Court.

RAIL LINES FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were quite excited to see the railroad's offer to sell 76.5 miles of unused 
railroad lines in the Los Angeles area to start a commuter train (Metro, May 
3). We urge everyone to lend support and contact local governments to make this 
happen soon. The June deadline is an achievable target if people will work 
together to solve our escalating transit problems. What a serendipity to our 
communities! 
</P>
<P>
We were both born and raised in Southern California; for the last three years 
we have lived in Portland, Ore., due to a job transfer. We experienced the 
initiation of the successful "MAX" mass transit system built on the old 
railroad lines amid such criticism and nonsupport. 
</P>
<P>
Once implemented, the people of Portland went crazy for MAX, its convenience, 
speed, safety, and, oh by the way, additionally improved property values. Every 
other major city has mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
In our three-year hiatus, we cannot believe the increased traffic congestion 
and severe impact on the freeway systems. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid transit must be a No. 1 priority and heritage left to future generations. 
The population explosion in our area and increased growth potential 
necessitates immediate action. Citizens can be educated and retrained to 
appreciate the ease and convenience of commuter rail transit. We all must reach 
into our pockets and pay now for a better, safer and faster tomorrow.

GALE ON ENERGY ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gale frames the energy question in relatively narrow terms. He rightly 
emphasizes our lack of serious commitment to effective energy policies but 
implies there are few options to expanded energy supplies as future demand 
increases. We are told all sources are tainted by environmental hazards but 
nuclear power appears the least troublesome -- if not for emotional 
reactionaries and murky politics which cloud rational thought. 
</P>
<P>
If we really want to be sensible about our options, why not take a cue from 
utilities who found conservation more profitable than new sources? Consider the 
words of physicist Amory Lovins ("To Save Energy, Oceans, Billions -- and the 
Air We Breathe" Opinion, Oct. 30, 1988): "Since 1979, Americans have gotten 
more than seven times as much new energy from savings as from all net increases 
in supply, and more new supply from renewable sources than from fossil and 
nuclear fuels. Savings achieved since 1973 are saving $150 billion in annual 
energy costs today. . . . Even so, we've barely scratched the surface of how 
much efficiency is available and worth buying." 
</P>
<P>
Who would have thought there was so much potential for creating wealth merely 
by not throwing it away? Even a headstrong consumer society might get used to 
that idea if it were painless enough (read: incentives, glamour). Maybe not, 
though. A mandate for efficient energy use might inadvertently lead to a more 
competitive business climate, forcing us to gaze on fewer foreign cars and 
high-rises against a cleaner skyline. This would be an obvious deline in our 
standard of living.

HELP THE CHILDREN NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oregon Gov. Neil E. Goldschmidt last year went to Portland's City Club and 
ticked off what the assembled business and civic leaders must do together to 
give children a healthy start in school. He expected a modest response. He got 
a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
The people were ahead of him, he discovered. The people are ready to address 
children's issues in the 1990s. And the proposals are ready before the U.S. 
Congress and the California Legislature. Small programs are even in place here 
and there across the country. What is needed now is leadership to secure the 
money, votes and commitment to duplicate those demonstrated successes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most comprehensive proposals comes from Rep. George Miller 
(D-Martinez), who chairs the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and 
Families. He and Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) are co-sponsoring a measure 
that emphasizes helping children early in life. Miller can point to report 
after report to buttress his case. For example, he says, "the Committee for 
Economic Development, composed of the leaders of Fortune 500 companies, 
estimates that each year's high school dropouts cost the country $240 billion 
in lost productivity and forgone taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's bill sets 1993 as a target to provide all impoverished pregnant women, 
their infants and children with health-care coverage under the Medicaid 
program. There would be a similar 1993 goal for complete coverage of those 
groups by the federal Women, Infant and Children nutrition program and for full 
immunization of all preschool children. Miller also wants appropriations 
increased for disabled preschool children and for ensuring an adequate vaccine 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
His program is ambitious -- and not as expensive as not acting. The first year 
of the four-year effort would cost $1.4 billion. In the long run, this 
investment in children's futures will save billions more than it will cost. 
</P>
<P>
Congress also must pass and pay for a child-care bill. Not a tax credit, as 
President Bush proposes, but the kind of bill that creates new child-care 
spaces, helps parents pay for decent care, requires that safety standards be 
set and helps improve the training of child-care workers. The Act for Better 
Child Care, sponsored by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), is such a bill. 
</P>
<P>
There also is much that can be done in California, where one out of every nine 
American children lives. Leaders of a California advocacy group, Children Now, 
report that only a small fraction of needy children here receive health 
checkups, preschool education and other preventive measures. Not only must 
state government devote more of its resources to children, it must not cut 
valuable programs like the Office of Family Planning or community mental health 
services. More, not less, must be done to help prevent child abuse and 
supervise children who must be placed in foster care. None of these programs 
can be expanded unless the Gann spending limit that straitjackets the state is 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the issues of income and housing for poor families must be squarely 
addressed as well. All these tasks are made difficult by the fact that neither 
the United States nor California has any coherent policy on what should be done 
for children. President Bush could provide leadership by reporting each year on 
the tasks that remain. 
</P>
<P>
But the real work is done on the local level with state money. A few counties 
and private agencies may lead the way to better coordination. For example, 
Ventura County has established a network that coordinates mental health, social 
services, corrections and special education programs to help treat all of a 
child's needs. Stuart House in Santa Monica, which helps abused children, 
brings together under one roof social workers, medical personnel and law 
enforcement agencies to reduce youngsters' trauma. The state could profit by 
these examples of coordination. Citizens need to get far more involved as well, 
by helping their local programs or working as Children Now does to push for a 
stronger state commitment. 
</P>
<P>
The people are indeed ahead of their government on this issue. The children, 
the greatest resource for the nation's future, are ready, too. Where are the 
leaders?

SUITS AGAINST DEPUTIES IN DEATH CASE PARED TO 1 CLAIM

A ruling by a federal judge Monday left intact only a small part of two 
$10-million lawsuits accusing three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies of 
killing a woman who was found slain after an evening of drinking with the 
deputies at a Van Nuys bar. 
</P>
<P>
The suits, filed by the woman's father, Edward Postma, and her mother, Mary 
Postma, accuse the deputies of causing the wrongful death of Catherine Michelle 
Braley, 26, and of violating her civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
But in the father's suit Monday and the mother's suit last week, U.S. District 
Judge Mariana Pfaelzer dismissed the civil rights claims by ruling that the 
deputies were not acting in their authority as law enforcement officers when, 
while off duty, they met Braley the night of Jan. 14, 1988. The next morning, 
Braley's body was found beaten and strangled in a nearby parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police investigating the unsolved case have said that no deputy is 
a suspect and that the three deputies, Robert Mallon, Robert Waters and Mike 
Turner, have denied involvement in Braley's death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dismissed Claim 
</P>
<P>
Pfaelzer last week dismissed Mary Postma's wrongful death claim on the basis 
that it should be dealt with by a state court, not a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, the judge would not dismiss Edward Postma's wrongful death suit 
on procedural grounds because Postma lives in Iowa and is suing residents of 
another state, causing federal court to have jurisdiction. The judge's rulings 
made no statement about whether the suits' allegations have factual merit. 
</P>
<P>
On the night before she was found dead, Braley had been drinking in a bar 
called The Hunter and had left at the same time as the deputies. In court 
depositions, Waters and Turner said they went their separate ways after leaving 
the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Mallon said in a deposition that he and Braley left in his unmarked county car 
and drove to a nearby area where they had consensual sex in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Braley, he said, then left the car and walked away. She was found dead the next 
day about a block away.

<P>
DROP IN ATTENDANCE HELPS ADMINISTRATORS KEEP SCHOOL GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
By 6:40 a.m. Monday, tension had squeezed out nearly all of Robert Collins' 
normal jocularity. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, principal of the 3,200-student Grant High School in Van Nuys, stood at 
the school's Oxnard Street entrance with his walkie-talkie in hand, scowling, 
breathing deeply and appearing ready for anything from gang trouble to 
picket-line violence. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't block traffic, you know that," he said to the striking teachers 
milling about. Then, a bit friendlier: "I hope this is the only day you guys 
have to be out here." 
</P>
<P>
Collins and his team of administrators had crafted what he called "a complete 
reorganization of the entire school" in preparation for Monday's strike, 
juggling classroom assignments, schedules and supervision duties to allow the 
school's operation without most of its 132 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But, until students and substitutes began arriving at about 7:15 a.m., no one 
knew whether it was going to work. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of impending gang violence had circulated all day Friday, adding to the 
tension. Collins had dismissed the rumors. Early Monday, however, the unknown 
still loomed. "You can discount rumors, but you never know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Collins nervously radioed the front office, checking on the number of 
substitutes. "If I get about a dozen substitute teachers, we can be pretty 
secure," he said. "Less than that and we can't run the program we want to run." 
</P>
<P>
Only 10 substitutes arrived to work, and 15 of Grant's teachers crossed the 
picket line. But it didn't matter much because only 1,400 students, far fewer 
than Collins had anticipated, showed up. 
</P>
<P>
When the 8 a.m. class bell rang, Collins and Joe Walker, the assistant 
principal, began sweeping through the campus, locking doors and hustling 
confused stragglers in the direction of their classes. Students whose teachers 
did not show were sent to large gatherings in the school's two gymnasiums or an 
auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
In the gyms and the auditorium, little of substance was going on, as 
administrators and substitute and regular teachers struggled for control. One 
student foursome dealt a hand of cards. Paper airplanes flew. Students shot 
basketballs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Return to Order 
</P>
<P>
By second period, a meager amount of instruction was occurring. A biology 
teacher conducted a lecture on organs and cells. A substitute art teacher gave 
out an assignment on shapes. Another substitute explained the rules regarding 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a waste of time," said senior Adam Finer, 17, as he exited the campus 
with a group of students who said they were bored by the lack of instruction. 
"They spent half the time reading the rules to us, as if we can't read 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Still, students were generally cooperative. A few gang members were warned to 
leave campus, but by the beginning of third period the 39-acre campus appeared 
entirely calm. 
</P>
<P>
And Collins, the tension of the early morning having dissolved, was joking, 
exulting even, and saying that starting today real instruction and learning 
would begin again. "Now our plan will work perfectly, because the number of 
students is low," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Walker sounded a note of confidence. "The longer this goes on, the better 
we get at it," he said.

MOTHER DENIES PUTTING COCAINE IN BACKPACK

A Topanga Canyon woman charged with hiding cocaine in her daughter's backpack 
testified Monday that the drug belonged to a man who had borrowed her car, and 
that items police called drug paraphernalia were actually harmless household 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Christina Torres, 40, said the borrower had admitted to her that he had 
secreted the cocaine in the book bag, which was in the car when she loaned it 
to him the day before the drug was found. 
</P>
<P>
Although Torres did not identify the man, defense attorney Richard A. Walton 
said in an interview that he expected the name to emerge during 
cross-examination of the defendant today by Deputy Dist. Atty. Tracy Watson. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, a Colombian citizen, is on trial in Van Nuys Superior Court for child 
endangerment and possession of cocaine for sale. If convicted, she could be 
sentenced to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to Canoga Park Lutheran School on June 13 after Torres' 
daughter and eight other students tasted the powdery substance, which several 
described in court as "yucky." None were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Torres also testified Monday that dozens of items confiscated from her by 
police and characterized by prosecutor Watson as "paraphernalia of the kind 
commonly used by cocaine dealers" were actually everyday household goods. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the stack of small plastic bags taken from her home was used by 
her to measure out in advance her vitamin doses. Two of the three pagers seized 
by police were inoperable, Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
The portable cellular phone police confiscated from her belonged to a friend, 
and she was carrying it around because she planned to fix it for the friend, 
Torres said. A powdery substance found in her car -- which police experts said 
was chalk of the variety commonly used to dilute cocaine -- was "some kind of 
good luck powder" used in a religious ritual, Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant said she went to the school soon after lunch to retrieve the 
cocaine from her 8-year-old daughter's backpack in response to a call from the 
man who had borrowed the car. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses called by Watson testified earlier that Torres created a scene in a 
classroom, demanding the plastic bag, and that she eventually retrieved it from 
the principal's office. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called after employees in the school office became suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
Torres testified that she promptly flushed the drug down a toilet at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they later collected slightly more than one-half gram of cocaine 
that the children had scattered about. 
</P>
<P>
Torres has been free on $100,000 bail.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SIMI VALLEY MAN ARRESTED IN FAKE THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Simi Valley man allegedly faked an armed robbery Monday at the gas station 
where he worked and botched an attempt to cover it up, Simi Valley police said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael White, 20, told police that two men armed with handguns took the 
station's cash and his personal jewelry, covering up the station's surveillance 
cameras in the process, Lt. Neal Rein said. 
</P>
<P>
But when police reviewed the videotape, it showed White covering a camera, Rein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
White was arrested on suspicion of embezzlement, a felony, and filing a false 
police report, a misdemeanor, after police found $670 in cash and White's 
jewelry in his car parked at 1st Street and Los Angeles Avenue, Rein said.

MURDOCH TV UNIT SUES DISNEY FOR $1.5 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
SKY TELEVISION CLAIMS AGREEMENT FOR SATELLITE VENTURE WAS DERAILED BY UNFAIR 
BUSINESS TACTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sky Television, media baron Rupert Murdoch's British TV unit, demanded $1.5 
billion from Walt Disney Co. in a lawsuit filed Monday that charged Disney with 
breaching its agreement to join the Murdoch company in a satellite TV venture. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses Disney of fraud and pits Barry Diller, who heads Fox Inc. and 
other Murdoch entertainment ventures, against Disney Chairman Michael Eisner, a 
longtime former associate of Diller's at Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims that Disney used 
unfair tactics to derail an agreement under which it was to join the unit of 
Murdoch's Australian-based News Corp. in launching two satellite movie channels 
in Great Britain this year. It demands $1 billion in punitive damages and $500 
million in actual damages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Four Broadcast Channels 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the complaint says: "While Disney spends millions to create the 
appearance that they are honest and wholesome and that the Disney name stands 
for such qualities, the fact is that defendants' common pattern and practice is 
to ignore and deny their agreements and to use economic leverage to exact 
unjustified concessions from those with whom they contract and deal." 
</P>
<P>
Disney spokesman Thomas Deegan read a one-line statement in response to the 
suit. It said: "We have great regard for Mr. Murdoch and his accomplishments, 
but we are surprised at this suit, which has absolutely no merit." 
</P>
<P>
Sky Television operates four direct broadcast British TV channels over a 
satellite that was launched Feb. 5. Last November, Disney agreed to join 
Murdoch in operating one of the channels, Sky Movies, as a pay service offering 
feature films and in launching the Disney Channel on the satellite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Available to Defuse Problems' 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, however, Disney executives failed to provide their share 
of funding for the venture, dragged their feet on decisions to force a change 
in terms and finally "repudiated" the agreement May 12, despite repeated pleas 
by Diller for cooperation from Disney executives. 
</P>
<P>
In an April 28 letter to Eisner and Disney President Frank Wells, a copy of 
which was filed with the suit, Diller wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"We have experienced the normal difficulties that one would expect in the case 
of a new venture, particularly in a new and ground-breaking business. We 
believe, however, these pale to insignificance when measured against the 
accomplishments of each of us. . . . To further the process, I offer to make 
myself personally available on a 'hotline' basis in order to defuse and resolve 
any potential problems that may arise." 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, Eisner and Wells never answered the letter. 
</P>
<P>
In its suit, Murdoch's company asks the court to block Disney from selling its 
programming in Great Britain until the dispute is resolved. Bertram Fields, an 
attorney for Murdoch, said no hearing has been set in the case, which was 
assigned to Judge Dion Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
Sky Television, one of several ventures seeking to tap the increasingly 
deregulated European television market, has been hampered by the initial 
unavailability of its satellite receiving dishes but still aims to reach more 
than a million British homes by year-end. Satellite TV is broadcast directly to 
a receiver in the viewer's home rather than over cable. 
</P>
<P>
The service has been competing with British Satellite Broadcasting, another 
satellite service that expects to begin operation later this year, for packages 
of Hollywood films. 
</P>
<P>
BSB secured rights to films from Warner Bros. and MGM/UA, among others, last 
year. According to the lawsuit, Sky Television's negotiations with Warner and 
other studios have been hampered by Disney's "dilatory behavior" -- which Sky 
Television alleged was meant to force a readjustment in terms or cancellation 
of the venture. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is the latest in a series of big-money disputes that have rocked the 
entertainment business. In other recent actions, Paramount Pictures sued Viacom 
for breaching a major pay TV contract, even as the two were said by Wall Street 
analysts to be discussing a merger; Viacom sued competitor HBO, in a move that 
some observers believed might complicate a pending merger between Warner 
Communications and HBO's parent, Time Inc., and MCA locked horns in a Canadian 
court battle with Cineplex-Odeon, its partly owned subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Diller, as chairman of Paramount, and Eisner, as president, were one of the 
most successful teams in the history of movie making before the breakup of 
their regime, which produced "Flashdance," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Beverly 
Hills Cop" and other hits. Diller left to join Twentieth Century Fox Film 
Corp., then owned by Marvin Davis, in 1984. Eisner immediately left Paramount 
for Disney, and was soon joined by many ex-Paramount executives.

OGILVY GROUP AGREES TO DEAL WITH WPP FOR $864 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than two years after it rocked the ad world with a hostile takeover of the 
J. Walter Thompson ad agency, the British marketing firm WPP Group on Monday 
did it again by agreeing to acquire the Ogilvy Group for $864 million. 
</P>
<P>
"This combination will create the finest advertising and marketing services 
group in the world," said Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, in a 
statement released just before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Top Ogilvy executives will remain with the merged agency, including Kenneth 
Roman, who retains the title of chairman at Ogilvy and gains the title of vice 
chairman of WPP. 
</P>
<P>
"While we would have preferred to remain independent," Roman said in a 
statement, "we have become convinced a combination with WPP represented the 
most attractive course for the future." 
</P>
<P>
David Ogilvy, the 77-year-old founder of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, will become 
chairman of WPP. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Run Autonomously 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition places under one corporate umbrella two of the best-known and 
most established names in advertising -- Ogilvy &amp; Mather and J. Walter 
Thompson. Executives say, however, the two agencies will be run autonomously. 
</P>
<P>
The deal creates the world's largest advertising and communications company -- 
topping that of rival British advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. An 
expanded WPP would post annual revenue exceeding $2 billion, while Saatchi 
&amp; Saatchi would rank second with revenue of about $1.6 billion, analysts 
say. WPP's annual billings will now exceed $13.5 billion. Well over half of the 
Fortune 500 companies will become WPP clients. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is subject to approval of WPP shareholders and the tender of at least 
two-thirds of Ogilvy's outstanding shares. Ogilvy Group's annual meeting is 
scheduled today in New York. WPP has scheduled a special shareholder meeting 
for June 14. 
</P>
<P>
WPP and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi now find themselves locked in a fierce rivalry 
for global pre-eminence not only in advertising, but also in media-buying 
wallop. The holding company whose advertising agencies have the most 
media-buying power often commands the best prices in purchasing advertising 
time on television and space in newspapers and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Although news of the anticipated agreement led to heavy over-the-counter 
trading of Ogilvy stock on Monday, Ogilvy Group closed unchanged from Friday's 
close at $53.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been speculation for nearly six months that Sorrell planned 
to acquire Ogilvy, his first bid of $45 per share was not made public until May 
1. Ogilvy executives responded by saying they intended to keep the agency 
independent. One week later, however, Sorrell raised his bid to $50 per share. 
The agency will be sold for $54 a share. 
</P>
<P>
For the 44-year-old advertising executive, the purchase of Ogilvy not only 
makes for a sweet victory, but perhaps even sweeter revenge, Sorrell-watchers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Sorrell was formerly the chief financial officer at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi who 
masterminded many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. He left Saatchi in 1986 for 
reasons never made public. Since then, some analysts say almost all of 
Sorrell's efforts have been directed toward creating an empire that can 
out-muscle -- if not out-hustle -- Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. 
</P>
<P>
"What you've got here are guys who are really portfolio managers," said Greg M. 
Ostroff, vice president of research at the New York investment firm Goldman 
Sachs &amp; Co. "From that aspect, Sorrell would have some of the finest assets 
in the business." 
</P>
<P>
Executives from WPP and Ogilvy had essentially agreed on the price tag last 
week, but spent the weekend and most of Monday ironing out the responsibilities 
of key Ogilvy executives. 
</P>
<P>
David Ogilvy, who has not attended an Ogilvy annual meeting for several years, 
reportedly flew to New York late last week to attend this one. He was 
unavailable for comment on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the prestigious Ogilvy name, WPP will inherit most of Ogilvy's client 
roster. When WPP purchased J. Walter Thompson, it picked up such key clients as 
Ford Motor Co. and Eastman-Kodak. Now, with the Ogilvy purchase, it also adds 
such select names as American Express and AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy's Los Angeles office -- regarded as one of Ogilvy's most profitable -- 
is expected to at least initially escape unscathed from the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"About the only thing that's different is we'll have a different owner," said 
Gerald D. McGee, executive vice president and managing director of Ogilvy's Los 
Angeles office, which employs 220. "This is a financial transaction only. It 
will not change our culture." 
</P>
<P>
But Mattel Toys, which accounts for about one-quarter of the business in 
Ogilvy's West Coast office, has reacted coolly to the WPP bid. Mattel remained 
undecided Monday whether it will review its business with Ogilvy. Glenn 
Bozarth, director of public relations at Hawthorne-based Mattel, said: "It's 
still up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Investment analysts and top industry executives look with mixed reviews on the 
prospect of WPP buying Ogilvy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a shame," said John S. Bowen, chairman and chief executive of the 
privately held New York ad firm, D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles. "This 
business of buying and selling ad agencies has gone too far. Any agency that is 
publicly held is subject to being taken over by anyone who wants to take it 
over." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Sorrell doesn't have his supporters on Wall Street. "He's talented, 
charming and an extremely good businessman," said Andrew Wallach, a vice 
president at the New York investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert. "He's been 
badly portrayed by the press as an ogre." 
</P>
<P>
Under Sorrell, Wallach said, "you'll see an aggressive attempt to improve the 
management of the company and cut costs without hurting the creative product." 
He said Sorrell will probably cut costs by closing some of Ogilvy's less 
profitable foreign offices. WPP will also save Ogilvy money by purchasing media 
time at larger discounts -- now that WPP is nearly twice the size. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorrell does not intend to destroy the Ogilvy culture," said Wallach. "That is 
the last thing he wants to do."

DOWNWARD SLIDE HITS DOWN-HOME MERCURY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Chairman Leonard Shane might be called a little 
old-fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
Until a few years ago, one of his favorite marketing tools was to hire school 
teachers to walk door-to-door and encourage neighbors to visit the nearest 
Mercury branch, where they could pick up a free pad of personalized stationery. 
</P>
<P>
And he still prefers to promote the Huntington Beach-based S&amp;L by 
sponsoring lunches for local civic groups rather than by taking out newspaper 
ads as his competitors do. 
</P>
<P>
"A basic, good idea doesn't get dated," Shane said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Basic is the word to describe Mercury S&amp;L, which was founded by Shane in 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
While some S&amp;Ls have evolved into brokers of "junk bonds" and wholesale car 
loans, Shane has stuck with conventional mortgages, preached the value of home 
ownership and criticized less traditional thrift operators who pushed industry 
deregulation to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the 66-year-old Shane has had problems of his own with 
regulators and accountants, and his institution is stumbling. Shane has brought 
his son William back as manager of branch operations for Mercury's 25-branch 
network, a key role in the institution, and the chairman said he hopes he can 
retire soon. William Shane left in late 1987, citing a desire to "pursue other 
ideas." He opened a sports novelty business. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, regulators forced Mercury to reduce the value of some of its 
assets. The reduction turned a $6.1-million profit originally reported for 1988 
into a $7.4-million loss. The writedown ended many years of profitability. 
James Wilson, an analyst at Sutro &amp; Co., a San Francisco brokerage firm, 
said the writedown has ignited rumors that Mercury is experiencing a capital 
crunch that could force Shane to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Shane said he is not negotiating a sale of the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the return of William Shane, who was Mercury president before 
resigning, might mean that Leonard Shane intends to keep control of the thrift 
in his family. Members of the Shane family own about 15% of Mercury's stock. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen years before Shane started Mercury, the Chicago native was an outspoken 
political advocate of the social, as well as economic, importance of national 
policy that promoted home ownership. A former journalist and advertising 
executive, Shane gained prominence in the 1950s by running national campaigns 
of Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Estes Kefauver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Party Activist 
</P>
<P>
Shane said he remains a party activist and was one of Orange County's biggest 
financial backers of Michael Dukakis, the unsuccessful 1988 Democratic 
presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Shane, a heavy-set, sometimes loud and exuberant and sometimes gentle and 
grandfatherly man, admits to delivering emotion-packed speeches. 
</P>
<P>
"If I believe in something, I put all my effort behind it, whether it is with 
politics or business or religion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, Shane, currently national vice chairman of the United Jewish 
Appeal, has led educational missions around the world to increase awareness of 
the rights of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
It was only in the early 1980s that Shane stopped hiring school teachers to go 
door-to-door through new housing developments to encourage neighbors to stop in 
the nearby Mercury Savings &amp; Loan branch for a memo pad and a friendly 
hello. 
</P>
<P>
Shane said he stopped that approach only because neighborhoods surrounding most 
of Mercury's branches are now developed. 
</P>
<P>
The memo pads are still free to anyone who drops into one of Mercury's 25 
branches, and most locations have rooms for local civic groups to conduct 
meetings, with full lunches paid for by Mercury. The money spent on the lunches 
and memo pads makes up most of Mercury's promotional budget. No money is spent 
on media advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Frederick, president of Frederick Research in New York, said Mercury's 
down-home style as the trustworthy safe keeper for a neighborhood's deposits 
has established one of the most loyal customer bases in a business where 
depositors hop from one institution to another chasing interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't find that style anywhere else in California. I don't know where you 
would find it," Frederick said. 
</P>
<P>
Old-style ways of doing business often are not the most cost-effective, and 
observers said that over the years that fact has not been lost on Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
"There are cost improvements that could have been made at Mercury. And Leonard 
knows that. He's been making them the last couple of years to boost Mercury's 
value," said Wilson, the Sutro analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst said some of the inefficiency is caused by centralized decision 
making that revolves around Shane. One former employee, exaggerating the point, 
said every loan considered by Mercury is reviewed by Shane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Computer in Office 
</P>
<P>
While Mercury's operation is automated, Shane doesn't have a computer in his 
office. An old manual typewriter, a historical showpiece in some offices, is a 
practical tool in Shane's. 
</P>
<P>
Shane's approach was not questioned through much of the 1980s while Mercury was 
prospering and other S&amp;Ls were failing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, when Shane headed the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the central 
trade group for S&amp;Ls, he gave impassioned speeches and Senate testimony 
warning of the dangers of deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
Shane said then, and three years earlier when he headed the California Savings 
&amp; Loan League, that institutions involved in more speculative activities 
were a major threat to themselves and the economy. A more vocal group of 
S&amp;L operators argued at the time that the industry must be deregulated for 
it to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard has always seemed to understand what the industry is about. And he's 
always been proved right," said Jim Grohl, an executive with the U.S. League in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, Shane was able to juggle the management of his institution with 
extensive civic duties, such as being a member of the Los Angeles Coliseum 
Commission and a local school board. However, some analysts said the time he 
committed to the U.S. League in 1984 eventually took its toll on Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
At the company's shareholder meeting in 1986, Shane predicted that 1986 profit 
would top the record earnings of $11.1 million in 1985. Instead, 1986 marked 
the start of an earnings slide. Earnings that year reached only $9.4 million, 
as Mercury increased by $27.6 million its reserve for loan and real estate 
losses. That was a sixfold jump from the amount of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Mercury's losses from loans, foreclosed losses in real estate and 
direct involvement in real estate totaled $23.4 million, compared to only $2 
million two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard to Determine 
</P>
<P>
Mercury is now among the S&amp;L money losers. And its health has become 
difficult to determine because Mercury, which has yet to hire a new accountant 
to audit its books, missed the Securities and Exchange Commission April 15 
deadline to file 1988 financial results. At the end of 1987, the institution 
did have more than the required 3% of assets in capital. 
</P>
<P>
In Mercury's recent battle with federal regulators, Shane said regulators 
disagreed with Mercury's accounting of some transactions and loan-loss reserves 
dating to 1984. The fight ended with Mercury writing down the value of some 
assets and increasing its general loss reserves by $12.2 million. Mercury has 
not reported its total loss reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's loss, which one analyst said was caused by overvaluing mortgage 
income in previous years, reduces the company's capital and raises concern that 
Mercury might not be able to meet higher capital requirements that analysts 
expect Congress to impose. The capital is the institution's insurance against 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be little choice but to sell," said Henry Dahlgren, an analyst at 
Cruttenden &amp; Co., a brokerage in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boost May Be in Store 
</P>
<P>
As part of its multibillion-dollar bailout of the virtually bankrupt Federal 
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., Congress is studying a recommendation from 
the Bush Administration that S&amp;Ls double their capital reserve to 6% of 
their assets by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Others said Shane will be able to maintain control of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard Shane has friends all over Wall Street. If he needs money, he can come 
here," Frederick said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Chairman Leonard Shane might be called a little 
old-fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
Until a few years ago, one of his favorite marketing tools was to hire 
schoolteachers to walk door-to-door and encourage neighbors to visit the 
nearest Mercury branch, where they could pick up a free pad of personalized 
stationery. 
</P>
<P>
And he still prefers to promote the Huntington Beach-based S&amp;L by 
sponsoring lunches for local civic groups rather than by taking out newspaper 
ads as his competitors do. 
</P>
<P>
"A basic, good idea doesn't get dated," Shane said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Basic is the word to describe Mercury S&amp;L, which was founded by Shane in 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
While some S&amp;Ls have evolved into brokers of junk bonds and wholesale car 
loans, Shane has stuck with conventional mortgages, preached the value of home 
ownership and criticized less traditional thrift operators who pushed industry 
deregulation to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the 66-year-old Shane has had problems of his own with 
regulators and accountants, and his institution is stumbling. Shane has brought 
his son William back as manager of branch operations for Mercury's 25-branch 
network, a key role in the institution, and the chairman said he hopes he can 
retire soon. William Shane left in late 1987, citing a desire to "pursue other 
ideas." He opened a sports novelty business. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, regulators forced Mercury to reduce the value of some of its 
assets. The reduction turned a $6.1-million profit originally reported for 1988 
into a $7.4-million loss. The writedown ended many years of profitability. 
James Wilson, an analyst at Sutro &amp; Co., a San Francisco brokerage firm, 
said the writedown has ignited rumors that Mercury is experiencing a capital 
crunch that could force Shane to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Shane said he is not negotiating a sale of the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the return of William Shane, who was Mercury president before 
resigning, might mean that Leonard Shane intends to keep control of the thrift 
in his family. Members of the Shane family own about 15% of Mercury's stock. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen years before Shane started Mercury, the Chicago native was an outspoken 
political advocate of the social, as well as economic, importance of national 
policy that promoted home ownership. A former journalist and advertising 
executive, Shane gained prominence in the 1950s by running national campaigns 
of Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Estes Kefauver. 
</P>
<P>
Shane said he remains a party activist and was one of Orange County's biggest 
financial backers of Michael S. Dukakis, the unsuccessful 1988 Democratic 
presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Shane, a heavy-set, sometimes loud and exuberant and sometimes gentle and 
grandfatherly man, admits to delivering emotion-packed speeches. 
</P>
<P>
"If I believe in something, I put all my effort behind it, whether it is with 
politics or business or religion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, Shane, currently national vice chairman of the United Jewish 
Appeal, has led educational missions around the world to increase awareness of 
the rights of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
It was only in the early 1980s that Shane stopped hiring schoolteachers to go 
door-to-door through new housing developments to encourage neighbors to stop in 
the nearby Mercury Savings &amp; Loan branch for a memo pad and a friendly 
hello. 
</P>
<P>
Shane said he stopped that approach only because neighborhoods surrounding most 
of Mercury's branches are now developed. 
</P>
<P>
The memo pads are still free to anyone who drops into one of Mercury's 25 
branches, and most locations have rooms for local civic groups to conduct 
meetings, with full lunches paid for by Mercury. The money spent on the lunches 
and memo pads makes up most of Mercury's promotional budget. No money is spent 
on media advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Frederick, president of Frederick Research in New York, said Mercury's 
down-home style as the trustworthy safe keeper for a neighborhood's deposits 
has established one of the most loyal customer bases in a business where 
depositors hop from one institution to another chasing interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't find that style anywhere else in California. I don't know where you 
would find it," Frederick said. 
</P>
<P>
Old-style ways of doing business often are not the most cost-effective, and 
observers said that over the years that fact has not been lost on Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
"There are cost improvements that could have been made at Mercury. And Leonard 
knows that. He's been making them the last couple of years to boost Mercury's 
value," said Wilson, the Sutro analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst said some of the inefficiency is caused by centralized decision 
making that revolves around Shane. One former employee, exaggerating the point, 
said every loan considered by Mercury is reviewed by Shane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Computer in Office 
</P>
<P>
While Mercury's operation is automated, Shane doesn't have a computer in his 
office. An old manual typewriter, a historical showpiece in some offices, is a 
practical tool in Shane's. 
</P>
<P>
Shane's approach was not questioned through much of the 1980s while Mercury was 
prospering and other S&amp;Ls were failing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, when Shane headed the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the central 
trade group for S&amp;Ls, he gave impassioned speeches and Senate testimony 
warning of the dangers of deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
Shane said then, and three years earlier when he headed the California Savings 
&amp; Loan League, that institutions involved in more speculative activities 
were a major threat to themselves and the economy. A more vocal group of 
S&amp;L operators argued at the time that the industry must be deregulated for 
it to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard has always seemed to understand what the industry is about. And he's 
always been proved right," said Jim Grohl, an executive with the U.S. League in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, Shane was able to juggle the management of his institution with 
extensive civic duties, such as being a member of the Los Angeles Coliseum 
Commission and a local school board. However, some analysts said the time he 
committed to the U.S. League in 1984 eventually took its toll on Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
At the company's shareholder meeting in 1986, Shane predicted that 1986 profit 
would top the record earnings of $11.1 million in 1985. Instead, 1986 marked 
the start of an earnings slide. Earnings that year reached only $9.4 million, 
as Mercury increased by $27.6 million its reserve for loan and real estate 
losses. That was a sixfold jump from the amount of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Mercury's losses from loans, foreclosed losses in real estate and 
direct involvement in real estate totaled $23.4 million, compared to only $2 
million two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard to Determine 
</P>
<P>
Mercury is now among the S&amp;L money losers. And its health has become 
difficult to determine because Mercury, which has yet to hire a new accountant 
to audit its books, missed the Securities and Exchange Commission April 15 
deadline to file 1988 financial results. At the end of 1987, the institution 
did have more than the required 3% of assets in capital. 
</P>
<P>
In Mercury's recent battle with federal regulators, Shane said regulators 
disagreed with Mercury's accounting of some transactions and loan-loss reserves 
dating to 1984. The fight ended with Mercury writing down the value of some 
assets and increasing its general loss reserves by $12.2 million. Mercury has 
not reported its total loss reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's loss, which one analyst said was caused by overvaluing mortgage 
income in previous years, reduces the company's capital and raises concern that 
Mercury might not be able to meet higher capital requirements that analysts 
expect Congress to impose. The capital is the institution's insurance against 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be little choice but to sell," said Henry Dahlgren, an analyst at 
Cruttenden &amp; Co., a brokerage in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boost May Be in Store 
</P>
<P>
As part of its multibillion-dollar bailout of the virtually bankrupt Federal 
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., Congress is studying a recommendation from 
the Bush Administration that S&amp;Ls double their capital reserve to 6% of 
their assets by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Others said Shane will be able to maintain control of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard Shane has friends all over Wall Street. If he needs money, he can come 
here," Frederick said. 
</P>
<P>
Shane apparently considered a sale in late 1987. One week after William Shane 
resigned as president after 13 years as a Mercury employee, Mercury directors 
announced that they hired Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco investment 
banking firm, to handle inquiries about the possible sale of part or all of the 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
Shane's interest in selling at that time may have come from a growing dismay 
about troubled institutions in the industry, and a growing interest in other 
areas. In 1987, Shane joined the board of the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. In 1988, he served as chairman of the U.S. League's legislative 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The negatives in the industry of the last couple of years have taken a little 
bit of the enjoyment off his work," said William Shane. "But the intensity of 
his passion for Mercury is no less now." 
</P>
<P>
This year's run-ins with accountants and regulators have taken a toll on Shane, 
friends said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been worried about Leonard, and I've hoped for some time that he could 
relax," said Paul Prior, a longtime personal friend of Shane, who is chairman 
of Ameriana Savings in New Castle, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he is distressed with the regulators," said Prior, also a leader in the 
U.S. League. "William's return might be what Leonard needs. William is a very 
good manager." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

STRONG U.S.-JAPAN TIES URGED; 
</P>
<P>
REPRESENTATIVES OF BOTH NATIONS HEAR DEUKMEJIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Reflecting Japan's increased economic stature in the United States, Gov. George 
Deukmejian called on Japanese and U.S. officials Monday to "keep our 
relationship strong" and "work even harder to lower trade barriers." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian spoke at the 20th Japan-American Conference of Mayors and Chamber of 
Commerce Presidents in downtown Los Angeles, becoming the first California 
governor to attend the session since the every-other-year event began in Tokyo 
in 1951. He joined Tokyo Governor Shunichi Suzuki, Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley and 349 delegates from some 90 cities in the United States and Japan to 
explore the conference theme of "Harmonizing the Japan-American relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the speech-making at the conference at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown 
Los Angeles, however, focused on the recent tension between the United States 
and Japan in the wake of Congressional pressure on U.S. Trade Representative 
Carla A. Hills to cite Japan and other countries for imposing unfair trading 
barriers on U.S. products. The U.S. trade deficit with Japan last year was 
$52.1 billion and is projected to be $50.1 billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharp Reaction 
</P>
<P>
Nobuo Matsunaga, Japan's ambassador to the United States, reacted sharply to 
the U.S. criticism of Japan in a lengthy and emotional speech to conference 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a mistake to observe the economic relationship of Japan and the U.S. in 
an adversarial way," said Matsunaga. "It is also a misunderstanding to think 
that trade imbalances resulted from trade barriers." He said other factors such 
as lower U.S. personal savings rates and big U.S. budget deficits have 
contributed to trade imbalances. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not deny that there is more to be done by Japan in order to sustain the 
prosperity and the stability of the world," Matsunaga continued. But, he said, 
"the tide of frustration seems to be increasing toward Japan when the substance 
of our relationship is (actually) improving." 
</P>
<P>
Yet even Deukmejian, who credited Japan with playing "a significant role in" 
creating economic "prosperity" in California, voiced criticism at the 
conference about Japan's failure to lower its trade barriers to U.S. goods. 
"Just as we have opened our markets to our friends overseas, we would like them 
to reciprocate by opening their markets to us," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
The conference, which is alternately hosted by Japan and the United States, has 
long been an important forum for addressing critical issues affecting the two 
countries. Organizers said this year's conference drew a record number of 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
"There is great potential for a mutually profitable relationship," said Walter 
Beran, former chairman of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and head of 
the conference organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for Businesses 
</P>
<P>
Among those hoping to profit was delegate Bill Harris, the mayor of Lincoln, 
Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said two companies based in Japan have built plants in Lincoln since the 
city began attending the Japan-American conferences to woo new business. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to show them you appreciate their business," Harris explained. "They 
like to know their investment is safe. And it's safe in Lincoln, Nebraska." 
</P>
<P>
But most conference participants from east of the Rocky Mountains were less 
hopeful about wooing Japanese investment -- an attitude Mayor Bradley 
attributed to general American pessimism about U.S. economic relations with 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a difference between the attitude of Washington and California," 
regarding relations with Japan, Bradley said. Noting that in contrast to the 
United States as a whole, California has a positive trade balance with the 
Japanese, Bradley added: "If everybody else were as aggressive as we have been 
(seeking trade with Japan) we wouldn't be having this discussion" at the 
conference about trade deficits.

JUSTICES BACK STOCKBROKERS IN FRAUD DISPUTES; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTORS MUST SEEK REDRESS FROM INDUSTRY ARBITRATORS, NOT FEDERAL COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, in a victory for the securities industry, ruled Monday that 
many unhappy investors who believe that they were cheated by their stockbroker 
must take their complaints to an industry arbitrator, not a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-4 ruling helps the stock firms avoid potentially huge damage awards by 
juries, which are often sympathetic to small investors who believe that they 
were bilked by their brokers. Instead, if an investor signs a standard contract 
pledging to take any dispute to arbitration, the justices said, he must abide 
by that deal. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the securities industry, in briefs to the court, say these 
arbitration hearings are fair, speedy and unbiased. More than half of the 
arbitrators may have no direct ties to the industry, and in 1987, 55% of the 
customers' cases that went before arbitration resulted in a damage award for 
the customer, the justices were told. 
</P>
<P>
But a Texas lawyer who represents 17 widows who may have lost as much as 
$400,000 because of a shady broker said his clients would have much preferred 
to go to a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
"This way, you are playing on their home court," said attorney Denis Downey of 
Brownsville, who was on the losing end Monday. "They (arbitrators) may profess 
to be neutral, but they are picked by the industry. Plus, even if you win in 
arbitration, you usually don't win much. Maybe a few thousand dollars in 
damages if you have lost $200,000." 
</P>
<P>
Federal court juries cannot only award a plaintiff damages to cover all of his 
or her losses, but can also tack on extra, huge punitive damage penalties to 
punish the broker or his company for their wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the ruling Monday was no surprise. Two years ago, the court issued a 
similar ruling concerning the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Then, 
investors had sued their broker in federal court under the 1934 law, but the 
justices said the door to the court was closed because their contract language 
called for arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the 17 Texas widows had filed a federal court suit under the 
Securities Act of 1933. They contended, among other things, that the broker who 
worked for Shearson-American Express had churned their accounts and put their 
money into the most risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
They relied on a 1953 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Wilko vs. Swan which 
specifically said that investors can use the 1933 Securities Act to get into 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, the conservative majority simply overruled the 1953 
decision, saying it was now "outmoded." 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that Wilko rested on suspicion of arbitration as a method of 
weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to would-be 
complainants," wrote Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, "it has fallen far out of step 
with our current strong endorsement of the federal statutes favoring this 
method of resolving disputes." 
</P>
<P>
The four more liberal members -- Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan 
Jr., Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun -- accused their colleagues of 
"judicial activism" since Congress has had 36 years to rewrite the securities 
law if it believed the Wilko ruling incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling not only spares the securities industry a big headache, but does the 
same for the federal court system. In 1987, 2,844 securities-related complaints 
were filed in federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
In its brief endorsing arbitration, the securities industry noted that the 
average U.S. judge handles 460 cases, meaning that the securities complaints 
alone could fill the schedules of six judges for a year.

NBC WILL ADD ONLY 4 HOURS OF NEW SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
NBC, riding a record-setting crest of 47 consecutive weekly prime-time 
victories, said Monday that it will stick with a good thing come fall by adding 
only four hours of new programming to its nighttime lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Befitting its standing as ratings leader for four years running, NBC said four 
nights of programming will return intact, two will be freshened up with one 
half-hour comedy apiece and Friday night will be overhauled with three new 
hourlong dramas. It was the first announcement by any network of plans for the 
1989-90 season. Among the shows NBC will replace are two veterans -- "Family 
Ties," which had its final broadcast last Sunday, and "Miami Vice," which will 
present its final episode this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Also scrubbed were a host of first-year entries that had aired at different 
times this season: "Nightingales," "Father Dowling Mysteries," "Unsub," "Nearly 
Departed," "Dream Street," "The Jim Henson Hour," "One of the Boys" and "Nick 
and Hillary" (a revamped, comedy version of the hour drama "Tattinger's.") 
</P>
<P>
The new shows are: 
</P>
<P>
* "The Nutt House" (Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m.), a comedy starring Cloris Leachman 
and Harvey Korman as the managers of a family owned New York City hotel. The 
show, from Touchstone Television, has as executive producers Mel Brooks and 
Alan Spencer ("Sledge Hammer"). 
</P>
<P>
* "Sister Kate" (Sundays at 8 p.m.), a comedy featuring "Dynasty" star 
Stephanie Beacham as a no-nonsense nun charged with keeping an unruly band of 
orphans in check. 
</P>
<P>
* "Baywatch" (Fridays at 8 p.m.), a series from GTG Entertainment, based on an 
NBC movie starring David Hasselhoff ("Knight Rider") and Parker Stevenson 
("Hardy Boys") about a group of Malibu lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
* "Hardball" (Fridays at 9 p.m.), starring John Ashton ("Beverly Hills Cop") as 
"a hip cop pushing 45 years old" who is sure he can out-hustle any younger cop 
on the beat until he is teamed with an irreverent young partner (Richard 
Tyson). 
</P>
<P>
* "Mancuso, FBI" (Fridays at 10 p.m.), starring Robert Loggia, reprising his 
role as FBI agent Nick Mancuso from the NBC miniseries "Favorite Son."

Former S&amp;L Owners' Trial Delayed: U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon has 
delayed the criminal trial of the former owners of Orange-based Ramona Savings 
&amp; Loan until June 13 because of a scheduling conflict. John L. Molinaro and 
Donald P. Mangano were scheduled to stand trial begining today on more than 30 
criminal charges including bank fraud and conspiracy in connection with a Palm 
Springs real estate deal that regulators say contributed to Ramona's September, 
1986, collapse. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office said a lengthy 
civil lawsuit Kenyon is currently hearing forced the postponement.

STOCKS KEEP UP BRISK PACE AS DOW RISES 24.19

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market kept moving ahead Monday, following through on its strong 
rally at the end of last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials climbed 24.19 to 2,463.89 on top of its 
56.82-point jump Friday, establishing a new post-crash high for the second 
straight session. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 927 up, 576 down and 491 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 179.35 million shares, down from 221.49 million 
Friday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades 
in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, 
totaled 212.53 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Friday's surge prompted buying of stocks by money managers at 
investing institutions who were fearful of missing out on a continuing advance 
in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
The catalyst for the market's latest advance came Friday in the government's 
report of a smaller-than-expected 0.4% increase in the producer price index of 
finished goods for April. 
</P>
<P>
That sent open-market interest rates tumbling and increased hopes that the 
Federal Reserve was succeeding in its effort to curb inflation without pushing 
the economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
As the new trading week began, there was talk of more favorable inflation news 
to come when the monthly data on the consumer price index is issued Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts cautioned, however, that those hopes might not be fulfilled. Wall 
Street estimates call for a CPI increase of 0.5% to 0.8%, after a rise of 0.5% 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blue Chips Fare Well 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard led the active list, down 3 3/4 at 53 3/8 on turnover of about 
3.4 million shares. The company said its operating results for the fiscal 
quarter ended April 30 fell short of analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
But the selling in that prominent stock did not spread to other blue chip and 
technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up 1 1/4 at 52 1/4; 
International Business Machines, up 2 at 112 3/4; American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph, up 1/2 at 34 1/2, and General Motors, up 7/8 at 40 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stock prices ended lower in the slowest trading this year with 
investors reluctant to buy stocks with the yen falling against the dollar. The 
Nikkei index lost 150.04, or 0.44%, to 33,716.29 after closing down 215.16 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices rose in subdued trading on the London Stock Exchange, 
boosted by Wall Street's healthy performance Friday and a strong advance by the 
dollar. At the close of trading, the Financial Times 100-share index was up 
14.2, or 0.7%, at 2,149.9. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar surged in foreign exchange Monday, reaching more than two-year highs 
against several key currencies in sometimes hectic worldwide trading, despite 
continued central bank intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York said its late bid was 
$374.10, down $2.15. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said several factors helped strengthen the dollar, including 
firmness in U.S. interest rates and political instability in Japan because of 
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's scandal plagued resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate currency buyers and speculators have also been encouraged by the 
dollar's ability to shrug off last week's strong intervention by central banks, 
dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
They said reports of moderate dollar selling by the Bank of Japan and the 
Federal Reserve throughout the trading session Monday also did little to change 
market sentiment toward the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clearly the preferred investment vehicle right now for global 
investments," said Earl I. Johnson, a trader at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in 
Chicago. "It's kind of developing a bandwagon effect." 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was strongest against the West German mark in U.S. dealings, 
reaching a nearly 2 1/2-year high. It also rose sharply against the Japanese 
yen and British pound, although profit taking brought it down from its highs of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, the dollar reached a 34-month high against the Swiss franc, 28-month 
highs against the West German mark and the French franc, a 19-month high 
against the British pound and an eight-month high against the Italian lira. 
</P>
<P>
All European markets, except in Britain and Italy, were closed Monday for the 
Pentecost holiday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar reached its highest level in 18 months, closing up 1 
Japanese yen at 136.80 yen. The dollar traded at 137.22 yen in London and at 
137.145 yen in New York, up from 136.10 yen Friday and the highest level since 
late December. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound dropped to $1.6385 from $1.6615 Friday. Sterling 
fetched $1.6410 in New York, up from $1.6615, a five-month high for the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late rates on Friday, 
included: 1.9389 West German marks, up from 1.9195; 1.7370 Swiss francs, up 
from 1.7175; 1.1897 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1879; 6.5550 French francs, up 
from 6.4880, and 1,409.00 Italian lire, up from 1,398.75. 
</P>
<P>
Late dollar rates in London, compared to rates in Europe late Friday: 1.9415 
German marks, up from 1.9195; 1.7438 Swiss francs, up from 1.7080; 6.5725 
French francs, up from 6.4870; 2.1905 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1407; 1,411.00 
Italian lire, up from 1,385.50, and 1.1905 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1868. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Government bond prices slipped Monday in the wake of a powerful rally last week 
that had been ignited by signs of modest inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate and municipal bond prices, however, finished slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 1/8 point, or about $1.25 for every 
$1,000 in face value. Its yield edged up to 8.84% from 8.83% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond had surged 25/16 points, or more than $23 per $1,000 
in face amount, during Friday's buying spree. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues were down 3/16 point, intermediate maturities were down 1/8 
point and long-term issues were mostly down by about 1/16 point, according to 
Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills held at 8.46% as the discount was steady 
at 8.19%. Yields on six-month bills increased to 8.75% as the discount rose 10 
basis points to 8.29%. Yields on 1-year bills moved ahead to 8.84% as the 
discount rose 10 basis points to 8.19%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 9.8125%, up from 9.5625% late Friday.

Pathe Communications Corp.: The Los Angeles motion picture maker and 
distributor reported that first-quarter profit slipped to $10.3 million from 
$10.5 million a year ago on revenue of $88.7 million, down from $92.6 million.

IBM, APPLE COPY EACH OTHER'S MAIN STRENGTHS

In a curious twist to the long-running battle for control of the personal 
computer market, industry rivals International Business Machines Corp. and 
Apple Computer Inc. are aping each other's greatest strengths, industry 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
In its most significant software move in years, IBM will introduce today a 
collection of software that will streamline the programs run on its machines, 
giving them a "look and feel" much like Apple's highly successful Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
The new software, analysts said, will allow IBM's machines to become more 
compatible by using a single system for controlling machines ranging from 
personal computers to mainframes. 
</P>
<P>
The Macintosh has long benefited from such a software system, which allows 
computer users to learn other programs more easily once they have mastered one 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Big Blue's innovations are not lost on Apple. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New System 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of software developers last week, the Cupertino, Calif.-based 
computer maker said it was designing an operating system that will provide 
easier access to mainframe computers such as IBM's for Apple users. 
</P>
<P>
Apple also said the operating system would have the ability to do several 
computations at once, one of the strengths of IBM's PS/2 line of personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said both computer makers are trying to make the most 
powerful machines on the market -- mainframes -- far more accessible to 
personal computer customers. 
</P>
<P>
IBM can use its new linking capacity to sell packages that include larger, 
higher-end machines, while Apple will emphasize its new ability to work with 
other computer systems, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The software introductions by IBM, the major producer of mainframes, would also 
test its ability to sell the PS/2 line of personal computers introduced two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, IBM's PC market share has slid, partly because of the lack of 
programs taking advantage of PS/2's Micro Channel architecture, which enables 
the system to do several tasks at once. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, IBM trailed Apple in the number of personal computers shipped -- 
1.23 million to 1.27 million -- for the first time since it entered the market 
in 1982, according to San Jose-based Dataquest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expensive Memory 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the slide: IBM's OS/2 operating system, which controls the basic 
functions of the PS/2, requires a large amount of memory, which is expensive. 
Last week, IBM announced rebates of up to $800 on memory packages to entice new 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"They came out with the price cuts because people are not migrating," said 
Paine Webber analyst Stephen Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said IBM still needs more software applications, such as spreadsheets, 
that take full advantage of the speed and power of the PS/2. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts said applications taking full advantage of the PS/2 would not be 
out until the fall, which is still months ahead of when Apple expects its 
System 7.0 upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
The degree to which PS/2 sales pick up will certainly affect Compaq Computer 
Corp., the largest producer of IBM-compatible PCs, or clones. 
</P>
<P>
Houston-based Compaq's sales have soared as IBM struggled through the 
transition to the PS/2. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq supplies about 7% of the computer units used by large companies, 
according to La Jolla-based Computer Intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say rising PS/2 sales would cut into Compaq's market share, which 
already dropped one point last week after IBM introduced its price rebates and 
two upgraded machines. 
</P>
<P>
As Apple and IBM continue to duel over leadership, other manufacturers have 
hedged their bets on whether the OS/2 system will become a standard.

MEXICO TO ALLOW 100% FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN SOME INDUSTRIES

Mexico will unveil a revamped law this week that allows foreign investors to 
buy into the tourist industry and drops other restrictions in some areas, the 
government newspaper El Nacional has reported. 
</P>
<P>
The new regulations, which are to take effect today, replace the 1973 Foreign 
Investment Law that set a 49% limit on non-Mexican capital participation in 
most areas of the economy, the paper said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which has long been considered outmoded and a drag on economic growth, 
has increasingly been waived in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The new law will permit 100% foreign investment in tourism, in-bond industries, 
or maquiladoras, and some forms of transportation, El Nacional said. 
</P>
<P>
It added, however, that only Mexican capital investment will be allowed in 
radio and television, retail banking, forestry, basic petrochemicals and oil 
exploration. 
</P>
<P>
A 49% limit on foreign capital would be enforced in the secondary petrochemical 
industry, most mining ventures and the fishing industry, El Nacional said. 
</P>
<P>
The old law placed a 100% ban on foreign investment in all sectors of the 
country's key petrochemical industry.

TOP-PAID SAN DIEGO EXECUTIVE DELIVERED FOR INTERMARK, TRITON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well known as a corporate wheeler-dealer, Charles (Red) Scott enhanced his 
reputation last year at the helm of Intermark, a La Jolla-based 
mini-conglomerate he has led as chief executive since 1970. He made deals both 
for Intermark and Triton Group, the La Jolla-based holding company controlled 
by Intermark. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who is also chairman of Triton Group, was compensated abundantly for his 
labors: His $1,888,045 total compensation in 1988 made him the highest-paid 
executive at a San Diego-based public company. The figure, which included 
$1,027,439 in gains from the sale of stock options and performance-related pay, 
includes Scott's compensation for his work at Triton. 
</P>
<P>
Scott guided Triton's 1988 sale of its Simplicity Patterns unit, a deal that 
resulted in a gain of $40 million just three years after Triton bought the 
sewing patterns publisher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deal-Making Continued 
</P>
<P>
Also in fiscal 1988, Triton sold 11% of the stock in its wholly owned 
Continental Graphics printing unit to the public. The stock offering was then 
followed by Triton's sale of its remaining 89% interest to a management group 
at the Los Angeles-based printing concern, enabling Triton to book an 
$80-million gain in fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's deal-making continued into fiscal 1989, which ended March 31. He 
engineered a plan for Triton to acquire voting control of Fuqua Industries, an 
Atlanta-based conglomerate. Pending approval by the Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board, Triton plans a friendly acquisition of 51% interest in Fuqua. The bank 
board's approval is required because Fuqua owns a Georgia savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Triton acquired a 64% interest in Western Sizzlin', which, with 
580 outlets, is the second-largest franchise steakhouse chain in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Unconventional Guy 
</P>
<P>
Triton's pending acquisition of a controlling interest in Fuqua, which had 
about $970 million in sales last year, contrasted with Triton's $151 million in 
revenue, is an indication of how unconventional a deal-maker Scott can be. 
(Intermark, whose sales for fiscal 1988 were $600 million, owns 41% of Triton 
stock and has an option to acquire an 20%. more.) 
</P>
<P>
But investors who have stuck by Scott, 60, over the long haul have done 
spectacularly well. A $10,000 investment in Intermark stock in 1975 was worth 
$917,000 at the end of fiscal 1988, a 41% compounded annual return, corporate 
counsel Mitchell Woodbury said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's 1988 compensation package was more than $670,000 above that of Neal 
Harris, the second-highest-paid San Diego County executive. Harris, executive 
vice president of Price Co., the operator of 42 Price Club discount warehouses, 
made $1,216,295 in 1988, of which $1,075,441 was in stock options. 
</P>
<P>
In third place was Michael Dingman, chairman of Henley Group, a multi-industry 
holding company that now has bicoastal headquarters offices in La Jolla and 
Hampton, N. H. Dingman made $1,160,000, all in base salary, and is one of five 
Henley executives to make the top 25 on San Diego's best-paid list. 
</P>
<P>
Other Henley executives on the list are President Paul Montrone ($775,000) in 
fifth place; managing directors Harold Eastman ($600,000) in eighth place, 
David L. Summers ($600,000) in ninth place and Harold Buirkle ($465,000) in 
16th place. Each of the Henley executives also has a "golden parachute," 
meaning they get special compensation if Henley is acquired. 
</P>
<P>
In fourth place was Jerry Caulder, president of Mycogen Corp., a company that 
produces biopesticides. Of Caulder's $926,485 in total compensation, $713,400 
came in long-term compensation, typically proceeds from the sale of stock 
options. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sifted Through Proxy Data 
</P>
<P>
The compensation list was compiled by the Los Angeles-based human resource 
consulting firm William M. Mercer Meidinger Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
The firm sifted through proxy material filed by 260 California-based, publicly 
held companies to produce a survey of the state's 100 highest-paid executives 
published by The Times on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Scott and Harris were the only two San Diego executives to make the statewide 
best-paid list, placing 23rd and 56th, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Michael O. McCullough, a principal with Mercer Meidinger Hansen, said he 
expects to see many more executives in San Diego and elsewhere in California 
take profits from stock options this year than last. 
</P>
<P>
Stock options, which enable executives to buy stock at historically low prices 
and then sell shares at current higher prices, were generally unattractive last 
year in the aftermath of the October, 1987, stock market crash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Compensation packages paid to San Diego County executives tracked fairly 
closely with pay given to the top 25 Orange County executives, McCullough 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The performance-driven compensation packages paid to Walt Disney executives 
Michael Eisner and Frank Wells were perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this 
year's statewide survey. Eisner, with $40.1 million, and Wells, with $32.1 
million, led the statewide list, and both had pay plans heavily freighted with 
incentives based on Disney meeting certain profit and growth targets. 
</P>
<P>
McCullough said the astronomically high compensation paid to Eisner and Wells 
was justified by Disney's improved financial condition and stock price since 
the two men took over the company's management in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
And, because of Disney's highly visible success, McCullough expects more 
companies to take a closer look this year at adopting pay plans that closely 
tie compensation salary to performance.

WILDERNESS AGAIN SEEKING CHAPTER 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wilderness Experience, the beleaguered Chatsworth camping gear firm, for the 
second time in two years has sought shelter from creditors by filing for 
Chapter 11 protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
According to its bankruptcy filing May 5, Wilderness Experience has assets of 
$627,400 and debts of $1.4 million. Among the debts are $43,500 owed to the 
accounting firm Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells, and $6,483 to the Los Angeles 
Department of Water &amp; Power. 
</P>
<P>
William Hess, Wilderness Experience's attorney, said the company's latest 
problems stemmed partly from its inability to deliver on time a $5-million shoe 
order to a major retailer, because Wilderness "didn't have the capital." 
</P>
<P>
The company has also been behind in payments to its landlords, and those debts 
helped force its bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Kramer, the company's president, said he has closed three of the 
company's six retail stores to cut costs, although its factory remains open and 
is manufacturing sportswear and backpacks. To help cut costs, the company has 
laid off about 25 workers, Kramer said, and has only about 45 employees now. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we can recapitalize the company and go forward. We will consolidate 
the operation by reducing overhead, going to smaller headquarters," Kramer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, the company filed for Chapter 11 protection and emerged from 
bankruptcy proceedings in April, 1988. The company's bank and some of its other 
creditors forgave 75% of Wilderness' debts in exchange for some of the 
company's stock. Wilderness was also able to raise $360,000 from investors. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Kramer hopes to reorganize once again and emerge from bankruptcy 
protection by "trying to sell or merge the company with a larger company." He 
said Wilderness still has a "large pool of stockholders who are very interested 
in helping the company continue," and some might be willing to provide 
additional capital. 
</P>
<P>
One shareholder who won't invest more money is Herve Babineau of Malibu. At the 
urging of a friend, he bought 13,200 shares of Wilderness' stock at 50 cents a 
share in hopes of catching the company on the rebound. He has since sold most 
of his stock at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
But he said, "I'm going to write things off," get a tax credit for the loss and 
use it to help invest in something else.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: 2 HOTEL INVESTOR FIRMS TO HIRE INVESTMENT BANKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel Investors Corp., two companies whose shares are 
paired on the New York Stock Exchange, said they plan to hire investment 
bankers to consider ways for boosting the shares' value. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Investors Trust, based in Woodland Hills, invests in lodging properties 
and Hotel Investors Corp. is a hotel management concern. The companies said 
they took the action because their shares have been underpriced and do not 
reflect "their intrinsic value." 
</P>
<P>
After the announcement last week, the companies' shares jumped 15% to $9.50 a 
share; they closed Monday at $9.25 a share. Before the announcement, the shares 
had been trading near their lowest level for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
The companies gave no specifics about what steps might be taken. But the 
bankers likely would consider a financial restructuring of the companies, a 
share buyback and the sale of part or all of the companies, among other things.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: AMWEST INSURANCE GROUP OKS ANTI-TAKEOVER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amwest Insurance Group, an insurance holding company in Woodland Hills, adopted 
a "poison-pill" stockholder rights plan designed to fend off unwelcome takeover 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, if any suitor -- with the exception of Amwest Chairman Richard 
H. Savage or his affiliates -- acquires 20% or more of Amwest's common stock, 
the rights would enable stockholders to buy Amwest shares for half price. The 
suitor who bought the 20% stake would not be able to exercise the same rights, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to sharply increase the number of shares in other stockholders' 
hands, making it prohibitively expensive for an unwanted bidder to pursue a 
hostile offer. Similar plans have been adopted by hundreds of other companies. 
</P>
<P>
The rights will be distributed to stockholders of record May 22, and 
stockholders are entitled to one right for each common share that they own. 
Amwest said it is not aware of any takeover interest in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Amwest said, it plans to buy up to $1 million of its common stock 
in periodic open-market purchases. Amwest's stock closed Monday at $11.00 on 
the American Stock Exchange. At that price, the buyback would involve about 
91,000 shares, or 4% of Amwest's 2.49 million total shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Amwest specializes in underwriting bail bonds and other surety bonds, in which 
the company guarantees the performance of a third party.

THE FESTIVAL BUZZ ON THE CROISETTE: 'JESUS,' OUI; 'ANGELS,' NON

<TEXT>
<P>
Three of the four American films in competition for the Gold Palm were shown 
during the first four days of this year's Cannes Film Festival, and as far as 
the critics were concerned, it was rookie director Steve Soderbergh who brought 
the best film. 
</P>
<P>
Soderbergh's "sex, lies and videotape" was the clear favorite of an 
international panel of critics polled in the trade paper Screen International. 
</P>
<P>
The panel rated "sex, lies and videotape" well above both director James 
Jarmusch's "Mystery Train," the Australian entry "A Cry in the Dark," and 
French director Bertrand Blier's "Too Good for You." 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, audiences saw what may prove to be the most and least popular 
films in the festival. Hugh Hudson's "Lost Angels," a Los Angeles-based story 
about a middle-class juvenile gang member, was hooted at two press screenings 
while Canadian director Denys Arcand's "Jesus of Montreal" drew the longest 
ovation yet heard on the Croisette from the demonstrative media crowds. ("Lost 
Angels" has already opened in many American cities, including Los Angeles, and 
hasn't done much better with critics there.) 
</P>
<P>
The Gold Palm winner, set to be announced May 23, will be determined by a 
10-person jury headed by West German film maker Wim Wenders. The jury's lone 
American member is actress Sally Field. 
</P>
<P>
Some notes on a few of the early films at Cannes: 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus of Montreal," Canada. Denys Arcand was discovered at Cannes three years 
ago when his "The Decline of the American Empire" became the hit of the 
Directors Fortnight. 
</P>
<P>
"Decline," a French-language film about eight upscale Canadians concerned with 
their sex lives, made some strong statements about the deterioration of values 
in the West and Arcand's new film drives the point home with a stake. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus of Montreal" is a daring updating of the death and resurrection of 
Christ, told through the story of a Montreal actor who puts on a revisionist 
avant-garde play about Christ and has his own life parallel both the art and 
the legend. 
</P>
<P>
Segments of the film cast doubts on the biblical version of Christ and 
comparisons will inevitably be made to Martin Scorsese's "The Last Temptation 
of Christ." But Arcand, who says he hasn't even seen the Scorsese film, seems 
less interested in challenging the faith than pointing out that man's 
inhumanities are alive and ill in Montreal. The film includes unflattering 
references to lawyers and agents, a bias Arcand admits was promoted by the 
phony attention he got after "Decline." He said his sudden popularity changed 
everyone around him, even his own lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"While negotiating for this film," Arcand said, "my lawyer said to me, 'What 
about T-shirts? People are going to want to buy them.' I said, 'Listen, I'm 
doing a film about Jesus Christ. Can you forget about T-shirts?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Mystery Train," United States. James Jarmusch was also discovered at Cannes 
through the unsanctioned Directors Fortnight. His "Stranger Than Paradise," 
which was later named best picture of 1984 by the National Society of Film 
Critics in America, was an off-beat black-and-white comedy about two immigrant 
cousins wandering through the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he continued the theme with "Down by Law," which was in 
competition for the Gold Palm, and this year he returns with what he calls -- 
retrospectively -- the third leg of a trilogy on immigrants' impressions of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"Mystery Train" is three separate but simultaneously occurring stories linked 
by a flea-bag hotel in urban Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The first, and I can sense it's the best segment, is about a Japanese couple 
making a pilgrimage to the birthplace of rock 'n' roll. The boy reveres Carl 
Perkins and Roy Orbison; she is strictly an Elvis fan. The second story is 
about an Italian woman stranded briefly in Memphis after her husband dies on an 
airplane. The third is about an English Elvis Presley look-alike who, in a 
drunken rage, shoots a liquor store clerk and goes on the lam with his shocked 
American buddies. 
</P>
<P>
"Mystery Train" delivered bigger laughs than either of Jarmusch's earlier 
films, but it roused little enthusiasm among the American critics here. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.7-million film was financed by JVC, the giant Japanese electronics firm, 
and will be released in the United States this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"sex, lies and videotape," United States. This first film by 26-year-old 
American Steven Soderbergh has been the talk of the festival so far. 
</P>
<P>
The crisply written film focuses on a Baton Rouge, La., couple whose troubled 
marriage is finally undone when the husband's old college friend returns to 
town with a peculiar hobby of interviewing women about their sex lives on 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
The film is in equal parts about deceit, sexual repression and aggression, and 
the inundation of video. 
</P>
<P>
Critics are raving about all the actors in the film, but James Spader, getting 
a break from all those preppy roles, may be in line for a best actor award for 
his moving performance as the video voyeur trying to make peace with himself. 
</P>
<P>
"sex, lies and videotape," made on a budget of $1.2 million, will be released 
this summer in the United States by Miramax Films. 
</P>
<P>
Bertrand Blier's "Too Good for You," which stars Gerard Depardieu as a Paris 
businessman whose affections are divided between his homely mistress and his 
beautiful wife, was better appreciated by French critics than the Americans, 
but is nonetheless one of the early festival hits.

CRITIC AT LARGE: THE WIND-BLOWN UMBRELLAS OF NEW YORK

This is the season of the blown-out umbrella and the endangered eye. Late last 
week a violently windy rainstorm hit Manhattan, where the sidewalks are hardly 
large enough to accommodate the daytime pedestrians, let along pedestrians 
wielding umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
Not even in London do I remember encountering so many umbrella-jams: walkers 
having to stop and disengage their entangled bumbershoots, usually by changing 
the elevations, so the sidewalks from a little distance look like erratic 
fields of black mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The gusty, lion winds left over from March blew from all directions, 
capriciously. The umbrella that was being pushed into you was suddenly pulled 
away, and what seemed like hundreds of umbrellas simply weren't up to it. They 
turned inside out, fabric sundered from the metal ribs. 
</P>
<P>
I found four dead umbrellas jammed into a single trash can. Others were tossed 
in alleys or dropped in the gutters, where, to use another image, they 
resembled large, bizarre insects whose brief life spans had ended. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast difference, I suppose, is that rain is what you more often see 
through windshields. Given the native irascibility of New York life, you'd have 
expected the umbrellas to be used as assault weapons, but the walkers were 
surprisingly even-tempered. This may be because it is hard to be aggressive 
when you look ridiculous trying to tame a flighty and fragile device that is 
supposed to keep you dry. 
</P>
<P>
The remembered springs of a small-town boyhood were always liberating and 
renewing, rewards for long winters and perhaps a young person's earliest 
positive reminders that life has rhythms and cycles. 
</P>
<P>
It struck me this time, as it has before, that spring in the steely, gritty 
metropolis has an added edge. It is liberating and renewing, but spring also 
somehow seems an act of defiance, as if to declare that a soft and gentle 
beauty can indeed prevail against the city's hardness, clangors and fumes. Not 
for long, obviously, but every year nature tries, and the results are quite 
miraculous. 
</P>
<P>
The rain this spring was borne with particular patience here because the East 
has been having its own drought crisis, with restrictions on lawn-watering and 
car-washing and water in restaurants by request only. But the rains, almost a 
third ahead of the seasonal norm, have restored the reservoirs to something 
like 85% of capacity and some of the restrictions are being lifted. 
</P>
<P>
The welcome rain adds to the optimism and the hopes that bloom along with the 
daffodils in the tiny spaces in front of the brownstones and in the window 
boxes and on the rooftops. Those penthouse plantings always seem faintly 
ridiculous because they are so improbable, but in spring, newly green, they are 
their own kind of defiance. They defy the acrid vapors of the late and humid 
summer air. And, quite obviously, they grow, because there are evergreen trees 
visible that would never fit in an elevator. 
</P>
<P>
In the words of a song Gertrude Lawrence used to sing, "It ain't all honey and 
it ain't all jam." On a lovely, hazy Sunday morning, a line of homeless men, 
hundreds long, snakes around a corner and up tony Park Avenue, waiting for a 
meal at one of the great midtown churches. The homeless are everywhere, like 
the visible wounds of a society that has still not got its act fully together. 
</P>
<P>
The gulf between the thrusting new constructions of midtown and the decaying 
warrens only a relatively few blocks north, west or south is enormous, and 
there are angers as well as despairs to be felt and found. Some parts of the 
city's school system is in a corrupted chaos and there is growing evidence that 
the basic structures by which the city is governed are in need of overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite the cracks and the flaws and the accusing presence of the 
have-nots, the prevailing tone is of an impatient, horn-honking vitality and a 
crucial, striding confidence that New York is a place to get ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Especially when it's spring.

TEACHERS STRIKE PROMPTS CHANGES ON TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KLCS Channel 58, the TV station owned by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, altered its broadcast schedule in response to the teachers strike 
Monday to include more instructional programs that do not require an adult 
educator's presence. 
</P>
<P>
The strike also shut down two 52-part educational series that KLCS is producing 
-- "Driver Education" and "Educational and Career Planning" -- because six 
certificated staff members were called into classrooms to fill in for striking 
teachers, said Sabrina Fair Thomas, manager of program scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
KLCS' staff-produced live show "Homework Hotline" (weekdays from 4:30 to 5:30 
p.m.), which uses teachers on the air to answer questions called in by 
students, will be replaced during the walkout by reruns of previous segments. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in its schedule of instructional programs for elementary and 
secondary schools, KLCS was replacing some teacher-dependent shows with PBS 
series such as "Newton's Apple," "Wonderworks" and "Reading Rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
"This is relevant programming; it's not designed to baby-sit students," Thomas 
said. "These particular programs were selected because of their instructional 
value. They allow kids to learn something without direct supervision." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the temporary programming schedule is most beneficial to secondary 
students whose complex lesson plans are more difficult for interim teachers to 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like a backup," Thomas said. "Normal instruction will still go on. But 
in case a person doesn't know how to teach science, they can turn on 'Newton's 
Apple' and the class will still learn something."

TANGO EXPERT PIAZZOLLA IN STEP WITH MODERN TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flash! Bandoneonist Astor Piazzolla has a new band. It's called the New Tango 
Sextet. 
</P>
<P>
Hot news, right? Excuse me, while I step aside to avoid the loud chorus of 
yawns. 
</P>
<P>
Who, you may ask, is Astor Piazzolla? What is a bandoneon, and why should you 
care? Ah, good questions. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: Piazzolla is universally acknowledged as perhaps the world's 
greatest tangoist. He is to the sensuous music of Argentina what Duke Ellington 
and Louis Armstrong were to jazz. In Piazzolla's hands, the bandoneon (actually 
a button accordion) and the tango have become the starting points for 
compositions which transform a national dance music -- a music which emerged 
from a blending of Cuban habanera, black candombe and Andalusian tango -- into 
a rich and complex vehicle of contemporary expression. 
</P>
<P>
Need more evidence? OK. Sting calls Piazzolla's music: "Great to make love to 
if you can't tango." The Grateful Dead's Mickey Hart says, "His sound makes 
your hair stand on end." And Pat Metheny says that Piazzolla is one of his 
"favorite musicians of all time." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the 67-year-old Piazzolla -- whose Los Angeles debut takes place 
tonight at UCLA's Royce Hall -- made a few changes in his group. To tango 
aficionados, the modifications in an ensemble which had remained stable for 27 
years were roughly equivalent to the startling departure of Johnny Hodges from 
the Ellington band in the early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Piazzolla's explanation was typically direct and to-the-point. "I write for my 
musicians," he said. "I've done it that way all my life. And after having 
composed music for the same group for 27 years -- hundreds of pieces of music 
and arrangements and sound -- I found myself against a wall. I wanted to do 
something different. So I changed two players -- the violinist and the pianist. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of a violin, I added a cello, for a more dramatic sound. And I added a 
pianist who is a very important contemporary composer in his own right. When I 
write for him, I have new world of music available to me, sounds and knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, I added another bandoneon. Back in the '30s, when tango groups were 
first trying to do something different with the music, they used to make tango 
solos for two bandoneons. I want to create a comeback of that style and put new 
harmonies and rhythms with it. I've found out how to do that, and I'm having 
great fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Argentina, Piazzolla was brought to the United States when he was 2 
years old, and grew up in the turbulent ethnic crosscurrents of New York's 
Little Italy. "I learned everything there," he said. "I got good beatings, I 
gave good beatings, and I learned to defend myself. I learned to have courage, 
and not to be afraid. When you study music, you can be the greatest musician in 
the world, but if you don't have the courage to do what you want, to find your 
own individual style, then why did you bother to study music for so long?" 
</P>
<P>
Piazzolla studied the bandoneon -- and there was no question that he did it 
with his own style. The instrument is the quintessential element in tango 
music, but Piazzolla's New York years exposed him to Bach, Mozart, Gershwin, 
Ellington, and very little tango. When he returned to Buenos Aires in the late 
'30s he was a hybrid artist -- studying with the likes of Alberto Ginastera and 
Nadia Boulanger, composing classical pieces and film scores, and creating 
modern-sounding tangos which both outraged and fascinated the music's purists. 
</P>
<P>
Things haven't changed much. Today, Piazzolla is just as determined to chart 
his own path. "I'm doing what I want. I always do," he said. "But, look, I'm 
not a Julio Iglesias. I play none of the old repertoire -- 'La Cumparisita,' 
pieces like that. God forbid. There are some stupid people who expect me to 
play things like that to get more applause, but I won't do it; I'll never sell 
my soul to the devil for applause -- never. I'm not interested in being the 
richest man in the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also not interested in what tango was. I'm interested in what it will be 
in the future. When the water doesn't run, it rottens. And that happens with 
tango. Tango that doesn't run -- it rottens. I don't like the smell of what's 
rotten. I have a great respect for the old tango, for the primitive tango. But 
I must do it in my own way. 
</P>
<P>
"When Gil Evans did a modern arrangement, you could always hear that it was 
jazz. The same thing applies to the tango in my music. The accentuation, the 
feeling, is like jazz -- like the blues. You can't explain what the feeling is, 
but you have it inside, because you've learned it since you were a kid. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been listening to tango since I was a little boy, but it's not as though 
each time I write a composition I say to myself, 'Look, Astor, you have to put 
some tango in here.' I don't have to do that. Anything I write will have tango 
underneath it, always. I was raised in this music, I played it all my life, and 
I have it inside my veins."

It was perhaps the closest that Malibu's Chamber of Commerce has come to 
apocalypse now. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Martin Sheen, the town's new honorary mayor, has proclaimed that Malibu 
will be "a sanctuary for aliens and the homeless" in addition to sheltering 
such celebrities as Johnny Carson, Sylvester Stallone and Larry Hagman. 
</P>
<P>
Sheen, who has been arrested several times during anti-nuclear demonstrations, 
also declared Malibu a "nuclear-free zone" and "a protected environment for all 
life, wild and tame." 
</P>
<P>
All this at a time when the beach colony can't even unite on whether it should 
become an incorporated city. 
</P>
<P>
Inasmuch as the sole responsibility of the town's honorary mayor is to preside 
over the annual Kiwanis Chili Cook-Off, the Chamber of Commerce was sizzling 
over Sheen's written inauguration speech. 
</P>
<P>
"He's purely a figurehead," said Anne King, the chamber manager. "We are 
attempting to set up a meeting with him so that unauthorized statements are not 
given by him. He should have cleared it with us." 
</P>
<P>
Would the chamber have approved Sheen's declaration? 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly would not have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt cognizant of the title of "People's Republic of Santa Monica" hung by 
critics on the beach city to the south, King added that the chamber does "not 
take any kind of political position." 
</P>
<P>
The honorary mayor's offer of sanctuary to Malibu's homeless comes nine months 
after the beating death of the town's most famous transient. Malibu Joe, as he 
was known, hasn't been forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"People still leave flowers at his plaque," said Anne Soble, publisher of the 
Malibu Surfside News. "I even got a call from a newspaper in London a while 
back, asking if the case had been solved." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Castello or Costello (he gave both versions), an Italian immigrant, lived 
outdoors in Malibu for more than 30 years before his death last September at 
the age of 96 following a robbery. The Sheriff's Department is still searching 
for the killer. 
</P>
<P>
After the incident, saddened neighbors contributed more than $3,000 to a fund 
that paid for a bas-relief plaque for Joe at his last camping spot, a mini-mall 
parking lot near Pacific Coast Highway. Leftover funds went to the Artifac 
Tree, a private agency that gives to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, an anonymous individual has taken up the cause of the homeless 
in a series of letters to the Surfside News, calling for such reforms as the 
opening of public beach restrooms around the clock for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
He signs his letters, "Malibu Joe, Too." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach is no Malibu. But gone are the days when it had a reputation chiefly 
as a wild Navy town, when "a chic haunt . . . was a place where the bartender 
didn't wear a tattoo," as author John Gregory Dunne put it. 
</P>
<P>
Now Long Beach has a new slogan ("Most on the Coast"), a just-unveiled world 
trade center and a huge development planned for the former site of the Pike 
amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
One more sign of its upward mobility: Wall Street Realty of Long Beach squires 
its clients around in limousines.

AL MARTINEZ: MAN BITES DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are roughly 500,000 dogs in L.A. County, and at any given moment about 
half of them are in some kind of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
If they aren't being chased from parks or arrested for fouling the city 
streets, they're being sacrificed by satanists or pursued by those who enjoy a 
tasty dog-kabob occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
They are also, if you believe the animal activists, being subjected to untold 
indecencies all over town by mad scientists attempting to make a name for 
themselves at the expense of you-know-who. 
</P>
<P>
All this is occurring despite the fact that canis familiaris has been man's 
best friend for 14 centuries; reason enough, I suppose, why tiger sharks and 
grizzly bears have never bothered to curry man's favor. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of today's column, however, is not to cheer dog cruelty but to 
explore the question of whether or not it is ever justifiable to commit 
violence against your neighbor's schnauzer. 
</P>
<P>
Only once have I felt hostility toward a dog beyond a simple desire to kick its 
teeth in for knocking over my garbage can. That was when, for no reason, a 
doberman came at me with murder in its eyes. 
</P>
<P>
I was in the yard pushing a wheelbarrow and fended off the animal by swinging 
the device at his head until he left, drooling in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
It is impractical, however, to be armed with a wheelbarrow at all times, so 
then what is one supposed to do to protect against a dog with a bad attitude? 
</P>
<P>
For at least one answer, I take you to Littlerock, a speck of a settlement near 
Palmdale, where the erotic intentions of Roscoe the Great Dane were 
short-circuited recently by a load of buckshot, or possibly a .22-caliber 
rifle, depending on who you believe. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Roscoe's owner, Cindy Vasquez, is an attractive former nude 
dancer had nothing to do, by the way, with my having braved the desert heat and 
a long, hum-drum drive to reach Littlerock. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, I was telephoned by state Humane Officer Barbara Fabricant, who, 
informed of Roscoe's fate, said she was sick and tired of living creatures 
being shot in the pursuit of sex. I feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Littlerock, tucked as it is among the Joshua trees, is the kind of place where 
dogs and guns abound, but usually in more placid coexistence than the incident 
that has aroused the neighborhood around 92nd Street and Avenue T-4. 
</P>
<P>
An occasional rattlesnake or a burglar might get shot due to their insufferable 
intentions, but usually not a dog. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, it seems that Roscoe broke free one night to visit a neighbor dog 
in heat and came home somewhat the worse for having followed his heart, or 
whatever it is dogs follow. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez says it was determined that Roscoe was shot, possibly with a 
.22-caliber rifle. The trail of blood led to the home of Robb Loebach, owner of 
a Queensland heeler whose sexual magnetism was said to have lured Roscoe into 
trouble in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Loebach won't talk, but his wife, Sara, says Roscoe wandered into their garage 
two days earlier and, for no reason, bit her husband on the leg. 
</P>
<P>
This naturally made the Loebachs suspicious of Roscoe's presence thereafter, 
and when he returned to allegedly savage their own dog, Robb let go not with a 
.22, Sara says, but with a load of bird shot. 
</P>
<P>
Roscoe, abruptly loveless, survived, but Robb is being charged with cruelty to 
animals and is in turn suing Cindy for possessing an animal "of vicious 
propensities." 
</P>
<P>
I'm not in favor of random violence against dogs, but even animal control 
officers will tell you that some form of protection is valid when set upon by 
an animal who weighs more than your kids. 
</P>
<P>
Roscoe tops 100 pounds and may be as gentle as a darter snail under normal 
circumstances. But love does strange things to a male of any species. Teen-age 
boys, for example, who will not walk across the street for a job will brave a 
sea of alligators to get to a girl with a nice behind. 
</P>
<P>
Fabricant says the only legal justification for shooting a dog is if he is 
attacking your livestock and "a Queensland heeler sure as hell doesn't look 
like a cow." 
</P>
<P>
That may be so, but even in this age of heightened awareness toward the fate of 
animals, humans count too and if the latter are threatened by the former, guess 
who God intended to win? I can tell you now that if that doberman ever comes at 
me again, he's going to get a wheelbarrow over his head, whether or not my cow 
is in peril.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ART RESTORER PLEADS GUILTY OF SMUGGLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Santa Barbara art restorer has pleaded guilty to conspiring to have 
pre-Columbian artifacts smuggled from Peru, but the charges against his wife 
were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
David Rand Swetnam, 31, who now lives in Santa Cruz, was indicted by a Los 
Angeles federal grand jury last November for conspiracy, making false 
statements to U.S. Customs agents and receiving and procuring smuggled goods. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, which also named his wife, Jacquelyn, 30, was the result of 
March 30, 1988, raids by Customs agents on homes and shops of art dealers in 
Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. The agents reported seizing 
more than 1,100 artifacts believed imported illegally from Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Peruvian officials have said that the items were stolen near the 1,500-year-old 
tomb of Sipan, unearthed last year and regarded as one of the hemisphere's 
greatest archeological discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
By pleading guilty on Friday, Swetnam acknowledged paying a Ventura art dealer 
to smuggle ceramic vases, miniature stone mortars and jewelry into the United 
States in 1986 and 1987.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRODUCER NEED NOT TESTIFY, JUDGE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Film producer Robert Evans won a reprieve as a witness Monday in a preliminary 
hearing in the "Cotton Club" murder case, but may be called to testify later. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay threatened to jail Evans for 
contempt on Friday for improperly invoking his 5th Amendment right against 
self-incrimination. But she reversed her position Monday after Evans' attorney, 
Robert Shapiro, cited a Saturday article in The Times that noted that Evans had 
been linked in police reports on file with the court to the 1983 murder of 
Broadway producer Roy Radin. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing enters its third day today with reputed Miami cocaine dealer Karen 
Delayne "Lanie" Greenberger and security guards Alex Lamota Marti and William 
Molony Mentzer charged in the killing. A fourth defendant, former security 
guard Robert Lowe, is fighting extradition from Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
According to the police report, Lowe said during a secretly recorded phone 
conversation that the "hit" against Radin was paid for by Greenberger and 
Evans. Evans had contracted with Radin to raise money, allegedly to help 
finance his film about the Cotton Club, a 1930s Harlem nightclub.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SHOT BY POLICE TASER DARTS DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young man jumping in and out of traffic in the Crenshaw area was shot with 
Taser electrical darts early Monday and died a short time later, officers 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. William D. Hall, supervisor of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
officer-involved shooting unit, said police were told by a motorist just before 
4 a.m. that the man was acting in a bizarre fashion and jumping in front of 
vehicles on Venice Boulevard, just west of Crenshaw Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire Division Officers Steven Johnson and Steven Garcia tried to move the 
unidentified man out of the street, Hall said, but reported that he "appeared 
to be under the influence of a drug or narcotic." 
</P>
<P>
The officers sent for the Taser device, which shoots electrically charged darts 
on fish lines in order to stun a hard-to-handle suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Although the first Taser shot failed to have any visible effect, a second 
appeared to calm the man down and he was handcuffed. Paramedics took him to 
Kaiser Foundation Hospital, where he died at 5 a.m., police said. Hall said an 
autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death.

MOTHER, MAN HELD IN DEATH OF GIRL, 8, DISCOVERED IN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The mother of an 8-year-old girl whose badly burned body was found last week in 
a San Pedro park has been arrested on suspicion of murdering her, as has the 
woman's boyfriend, Los Angeles police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Natividad Flores, 26, and Alejandro Lara, 29, were arrested Friday at their 
home south of downtown and are being held without bail, Lt. Fred Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Results of an autopsy on Alba Susanna Flores indicated that she had been 
sexually abused and died of multiple injuries before she was set ablaze and 
dumped in Alma Park last Thursday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The arrests were made because of information we developed during our 
interviews with them, coupled with physical evidence," Nixon said. He would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Went to Buy Ice Cream 
</P>
<P>
The couple had originally reported that the girl had gone to buy ice cream and 
did not return. Investigators said Flores told them she awoke at 11 p.m. 
Wednesday to find her daughter missing, then summoned police. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's charred body was found by a passer-by about 6 a.m. the next day 
miles away in Alma Park. A flammable liquid had been poured on her, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As news of the arrests spread in the run-down Mid-City neighborhood where the 
girl lived, acquaintances painted an unsettling portrait her last days. They 
said the girl was locked in the house most of the time since she arrived from 
El Salvador three months ago to live with Flores and Lara, who had lived in the 
home on West 24th Street for about five years. Alba was not sent to school, 
neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who has two other children, a boy and a girl, "hit and yelled at them," 
said neighbor Gloria Pineda, a hotel housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Witnessed Argument 
</P>
<P>
Pineda said she last saw Alba about a week ago. "She was leaning against a car 
in the back yard, crying," the neighbor recalled. "I asked her why she was 
crying and her mother started screaming at her and saying bad words. I told 
her, 'Go back inside or your mom will hit you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Pineda said she had another verbal confrontation with Flores, who operated a 
lunch truck with Lara, after she "insulted my mother." 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor also told of seeing the child being struck by the mother. A 
third neighbor, Jose Cortez, said that when Alba was allowed outside she was 
very shy and would hardly talk to other children. 
</P>
<P>
The Flores home was deserted Monday. But on the porch steps of the triplex 
bungalow, a vase of fresh spring flowers had been delivered. An anonymous note 
written in Spanish said, "In memory of your daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Flores is at Sybil Brand Institute and Lara is jailed at Parker Center, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the body of Alba remained unclaimed at the county morgue.

THOUSAND OAKS ARCHIVISTS SIFT THROUGH CROONER RUDY VALLEE'S 4-TON COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rudy Vallee, the megaphone-carrying crooner and popular radio personality, was 
a pack rat, say archivists at the Thousand Oaks Library who recently began 
cataloguing the four-ton collection of papers and mementos he gathered for more 
than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
Vallee saved X-rays of an impacted wisdom tooth he had extracted in the 1970s, 
brief notes his fourth wife left on the refrigerator and a copy of the formula 
for his golden hair dye. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for students of entertainment history, Vallee also kept thousands 
of fan letters, radio scripts, musical scores and other items that provide an 
unusually complete record of the popular culture of his day, said Henry Matoon, 
an archivist hired to catalogue the collection. 
</P>
<P>
The material fills about 560 crates and spans Vallee's long career, which began 
in the 1920s, reached its peak during the next two decades when he became one 
of the nation's most successful vaudeville and radio personalities, and 
continued until he was well into his 70s. 
</P>
<P>
The collection will be available to the public by January, 1990, Matoon said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God Vallee saved all that stuff," said Larry Gassman, president of the 
Los Angeles-based Society to Preserve and Encourage Radio Drama, Variety and 
Comedy. "For anyone writing his biography or interested in history, its value 
is incalculable." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Vallee died in 1986 at 84, the Thousand Oaks Library Foundation 
bought the collection for $275,000 as part of an ambitious program to establish 
an archive on the history of radio and early television. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, which raised the money through private donations and a $125,000 
grant from the city of Thousand Oaks, outbid the University of Wyoming and 
several other institutions for the material, said Antoinette Hagopian, the 
group's president. 
</P>
<P>
By owning the prized Vallee collection, the foundation "is on its way to 
building a first-class archive" on the performing arts akin to those at UCLA 
and other area universities, Hagopian said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is rare for a small city library to embark on such an ambitious 
endeavor, the foundation believes the role of a library "is to preserve 
history, not just to provide typical library materials to a community," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation could have chosen early California history or other topics, but 
decided to devote its archive to radio and early television because many local 
residents are employed in the entertainment industry and have offered to 
bequeath their papers to the foundation, Hagopian said. 
</P>
<P>
The library has more than 2,000 books on the subject and about 6,000 scripts. 
In addition, it has the papers of Clete Roberts, a famous World War II news 
correspondent who lived in the area before he died in 1984, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the foundation came under fire from some city residents who criticized 
it for acquiring the Vallee collection in the face of cutbacks in library 
services that year. But officials defended the acquisition by saying the 
collection is an investment whose value will continually increase, and the 
outcry was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Library Grant 
</P>
<P>
In January, the foundation received a $50,000 grant from the state library to 
begin cataloguing Vallee's huge collection, which he kept in a three-story 
building on his Hollywood Hills estate. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by pictures of the clean-cut singer and by old newspapers with 
headlines devoted to his appearances, archivists Matoon and Martin Getzler are 
sifting through the thousands of newspaper clippings, photographs and financial 
and other records. While they are working, they sometimes play tapes of Vallee 
favorites, such as "My Time Is Your Time" and "I'm Just a Vagabond Lover." 
</P>
<P>
Vallee's widow, Eleanor Vallee Hustedt, owns the copyrights to many of Vallee's 
personal papers, and researchers who want to publish the materials will have to 
approach her for permission, library officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The collection contains none of the original megaphones that became Vallee's 
trademark, said Ruth Leonard, special collections librarian. However, the 
library does have hundreds of recordings of Vallee's radio shows, which will be 
copied onto cassette tapes and lent to library patrons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interesting Discoveries 
</P>
<P>
The archivists say they have made some interesting discoveries by perusing the 
collection. For instance, they have come across records that indicate Vallee 
hired a detective to follow a woman with whom he was romantically involved 
before he met his fourth wife. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days of radio, the fan letters he got from women were on a high 
romantic plane," Getzler said. "Later, in the '40s, the women were a lot more 
forward and tried to instigate meetings with Vallee." 
</P>
<P>
From the age of 8, Vallee saved memorabilia from his life because, even as a 
Maine schoolboy who played the saxophone, he believed he would become famous, 
said Hustedt, whom he married in 1949. Vallee knew his collection "would be 
valuable for posterity, just like Nixon's," she said.

OPEN PALMS OF RECRUIT SCANDAL SHOW JUST HOW CLOSED JAPANESE SOCIETY IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN M. WEBBER, Alan M. Webber, managing editor of the Harvard Business 
Review, is in Tokyo as a U.S. Japan Society Leadership Fellow.

<P>
American observers, seeking to make sense of Japan's Recruit scandal, might be 
tempted to measure it against our Watergate episode. Both involved huge sums of 
illegal money; both were cracked open by enterprising reporters who had been 
assigned to a seemingly unimportant beat; both tripped up top business leaders, 
featured humiliating arrests and criminal convictions, and both ultimately led 
to the door of the highest government official in the land. And now in Japan, 
in the wake of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's decision to resign, there is 
even talk of sweeping political reform, similar to that adopted in the United 
States 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the Recruit scandal is not what it seems. It is not about Recruit, nor is 
it really a scandal. And the greatest opportunity for reform coming out of this 
episode is not in Japan but in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The political and economic systems that underlie the scandal are fundamentally 
different from those in the United States. Where Watergate was a cancer on the 
presidency, threatening the principles of the Constitution, Recruit is a 
temporary headache, disrupting Japan's ability to conduct business: The day 
after Takeshita's announcement, the stock market soared -- the headache had 
passed. In Japan, where business and personal ethics are largely situational, 
the crime of Hiromasa Ezoe and his Recruit Co. is hardly a moral failing. It is 
business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Politics in this country runs on huge under-the-table contributions from 
corporations. With that money, elected officials are expected to provide 
constituent services that no U.S. congressman would ever dream of offering. For 
example, when a Diet member's supporters travel from their outlying districts 
to visit Tokyo, the elected official is expected to underwrite as much as 70% 
of the costs. Officials are supposed to contribute gifts of money to every 
wedding and significant social event in their district and provide funds to 
other Diet members if they hope to increase their power, rise in the faction 
and someday assume a national position. This system is neither right nor wrong; 
neither moral nor immoral. It is simply correct -- the appropriate way for the 
official to behave, just as it is appropriate for corporations to provide the 
funds that keep the system running. 
</P>
<P>
What Ezoe did was not wrong -- but it was incorrect. He did too much, too fast, 
too blatantly. His approach lacked the kind of humility that the Japanese pride 
themselves on. But the practice is symptomatic of the way of life. It is part 
of a political and economic system that is designed to promote stability and 
predictability. 
</P>
<P>
To call this episode a scandal is to condemn, by implication, the system that 
defines the way of life. Japan is a country that thrives, not so much on 
creating consensus, but on diminishing opposition. It is a nation that lacks an 
effective opposition or a meaningful alternative. There is one correct way to 
do everything. The most closed distribution system in Japan has nothing to do 
with the distribution of cornflakes or computers from the United States. It has 
to do with the distribution of opportunity and choice. There is only one 
national distribution channel for success. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, it is difficult to imagine this current episode leading to 
fundamental change in Japan. Fundamental change would involve creating 
meaningful opposition -- and opening up the risk of instability and 
uncertainty. But there is an opportunity, for the first time since the end of 
World War II, for U.S. business and political leaders to take a realistic look 
at the important difference between Japan and the United States and to 
construct a pragmatic strategy to guide the relationship through the currently 
troubled waters. Democracy and capitalism mean vastly different things in the 
two countries. 
</P>
<P>
For too long, the United States has tried to define Japan as if it were a 
nation just like us. In that regard, this episode may come at a surprisingly 
good time. The United States is weighing the so-called Super 301 trade 
declaration, deciding whether to name Japan as an unfair trader. The decision 
is part of a much larger -- and long-overdue -- reconsideration of U.S.-Japan 
relations. The Japanese are sounding new themes that reflect their own policy 
reconsideration. Most Japanese business and government officials expect the 
relationship to get worse before it gets better. Japan is rapidly advancing up 
the technological chain and is doing so without relying on U.S. capabilities. 
This only increases the likelihood of conflicts and produces a heightened sense 
of a zero-sum economic game. And many Japanese officials feel that they have 
done everything they can to respond to U.S. pressure. Negotiations over trade 
frictions serve no fruitful purpose; the only resort is to confrontational 
legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Japanese are sounding a new note about their own identity. For 
years, the official party line was that Japan practices the same kind of 
political economy as the United States. Now there is a new argument: "We're not 
unfair; we're just using a different system." At the same time, Japanese 
business and government leaders are reaffirming their status as an Asian 
country, working to make new friends among their regional neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best hope of the Recruit scandal is that the United States will see 
Japan as it really is. We have shared interests and intertwined economies. But 
we also have different values and systems at work in our countries, and 
different roles in the world. Perhaps in the aftermath of Japan's current 
political discomfort, the United States will start to make appropriate demands 
that fit Japan's own way of doing business. And at the same time, perhaps we 
will assume more responsibility for creating our own economic future.

THERE IS NO MILITARY OPTION ON PANAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. NUCCIO, Richard A. Nuccio is director of international programs 
at the Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By separating U.S. compliance with the Panama Canal treaties from the issue of 
Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's hijacking of Panamanian politics, by consulting the 
rest of Latin America and by affirming U.S. support for democracy and civilian 
rule, President Bush has gone most of the way toward establishing the basis for 
a successful U.S. policy on Panama. The required next step is to cast aside the 
so-called military option. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of those things that Presidents are never supposed to do. Even 
liberals like Sens. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) or John Kerry (D-Mass.), insist 
that we must "never rule out" the military option. If the United States had any 
military options in Panama that were worth the costs that would be paid in 
exercising them, reserving the right to unilateral military action might make 
sense. But the scenarios for the successful use of U.S. military power in 
Panama are hard to imagine, let alone execute. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is among the first to recognize this. Despite orders from 
then-President Reagan to draw down the number of dependents who might be in 
harm's way in Panama, there are more families of service personnel in and 
around U.S. bases today than during the last crisis point 14 months ago. Many 
believe that this is not a bureaucratic snafu, but the Pentagon's way of 
complicating an option it doesn't believe should be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is thinking long-term. After Noriega, there will still be a 
Panamanian Defense Force and the need for joint U.S.-Panamanian defense of the 
canal until 1999. Noriega's is neither a personal nor a purely military 
dictatorship. It is a curious, and now perverted, alliance, forged years ago by 
the late Gen. Omar Torrijos, between a modernizing military and a segment of 
the professional class. The only surgical removal of Noriega possible is one by 
his fellow officers. Any U.S. action would almost certainly take the lives of 
people who favor Noriega's ouster -- other officers and enlisted members of the 
PDF and some of their civilian supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is also thinking about the precedent to be set if U.S. bases, 
granted by treaty right to be in a foreign country, are used to mount an attack 
on that country's de facto if not de jure government. Already politically 
difficult situations in Spain, Greece and the Philippines would be made 
immensely more complicated by the use of U.S. bases in Panama to attempt to 
remove Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The rattling of the military option undercuts attempts to persuade our friends 
in Latin America to take stronger public positions against Noriega. Some may 
believe that the other democratic governments will be prodded into action by 
our implicit threat to go it alone if they do not take up the case against 
Noriega in the Organization of American States or some other forum. The 
opposite is the case. Latin Americans have two centuries of experience with 
U.S. unilateralism and are ever vigilant for the first sign of a new offensive. 
If we wish them to be partners in reinforcing democratic aspirations in Panama, 
they must believe that the United States is willing to treat them as juridical 
equals -- to consider their counsel and accept the restraint on unilateral 
action that consultation implies. 
</P>
<P>
Editorialists and other pundits are starting to draw grave analogies between 
U.S. performance in this crisis and in Nicaragua's elections scheduled for 
early next year. If we don't act tough in Panama, they pronounce, the 
Sandinistas will conclude that they can get away with fraud or other electoral 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
It is not U.S. machismo but our common sense that is being tested in Panama. 
Unilateral military options to remove Noriega at acceptable costs to U.S. and 
Latin American interests do not exist. The chances for a successful outcome to 
the crisis in Panama would be increased, not diminished, by recognizing this 
simple fact.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 OFFICIALS BACK PLAN TO EXTEND RAIL LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to unite San Fernando Valley leaders behind a single rail proposal, two 
elected officials on Friday endorsed a plan to extend the Metro Red Line partly 
underground from North Hollywood to the Sepulveda Basin, where passengers would 
then transfer to buses. 
</P>
<P>
In supporting a westward extension to Encino of the downtown-to-North Hollywood 
subway, state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City Councilman 
Marvin Braude became the first local elected officials to endorse a specific 
rail route. 
</P>
<P>
Several others have condemned specific routes, but most have said they are 
waiting for the results of a County Transportation Commission study expected in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
A key aspect of their plan is halting the rail line at Balboa Boulevard. 
Planners have found no way other than costly tunneling to get trains through 
the West Valley without disturbing some residents.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEIGHBORS MUST GIVE OK FOR REBUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council has adopted an interim policy to require 15 property 
owners to win approval from their neighbors before they can begin work to tear 
down or substantially rebuild their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 projects were left in limbo last week when the council adopted an 
emergency ordinance that limits the floor area of single-family dwellings to 
60% of the lot area. The projects, which exceed that limit, cannot proceed 
until neighbors either approve plans or fail to comment after being notified by 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
If a project is controversial, the matter may be appealed to the City Council, 
a process that planning officials said can take several months. 
</P>
<P>
Several property owners objected to the new procedure, but Mayor Katy Geissert 
defended the approach. "It's been a tough issue," she said. "There are people 
who are really up-tight on both sides. . . . We are honestly trying to be 
fair." 
</P>
<P>
The interim policy will apply to only those 15 projects. Any new proposals that 
exceed the 60% limit will be unable to proceed until the city completes a study 
on permanent size and height limits for single-family homes.

2 BADLY HURT AS CAR HITS TRACTOR-TRAILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small convertible sports car crashed into the back of a parked 18-wheel 
tractor-trailer rig in Laguna Beach early Monday morning, critically injuring 
its driver and a passenger, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Stewart, 26, of Irvine, who was driving the car, and his passenger, John 
Gilmour, 22, of West Hollywood, were listed in critical condition at Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, suffering from head 
injuries, spleen injuries and broken facial bones, hospital spokeswoman Nancy 
Gasho said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart also broke his left arm and knee, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was driving a Fiat Spyder convertible northbound in the 400 block of 
North Coast Highway shortly after midnight, Police Sgt. Ray Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
He apparently veered off the road and smashed into the rear of the truck, which 
was parked on the right shoulder of the highway, Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the tractor-trailer, who was not injured, told police that he had 
been inspecting his lights to prepare for a long-distance trip when he heard a 
loud crash. He rushed to the back of the rig and saw the mangled wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
The tractor-trailer was not damaged, Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Greg Bartz said motorists who stopped at the scene of the accident told 
them that they saw Stewart driving "erratically" moments before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
He said a blood sample was taken from Stewart at the hospital to test for 
alcohol in his blood. Results of that test are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going on suspicion that (Stewart) may have been operating the vehicle 
under the influence of alcohol," Bartz said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication that Stewart had been speeding, Bartz said.

GRAND JURY CRITICIZES ANIMAL CONTROL POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report from the Orange County Grand Jury has recommended improvements in the 
administration of the county's Animal Control Shelter, saying its policies and 
authority are confused and its employees rude to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"Officers who deal with citizens lack public contact skills," said the report, 
which was released Friday. "Complaints received indicate they sometimes lose 
their tempers, become rude and provide inadequate explanations to the public 
regarding animal treatment." 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that shelter workers must rely on "informal knowledge" of 
proper procedures and that the department's policies are "not clearly stated." 
</P>
<P>
It also said the shelter is operating at a deficit, while it should generate 
enough revenue to be self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury recommended that the county provide better training for the 
employees, conduct an audit of the department's finances, establish proper 
procedures and distinguish the authority of the county from the state 
Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
County shelter officials were not available for comment.

SUSPECT IN SLAYING OF WIFE TO BE RETURNED BY ANAHEIM POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
An Anaheim Hills chemical engineer accused of murdering his wife, threatening 
54 other people and then leading authorities on a manhunt through the wilds of 
Montana, agreed Monday to waive extradition and is scheduled to be returned to 
Orange County late today. 
</P>
<P>
After consulting with a court-appointed lawyer here, David Lee Schoenecker, 48, 
agreed to sign an extradition waiver before Montana's 4th Judicial District 
Court, according to the attorney, Larry Mansch. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police detectives who came here last weekend to take charge of the case 
are scheduled to accompany Schoenecker on an Orange County-bound flight from 
the Missoula County International Airport this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Later this week, the fugitive is expected to be arraigned in Orange County on 
charges of shooting and killing his wife, Gail Schoenecker, a 40-year-old 
elementary school teacher, at the couple's home on May 5. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Biskar, an Orange County deputy public defender with whom Mansch 
consulted, said Schoenecker has indicated that he cannot afford to hire a 
private attorney and will ask at his arraignment that a lawyer be appointed to 
represent him at taxpayers' expense. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing earlier Monday, Missoula County Justice of the Peace Michael D. 
Morris charged Schoenecker with being a fugitive in the state of Montana and 
ordered that his bail stand at $500,000. The bail was originally set Friday in 
the Mineral County Court, in Superior, near where the fugitive was tracked down 
in deep snow by a specially deputized posse. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Morris also appointed a member of the local public defender's office to 
represent Schoenecker in his extradition proceedings, after the fugitive, 
wearing an orange-colored jumpsuit and leaning casually against a podium in the 
small courtroom, said he did not know if he had money for a private lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to check my private property and assets," Schoenecker said to the 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker, who had refused to sign an extradition waiver following his 
arraignment Friday, told the judge that one reason he wanted a lawyer was so he 
could have the extradition process explained to him. 
</P>
<P>
When the brief hearing ended and Schoenecker was being led back to the Missoula 
County Jail where he had been held since Saturday, he ignored a reporter's 
shouted request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Mineral County Sheriff Wade VanGilder, who arrested Schoenecker at gunpoint, 
said the suspect has adamantly refused to be interviewed by newspapers. 
However, Schoenecker on Saturday did answer questions from a California 
newspaper columnist to whom he had written last week assertedly admitting that 
he killed his wife and planned to "punish" 54 relatives and acquaintances, most 
of whom live in Wisconsin. Schoenecker and his wife moved to California from 
the Milwaukee area about 2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After the Friday morning hearing before Judge Morris, Mansch spent the better 
part of the day explaining the extradition process to Schoenecker. At one point 
during the more than 4 hours that the two consulted in jail, Schoenecker asked 
Mansch to telephone the public defender's office in Orange County for 
elaboration on some of the technical points of extradition. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to make sure the process worked the way it is supposed to work," 
Mansch said. "We didn't talk at all about the case. We just talked about the 
extradition process." 
</P>
<P>
Mansch declined to elaborate on Schoenecker's concerns or on why he finally 
decided to waive extradition. Biskar, in a telephone interview from Santa Ana, 
said Schoenecker was mostly concerned "about the procedures of extradition and 
what it means." 
</P>
<P>
The extradition process in Montana is relatively simple, according to Missoula 
County Atty. Robert L. Deschamps III. The suspect has either to waive 
extradition, in which case he is immediately returned to the jurisdiction where 
he is charged, or he can try to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
If the suspect refuses to sign extradition papers, Deschamps said the police 
officers who want him must obtain a governor's warrant for his return. That can 
take up to 30 days, although Anaheim police officials say they could have 
obtained one for Schoenecker in only a few days. 
</P>
<P>
When the warrant is returned to Montana, Deschamps said there are only two 
issues the state must decide before agreeing to an extradition request: Does an 
outside law enforcement agency, such as Anaheim police, have jurisdiction over 
the crime, and has the suspect been properly identified. 
</P>
<P>
"If he (Schoenecker) could prove he was in Montana at the time of the crime, 
that would be another matter," Dechamps said. 
</P>
<P>
Had Schoenecker chosen to do so, he could have delayed extradition by as long 
as 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
"But in the end he would lose," Deschamps added. 
</P>
<P>
Although fugitives being held in Montana are subject to automatic release if 
they are not extradited within 90 days, Montana officials said that never 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker's extradition proceedings Monday created great confusion in the 
Missoula County Courthouse, where county judicial employees said they learned 
through the local Missoulian newspaper that the fugitive would be making an 
appearance in court that day. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Wing, a deputy county attorney assigned to the case, spent the entire 
morning rushing from one office to another and telephoning Mineral County 
authorities on when Schoenecker was supposed to appear. Even the Missoula 
County Jail officials said they had been given no warning. 
</P>
<P>
Wing had so little time to prepare for her court appearance on the state's 
behalf that she misquoted the charge against Schoenecker, referring to it as 
"robbery and homicide." Schoenecker promptly corrected her, when the judge 
asked if he understood the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbery I don't understand," Schoenecker said. 
</P>
<P>
Wing subsequently realized that she had referred to the robbery-homicide 
classification of the Anaheim detectives who are investigating the case and 
sheepishly corrected herself.

NRC ALLOWS START-UP OF DAMAGED REACTOR AT SAN ONOFRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators gave the green light Monday for operators of the San Onofre 
nuclear power plant to fire up the Unit 1 reactor, despite damage to bolts 
holding an important thermal shield. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission came amid complaints from a 
San Diego-area congressman that the reactor is "an accident waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with Southern California Edison Co., the utility that operates the 
plant just down the coast from San Clemente, said the problem with the bolts 
does not threaten safe operation of the plant. The bolts are to be fixed in 
about a year. 
</P>
<P>
The thermal shield, a 2 1/2-inch-thick cylinder, surrounds the reactor core and 
protects the pressure vessel from radiation that, over time, makes the vessel 
more brittle. The shield rests on six supporting blocks and is tied to the 
reactor floor by 30 bolts. Three bolts have come partly unscrewed, and others 
appear to be in a degraded condition. 
</P>
<P>
Critics worry that problems with the bolts could cause the shield to come 
loose, fall to the reactor floor and block the flow of coolant. But Edison 
officials contend that such a scenario is highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Morgan, station manager at the plant, likened the damage to the bolts to 
the loss of a single screw from a door hinge that continues to work properly 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's satisfactorily sound," Morgan said. "There's more than sufficient support 
for the thermal shield . . . And we're not planning to operate in this 
condition for what would be considered an extended period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such assurances, Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) continued Monday to blast 
the NRC and Edison for the decision to start up the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an accident waiting to happen," Bates said. "They may be lucky and it 
might get through, but I think it's irresponsible, unconscionable. It's playing 
hard, fast and loose with the public safety." 
</P>
<P>
Bates said he would urge "the interested parties," such as lawmakers with the 
cities of San Diego and Oceanside who have expressed concern over the situation 
at Unit 1, to seek a court order blocking start-up of the reactor. 
</P>
<P>
He argued that plant operators are eager to fire up Unit 1 because further 
delays would only cost more money, weakening the utility's efforts to assume 
control of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. Bates also maintained that putting 
off the repairs will save about $15 million for the takeover effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a production-driven system based on money," Bates said. "But I think they 
should err on the side of the public, not on the side of money." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at San Onofre refused to comment on Bates' remarks. 
</P>
<P>
San Onofre officials said they expect the plant, which has been out of service 
for refueling since the beginning of the year, to begin producing electricity 
again Thursday or Friday. Each day the reactor is out of service it costs the 
utility $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from a feeling that the repairs are not a pressing need, Morgan said 
operators wanted to delay the job to allow sufficient time for design work and 
to invite bids, thus reducing its cost. 
</P>
<P>
If the repairs had been started after the problem was first discovered in 
January by a remote-operated camera inserted into the reactor vessel, it 
probably would have taken 6 months to finish the work, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
With adequate time now to determine the best procedure for accomplishing the 
job, the repairs should take only about 3 months when the work is begun, 
probably in mid-1990, he said.

<P>
If there is a dark horse in the Southern Section 4-A tennis playoffs, it's 
Mater Dei High School. At this point, there's no other way to classify the 
Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei swept to the Angelus League title and compiled a 19-1 record. Not a 
bad season. But when the Southern Section announced its pairings, Mater Dei was 
not among the seeded teams. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei plays host to Baldwin Park as first-round play begins today at 3:15 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
If the Monarchs win, they play the winner of today's Newport Harbor-Marina 
match. Some reward. Newport Harbor (13-7) is seeded fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei depends on the singles play of brothers Dax and Adam Peterson. Dax, a 
senior, plays at No. 1 singles. Adam, a freshman, plays at No. 2 singles. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar, the third-seeded team in the 4-A, plays host to Nogales (17-4). 
Top-seeded Santa Barbara (20-0) plays host to Santa Ynez (8-12), and 
second-seeded Beverly Hills (14-6) plays host to Ventura (13-7). 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A, top-seeded Woodbridge (15-4) plays host to Claremont (11-8). 
Second-seeded Laguna Beach -- led by Jon Leach, last year's Southern Section 
singles champion -- plays host to Esperanza (7-9). Laguna Beach is 17-3. 
Third-seeded Sunny Hills (18-1) plays host to Rubidoux (14-6). 
</P>
<P>
San Marino, which has won back-to-back 3-A titles, is unseeded with a 17-3 
record. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A, Valencia (15-4), the Orange League champion, is fourth-seeded and 
plays host to Bonita (12-8). ELLIOTT TEAFORD

COUNTY TEAMS LACK REQUISITE PITCHING PUNCH

<P>
Orange County teams are not projected to be heavy hitters in this season's 
Southern Section softball playoffs, which begin today with wild-card games in 
the 5-A division. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason is county teams don't have the dominant pitching of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 32 county teams participating in five of six divisions (Orange County 
does not have 2-A leagues), only two are seeded. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, the highest-seeded county team, did not even qualify for postseason 
play last year. The Vaqueros (18-7), the No. 1 team from the South Coast 
League, are seeded third in the 3-A behind top-seeded La Mirada (25-1) and 
undefeated Covina (21-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
Irvine plays at home Thursday against Mayfair (15-9). Nine other county schools 
made the 32-team 3-A bracket, including South Coast League teams San Clemente 
(11-12), El Toro (12-8) and Mission Viejo (14-8). 
</P>
<P>
In the 5-A, top-seeded St. Joseph of Lakewood (21-1) from the Angelus League 
has the section's best pitcher in Lisa Fernandez -- the heir apparent to 
Michele Granger. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (15-6-1), the third-place team from the Angelus League, and Marina 
(18-9), Fountain Valley (18-6-1), Los Alamitos (14-10) and El Dorado (16-7) 
made the 16-team bracket. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley might have the best shot at the finals, but it's a long one. 
Fountain Valley has a strong pitcher in Rae Rice, and though her statistics 
have not been great because she was injured, she has mended and is on the 
upswing. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A, Kennedy (18-4) is seeded fourth and one of 12 county teams in the 
32-team draw. Kennedy, the Garden Grove league champion, is led by pitcher 
Cheryl Longeway.

EL DORADO TRIES TO TURN IT AROUND

<TEXT>
<P>
A year of expectation has turned into frustration for El Dorado High School, a 
team that limps into the Southern Section 5-A division baseball playoffs as the 
No. 2 entry from the Empire League after being ranked No. 1 in Orange County in 
the preseason polls. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Golden Hawks were seeded first in the division and were named 
the county's mythical champion after finishing the regular season with a 22-3 
record. This year, El Dorado is 18-8 despite returning the county's best 
pitching staff and several other key players. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the disappointing season, Coach Steve Gullotti is looking forward to 
the playoffs, where the Golden Hawks play host to Nogales (19-6) Friday in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood (22-3) is seeded first in the division with Riverside Poly (23-3) 
second, Simi Valley (21-3) third and Mater Dei (20-5) fourth. For the third 
consecutive year, an Empire League team will play in the wild-card game with 
Los Alamitos (13-13) traveling to Bishop Montgomery (13-7) today. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A, Anaheim (17-9) is riding a 13-game winning streak and gained its 
first league championship since 1981, but the Colonists drew one of the 
toughest No. 2 entries in the division by playing host to Capistrano Valley 
(16-9). 
</P>
<P>
Three county schools -- El Modena (11-11), Irvine (13-12) and La Habra (13-8) 
-- drew wild-card games today with Irvine playing host to La Habra. Buena 
(18-2-2) is top-seeded and plays host to Valencia (11-10) Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In an interesting move by the pairings committee, Upland (21-5) was seeded 
fourth but is the No. 2 entry from the Baseline League. Upland lost a coin 
flip, so the school travels to Western (15-10) Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A, Laguna Hills (22-4) is the fourth-seeded team and will play host to 
Saddleback (13-12) Friday. Laguna Hills has won 19 of its past 20 games and 
finished the regular season as the top-ranked team in the county.

defended her section championship in the 200-yard individual medley, winning in 
2 minutes 5.30 seconds. She also won the 100-yard butterfly in 56.90. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh, a four-year varsity swimmer, was undefeated in Sunset League competition 
this year. She helped Marina to a second-place league finish and was voted 
Sunset League swimmer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Though she specializes in the individual medley and the butterfly, "she swims 
just about everything pretty well," Marina Coach Dave Pickford said. "We have 
10 events and she holds the school record in eight of them." 
</P>
<P>
A member of Fullerton Aquatics Swim Team (FAST), she works out from 5:15 to 
6:45 a.m. and again from 3:15 to 5:45 p.m. every day except Sunday. She often 
sits in class smelling of chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't bother her. 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't have much time to go out with friends during the week. But she 
doesn't let that bother her either. 
</P>
<P>
"For most kids in high school, swimming is an activity," Pickford said. "It is 
something to do. For other kids, it is a sport. They are going to get a letter 
in it and try to qualify for CIF. And then there are people who make things 
happen, and Betsi is in that category." 
</P>
<P>
Hugh knows what she wants -- a spot on the 1992 U.S. Olympic team. "That has 
been my goal forever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, as a 15-year-old sophomore, Hugh won the 200-yard individual 
medley in the 18-and-under division at the Junior Nationals in Milwaukee. She 
has been working to match the exhilaration of that victory ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get up on that top block and know you've won, it is like a really 
neat feeling," she said. "You go, 'Wow! I want to get back in that pool,' 
because you know you can go faster." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans of El Dorado won the 200 individual medley, swimming a national 
high school record time of 1:59.96 at the Southern Section 3-A swim

</P>
<P>
Allison Franke of Canyon set a Southern Section 3-A record in the discus with 
the third-best toss (160-6) in Orange County history at the 3-A track and field 
preliminaries at Gahr Saturday.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL; 
</P>
<P>
LET'S PLAY IT AGAIN, ORANGE EMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sure, the Orange Empire Conference baseball season ended 10 days ago. And sure, 
there already have been two rounds of the state playoffs with a third to start 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But, somehow, it doesn't seem all that different from the Orange Empire 
Conference season. 
</P>
<P>
First, Orange Coast and Rancho Santiago colleges played Saturday to decide 
which team would advance to the third round of the playoffs. Rancho Santiago 
won, 2-1, in the fifth meeting this season between the teams, both Orange 
Empire Conference members. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Rancho Santiago earned a berth in one of the two Southern 
California Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (29-15) will take on Cypress (31-13), another Orange Empire 
Conference member, at 11 a.m. Friday in the first round of the 
double-elimination regional at Rancho Santiago. The Dons defeated Cypress in 
three of four games this season, but Cypress won the conference title by one 
game over Rancho Santiago and Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't worry about what happens all season," Rancho Santiago Coach Don 
Sneddon said. "We could have beaten them, 20-0, four times and it wouldn't 
matter. This is a whole new start." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Harbor (29-13) plays Palomar (21-15-1) at 3 p.m. Friday at Rancho 
Santiago. The losers' bracket game is at 10 a.m. Saturday at Fullerton College 
and the winners will play at 11 a.m. Saturday at Rancho Santiago. The regional 
final is Sunday and its winner advances to the state tournament at Sacramento 
City College, May 26-28. 
</P>
<P>
By winning the conference title, Cypress got a 13-day break, but Coach Scott 
Pickler doesn't think the layoff will affect his team. 
</P>
<P>
"You try and make your practices as much like games as possible," Pickler said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Sneddon and Pickler said pitching that decides the regional. And when it 
comes to pitching, Cypress should hold an advantage over Rancho Santiago. 
Cypress used three starters -- Jeff Patterson (9-3), Dennis Burbank (12-4) and 
Rich Lodding (7-2) -- all season. Rancho Santiago went with Jack Bailey (12-4) 
and Willie Navarrette (11-4). 
</P>
<P>
Records? Navarrette's complete-game victory over Orange Coast Saturday gave him 
a Rancho Santiago single-season record 140 1/3 innings pitched. But he might 
not hold the record too long. Teammate Bailey has pitched 139 1/3 innings this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Navarrette, a sophomore left-hander, has pitched 248 1/3 innings in his 
community college career and has a good chance to set a school record by 
surpassing Mike Schwabe (1985-86), who pitched 257 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Navarrette needs three more victories to tie Schwabe's career record of 25. 
Because of a misprint in the Rancho Santiago media guide, Navarrette was 
thought to have broken the record Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Cypress softball team travels to San Diego Mesa today at noon to complete 
its best-of-three second round of the playoff series. Cypress won Saturday's 
opening game, 4-2, but Sunday's game was rained out. 
</P>
<P>
If Cypress loses the first game today, the teams would play again immediately 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the series advances to the state tournament, which starts Friday 
at Golden West. Cypress is 34-12 and Mesa is 28-14. 
</P>
<P>
At noon, the Cypress/Mesa winner plays San Mateo (34-10) and Fullerton (35-10) 
plays Foothill (28-7). At 2 p.m., West Valley (34-13) plays Moorpark (34-10) 
and Fresno City (29-21) plays Palomar (34-5). The double-elimination tournament 
continues Friday night, Saturday and Sunday at Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
Back in March, when Mike Mayne said he was stepping down as baseball coach at 
Orange Coast, he had thoughts of working as an assistant at a four-year program 
or for a professional organization. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayne now says he will stay at Orange Coast and work as an assistant. Scott 
Groot, now an assistant at Orange Coast, will be head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are saying that I'm leaving OCC," Mayne said. "It's not true. 
I'll be there just like always, only as an assistant coach. I'm just getting 
away from some of the administrative duties that the head coach has to look 
after." 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Coast and Golden West women's tennis teams play at 2 p.m. today at 
Ridgeline Country Club in Orange for the Southern California dual-meet team 
championship. Orange Coast won the Southern California individual championships 
over the weekend with 19 points. Golden West was second with 18 points. . . . 
The Orange Coast freshmen eight crew has been invited to the Intercollegiate 
Rowing Championships June 1-3 on Lake Ononodaga in Syracuse, N.Y.

Hotel Investor Firms to Hire Investment Bankers: Hotel Investors Trust and 
Hotel Investors Corp., two companies whose shares are paired on the New York 
Stock Exchange, said they plan to hire investment bankers to consider ways for 
boosting the shares' value. Hotel Investors Trust, based in Woodland Hills, 
invests in lodging properties and Hotel Investors Corp. is a hotel management 
concern. The companies said they took the action because their shares have been 
underpriced and do not reflect "their intrinsic value." After the announcement 
last week, the companies' shares jumped 15% to $9.50 a share; they closed 
Monday at $9.25 a share. Before the announcement, the shares had been trading 
near their lowest level for the past year. The companies gave no specifics 
about what steps might be taken. But the bankers likely would consider a 
financial restructuring of the companies, a share buyback and the sale of part 
or all of the companies, among other things.

RECYCLING BRINGS PROFITS; 
</P>
<P>
CORPORATIONS TAKING WASTEPAPER TO THE BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Corporations nationwide are turning wastepaper into money. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph last year saved $1 million in disposal costs 
and made a $365,000 profit by recycling its office wastepaper instead of 
sending it to a trash heap. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of America earns an estimated $354,000 a year, while cutting $62,000 
from its annual waste-hauling expenses, by participating in a recycling 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, MCI Communications Corp. picked up an extra $30,352 last year and 
saved $7,000 in disposal expenses by selling 42 tons of used computer printout 
and ledger sheets to companies that turned the stuff into toilet paper and 
paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate paper-recycling programs, once public relations gimmicks designed to 
placate restive environmentalists, increasingly are being used by companies 
that realize there is serious money to be saved and earned in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Exact figures are not available for the number of companies participating in 
recycling programs, according to Bill Hancock, a spokesman for the American 
Paper Institute in New York. But he estimates that corporations now recycle 
about 200,000 tons of paper annually, contrasted with almost nothing 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The recycling programs are enterprises born of necessity, and an acknowledgment 
that the idea of the paperless office was a much ballyhooed notion that will 
likely never come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the paper load is getting heavier. 
</P>
<P>
Each office worker produced an average of between half and three-quarters of a 
pound of wastepaper each working day in 1979, according to the Office Paper 
Recycling Service (OPRS), a New York recycling consulting group. Today, the 
average office worker produces at least a pound a day, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, much of that excess paper is being generated by computers and other 
electronic communications systems that were supposed to make paper eventually 
obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disposal Costs Higher 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the 1970s, people were talking about the 'paperless office' and the 
'checkless society,' but I wasn't buying any of that," said Burke Stinson, 
spokesman for AT&amp;T's paper recycling project. 
</P>
<P>
Computers can store information for decades and zap it from one place to 
another in an instant, but everybody wants to hold on to a computer printout of 
some sort, said Stinson. 
</P>
<P>
With the paper mountain growing and dumping space shrinking, disposal costs 
have skyrocketed. A New Jersey company that paid an average of $5 a ton for 
trash disposal in 1970 now pays about $100 a ton, according to state 
environmental officials. 
</P>
<P>
The disposal price increases have created a keen interest in corporate 
paper-recycling programs, one that has companies from Australia to New York 
seeking services from OPRS.

EMPLOYEES OF PIRELLI ARMSTRONG STUDY ITALIAN

A year after Armstrong Tire Co. was acquired by the Italian tire-maker Pirelli, 
several dozen employees of the new Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. are going the 
extra mile and studying the mother tongue of their mother company. 
</P>
<P>
Treading where they haven't been in years -- the classroom -- the new Italian 
language students range from vice presidents to engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the employees are spending extra time at work to take classes being 
offered in the cafeteria of the company's headquarters. Others, including some 
vice presidents, are being trained by tutors who come to their offices or are 
taking college courses. 
</P>
<P>
In the hallways of the company's headquarters, and out on the building's 
grounds, it is not uncommon to hear employees practicing their new language 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
Pirelli Armstrong officials say that it was their idea to start the program and 
that participation in the crash-language courses has been strictly voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our way of saying we like being part of the Pirelli organization," said 
Jan Colella, employee relations manager at Pirelli Armstrong. "It was our idea. 
They (executives in Italy) said slow down, you don't have to learn so fast," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the people from the Pirelli Group in Milan, Italy, speak English, 
not all do so well, "so it is helpful if we can meet each other halfway 
sometimes," Colella said. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 employees have finished a beginner's class and have moved on to the 
next level of instruction. Meanwhile, a second beginner's class has also 
started. The classes are held 2 days a week, from 4 to 6 p.m., so that the 
employees are taught partly on their own time and partly on the company's. The 
work day ends at 5. 
</P>
<P>
At least seven management-level employees are learning Italian through the 
Berlitz method, including William Bruce, who is a vice president and corporate 
counsel. "It's tough to go back to school after all these years," said Bruce, 
who is 37. It's even tougher, he said, to find the time for visits by a tutor 
and for studying.

TOBACCO AD BAN IN CANADA KINDLES FIRE UNDER CONGRESS 
</P>

<P>
Canada's tough new anti-smoking laws banning print advertising and requiring 
disclosure of cigarette ingredients have encouraged advocacy groups in the 
United States to demand similar legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"A big part of it is the Canadian bill that shows such legislation can work and 
is not just pie in the sky," said Phil Wilbur, director of Advocacy Institute, 
a health research center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 anti-smoking bills are pending before Congress, including one drafted 
by Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) to restrict print advertising and another by Sen. 
Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) to eliminate the tax deductibility of tobacco 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lukin (D-Ohio) has asked the Justice Department to look into whether 
product placement in movies that might appear on television violates the 
current advertising ban. 
</P>
<P>
"The mood in the United States has changed. The swing is against the special 
interests represented by the tobacco companies," Wilbur said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
He said many of the bills were drafted after Canada led the way. Canada's 
smoking ban on airline flights of less than 2 hours' duration in 1987 preceded 
similar legislation in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Conservative government also considered a complete ban on smoking 
but opted instead for the restrictive Tobacco Products Control Act that banned 
newspaper and magazine advertising and required cigarette companies to disclose 
to the Health Department the ingredients in their cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
A ban on billboard advertising takes effect next January and tobacco companies 
have also been ordered to halt sponsorships of sports and cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield Mahood, executive director of the Non-Smokers Rights Assn. in Toronto 
credited with leading the anti-smoking campaign, said the United States will be 
under pressure to pass its own Tobacco Products Control Act. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans have a great appreciation of the value of disclosure and this bill 
is an example," Mahood said. 
</P>
<P>
"American legislators will be hard pressed to tell Americans why, when the 
industry (in Canada) is disclosing the toxic constituents of second-hand smoke, 
that information should be privileged in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian law has infuriated tobacco companies, which are going to ingenious 
lengths to avoid the disclosure clause. 
</P>
<P>
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. of Winston-Salem, N.C. said in January that it was 
changing the recipe of its four brands sold in Canada -- Winston, Camel, Salem 
and More -- to get around the disclosure regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"The company doesn't have to give the recipe to any other government. To 
protect the confidentiality (of ingredients) it made a switch on the Canadian 
product," said Jeffrey Labow of RJR Macdonald Inc., the Canadian subsidiary of 
R.J. Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Labow said the new brands went on sale 3 weeks ago and it is still too early to 
estimate the impact on sales. However, the company said its research indicated 
that people who tried them "don't see any difference whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. cigarette makers want to protect their tiny niche in Canada, where imports 
have a 1% market share. The market is expected to improve under the U.S.-Canada 
free trade agreement, which will reduce or eliminate tariffs on imported 
American cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada, the government's reporting agency, estimated that there were 
5.6 million smokers in the country in 1986. While the number of male smokers 
has declined, a growing number of women seem to be taking up the habit, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's three tobacco companies, RJR Macdonald, Imperial Tobacco Ltd. and 
Rothmans Benson &amp; Hedges Inc., have launched separate court challenges of 
the Tobacco Products Control Act. 
</P>
<P>
RJR Macdonald, in documents filed in the Quebec Superior Court, charges that 
the legislation violates freedom of speech guarantees in the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
The company also says the law puts Canadian cigarette companies at a 
disadvantage because the advertising ban does not apply to foreign magazines. 
About 60% of cigarette advertising read by Canadians appears in U.S. 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the American Bar Assn., along with the newspaper and 
magazine publishing industries, vigorously opposed similar legislation 
suggested 2 years ago.

Summer vacation often means travel, and traditionally summer is the biggest 
travel season in the United States. To that end, companies that serve travelers 
are beginning to gird themselves for the annual onslaught. A case in point: 
travelers checks. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the world's biggest travelers check companies have come out with 
announcements. Spokesmen for the three -- American Express Travel Related 
Services, MasterCard International and Visa International -- said the approach 
of summer was the reason the announcements were timed for late March. 
</P>
<P>
"Approximately 40% of our annual sales take place in June, July and August," 
said John B. Wright, president of MasterCard's travelers check unit. 
</P>
<P>
What's new in the hotly competitive $56-billion market for travelers checks? 
The battle rages on two fronts. 
</P>
<P>
The first line is the consumer, who should be concerned with fees, 
acceptability and ease of refunds. Experts said about two-thirds of the 
travelers checks sold in this country are sold without fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seek Highest Profit 
</P>
<P>
Acceptance worldwide and ease of refunds are the subject of debate among the 
companies and the theme of various ad campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The other battlefield is the distributor, who wants to know which is the most 
profitable check to sell. 
</P>
<P>
With the last few days, the big players announced these changes: 
</P>
<P>
* American Express launched an advertising campaign for its Worldwide Refund 
Delivery program, which promises to hand-deliver replacements for lost or 
stolen American Express travelers checks anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The company, the industry leader and the biggest spender on consumer 
advertising for the checks, says the refund can be obtained by calling one of 
12 toll-free numbers from any of the 570 million telephones in the world. 
</P>
<P>
* MasterCard, taking a stand on the distribution front, introduced a voluntary 
program in which it will invest the "float" -- the money paid by customers for 
travelers checks that have not yet been spent -- on behalf of any financial 
institution that sells its checks, and will pay that institution a sales 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the institutions had to pay MasterCard an administrative fee and 
invest the float themselves. Wright, the unit's president, said many small 
banks and other sellers had asked for this system, which is the way American 
Express operates. MasterCard, an association of member banks, does not issue 
travelers checks itself, but licenses issuers. 
</P>
<P>
* Visa announced an expanded refund network and predicted that it would outsell 
American Express outside the United States this year -- which produced the 
closest thing to a snort of derision one is likely to get from the 
buttoned-down financial-services types at American Express. As Tom Cash, senior 
vice president at American Express Travel-Related Services, put it: "People can 
make all kinds of projections, and what they have to do is deliver on that." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the international travelers check market is growing at 7% to 8% a 
year, notwithstanding the increasing acceptability of credit cards in many 
tourist destinations. That's twice the rate of growth of the American travel 
business, according to Cash, who added that he sees travelers checks as an 
alternative to cash, not to credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
"People still buy travelers checks," said Spencer Nilson, publisher of the 
Nilson Report, a publication that tracks travelers checks and other non-cash 
payment systems. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of people don't want to carry their credit cards. The difference 
is, you can convert travelers checks to cash, and (with) bank cards you can't 
always do that. There's no substitute (for cash) for a taxicab."

Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang today promised students on a hunger strike 
that China will take concrete steps toward democracy, one of the demands by the 
500,000 people jamming Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
As China's leaders held a historic summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev inside the Great Hall of the People, protesters surged onto its steps 
today and turned the adjoining 100-acre square into a vast parade ground, 
including 3,000 students on a 4-day-old hunger strike. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police and soldiers guarded the hall's entrances, but no police 
were seen in the square. 
</P>
<P>
After midnight, Zhao sent a message to the students on behalf of the party 
Politburo Standing Committee, the highest party body, saying it affirmed their 
patriotic spirit in calling for greater democracy and attacking official 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the government won't punish them and will "work out 
concrete measures to enhance democracy and law, oppose corruption, build an 
honest and clean government and expand openness." 
</P>
<P>
The message addressed key demands of the students, but it was not clear whether 
they will be satisfied. He did not accede to a demand for a dialogue with 
officials, to be broadcast live. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Reforms Overnight 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in his meeting with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping today, raised the 
issue of the unprecedented protests raging in Beijing and said, "We also have 
hotheads." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, stayed clear of the mass of student 
demonstrators for a second day today. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told reporters that 
Gorbachev raised the student issue with Deng and expressed confidence that the 
Chinese leadership could resolve the situation "for the benefit of the entire 
country." 
</P>
<P>
" 'We also have hotheads' is what he said," Gerasimov reported. "He said both 
sides have their hotheads who want to renovate the system overnight. Gorbachev 
said this was, of course, impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"He said this does not happen overnight. That only happens in fairy tales," 
Gerasimov said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said Gorbachev also raised the question of the demands of the 
students as expressed in their banners and slogans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Who Is More Interested?' 
</P>
<P>
"We also have our slogans. They are similar to what our slogans, the slogans of 
our party, were. After all, who is more interested in renovating the system 
than the party that introduced the reforms?" Gorbachev was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Gorbachev's remarks about "hotheads" meant that he was also 
referring to the Chinese students as such, Gerasimov stumbled and said 
unconvincingly that the Soviet leader was referring to Soviet radicals only. 
</P>
<P>
He then repeated: " 'We also have hotheads' is what he said." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader, on his way back to the state guest house after lunch with 
Deng, avoided Tien An Men Square but stopped his car and got out to shake hands 
with pedestrians, New China News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Raisa Gorbachev earlier toured the national library with Zhu Lin, the wife of 
Premier Li Peng. She, too, walked into a crowd of spectators upon her arrival 
and greeted them with handshakes and hellos in Chinese.

TEACHERS REMAIN OUT AMID NEGOTIATIONS

<P>
With education grinding to a standstill, the Los Angeles Unified School 
District entered its second day of a teachers' strike as district and union 
officials continued intense negotiations focusing on possible new salary 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
A district source said the Los Angeles Board of Education was considering a 
package of proposals from United Teachers-Los Angeles that were presented late 
Monday. No specifics were offered. 
</P>
<P>
But UTLA President Wayne Johnson denied reports that the union had proposed a 
new salary package for a 22.5% raise over three years. The district has offered 
21.5% over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he had not been in communication with any district official as of 
late this morning. "I am much less hopeful today than yesterday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some schools reported higher attendance among students today, high 
school students in particular continued to leave campus in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
At Franklin High School in Highland Park, about 500 students walked out at 10 
a.m. to stage a protest outside the school. Police were called in when students 
began blocking traffic, but no injuries were reported and no arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Students said school administrators attempted to lock gates to prevent students 
from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Said Angelina Barriga, an 11th-grader: "As soon as we started walking out, they 
closed the gates and shut the doors and barricaded students." She said students 
got out by jumping fences, breaking through gates and rushing past school 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two sides issued conflicting reports on how many teachers 
remained on strike today. Union officials said at least 25,000 of the 
district's 32,000 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians stayed out on the 
picket lines on the second day of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hanging strong," union spokeswoman Catherine Carey said. 
</P>
<P>
The district, however, said early indications today showed that teachers were 
"trickling back" into schools in three regions -- the south San Fernando 
Valley, the Eastside and Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
District spokeswoman Diana Munatones said between one and seven teachers per 
school who had not been in class Monday reported to work this morning.

HELICOPTER IN CHUCK NORRIS MOVIE CRASHES; 4 KILLED

A helicopter used in filming the Chuck Norris movie "Delta Force 2" crashed in 
a ravine today, killing three Americans and the Filipino pilot and seriously 
injuring four other Americans, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Norris was not on board. 
</P>
<P>
The scene called for the Dolphin helicopter to catch fire, said police 
investigator Jaime Talay, and it took several moments before the stunned crew 
on the ground realized that the crash was real. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Near Unfinished Mansion 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred near an unfinished hilltop mansion in the mountain resort of 
Tagaytay called the Palace in the Sky that ousted First Lady Imelda Marcos 
started building in 1983 as a guest house for a visit, never made, by then-U.S. 
President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Police and members of the film crew said the helicopter had just taken off to 
film a scene when it veered to the left and plunged into a 40-foot ravine. 
</P>
<P>
A fire truck stationed nearby helped extinguish the blaze, Talay said. 
</P>
<P>
Talay identified the three dead Americans as electricians Don Marshall and Mike 
Graham and cameraman Gaddi Dansig. 
</P>
<P>
The Filipino pilot, Jojo Imperial, died a few hours later in a hospital, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 people were hospitalized in nearby Dasmarinas, but most had only minor 
injuries, a nurse said. Two were in critical condition and two others had 
serious but not life-threatening injuries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The injured were identified as American stunt men John Ryan, Jeff Brewer and 
Bani Simanthof and American actor Matthew Gomez. No hometowns were available, 
and hospital authorities refused to identify the critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Location for 2 Months 
</P>
<P>
The crew of "Delta Force 2" had been in the Philippines for two months and was 
due to finish filming May 27. The movie depicts the destruction of a Latin 
American drug syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second accident involving a Norris film in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a Philippine military Sikorsky helicopter used by Norris' crew crashed 
in Manila Bay, killing three Filipino soldiers working as extras.

Helen Suzman, the country's most durable anti-apartheid politician, announced 
today that she will retire in September after 36 years in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Suzman, 71, is the longest-serving member of Parliament, having represented the 
same Johannesburg constituency since 1953. 
</P>
<P>
From 1961 through 1974, she was the only legislator representing the 
anti-apartheid opposition and often cast the sole vote against discriminatory 
or repressive laws. 
</P>
<P>
She announced that she will not seek reelection on Sept. 6, when a general 
election will be held for the white, Asian and mixed-race chambers of 
Parliament. She has campaigned consistently to extend political rights to the

For the first time since 1978, the television series "Dallas" will not be 
filmed here this summer, a spokesman for Lorimar Productions said today. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not planning to come down at the usual time to shoot the first 12 
episodes," David Stapf told reporters. "No decision has been made for the 
entire year." 
</P>
<P>
"Dallas," for years one of TV's blockbuster hits, has been sagging in the 
ratings the last two years. A Dallas-based film production company estimated 
that the city will lose more than $5 million if "Dallas" spurns it for the 
entire season.

Howard (Buddy) Jacobson, a one-time top horse trainer convicted of killing his 
former girlfriend's lover in a highly publicized New York City trial, died 
early today. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson, 58, died at Erie County Medical Center where he had been under 
treatment for cancer, said a spokesman for Attica state prison, where Jacobson 
had been serving his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Top Horse Trainer 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson, the top horse trainer in the United States in 1963, also accumulated 
a fortune in modeling agency and real estate ventures. 
</P>
<P>
He was serving 25 years to life for second-degree murder in the Aug. 6, 1978, 
killing of John Tupper. Prosecutors claimed that Jacobson killed Tupper in 
jealousy over Tupper's affair with model Melanie Cain. 
</P>
<P>
Tupper, 33, was shot six times, stabbed and beaten. His body was found in a 
dump in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
Cain, who appeared on the covers of several national magazines, including 
Cosmopolitan and Red Book, had lived with Jacobson for four years, but the 
relationship ended 22 days before Tupper's death. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson was convicted in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1980, he escaped from a Brooklyn jail by changing places with a man 
posing as his lawyer. He was captured 40 days later in Manhattan Beach, Calif.

GIRL, 15, NEEDS PARENTS' OK FOR ABORTION, KENNEDY SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy today blocked a 15-year-old 
Florida girl from getting an abortion without first receiving the consent of 
her parents or a judge. 
</P>
<P>
The stay came just three hours after the Florida Supreme Court said it would 
allow the girl to get an abortion, clearing the way for other minors to have 
abortions without such permission. 
</P>
<P>
The state's abortion-consent law, which took effect in February, was ruled 
unconstitutional by a state appellate court Friday, and the state Supreme Court 
said today that it would rule this fall on the law's constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, acting on a request by a lawyer appointed to represent the fetus, 
issued a stay in Washington. His order blocks the abortion until the full U.S. 
Supreme Court considers the matter, probably at a closed conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The case involves a 15-year-old girl who wants an abortion but was afraid to 
seek her parents' consent. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly time is of the essence, and that can be determined from the flurry 
of activity," Richard Boylston, the lawyer appointed to represent the interest 
of the fetus, had said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Jerri Blair, attorney for the Lake County 15-year-old, filed a motion Monday to 
dissolve the stay. 
</P>
<P>
The girl is 12 weeks pregnant, and many clinics won't perform abortions after 
the 13th week of pregnancy because of a greater risk of medical complications, 
she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Before Kennedy issued his stay, Blair refused to say whether her client had 
been told of the Florida high court decision and also said she will not 
disclose any decision the girl might make on whether to go ahead with the 
abortion.

Hewlett-Packard expects to complete the acquisition of Apollo Computer of 
Chelmsford, Mass., by May 22, the giant electronics company announced today. 
</P>
<P>
More than 35 million shares of Apollo Computer Inc. common stock have been 
tendered to the California company, according to a preliminary count by 
Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
The shares, which equal about 97% of the outstanding shares of Apollo, have 
been "accepted for payment in the proposed acquisition of Apollo by HP," the 
company said in a statement. The statement said Apollo will become a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
The merger will unite two of the nation's leading manufacturers of 
workstations, desktop computers that are more powerful than personal computers 
and are generally used by scientists and engineers. They make up the 
fastest-growing segment of the computer industry.

Cray Research Inc., the nation's sole surviving supercomputer maker, held its 
annual meeting amid turmoil today as its shares plunged on Wall Street one day 
after it announced a dramatic restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Cray's stock skidded $4.875 to $50.875 on the New York Stock Exchange in what 
some analysts called a reaction to diminished takeover prospects for the newly 
divided company. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were initially split over whether Cray's plan was an earnest attempt 
to wring more profits from its high-tech products or simply a way to fend off a 
rumored takeover.

CALIFORNIA SUSTAINS SPIRAL IN HOME COSTS;

RISING MORTGAGE RATES SLOW PACE IN NORTHEAST CITIES

Rising mortgage rates hit home sales and prices hard in expensive Northeast 
cities in the first three months of 1989, but booming West Coast markets 
weathered the storm, a real estate trade group said today. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, industrial cities in the Midwest with low-cost housing showed 
healthy appreciation and depressed housing prices in Texas' two largest cities 
began to recover, according to the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of an existing home in the San Francisco area soared to 
$243,900 in the first quarter, meaning half sold for more and half sold for 
less. That represented a 31.8% increase from a year ago and was the steepest 
appreciation rate among 83 metropolitan areas surveyed by the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
California accounted for the top five appreciation rates in the nation. Home 
prices in Orange County shot up 30.2% to a median of $237,900. In Los Angeles, 
prices rose 26.3% to $201,000; San Diego, 21.9% to $163,900, and Riverside-San 
Bernardino, 21.6% to $116,000. 
</P>
<P>
That compares with the 3.4% increase to $91,600 for the median-priced existing 
home for the entire United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The hot spots definitely are on the West Coast," said Ira Gribin, president of 
the realtors' group. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department, in a report issued today, said housing construction 
fell 2.7% in April to the lowest level in more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
Northeastern cities continued to be some of the most expensive places to live, 
but home prices in New York City and its suburbs; Boston and Worcester, Mass., 
and Hartford and New Haven, Conn., either fell or rose only modestly. 
</P>
<P>
New York area prices -- the fifth highest in the nation after San Francisco, 
Orange County, Honolulu and Los Angeles -- sank 2.8% to $181,700. Boston, New 
Haven and Hartford -- the sixth, seventh and eighth most pricey cities -- 
posted appreciation rates of 0.9%, minus 1.3% and minus 0.5%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"The affordability gap already caused prices to slow down in the high-cost 
areas. They were really hit hard when (mortgage) rates started jumping," said 
the trade group's chief economist, John A. Tuccillo. 
</P>
<P>
Fixed-rate mortgages started out the quarter averaging 10.77% and jumped nearly 
half a percentage point to 11.19% by the end of the period. One-year 
adjustable-rate mortgages went from 8.49% to 9.31%. During the first quarter a 
year ago, mortgage rates were falling. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board has been pushing up interest rates since March, 1988, 
in an effort to slow the economy enough to curb inflation. The housing and 
construction sectors are the most sensitive to the increase.

The Securities and Exchange Commission filed insider trading charges today 
against a 24-year-old former paralegal and five others who allegedly made more 
than $800,000 from her tip about a leveraged buyout of a department store 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC alleged that the paralegal, Kerry A. Hurton, learned from confidential 
documents that Hooker Corp. Ltd. planned to announce a proposed buyout of 
Birmingham, Ala.-based Parisian Inc. in July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Hurton worked in the Boston office of the major New York law firm Skadden, 
Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. She allegedly passed information to her 
boyfriend, Eric Laboz of New York City, and directly or indirectly to several 
other people who made a total of $823,825 in profits by trading in Parisian 
stock, the SEC said.

BENGALS' PLAYERS, COACHES BACK BANNING OF WILSON

<P>
Cincinnati Bengals players and coaches say the National Football League acted 
appropriately in permanently barring former Bengals running back Stanley Wilson 
from the league because of his chronic drug use problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying I'm glad about it, but I do feel the man is getting what he 
deserved," Cincinnati fullback Ickey Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
"The league and the Bengals gave him a lot of chances to straighten up, but 
he's obviously very sick. Maybe this will help him get back on track to a 
complete life." 
</P>
<P>
Bengals linebacker Reggie Williams said: "This is just another indication of 
the need to protect the image and integrity of professional sports, as it 
relates to drugs. It's unfortunate for Stanley, but it hopefully sends a 
message, not only to active professional players but to college and high school 
athletes as well." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, 27, suspended on the eve of the Jan. 22 Super Bowl, is back in drug 
rehabilitation at a Phoenix clinic. His Los Angeles agent, Reggie Turner, has 
said Wilson will implicate five other Bengals players in his drug episode in a 
story that Wilson is selling to a nationally circulated magazine. Those 
comments have angered Bengals players. 
</P>
<P>
Turner has declined to identify the players who were supposedly involved. 
Published reports have suggested that Penthouse will be publishing Wilson's 
story, but a magazine spokesman has declined to confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
Bengals coach Sam Wyche said he believes Wilson's ban is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter from NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle dated last Thursday, Wilson was 
told he faces "a permanent ban from further participation in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Woods has said he knows Wilson plans to name him as one of the players involved 
in the Jan. 21 incident. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he believes that Wilson's permanent disqualification might lessen the 
effect of a tell-all story, Woods said: "I don't know if it will lessen 
anything. The only thing that matters is that any story about me being involved 
is not true, and Stanley knows it's not true. I think the NFL has found out the 
true story, and that's why I'm not worried."

The family of the late Art Rooney Sr., who founded the Pittsburgh Steelers in 
1933, has increased its ownership in the team from 65% to 80%. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McGinley, a Steelers vice president, and his sister, Rita, have sold some

McGinleys, also of Pittsburgh, are longtime minority owners of the team. 
</P>
<P>
The change in ownership, begun before Art Rooney died last August, was approved 
by the 27 other NFL owners in a vote taken by fax machine. Dan Rooney, Steelers 
president and the oldest of Art Rooney's five sons, declined to say what the 
transaction cost.

<P>
t month's Baja 500 off-road race has been moved from Ensenada to San Felipe 
because of ranchers' threats to disrupt the annual event through the Mexican 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
The site change has prompted Los Angeles-based SCORE, which sponsors the 
competition, to restrict entries in the June 3 race to cars and trucks. SCORE 
President Sal Fish said motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles will be barred 
because the new course looks "rather fast, and I think it would be too risky." 
</P>
<P>
Ranchers living along the part of the usual race route in mountains east of 
Ensenada had threatened to block part of the course with heavy equipment, 
saying racers have destroyed their roads and fences and killed their cattle. 
Fish and Mexican tourism officials agreed to move the race to San Felipe, 140 
miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border on the eastern Baja California coast.
