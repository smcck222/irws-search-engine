HUGE PROJECT PLANNED FOR BARRIO LOGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of San Diego businessmen will make public today plans for a $300- to 
$400-million redevelopment project in Barrio Logan that would include a massive 
parking garage, a retail center, an international trade complex and possibly a 
sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Barrio Pacific Rim Project, which would cover a 17-to 20-acre 
tract near the waterfront in Barrio Logan, is dependent upon the group winning 
low-cost bonds that would reduce land acquisition and construction costs, said 
Luis Garcia, one of the businessman involved. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for the project to include a 6,800-car garage, a retail 
center, 500 owned and rental housing units, office space, a hotel and an 
entertainment complex that might include a sports arena. The site was not 
specified Tuesday, but it would be near the waterfront and the Barrio Logan 
trolley stop. 
</P>
<P>
The project's office space would be dedicated largely to international trade, 
its backers said. The parking garage would serve shipyards in the neighborhood 
as well as commuters who would park there and take the trolley to jobs 
elsewhere in the county, according to Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
The project would be 51% owned by minority businesses and individuals, he said. 
Backers also hope that nonprofit organizations, such as the Chicano Federation 
of San Diego, will own as much as 15% of the project, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, the owner of a San Diego construction company, and San Diego 
businessman Mateo Camarillo have formed Barrio Enterprise Zone Inc. to develop 
the project. Camarillo, who owns restaurants and a wholesale fabric company, 
also serves on the San Diego Convention Center's board of directors. Joseph 
Martinez, a San Diego architect, is acting as architect and project manager. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is to be unveiled today at a 6 p.m. meeting of the Barrio Logan 
Project Area Committee, an organization that was formed to consider 
redevelopment plans for the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a Cinderella project," Garcia said, adding that it would 
transform Barrio Logan, long used by San Diego as a dumping ground for 
"wrecking yards and toxic chemicals," into a "showcase." 
</P>
<P>
The project's backers have won the support of Harry Cooper, the La Jolla 
businessman who wants to build a sports arena in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I think these guys can make things happen down there," Cooper said. "I want 
that site as an option. It's a possible site, even though I know it has lots of 
(construction-related) problems." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper earlier this year won City Council approval to consider building a 
sports arena on land he owns in Sorrento Valley. But Tuesday he said he would 
keep the Barrio Logan site as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"This project should happen," Cooper said. "And it's not dependent upon a 
sports arena." 
</P>
<P>
With or without an arena, the project faces several substantial obstacles. 
Perhaps the largest is winning congressional approval to use development bonds 
the federal government earmarked in 1983 for construction of the controversial 
Sander project, a proposal for a trash-to-energy plant that voters defeated in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds were authorized by the federal government, but most of them were 
never sold. An estimated $225 million worth of the bonds are still available 
for use in San Diego, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
BEZ Inc. is pushing the city of San Diego to obtain congressional approval to 
reappropriate or redesignate those unsold bonds, Garcia said. A San Diego tax 
attorney said that Congress might be willing approve the redesignation even in 
the midst of the current budget crunch because the action "would be revenue 
neutral" and would not hurt the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, the San Diego City Council authorized city staff members to 
seek federal approval to "somehow take advantage of the bonds that were 
allocated but never utilized," said Mike Jenkins, an official in the city's 
property department. "We think there may be a chance of getting them 
reauthorized." 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials Tuesday made it clear that the reauthorization is 
independent from the Barrio Logan project. The city hopes to win the 
reauthorization, which would clear the way for the bonds to be used for some 
redevelopment projects, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) is working to win reauthorization of the bonds, a 
spokesman said.

PROPOSED BUDGET CUTS ARTS, RECREATION, LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police response times probably would rise, the city's pools and recreational 
facilities would be open fewer hours, the city library budget would be cut in 
half, and arts organizations would get no money under a $1.2-billion budget 
proposed Tuesday by City Manager John Lockwood. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Lockwood repeated his contention that the city will be 
unable to maintain existing municipal service levels such as police protection 
and library hours, unless the council decides to increase taxes or fees. The 
city must generate an additional $60 million in new revenue if it intends to 
keep services at the current level, Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only stretch the dollar so far," Lockwood said. The $1.2-billion 
budget proposed Tuesday "is not an adequate amount of money in order to fund 
what we're used to funding," Lockwood said. "But it's all we have." 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood's inch-thick budget proposal, which was described as "dead on arrival" 
by at least one council member, served to rekindle an already acrimonious 
council debate on whether the city should solve the budget crunch by cutting 
service levels or by taking the politically difficult step of raising taxes and 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Council members will use Lockwood's proposed budget as the starting point for a 
series of public hearings on the budget that begin May 24. The council now has 
the option of accepting Lockwood's budget or fashioning its own budget by 
making cuts and/or raising revenue. The council expects to complete its budget 
by late June or early July, Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor on Tuesday remained adamant that the city's budget 
crunch not destroy "people programs," such as parks and recreation, the library 
and arts funding, said O'Connor spokesman Paul Downey. 
</P>
<P>
"Her position is identical to what she's said before," Downey said. "She is 
still opposed to raising revenue without putting it to a vote of the people." 
O'Connor will review Lockwood's proposed budget before making her own 
recommendations, Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts said that Lockwood's budget proposal would "bring some 
sanity into this (budget) process" by forcing the council to address needed 
budget cuts and new revenue sources. "Those who have put their heads in the 
sand and said there's no problem will now have to address" the shortfall, 
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who earlier this year argued that the city needed to make "substantial 
cuts" in the upcoming budget, also has stated that the council must raise taxes 
or fees to reduce the shortfall. Roberts has suggested that council add revenue 
by increasing business license fees or imposing a new utility bill tax. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' argument that new revenue sources are needed runs counter to 
Councilman Bruce Henderson's oft-stated claim that there is no budget crisis 
and that the city could make cuts without seriously endangering services. 
</P>
<P>
While the $1.2-billion budget is by far the largest ever proposed in San Diego, 
its size is "misleading," according to Lockwood, because the general fund, 
which finances police, fire, recreational programs and the library, has only 
increased to $434.6 million, up from $402 million. 
</P>
<P>
A large part of the proposed increase in the general fund is linked to programs 
that were approved during the current fiscal year but didn't require funding 
until the upcoming fiscal year. For example, the city last year authorized the 
addition of more than 100 uniformed police officers, but delayed their hiring 
until late in the year. The full cost of those officers will be felt in the 
coming year for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the $1.2-billion budget covers programs that the council cannot 
cut, Lockwood said. Programs that have their own funding sources, such as sewer 
and water treatment, will not be cut back, Lockwood said. "I don't think 
there's one . . . (department) that's funded by general revenue that will 
maintain the same level of service," Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Police Department budget proposed by Lockwood would increase by 
3.9% to $145.4 million, up from the current $139.8 million, the department's 
level of service would probably deteriorate slightly because the department 
would have 50 fewer non-uniform personnel, Lockwood said. And, although the 
number of uniformed officers would remain constant, the population is expected 
to increase by 25,000, which would move the city farther away from its 
long-stated goal of two officers per 1,000 residents, Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
The library's current $12.6 million budget would be cut by 47.9% to $6.5 
million. That reduction would force branch libraries to cut back hours to an 
average of 24 hours a week from the current 43 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
Park and recreation centers would be cut to 24 hours a week, down from 60 
hours, and swimming pools would only be open 24 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
Nonprofit arts organizations in the city, which traditionally have won city 
funding through the transit occupancy tax (TOT) that is levied upon hotel and 
motel guests, received no funding in Lockwood's proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the shortfall in revenue, Lockwood instead has proposed using TOT 
money "to maintain . . . (police, recreation and library services) at the 
expense of arts and promotions" such as the Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not disagreeing with the arts and promotion community leaders who say that 
we can't afford these reductions," Lockwood said. But Lockwood maintained that, 
given the current budget crisis, it is more important to fund regular city 
services than arts and promotions.

EL CAJON COUNCIL VOTES TO SUE STATE ON SPRAYING; 
</P>
<P>
MALATHION: MAYOR TELLS CAPACITY CROWD THAT THE CITY WILL WAIT UNTIL FRIDAY TO 
HEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The El Cajon City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to sue the state of 
California unless Gov. George Deukmejian heeds its request to call off the 
aerial malathion spraying that is planned over a 16-square-mile residential 
area. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour of discussion and a brief closed meeting, the five-member council 
adopted a resolution to condemn the aerial spraying and urge the governor and 
state officials to stay the plan, which now calls for three applications of the 
pesticide over a four-week period beginning as early as Monday. The council 
authorized the city attorney to begin litigation if the governor does not grant 
the request. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not sit idly by and let the governor proceed with this if I can prevent 
it," Mayor John W. Reber said, prompting applause from a standing-room-only 
audience of about 200 El Cajon residents. "If we don't hear from the governor 
by Friday morning, a lawsuit will be filed." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gary A. Reece, chief of agriculture services for the county 
Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures, said the state appears to be 
moving ahead to begin spraying Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, it's Monday at 9 p.m.," Reece said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, county officials were expecting to receive formal announcements from the 
state to be distributed to residents in the affected area, Reece said. "As far 
as I know, that's all falling in place." 
</P>
<P>
The malathion spraying plan is a response to a suspected infestation of the 
Mexican fruit fly, or Mexfly. Since April 25, three Mexflies -- one mature male 
and two egg-bearing females -- have been trapped within a quarter of a mile of 
each other in a residential area near John F. Kennedy Park, just south of 
Interstate 8. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, Reber noted that not a single Mexfly has been found since 
May 5, despite increased trapping efforts in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"That tells me this is an isolated area, and we have it under control with 
voluntary spraying," he said, referring to a ground-spraying program that began 
May 8. "I think the governor is overreacting at the present time." 
</P>
<P>
What had been scheduled as a council "discussion" quickly turned into a mass 
venting of anger, as several El Cajon residents said they felt ambushed by the 
state's decision and outraged by their inability to affect it. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the governor declared a state of emergency, eliminating the need for 
public hearings on the spraying plan. Tuesday afternoon, residents made it 
clear they resent being muzzled. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not hurt feelings; this is an extreme feeling of frustration," said 
Peggie Willbanks. "You must pay your taxes, and you must obey your government, 
but when it comes down to dumping a poisonous pesticide that will affect our 
children, our pets and everything else, we have nothing to say. We are being 
bombarded." 
</P>
<P>
Some people expressed themselves silently, wearing gas masks and other 
protective gear. Dan Tarr, an El Cajon resident and member of the San Diego 
Greens, an environmental group, wore a white protective outfit, complete with 
booties and hood. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Henry Voss collection for spring," he said, referring to the 
director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture who gave the order 
Friday to approve the spray plan. "What the well-dressed El Cajoner will be 
wearing." 
</P>
<P>
Other people took the podium, supporting the council's action as they predicted 
the ills that will befall El Cajon if the spraying goes forward. Ken Horton, a 
resident of East County since 1936, said he had firsthand experience with 
malathion when he interviewed agriculture workers for the state in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Horton said the workers he met wore heavy, long-sleeved clothing in the fields 
even on the hottest days. They told him they had to bundle up to protect 
themselves from malathion, which gave them rashes and infections. Horton said a 
"sunburn-like prickling" and rash soon prompted him to don heavy clothes as 
well -- but that even that wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It penetrated my shirt," he said, explaining that he found he had to change 
clothes and take a shower after each visit to a sprayed area. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Moran, an El Cajon resident and spokeswoman for the Sierra Club, warned 
that malathion will kill butterflies and bees as well as Mexflies, while 
letting stronger and more adaptable pests, such as fleas and ticks, survive. 
Moran drew cheers when she said that, if the spraying begins, "I would urge the 
people of El Cajon to boycott produce grown by California agribusiness." 
</P>
<P>
Because of time constraints, only a handful of people were allowed to speak, 
prompting boos from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"I live right in the middle of this stuff and I want to speak about it," yelled 
Vicki Miles, a mother of two young children, when she was informed she would 
not have a turn at the microphone. Later, outside the meeting, she said that, 
on Sunday, unbeknown to her or her neighbors on Melody Lane, the state sprayed 
in her area. 
</P>
<P>
"My windows were wide open and the spray came right in," she said. "I don't 
want it dropped. I don't want it sprayed. I don't want it in my house." 
</P>
<P>
Reber, at a loss for how to accommodate such a large crowd, urged residents to 
send telegrams and letters to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Stephen M. Eckis, deputy city attorney, had warned the council 
that the type of litigation they were considering is one "at which no one has 
been successful to this point." But he added that he believes "the facts are 
different" in San Diego County than in other California counties that have 
sued. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when Voss issued his decision on the spraying plan, he failed to 
list non-pesticide alternatives to the spraying, as required, Eckis said. Eckis 
also said that, if the El Cajon spraying is to be carried out as it has been in 
other counties -- via helicopters, flying in formation about 300 to 500 feet 
above ground at 75 m.p.h. -- it may violate Federal Aviation Administration 
rules. He also said that some endangered species may be affected by the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, environmental groups held a press conference on the steps 
of the council chambers to challenge the state's contention that the malathion 
spraying would be harmless. 
</P>
<P>
"The state has been lying to you -- malathion is a carcinogen," said Sharon 
Taylor, the pesticide reduction coordinator for the San Diego Environmental 
Health Coalition. "They told us DDT was safe. They told us Agent Orange was 
safe. And asbestos. Do you believe them?" 
</P>
<P>
State and county officials have scheduled an educational public meeting at 
Granite Hills High School at 7 p.m. Thursday. Two hot lines have also been 
established to answer questions about the use of malathion. For health 
questions, call 1-800-439-6359. For agricultural questions, call 
1-800-427-6359, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

GOMPERS TEACHER TO BE CHARGED WITH CHILD MOLESTATION, D.A.'S OFFICE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran teacher at Gompers Secondary School will be charged with one count of 
misdemeanor child molestation involving several female students from September, 
1989, to April, 1990, the San Diego County district attorney's office announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney J. Loveless Jr., an English teacher at the controversial Southeast San 
Diego school, will surrender for arraignment by next week and be released on 
his own recognizance, based on an arrangement made with Loveless' attorney, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Harry Elias said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source told The Times on Tuesday that the agreement involves 
Loveless pleading guilty to a single molestation count, forgoing a trial, and 
that he will be required to register as a sex offender under state law. 
Loveless would also be fired by the San Diego Unified School District and face 
loss of his state teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth W. Brooks, the attorney representing Loveless, declined comment on the 
case Tuesday other than to say that he has not yet talked with Elias regarding 
a specific date for Loveless to appear for legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Elias said Tuesday that his department's monthlong review of evidence presented 
him by San Diego police child abuse detectives persuaded him that a single 
count incorporating alleged molestation of several students is the most 
appropriate charge to file. 
</P>
<P>
Elias said he will also review police evidence regarding violations of state 
law by Gompers Principal Marie Thornton in allegedly failing to properly report 
the allegations against Loveless when first brought to her by two students in 
late March. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to review those reports beginning tonight," Elias said. Police have 
recommended that Thornton be cited on a misdemeanor charge for failing to 
immediately notify both school police and the county Integrated Child 
Protective Services and to follow up with a written report within 36 hours as 
required under state law. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton has been under frequent fire this year for purported management 
shortcomings in her handling of teacher assignments and complaints and of a 
February student demonstration at Gompers. Gompers, an award-winning, 
high-powered math-science-computer magnet school, has been embroiled in efforts 
to expand its long-limited curriculum to more nonwhite neighborhood students. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Dyer, attorney for the San Diego Unified School District, said Tuesday 
that Loveless will be suspended immediately from the district without pay until 
his case is concluded. Should he plead guilty or decide to go to trial and be 
convicted, he would be immediately fired because the state education code 
requires termination for conviction under the misdemeanor provision that 
Loveless is charged with. 
</P>
<P>
Dyer said the district in such a case also informs California's Commission on 
Teacher Credentialing, which conducts its own review before deciding whether to 
strip the teacher of his state teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
Loveless was removed from his classroom at Gompers and has been working at a 
non-classroom job at the district's Instructional Media Center in Linda Vista 
since police began looking into his case in early April. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators found that as many as 30 victims over several years may 
have been involved with Loveless, sources told The Times last month. Loveless 
was also counseled several years ago at Gompers by Thornton in connection with 
a previous case of suspected abuse, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton is under investigation for not immediately reporting the accusations 
when she received them in late March, even though state law says that a 
principal or other staff member "must report" suspected child abuse "by 
telephone immediately, or as soon as practically possible," and follow up with 
a written report within 36 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Another source told The Times in April that, before contacting police, Thornton 
confronted Loveless during a meeting at which the two students were present. 
The education code states, in underlined passages, that "school personnel must 
keep in mind that investigation and suspected child abuse is the responsibility 
of the child welfare unit and, when appropriate, assesment is made by the Nurse 
Intervention Task Force; it is not the responsibility of school personnel." 
</P>
<P>
Although Thornton reportedly notified the Gompers school police officer the 
following day, Child Protective Services, which intervenes to make sure that 
students are adequately counseled after suspected child abuse, was not notified 
until almost a week later, by an assistant principal, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton has declined all comment on the investigation and has retained an 
attorney.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 22-year-old Escondido man has been found guilty of assault with a deadly 
weapon in a drive-by shooting and in the attempted shooting of an Escondido 
city councilman who pursued him. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Kris Murphy testified in San Diego Superior Court that he followed 
the gunman after seeing the Nov. 25, 1989, drive-by shooting, which was 
believed to be gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Ramiro Ochoa was convicted of wounding 17-year-old Salvador Santoyo, who 
also testified in the trial that began several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also found Ochoa guilty of conspiring to commit an assault with a 
firearm. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Laura Hammes set sentencing for June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa has been in County Jail since his arrest in lieu of $250,000 bail, but 
Hammes ordered him held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Santoyo, who was shot in the back and in his leg, had been talking with his 
brother while leaning against a car fender. He never saw his assailant.

A 29-year-old Fresno man was in critical condition Tuesday after he drove 
across Interstate 5 in North County and crashed into a parked tractor-trailer 
rig, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lee Reynolds was traveling north in a pickup truck on I-5 at 10 a.m., 
south of Lomas Santa Fe Drive, when he drifted onto the right shoulder and 
rear-ended the rig, CHP Officer Joe Wolf said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCDONNELL DOUGLAS UNION TO SELECT LEADER 
MAY 22 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A May 22 runoff will decide who will lead the largest union at McDonnell 
Douglas Aircraft Co. at a time when Long Beach's largest employer faces 
impending layoffs, peacetime cutbacks and debate over a controversial 
Japanese-style management. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Griffith, president of United Auto Workers Local 148, will face Richard 
Rios for the union presidency. 
</P>
<P>
With several challenged ballots still unresolved, preliminary results show that 
Griffith received 39% of the vote and Rios 32% in the recent election. More 
than 12,000 members chose among 205 candidates vying for 49 posts, including 
six candidates for president. 
</P>
<P>
One of the hottest issues of the campaign was the union-company liaison struck 
by Griffith and opposed by some workers as union-busting. Griffith endorses the 
company's Japanese-style management, which, among other things, encourages 
employees to monitor each other's work habits.

CITY SETTLES LAST OF LAWSUITS FROM HOME FLOODING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of San Diego has settled the last of several lawsuits lodged by 16 
families whose homes were flooded during a Feb. 2, 1988 rainstorm. The 
out-of-court settlement reached on Friday authorized a $550,000 payment to 
members of the Vasquez family, whose home at 1255 Lauriston Drive was flooded 
during the 1988 downpour. 
</P>
<P>
In an out-of-court settlement reached last October, the city agreed to pay $9 
million to 15 other families whose homes were flooded when rainwater poured out 
of a city catch basin. 
</P>
<P>
That settlement followed a Superior Court jury's determination that San Diego 
was liable for damages because the flooding was caused by a city-owned catch 
basin that was used as a parking lot. During the 1988 storm, debris from the 
parking lot clogged basin drains and the spillway, forcing the overflow to run 
down a hill into the residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this settles the whole 1988 flooding incident" as far as the city is 
concerned, said Deputy City Atty. Larry Renner. "We agreed to pay $550,000 to 
the five (family members), and, for that sum, the city will receive title to 
the property, the only parcel that the city doesn't already own" in the area 
that flooded. 
</P>
<P>
The city took title to 15 other properties on Lauriston, Paxton and Elrose 
drives in south San Diego as part of the settlement reached last October. The 
city paid about $2 million to take title to the 15 homes included in last 
October's settlement. The rest of the $9-million settlement covered the loss of 
personal property and emotional distress suffered by the families and a 
business that had stored fabric in a garage that was flooded. 
</P>
<P>
The city had contended that the storm was a freak occurrence that would happen 
only every 200 to 500 years. But the city lost the liability phase of a trial 
in Superior Court and decided to settle out of court rather than have a jury 
determine the financial penalty.

MAN'S PLAN FOR BACK-YARD HELIPAD HAS ROCKY LANDING; 
</P>
<P>
FLYING: DEAN RASMUSSEN PROMISES TO ALLOW FIREFIGHTERS' CHOPPERS TO USE HIS PAD, 
BUT SOME NEIGHBORS ARE NOT PERSUADED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dean Rasmussen, who lives on a sprawling hacienda with a magnificent view of 
Agoura Hills, said Tuesday that all he needs to "save the strain and pain" of 
freeway commuting is a heliport in his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
But the deep whoop-whoop-whoop of chopper blades is not a welcome sound in the 
rural enclave of Agoura Hills, where residents relish the caws of hawks and the 
howls of coyotes. The small city near the Ventura County line prohibits private 
helipads. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, the president of a large grading and construction firm, however, is 
accustomed to moving mountains to get a job done. And Tuesday, with the 
fortitude of an earthmover, he launched a public relations campaign aimed at 
winning approval for his heliport. 
</P>
<P>
He opened the locked gates to his 120-acre hilltop ranch home and conducted a 
media briefing, complete with prepared text and poster-size graphics of his 
helipad plans. He handed out a slick folder stuffed with color photos of his 
property, a noise study and seven magazine and newspaper articles that praised 
the heroic efforts of emergency helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
He promised to allow Los Angeles County Fire Department helicopters to use his 
proposed pad and said he would build a 10,000-gallon emergency water tank that 
could be used by choppers fighting brush fires or by earthquake victims after 
the Big One strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in America," said Rasmussen, whose Simi Valley-based company is C.A. 
Rasmussen. "If what you want doesn't have an impact on your neighbors, if you 
work hard, you should get what you deserve." 
</P>
<P>
One other item that Rasmussen, a country boy at heart, wants permission to do 
is shoot skeet. 
</P>
<P>
"At times, me and a few of my buddies have been known to shoot some skeet out 
in the back," Rasmussen said. "I'll be asking for a permit to open a private 
range." 
</P>
<P>
Some neighbors who live below his spread are not impressed. They have property 
values to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighbors are upset because we would have to disclose during property 
sales that a heliport is close by," said Mary Lou Thornton, president of the 
Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation and a resident of the subdivision below 
Rasmussen. "Also, the mothers are concerned that he is seeking a shooting range 
in the hills where their children play." 
</P>
<P>
Residents also are upset because Rasmussen has begun preliminary grading at the 
heliport site and in the past has occasionally had a helicopter illegally pick 
him up at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the prohibited takeoffs, Rasmussen responded, "Have you ever 
driven 60?" He said he plans to hold a community meeting at his home later this 
month to explain to his neighbors that the chopper will sound "like a car 
driving 25 miles an hour." He said he would only use the landing pad about 
twice a month when his job requires that he visit far-flung construction jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Like other political campaigns, Rasmussen is attempting to put a spin on the 
issue: This is no simple heliport, he says. It is an "Auxiliary Landing Pad" 
that may help save "lives and limb" in the event emergency transportation is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Sanchez, chief of air operations for the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department, said he is in an awkward position on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we do need heliports because of the growth in the area. Yes, we could use 
the water tanks. But we can't get caught in the middle of political play," 
Sanchez said. "Would we lobby for him or give him support? Probably not." 
</P>
<P>
Agoura Hills Senior City Planner Michael Kamino said Rasmussen faces a battle 
to obtain a city zoning permit for the landing site and skeet shooting range. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we've received many calls, and the neighbors feel it will cause a lot 
of noise and they are going to oppose it," Kamino said. 
</P>
<P>
And feisty Agoura Hills is only the first hurdle. Rasmussen would also need 
clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration and the California 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
But the 47-year-old Rasmussen, a private pilot, said he is fascinated with 
aviation and obsessed with a dream. He said he was once a poor kid who vowed 
that one day he would be rich enough to fly to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted a helicopter and my own pad," he said, blushing slightly, "I 
know this may sound a little sickening, but I've worked hard every day of my 
life to be able to get this far."

FRYMAN BUILDER GETS MORE TIME TO PREPARE BATTLE TO KEEP PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer trying to build houses in Studio City's Fryman Canyon won more time 
Tuesday to fight for a crucial grading permit as he battles threats from City 
Hall to encumber his project with additional environmental requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Without debate, the city's Building and Safety Commission gave developer Fred 
Sahadi an additional week to appeal the revocation of his grading permit after 
it was learned that Sahadi was not adequately notified that the hearing on his 
appeal was scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi inadvertently was not informed of the hearing, Building and Safety 
Department General Manager Warren O'Brien told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission next week upholds its staff's recommendation that Sahadi's 
grading permit be voided, the developer would "probably at minimum" be required 
to expand his 1978 environmental impact report if he reapplies, said Tim 
Taylor, deputy general manager of the department. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, who appoints commission members, supports requiring new 
environmental reviews of the project, said Jane Blumenfeld, the mayor's 
land-use deputy. The project should be subjected to current environmental 
review standards, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor overturned a lower-ranking official's decision earlier this month that 
would have extended Sahadi's grading permit. The permit, issued in September, 
1988, required the developer to do some grading work within 180 days, but 
expired with no work begun. Reznik said it would be illegal to impose new 
environmental conditions as a prerequisite for applying for a new permit 
because Sahadi was unable to begin work under the previous permit due to the 
many roadblocks the city itself created. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi's project has galvanized environmentalists opposed to development in the 
Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Cultural Heritage Board is scheduled to decide today whether Fryman 
Canyon should be named a cultural-historic monument, which would block Sahadi's 
plan to build 26 estate-sized homes on the site for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's office also supports landmark status for the canyon, as have various 
legislators, including Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) and Assemblyman 
Terry Friedman (D-Sherman Oaks).

LAWYER PLEADS GUILTY AND AGREES TO COOPERATE IN 'ALLIANCE' CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles lawyer who worked for the alleged mastermind of a 
multimillion-dollar insurance fraud pleaded guilty Tuesday and agreed to 
cooperate with the government, a development prosecutors described as 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory S. Bodell, 34, pleaded guilty to a single count of mail fraud, becoming 
the fifth attorney and eighth person convicted in the case, involving a network 
of Los Angeles-area lawyers whom prosecutors have called "the Alliance." 
</P>
<P>
The government contends that the lawyers cheated insurance companies out of $50 
million in legal fees by manipulating complex lawsuits in Los Angeles, Orange 
and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
The Bodell plea, entered in federal court in San Diego, is the first since the 
indictment last month of 18 defendants, including Bodell's former boss, Lynn B. 
Stites, whom the government has accused of running the scheme. The others have 
pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Bodell had worked since 1982 for the Stites Professional Law Corp., based in 
Woodland Hills and later in West Los Angeles. "The fact that he acknowledged 
his involvement is extremely significant, given the number of years that he was 
in close association with Lynn Stites," said Assistant U.S. Atty. George Hardy, 
chief prosecutor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Stites and the others indicted last month, Bodell had faced 
racketeering and multiple mail fraud counts. The single mail fraud charge to 
which he pleaded guilty carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment 
and a $250,000 fine. No sentencing date was set. 
</P>
<P>
Bodell will be debriefed by the government and will resign from the California 
State Bar, said his attorney, John D. Vandevelde. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney described Bodell as a young man who "first became involved in this 
when he was just out of law school." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very traumatic, very, very difficult for him to deal with, and he has 
made a decision to try to deal with all these problems responsibly . . . and 
put it behind him the best way he can," Vandevelde said. 
</P>
<P>
Bodell's plea bargain may induce other defendants to plead and provide evidence 
to be used against Stites, if he ever surrenders or is apprehended. In recent 
years, Stites, 45, divided his time between Switzerland and a home in Bell 
Canyon in eastern Ventura County, which he sold last November. His whereabouts 
are unknown, and a warrant is out for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Mesereau, a Los Angeles attorney who has represented Stites, declined 
comment on Bodell's plea. 
</P>
<P>
Before last month's indictment, seven people pleaded guilty in the midst of a 
lengthy investigation. Of the 25 charged, 18 have been lawyers, most of whom 
worked or lived in the San Fernando Valley. The other seven were law firm 
employees or clients. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys would appear together as defense lawyers in cases in which 
insurance companies had to pay legal fees for defendants. They allegedly worked 
together to torpedo settlements and to prolong and expand the cases through 
various legal maneuvers, such as conducting meaningless pretrial discovery and 
filing claims against each other's clients, generating more insurance billings 
for all. 
</P>
<P>
According to the government, Stites franchised litigation, helping some of the 
other lawyers set up their own offices and sending them insured clients, in 
return for fixed percentages of their insurance billings. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer who has already pleaded guilty said the attorneys in some cases paid 
kickbacks to their clients so they would not want cases against them to be 
settled.

STATE OFFICIALS CONTINUE AERIAL SPRAYING AGAINST PESKY MEDFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I used to think that the spraying of pesticides to kill the Medfly was a 
necessary evil with little health risk, until my neighborhood became a 
continuous target for spraying. I am now beginning to think that the Medfly 
spraying is not only very unhealthy for the environment, but also completely 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
The saturation bombings are obviously not working. They sometimes spray two 
days before it rains and then have to spray again a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do we have to worry about the health risks, but we also have to worry 
about one of the five helicopters crashing down into our homes. It is 
impossible to sleep with the squadron of helicopters flying directly over your 
house. Perhaps the leaders of pest control should change their tactics for 
ridding Southern California of the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with William Jordan (Commentary, April 23) that "the high-command" of 
pest control should try using intelligence rather than physical force. Maybe 
Mother Nature will respond better to intellect, for she is definitely not 
responding to force.

Thoughts inspired by "Officials Abandon Spraying Deadline" (Part A, May 5): 
</P>
<P>
Long before aerosol spray cans filled with exotic chemicals became the 
commonly-accepted weapon in the war on insects, around the house and garden, a 
labor-intensive, hand-pump spray gun was used on the home front, accompanied by 
the battle cry, "Quick, Henry, the flit!" 
</P>
<P>
Today, given Gov. Deukmejian's stony support of the indiscriminate aerial 
dousing of residential areas with a pesticide in the futile war on the Medfly, 
the slogan is now, "Quick, Duke, the malathion!" 
</P>
<P>
When China's teeming population was fast becoming outnumbered by flies, Mao had 
fly swatters issued to every household with orders for everyone to meet a daily 
fly-kill quota. Presto! Soon no more flies. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian should take a page from Chairman Mao's book and order Southern 
Californian homeowners to take to their gardens armed with this fail-safe 
weapon. Medflies wouldn't stand a chance against such an invincible Swat Team.

Officials of Los Angeles are constantly telling us to conserve water and cut 
down on usage. Seems to me they have overlooked the quickest solution: Stop the 
malathion spraying so we don't have tens of thousands of people all over the 
Los Angeles Basin forced into washing their cars to avoid paint damage. The 
officials can't have it both ways, folks.

STANFORD'S REVISED CURRICULUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There can be no place but Stanford where the text of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is 
pored over so seriously. 
</P>
<P>
It was a trash novel in its day, written by a housewife who never set foot in 
the South. It is a device for the study of Western culture just as "Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles" is a device for the study of animal biology. 
</P>
<P>
If the privileged children of Stanford must immerse themselves in the doings of 
Little Eva, Topsy, and company, let it be as an artifact of the Civil War era. 
Don't put it on the shelf next to Plato and the Bible.

You say you don't like being sprayed with malathion? There is a solution to the 
problem: move into the Crystal Cathedral or masquerade as a giant kangaroo rat. 
Both have been exempted from spraying. 
</P>
<P>
You resent paying for the spraying and paying again for the fruit when it comes 
to market? Never mind, chalk it up to another bureaucratic bungle that has 
turned out to be expensive, ineffective and ironically, unscientific. 
</P>
<P>
You ask why haven't we taken the advice of top entomological experts on how to 
control the Medfly? It seems that fruit growers and the State Department of 
Agriculture would rather go "by guess and by golly."

<P>
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, there are no ladybugs, no bees, etc.

There's a widely held notion that a person can become either a troublemaker or 
a model citizen depending simply on how well a society plans and provides 
opportunities. State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig offered evidence of 
the practical wisdom of that idea the other day. He reported on commendable 
results being achieved by California high schools that have organized, with the 
help of a 4-year-old state program, to combat their dropout problems. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, a number of districts cut their dropout rates 
considerably, with a not-too-shabby overall decrease from 31.8% in 1986 to 
26.4% last year. El Monte High School, the place chosen by Honig to release the 
report, cut its rate by using state funds to hire a dropout-prevention 
counselor. But don't cheer too loudly until districts like Lynwood Unified, 
where more than half the class of 1989 left early, improve. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the most dramatic improvement came in the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District, where the dropout rate fell from 19.1% in 1986 to 6.4% 
in 1989. The figure is no accident. The district has been busy identifying 
students at risk of dropping out, and it has worked closely with them. On the 
other end, Garden Grove Unified School District has not fared so well and needs 
to improve on its 16% increase in dropouts over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
It is particularly noteworthy that the Los Angeles Unified School District and 
the Santa Ana Unified School District in Orange County, both of which have 
students from many cultures, also managed to make significant dents in their 
dropout rates by getting parents involved. Again, even in a rapidly changing 
society, the old wisdom is best: Education begins in the home. 
</P>
<P>
These figures show steady progress, but also something more significant than a 
graph could show. Each decrease in the percentage of dropouts represents young 
lives turned at a crucial point. 
</P>
<P>
What a positive difference it can make when society gets organized and provides 
ways to take advantage of a well thought-out plan.

THE GHOST OF STALIN CRASHES THE PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
CRITICISM OF THE PRESIDENT IS SUDDENLY A CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Parliament has given its approval to an ambiguous law making it a 
crime to "insult" President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The measure recalls the 
infamous Stalin-era penal code, with its stiff prison terms for anyone 
convicted of "slandering" the state. That law, like others used to legitimize 
the Communist Party's ruthless suppression of dissent, was discarded after 
Gorbachev took power in the mid-1980s and began to encourage freer speech. Now 
comes a clear signal that there may be such a thing as too much free speech. It 
is a painful setback to the Soviet Union's nascent experiment with democracy, 
and an ominous hint of what the future may hold. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the plan to silence critics offer the standard justifications. 
Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, one of Gorbachev's top military advisers, argues 
that insulting the president "weakens our society," and so cannot go 
unpunished. Parliamentary deputy Yuri V. Golik agrees that the law is needed 
for "the defense of the Soviet state." In other words, there's nothing personal 
involved. It's not Gorbachev's feelings that have to be protected, but the 
larger interests of the polity. It would be naive to accept this explanation as 
the sole reason for the regressive law, especially in light of Gorbachev's 
increasing public impatience with criticism. But the explanation isn't without 
substance. The history of Russia is a story of authoritarian rule. In a 
political culture such as this, identifying attacks on the leader with the 
subversion of the state becomes more understandable. 
</P>
<P>
Understandable, perhaps, but not -- given what Gorbachev says he wants to 
achieve -- any more acceptable. After all, glasnost is supposed to encourage a 
more honest and critical confrontation with the Soviet system's failures as a 
first step toward enacting effective reforms. The Soviet people, as it 
immediately became apparent, didn't need much encouragement to give vent to 
their grievances against inept and corrupt officials and a failed system. But 
that anger soon enough turned against a beset leader, who has grown 
increasingly frustrated -- and has come to be increasingly blamed -- because of 
his inability to more speedily deflect the Soviet behemoth from its looming 
rendezvous with economic disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The criticisms no doubt have stung. A man who regards himself as a pragmatic 
and even humane reformer can hardly enjoy seeing himself compared unfavorably 
in May Day demonstrations with Czar Nicholas II and Josef Stalin. That, he 
would feel, is not fair comment but an insult. It's not hard to see the 
progression in thinking that could follow: to criticize the leader is to 
slander him, to slander him is to oppose his reconstructive policies, to oppose 
those policies is to imperil the state. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the law now passed by Parliament. Anyone found guilty of publicly 
"insulting or slandering" the president could face up to three years in prison 
-- and three more if such remarks were made in the mass media. Any newspaper or 
television program that was twice found to have carried insulting comments 
could be suspended or shut down. What constitutes an insult or slander, as 
distinct from acceptable criticism? The law seems disturbingly, probably 
deliberately, vague. Apparently an "insult" will be what authorities say it is, 
nothing more and nothing less. 
</P>
<P>
There is a grim echo of Stalinism in all this that dissidents can only find 
chilling. And that, no doubt, is exactly what proponents of the new law intend.

STATE OFFICIALS CONTINUE AERIAL SPRAYING AGAINST PESKY MEDFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is very interesting that the decision to resume the Malathion spraying was 
announced the day after a bill that had passed the Assembly didn't get the 
two-thirds majority required to pass in the Senate (Part A, May 4). 
</P>
<P>
This bill by Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) would have allowed citizens injured by 
the spraying the right to sue the manufacturers and suppliers of malathion and 
the government entities which authorized the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
It is also interesting to note that our government is spraying a large urban 
population with a toxic chemical repeatedly while the country that we want to 
buy our fruit has outlawed aerial spraying of malathion because of permanent 
irreversible optic nerve damage found among children in a sprayed area in that 
country. 
</P>
<P>
And the California taxpayer picks up the tab!

CORRECTIVE COURSE FOR CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Freedman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One out of every eight American children are born in California. If this state 
leads the way to prenatal care, other states will follow. As the industrialized 
democracy with the worst record for infant mortality, the United States should 
make a healthy birth for all its children a national priority. Our future must 
not be stillborn. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what Californians can do: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make access to prenatal care a right protected by the state Constitution. 
An initiative that would establish this health right is being drafted for the 
1992 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vote for candidates who pledge to make California the first state in 
America to achieve universal prenatal care. This is not pie in the sky, but 
fiscally sound: For every dollar spent in prenatal care, at least four are 
saved in emergency and long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Create a malpractice insurance cooperative to sell low-cost coverage for 
obstetricians who provide comprehensive prenatal care to Medi-Cal mothers. 
Malpractice insurance represents more than $200 of the cost of every birth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Restrict the sale of health-insurance plans with fine-print clauses stating 
that prenatal care and delivery are not covered. Also, the commissioner of 
insurance and private companies should find a way to insure families who do not 
qualify for Medi-Cal and aren't covered by employer plans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increase multicultural outreach programs to bring the message of preventive 
care to women early in pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give pregnant women priority in substance-abuse programs, which will have 
to be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Encourage childbirth and health-education classes. Prepared childbirth for 
low-risk babies saves money and bonds families together. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Expand model programs, such as the Comprehensive Perinatal Program, in 
urban areas throughout the state. Programs geared to the special needs of rural 
mothers and farm workers also must be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Provide maternity leave for families to nurture newborns in a stable 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Expand nutrition programs for pregnant mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Empower nurse midwives to participate more in low-risk births. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give prevention priority in health spending. Preventing emergencies saves 
scarce resources for non-preventable emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't lose sight of babies in the abortion debate. Demonstrators gather by 
the thousands, but when a woman is turned down for prenatal care, she is alone. 
Both sides should join together to support health care for mothers who want 
their children to be born and grow up healthy. Jonathan Freedman

<P>
LAW: A FEDERAL JUDGE CONSIGNS PANHANDLERS TO A CLASS OUTSIDE THE PROTECTION OF 
THE FIRST AMENDMENT. WHAT MORE CAN THE HOMELESS LOSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MURRAY KEMPTON, Murray Kempton is a syndicated columnist in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few of those hissings and slitherings that intimate the presence of the 
snakes of meanness of spirit are rather too audible in the cadences sounded in 
U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Frank X. Altimari's affirmation of the New York 
City Transit Authority's ban on panhandling on its subways. 
</P>
<P>
We might wish that Judge Altimari was up to a little more respect for the 
decencies of hypocrisy than he showed in the fleeting nod he gave to the altar 
of our ritual pieties about suffering humanity in general before he dismissed 
one of its most abject segments in the particular. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the Court of Appeals ruled that individuals cannot beg in the 
subways, but that organized charities can. Judge Altimari's distinction -- it 
scarcely amounts to a difference -- is that solitary beggars convey no message 
except their desire "to extract money from those they accost," while 
respectable, presumably because organized, solicitors communicate information 
and disseminate views and ideas. The homeless beggar's want of shelter 
therefore extends to the First Amendment because his conduct fails to meet the 
standards for "variety of speech interests" that qualify a candidate to lodge 
under even its roof. 
</P>
<P>
Altimari may or may not have been often reduced to the exigencies of subway 
travel, but there is small chance that he could have and escaped the 
too-frequent experience of the passage by some ragged stranger mutely holding 
forth his paper cup, and then one's sudden halt to turn and drop a puny mite. 
If a face that can thus abrade the laggard conscience is not a kind of speech, 
then what are we to take communication to be? 
</P>
<P>
It is Altimari's view that, "while there is no doubt that giving alms is 
virtuous, in the Western tradition there is also no doubt that the virtue is 
best served when it reflects an 'ordered charity.' " This is a precis of 
Western tradition that some of its historians may find lamentably shortened. 
The Franciscan order would be the last to suggest that it is purer than in the 
days when its saintly founder went barefoot on the byways begging bread for the 
poor and, of necessity, also for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Altimari supports his preference for "ordered charities" by citing the Supreme 
Court's opinion that it was unconstitutional for Maryland to limit fund-raisers 
to 25% of the proceeds of their appeals. The plaintiff was a professional 
solicitor, and while we might go too far if we called a man a hustler for 
keeping for himself a quarter of what he has gleaned for those in need, we have 
to recognize him as indeed the stateliest of beggars. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to dispute the Court of Appeals' judgment that the panhandler is a 
nuisance. Reminders of suffering humanity are always nuisances, but there are 
altogether worse ones attendant upon the companionships enforced in public 
transit. Of course, beggars now and then accost, but the run of them are too 
beaten by circumstances and the shame to which they have been reduced to be up 
to exertions beyond standing all but unconscious of the faces that tithe for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Altimari gives special weight to a Transit Authority survey that "revealed 
that, in fact, two-thirds of the subway ridership have been intimidated into 
giving money to (beggars)." It would not be easy to conceive a greater excess 
of frivolity in the judicial temper than this certification of a study of 
beggars bought and paid for by their declared enemies. After all, the 
conservative canon embodied by this judge has no article more sacred than the 
one that abjures courts from substituting what the public might say for the 
strict prescriptions of the Constitution. The subway beggar is indeed unique; 
he is condemned to the first class whose First Amendment credentials are 
disqualified by a poll. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about nuisances. You cannot walk through an airline terminal without being 
afflicted by devotees of the martyred Lyndon Larouche bawling the noxious 
notions of a convicted swindler and unrepentant caterer to paranoid fantasies. 
No one would suggest that their right to ventilate their views could fairly be 
tested by a public-opinion poll that included the rational and civilized 
majority of citizens. 
</P>
<P>
But the First Amendment remains the guaranteed protection of every sort of 
nuisance except the beggar who appeals to nothing worse in us than our pity and 
is now consigned by a circuit court to a station lower than a four-letter 
obscenity's.

L.A. AREA NOW BATTLING WITH NEW PEST -- THE MEXFLY

<TEXT>
<P>
County supervisors Tuesday grudgingly extended an emergency proclamation to 
cover pesticide spraying to eradicate a new pest, the Mexican fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
The action came only after board members complained bitterly about the state's 
lengthy battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the supervisors in condemning the state were city officials from 
infested neighborhoods in the southeastern part of the county. They complained 
about the state's plans to spray their communities every other week into June. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman chided agriculture officials Tuesday for failing to stick 
to a May 9 deadline to end the spraying against the Medfly. And Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum griped about continued use of El Monte Airport, in his district, as 
the base for the malathion-spewing helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
"You announced that May 9 was going to be the last date for malathion spraying, 
and that has already slipped," Schabarum told state Department of Food and 
Agriculture officials. "So you don't mind if I have a little bit of reservation 
about the genuineness of your representation." 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, questioning the effectiveness of the 10-month aerial attack on the 
Medfly, said: "I am wondering if it makes sense to embark on the same kind of 
program for the Mexican fruit fly. If it hasn't worked as effectively in 
ridding Southern California of one bug, how is it going to work in ridding the 
county of this other bug?" 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors, nonetheless, approved the emergency proclamation, which shields 
the county from liability in connection with the eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
Don Henry of the state agriculture department assured Schabarum that the 
helicopters will stop using El Monte Airport after tonight.

CARDINALS' MAGRANE FINALLY BREAKS THE ICE, 4-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Magrane and Mike Scott were as good as any pitchers in the National League 
last season. Magrane, despite not winning in the last five weeks, won 18 last 
season and Scott won 20. 
</P>
<P>
Both of them have pitched poorly. The two right-handers, who had lost nine 
games between them, opposed each other Tuesday night at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane, who had failed to win in his previous 13 starts, pitched a four-hitter 
and the Cardinals beat Scott and the Houston Astros, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane, who had lost six decisions in his seven starts this season, was in 
command from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's miseries continued. His record fell to 1-4. In five innings he gave up 
eight hits and all the Cardinals runs. 
</P>
<P>
Willie McGee had three singles, scored twice and drove in a run for the 
Cardinals, who won for only the fourth time in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane had an earned-run average of 2.91 last season, while Scott's was 3.10. 
Going into this game Magrane had a 6.45 ERA, having given up 27 runs in 37 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane, who gave up seven runs in his previous start last Thursday, was a late 
replacement for John Tudor. Tudor (4-1) complained of stiffness in his left 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The first complete game by a Cardinal pitcher this season was the sixth time in 
a row they have beaten Scott. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what was wrong," Magrane said. "I was trying too hard. I was trying too 
hard to get the ball down. I've finally straightened it out just by throwing 
strikes." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 12, Atlanta 2 -- Andre Dawson is trying to get the Cubs straightened 
out by himself. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson hit two two-run home runs at Atlanta to support the relief pitching of 
Jeff Pico. Pico, recently up from the minors, gave up one hit in six innings 
for his first victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson, who leads the league with 11 home runs, has had 31 multi-home run 
games. He also hit two home runs last Tuesday against the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson has hit 32 home runs against the Braves, 23 of them in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 5, Pittsburgh 4 -- When Todd Benzinger singled with the bases loaded 
in the 11th inning at Cincinnati, it gave the Reds their best start in modern 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-7 record is the best in the majors. In 1970, the Reds were 22-8. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sabo's one-out single started the winning rally. Two walks loaded the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds trailed, 4-3, after Don Slaught's pinch home run in the top of the 
ninth. A triple by Billy Hatcher and Benzinger's sacrifice fly sent it into 
overtime against Pirate reliever Bill Landrum. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second time in eight chances that Landrum failed to hold the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 2, San Diego 1 -- Ricky Jordan and Carmelo Martinez hit 
consecutive home runs in the fifth inning at San Diego and the Phillies made it 
stand up. 
</P>
<P>
Rodger McDowell disposed of Tony Gwynn and Roberto Alomar with they tying run 
in scoring position in the ninth to get his eighth save. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, a former Padre who signed as a free agent with the Phillies last 
winter, hit his fourth home run to make a loser out of Dennis Rasmussen. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 6, New York 5 -- Gary Carter, blamed for many of the Mets' 
problems last season, stung his former mates in this game at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Carter doubled in the winning run in the eighth inning to give the Giants their 
second victory in a row over the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Kennedy earlier hit a grand slam for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bedrosian worked a scoreless ninth for the save. DAN HAFNER

FISK'S HOME RUN HELPS CHICAGO BEAT BALTIMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carlton Fisk will probably always be remembered for his dramatic home run that 
won a game for the Boston Red Sox in the 1975 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
But, the 41-year-old catcher has played more games for the Chicago White Sox 
than he did for the Red Sox, a team he played on for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
As the White Sox have built into a pennant contender, Fisk has continued to be 
a contributor. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk hit his first home run of the season in dramatic fashion Tuesday night at 
Chicago. The two-run homer came with two out in the eighth inning and gave the 
surging White Sox a 3-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox, who lost 92 games in 1989 and finished 29 1/2 games behind 
Oakland in the Western Division, are off to a solid start. With an 18-10 
record, they are only two games behind the slumping Athletics. The teams are 
tied in the loss column. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles were leading, 2-1, behind Pete Harnisch (3-1). With two out Dan 
Pasqua batted for Ron Kittle and tripled. Fisk followed with his 337th home 
run, his 316th as a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk, who lashed out at younger players recently for their refusal to spend 
more hours working on conditioning, didn't change his own routine after the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Long after his teammates were gone, Fisk was working on his weight program. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned you have to work," he said. "I've learned to focus on each 
at-bat, each pitch. I try to waste nothing. The guys who are able to do that 
are the guys who do the best." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jeff Torborg doesn't worry about Fisk's hitting. He knows just how 
valuable the veteran is. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes a big difference to the young pitchers," Torborg said. "He knows how 
to handle them, nurse them along, and they have great faith in him. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier in the season when he was on the disabled list, we were getting bombed 
out in nearly every game. Our staff was in shambles. He has straightened it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 5, Oakland 4 -- The Athletics are the best defensive team in 
baseball. They are also in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
They were guilty of three errors at Cleveland in a rain-delayed contest and 
blew a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the errors were in the seventh inning to help the Indians score four 
runs and hand the A's their fourth defeat in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco hit his 11th home run in the first inning, his third straight over 
two games, and Scott Sanderson pitched another strong game until the defense 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The big error was by left fielder Rickey Henderson. Henderson dropped a routine 
fly ball by Candy Maldonado with two out that permitted the tying and winning 
runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 3, Texas 2 -- The amazing Cecil Fielder hit his major league leading 
14th home run to proved the Tigers with another victory at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Moseby opened the seventh with a single and Fielder followed with a 
414-foot home run to win it. He has hit 12 home runs and driven in 29 runs in 
the last 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
He leads the majors with 34 runs batted in and 14 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Petry (4-1) won his third in a row to end the Tigers' three-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
New York 7, Minnesota 3 -- Don Mattingly became the 11th player to hit 100 home 
runs at Yankee Stadium. It was a three-run homer in the first inning and the 
Yankees never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
The fast start helped Chuck Cary win his first start of the season. Cary, out 
since mid-April with an inflamed elbow, gave up four hits and a run and struck 
out eight in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 4, Toronto 3 -- Mike Brumley tripled and Harold Reynolds singled him 
home with one out in the 10th inning at Toronto. DAN HAFNER

MARKET BEAT: GETTING A CLUE ON WHEN TO BUY AND WHEN TO BAIL OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An old line that never loses its relevance: The only thing tougher than knowing 
when to buy a stock is knowing when to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
With the Dow Jones industrial average at record highs, it may be more fun to 
think about jumping in than jumping out. But any investor with paper gains 
ought to take the Dow's surge as an opportunity to do a quick portfolio review. 
Maybe it's time to do a little pruning. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of investors are jittery about what's next, all right. Walter Haddad, a 
veteran broker at Paine Webber Inc. in downtown Los Angeles, says he's getting 
plenty of calls from clients with one basic question: "They want to know if the 
fun is over." 
</P>
<P>
Unless you're convinced that another crash is imminent, selling everything 
makes no sense. Rather, the decision has to be made stock by stock. 
</P>
<P>
First, consider the basics. Any capital gain will be taxed at the same rate as 
ordinary income. So you'll be giving Uncle Sam a 28% to 33% cut, and many 
states take a cut, too. But while taxes are a consideration, that alone never 
should stop you from selling, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Another basic question is, what will you do with your profits? Don't sell until 
you've decided where the money will go, whether that's another stock or a 
short-term parking place. 
</P>
<P>
After covering those bases, how do you pick out stocks worth selling? Some 
strategies: 
</P>
<P>
* Tom Anderson, a Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. broker in downtown Los Angeles who 
has been in the business for 31 years, is guided by one of the most trustworthy 
of all yardsticks: a stock's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), or price divided by 
most recent four quarters' earnings per share. 
</P>
<P>
"When a stock is selling for 20 to 21 times earnings, or a higher multiple than 
it has sold for in a long time, that's often the time to get out," he said. 
Pepsico Inc., for example, closed at $68.75 Tuesday. It's up 7% year to date, 
after a 62% rise in 1989, and now sells for 20 times earnings. That's been the 
ceiling on the P/E since 1980, and Anderson takes that as a sell signal. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean Pepsico won't do well over the long term, he notes. If 
earnings keep rising, the stock will, too -- over time. But this latest surge 
looks spent to him, or at the very least it has raised the risk level. So it's 
time to take profits. 
</P>
<P>
* Has the stock had a "climax run" -- a rapid, exponential rise? Morgan White, 
principal at Woodside Capital Management in Menlo Park, says such runs often 
are great sell signals. 
</P>
<P>
That may appear to fly in the face of a long-held market maxim, which is that 
you cut your losses if a stock drops 7% to 15% from where you bought it, but 
that you let your profits run. However, White notes that "no stock goes up 
forever," and after a dramatic rise, selling some is an insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
Look at software firm Adobe Systems. It has risen to $46.50 now from $20.25 on 
Jan. 1. The greed-monger in you might say, "Wait for more!" But after a stock 
doubles, as a general rule you might want to sell half the stake, White said. 
</P>
<P>
* If your paper gain on a stock is, say, 15% to 20%, you face a tougher sell 
decision. Many investors feel that kind of return is all they need to justify 
bailing out. Some brokers disagree. "People are eager to take a small profit," 
said Paine Webber's Haddad. "But you're going to make as many mistakes that way 
as selling at a loss." 
</P>
<P>
Take another look at the company's fundamentals, Haddad advises, and remind 
yourself why you bought the stock in the first place. If the firm's earnings 
outlook has improved dramatically over the past year, "the stock can be cheaper 
at $40 than it was at $20," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But above all, Haddad said, the decision to sell should be based on your 
"comfort" level: If you can't sleep at night because you fear your paper gains 
could disappear, then sell some of your shares -- even if it's just a portion 
of each holding. You'll feel better, you'll have new capital to put to work 
elsewhere, and yet you'll retain the bulk of your long-term commitment to the 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Have money funds peaked?Even before the stock market reawakened with a bang 
last Friday, individual investors were pointing the way: They've been pulling 
cash out of money-market mutual funds since late March in favor of stock funds 
and other longer-term investments. 
</P>
<P>
The unanswered question is, how much of the $383 billion that's still in money 
funds will flow to stocks? The evidence so far in May suggests that investors' 
appetite for stock funds remains strong but that long-term bond funds also are 
garnering a lot of cash once again. 
</P>
<P>
What's interesting is that investors aren't fleeing money funds because fund 
yields are plunging. The average fund yield has been steady in the 7.6% to 7.7% 
range all year, notes Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of IBC/Donoghue's weekly 
money fund letter. The latest figure is 7.66%. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, investors must simply see better potential in stocks and other ideas. 
And perhaps not surprisingly, the investors who are most actively shifting 
money around are those who have brokers to prod them. 
</P>
<P>
Money funds sponsored by brokerages have accounted for the bulk of the drop in 
assets so far: The broker fund category has fallen to $160 billion in assets 
now from $167 billion in late March. In contrast, assets of general purpose 
money funds, often used by independent investors, have fallen only slightly, to 
$132.2 billion from $133.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the decline in money fund assets has been seasonal, as investors pay 
tax bills. Even so, fund companies say there's no question that a shift to 
longer-term investing has begun. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a definite turnaround in May -- investors moving into stock funds 
and long-term municipal bond funds," said Greg Johnson, vice president for 
marketing at Franklin Group mutual funds in San Mateo. 
</P>
<P>
At fund giant T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, spokesman Steve Norwitz 
said stock fund sales are leading the wave. "Stock fund sales have exceeded 
bond fund sales every month since December," he said. "That hasn't happened 
since 1986." 
</P>
<P>
Investors also are moving out of tax-free municipal money funds and into 
longer-term municipal bond funds, Norwitz said. That's occurring even though 
average yields on tax-free money funds have risen to 5.5% from 5.2% since late 
January, while long-term interest rates have been falling since late April. 
Investors obviously have one viewpoint here: It's time to lock in long-term 
yields before they go even lower. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Gawne, spokesman at Kemper Group mutual funds in Chicago, said money 
flows into the firm's U.S. Government bond fund were strong last week. That 
fund's yield now is 9.19%. Second most popular bond fund at Kemper: the 
Municipal Bond fund, yielding 6.87% tax free -- equivalent to a 10.25% taxable 
yield in the 33% tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden is in Los 
Angeles this week. He addresses the World Affairs Council on Friday at the Los 
Angeles Hilton. . . . William O'Neil, long-time market pro and publisher of 
L.A.-based Investor's Daily, issued a super-bullish stock market forecast on 
Tuesday, predicting the broad market will rise 25% over the next 12 months.

WALL STREET RALLY COOLS; DOW UP 0.92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street took some time out Tuesday after running up a string of sharp 
gains, but its retreat was milder than expected and the Dow Jones industrial 
index still managed to breach a new closing high. 
</P>
<P>
Market watchers had anticipated heavy profit taking after the Dow surged more 
than 176 points in less than two weeks. But with relatively light selling, "we 
had a constructive day," said Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody 
&amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials inched up 0.92 to 2,822.45, just 
eclipsing the record high of 2,821.53 set on Monday. The advance brought to 
177.40 points the surge in Wall Street's best-known barometer since April 27. 
</P>
<P>
The average fluctuated during the day, but the broader market stayed in 
negative territory. At the close, declining issues outnumbered advancers by 
about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, 
with 654 up, 856 down and 505 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Wall Street showed continuing signs of strength. Tuesday's 
selling was an extension of profit taking that began Monday, when the Dow 
industrials rose 50 points and then fell back, closing with a 19.95-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
While Monday's performance raised the specter of heavier losses Tuesday, 
"volume dried up on the downside," Jarrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume retreated to 165.73 million shares, from Monday's 225.41 
million 
</P>
<P>
The stock market's rally in the last two weeks has been attributed to evidence 
that inflation is easing, which has sent interest rates plunging. Last Friday's 
announcement of the second straight monthly decline in wholesale prices fed a 
91.22-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
The market also has been bolstered by the perception that the Bush 
Administration and Congress are willing to negotiate to reduce the nation's 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market ignored a government report Tuesday that industrial 
production fell 0.4% in April, the first decline since January, but they said 
there was some concern on Wall Street about today's scheduled release of 
consumer price figures for April. 
</P>

Technology stocks helped lead the market Tuesday. Compaq Computer jumped 2 1/8 
to 114 1/2, IBM picked up 1 3/8 to close at 115 5/8, and Texas Instruments rose 
2 1/4 to 39 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Retailing stocks were among those hardest hit by profit takers. J. C. Penney, 
which announced a big earnings increase, fell 1 3/8 to 65 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
American Express was up 1 3/8 to 30 5/8 amid speculation that it was 
negotiating to sell its troubled Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. brokerage 
subsidiary to Primerica. 
</P>
<P>
Among other blue chip stocks, Philip Morris rose 1/8 to 44 7/8, AT&amp;T fell 
5/8 to 41 3/4 and Boeing slipped 1 to 77. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed mixed as a 
round of profit taking dampened an otherwise bullish market. The Nikkei 
335-share index eased 45.61 points to close at 31,997.04. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stock prices closed slightly lower in lackluster trading, running 
out of steam after Monday's strong rally. The Financial Times 100-share index 
finished down 2.3 points at 2,212.2. 
</P>
<P>
The DAX index of 30 stocks fell almost 1% in Frankfurt, West Germany, to close

Bond Prices Decline on Profit Taking 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices retreated after staging a powerful advance over the previous three 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts cited profit taking, the recent decline in the dollar and apprehension 
over an impending report on inflation at the consumer level for the pullback. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 13/32 point, or $4 per $1,000 face 
amount, after rising more than 2 1/2 points over the last three sessions. Its 
yield, which falls when prices rise, edged up to 8.61% from 8.57% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the pullback in light dealings saw some traders cash in gains 
made in the market's recent strong advance. They also said the dollar's decline 
against the Japanese yen may have discouraged some investors from Japan from 
adding to their holdings of dollar-denominated notes and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But many traders stayed on the sidelines Tuesday in anticipation of the 
government's scheduled report today on consumer prices in April. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.313%, up from 8.25% Monday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Makes Gains in Quiet Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar firmed against most major currencies in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
The currency market seemed to shrug off the industrial production report, 
dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
They said attention is turned toward today's consumer price report and 
Thursday's March trade data for further indications of the direction of the 
U.S. economy and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
For Tuesday, dealers said the dollar's strength came partly at the expense of 
other currencies, particularly the West German mark and British pound. 
</P>
<P>
The mark remained under pressure, they said, following the surprisingly weak 
showing in recent state elections by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
conservative party. Those results brought some uncertainty about the pending 
reunification with East Germany, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound fell against the dollar after Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher said she supported efforts by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major 
to lower the current official interest rate of 15% by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Soybean Prices Fall for 3rd Straight Day 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures prices fell sharply for the third straight day amid profit 
taking and speculative fund-selling prompted in part by signs that Brazilian 
soybean exports are closing the gap between world supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, grain futures fell; cocoa futures retreated; oil 
futures were mixed; precious metals were mixed, and livestock and meat futures 
were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures settled 8 to 11.5 cents lower on the Chicago Board of Trade, 
with the contract for delivery in May down 10.25 cents at $6.1325 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
The decline extended to about 35 cents the drop in the May soybean contract's 
price since Thursday, when the Agriculture Department released a report 
projecting rising U.S. soybean stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts attributed the weakness to increased soybean exports, especially 
from Brazil, the world's second-largest producer after the United States.

* Bjorn Again: A Swedish news magazine must pay $12,500 to retired tennis star 
Bjorn Borg for defaming him by reporting allegations that he used cocaine. 
Monday's verdict in Stockholm was against the magazine "Z" for printing the 
allegations of Borg's former girlfriend, Jannicke Bjorling, who is involved in 
a custody dispute with him over the couple's son, Robin. 
</P>
<P>
* First Mate: Dr. Arthur Kunin, whose wife Madeleine has been Vermont governor 
since 1984, told a conference of governor's spouses in Columbus, Ohio this week 
that he had a crisis of sorts when his wife became governor. 
</P>
<P>
"What did I want to be called?," Kunin says he was asked. He didn't know. So he 
sought help from "learned scholars" who took about six months to come up with 
the title of "First Mate," as a male equivalent to First Lady. And he says he's 
been satisfied with the title ever since. 
</P>
<P>
* Chairman Hope: It looks as if Anthony Hope, son of comedian Bob Hope, will be 
confirmed easily as chairman of the new Indian Gaming Commission. The 
Georgetown University and Harvard Law School graduate testified before the 
Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs on his qualifications last week. On 
Monday, the committee recommended his confirmation as the first chairman of the 
new commission to oversee gambling on Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
* Another Addiction: One in every 20 Italians is obsessed by sex, psychiatrist 
Piero De Giacomo told reporters Tuesday in Rome. According to a study the 
professor has completed, 5% of men and women in Italy had excessive sexual 
appetites. "For these people, sex is an end in itself. They have numerous 
partners, often more than one at the same time . . . make use of pornographic 
films and photographs and sometimes use violence in sexual relations."

'Care Bare' Video: Vickie Schmerda and her husband, David, are suing a video 
company and outlet over a very unchildlike video their 4-year-daughter, 
Kristen, accidentally saw. 
</P>
<P>
The Schmerdas, who live in Woodhaven, Mich., thought they had rented "The Care 
Bears Storybook" from the Blockbuster Entertainment store. But Kristen actually 
saw "Playboy's Farmers Daughters," which featured nude women dancing with 
cartoon farm animals. The child announced she wanted to dance naked, "like the 
Care Bears video with the naked ladies," Schmerda said. The couple is suing for 
negligence and infliction of emotional distress. GREG BRAXTON

J.J. CALE HUNKERS DOWN IN SAVORY, LIVING-ROOM COMFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However much J.J. Cale might protest that his image as a recluse was 
manufactured by the press, his performances of old did little to dispel that 
image. 
</P>
<P>
In shows only a couple of years ago, the Oklahoman author of "After Midnight" 
and "Cocaine" might have been playing to a wall instead of an audience for all 
the acknowledgement he gave the crowd. Between the time he stepped on stage 
until he left, there often would not be so much as a "hello" or a flicker of 
eye contact with his fans. 
</P>
<P>
But even at his most aloof in terms of showmanship, Cale always had the welcome 
mat out where it mattered: The smoky, slow-cooked savor of his music invariably 
drew listeners in. 
</P>
<P>
At the Coach House on Monday, the 51-year-old singer-guitarist seemed a new 
man, talking and joking between songs and generally seeming comfortable with 
the idea that he was in a room full of people. 
</P>
<P>
A fresh, open-eyed approach also seemed to infuse his music. His old shows 
could give listeners the feeling they were peeking through a window at a bunch 
of friends having a relaxed and insular living-room jam. While Cale and his 
miraculous six-piece band retained that special feel Monday, they also have 
turned it outward, playing with such a spark that they seemed intent on 
carpeting the whole world with their living-room vibe. 
</P>
<P>
Cale has always managed to find players responsive to his musical whims, but he 
has outdone himself with some real groove monsters this time. Joining longtime 
cohorts Jim Cruce on drums, Jimmy Karstein (who makes even a tambourine a 
fluent instrument) on percussion and Christine Lakeland on guitar and vocals 
were pedigreed players Steve Douglas, Tim Drummond and Spooner Oldham. 
</P>
<P>
Saxman Douglas has been a rock studio legend since starting with Duane Eddy in 
the '50s, while bassist Drummond has worked with everyone from James Brown to 
Bob Dylan. Keyboardist Oldham co-penned such soul and country classics as "Do 
Right Woman" and laid down keys behind Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett and 
countless others (that's Oldham's organ on Percy Sledge's immortal "When a Man 
Loves a Woman"). 
</P>
<P>
Seven-player rock bands can be cumbersome affairs, but Cale's group played like 
a simmering stew, where personality-filled solos bubbled to the surface while 
still adding their flavor to the overall mix. Cale's spare but highly rhythmic 
finger-picked guitar provided the recipe for the songs, though they remained 
continually open to revision and spicing. 
</P>
<P>
Cale's current "Travel-Log" album rates as his most enlivened work, and the 
summer-fireworks spirit of its songs translated well to the stage. "No Time" 
and "Hold On Baby" both had an insistent locomotive drive, while the pulsing, 
sensual "Humdinger" was nudged on with stings from Cale's slide guitar. The 
only album tune not up to the recorded version was "New Orleans." Though it had 
plenty of atmosphere from Douglas' snaking soprano sax lines and Oldham's Randy 
Newman-like piano dissonances, it lacked the magic of Al Capps' orchestrated 
street-funeral arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Eschewing both current high-tech and funky old equipment (he used to be noted 
for playing a beat-to-hell Sears guitar), Cale bravely did his picking on a 
budget Casio guitar, with a built-in synthesizer used lightly to broaden his 
tonal palette in places. Though one suspects that he would have little trouble 
executing the highly dramatic flash solos of his admirer Eric Clapton, Cale 
instead worked to achieve a deceptively low-keyed, precarious balance between 
invention and adherence to the songs' simple forms. 
</P>
<P>
On "The Best I Ever Had," that meant weaving a delicate web of notes to support 
the gentle lyric, while on Don Nix's blues standard "I'm Goin' Down" he 
perversely overlaid some flamenco-flavored licks. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas also peppered nearly every song with solos on soprano, alto or tenor 
saxes; his workout on the Viscounts' moody version of Johnny Otis' "Harlem 
Nocturne" was a standout. 
</P>
<P>
One would think that after playing "After Midnight" countless times and seeing 
it turned into a turgid suds anthem by Clapton, Cale would be pretty well fed 
up with the song. Instead, he made it the highlight of the show, pumping out an 
exuberant, racing version, where his chugging guitar alone could have powered 
it into next week.

Unfunny Returns for Comedy Benefit: The organizers of a Monday night benefit 
for homeless children at several area comedy clubs are not happy with the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Despite appearences by Sam Kinison, Bobcat Goldthwait and Richard Belzer, the 
Comedy for Harmony shows only raised $5,000, about one-fourth of the expected 
total. "This is a huge disappointment," said Carla Chadwick, founder of the 
Harmony Project. "The public just did not come out and support us." Among the 
10 clubs hosting the shows were the Improvisation in West Hollywood, the Ice 
House in Pasadena and L.A. Cabaret in Encino.GREG BRAXTON

Rap Intellectualized: A Rhodes scholar testified Tuesday in federal court in 
Ft. 
</P>
<P>
Lauderdale, Fla., about cultural, political and literary value in the music of 
controversial rappers 2 Live Crew. "The music is political simply in that you 
have a group of artists who are saying 'I'm going to express myself the way I 
express myself,' " said Carlton Long, who said he will teach political science 
at Columbia University this year. The group's album, "As Nasty As They Wanna 
Be," has been banned from several Florida counties, and U.S. District Judge 
Jose Gonzalez Jr. is considering whether the album should be banned from 
Broward County. GREG BRAXTON

Cantinflas in Contempt: Contempt of court charges have been filed against 
Mexican superstar Mario "Cantinflas" Moreno in divorce proceedings in Houston. 
Joyce Jett-Moreno, Moreno's wife for more than 20 years, had asked State 
District Court Judge Robert Webb to jail or fine Moreno for repeated violations 
of the court order issued last October stipulating the actor to pay $20,000 in 
monthly spousal support. 
</P>
<P>
She also claimed that the actor had failed to provide her with "even the basic 
necessities of life" even though he has $10 million in cash in the U.S. Webb 
set a June 12 court date to hear evidence. Moreno has produced, directed and 
starred in more than 70 films, including "Around the World in 80 Days." GREG

Cambodian Dancers May Perform at L.A. Festival: L.A. Festival officials were 
encouraged following talks concerning the proposed visit in September of the 
National Dance Company of Cambodia. "Things went very well -- extremely well -- 
and we're very encouraged," said L.A. Festival executive director Judith Luther 
Tuesday upon her return from a day of Washington meetings with immigration and 
state department officials to discuss the visit. Luther said the officials were 
"open . . . and, I think, supportive to the extent they can be," despite the 
fact that the U.S. government does not recognize Cambodia or its current 
leader, Hun Sen. GREG BRAXTON

'STANDARD' A SKILLFUL BALANCE OF GENRE, TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's admit it at the outset: "Eastern Standard," a provocative entertainment 
at the Coast Playhouse, is about a bunch of yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
Some people simply don't want to hear about yuppie soul-searching, when there 
are so many more pressing problems on the planet. These people will have a 
built-in prejudice against this play. 
</P>
<P>
Not that other problems are ignored by Richard Greenberg, the playwright. One 
of the characters has AIDS. Another is on the margins of an insider trading 
scandal. And the young and the restless in this play are confronted with a 
homeless schizophrenic who temporarily enters their lives and provides a prod 
for the action. 
</P>
<P>
They're not talking about what color the new Miata should be. 
</P>
<P>
It's the overall context that may annoy confirmed yuppie-haters. "Eastern 
Standard" is a contemporary model of the sort of play that Philip Barry wrote 
60 years ago: a witty comedy that addresses social issues obliquely -- through 
the unrest within a group of well-educated and well-connected young adults. The 
ending is relatively happy -- for the yuppies if not for the schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern Standard" doesn't take its issues as seriously as some may wish. But 
Greenberg does take his characters seriously. He refuses to dismiss them as 
caricatures. 
</P>
<P>
We laugh at their banter, though occasionally it sounds too studied. We also 
see their frailties and hypocrisies. And their possible evolution into more 
humane people is surprisingly heartening. Without resorting to heavy-handed 
psychoanalysis that would violate the standards of the genre, Greenberg digs 
surprisingly deep below the shallow surfaces of these people. 
</P>
<P>
This balancing of a light genre with dark times, of flip remarks with suddenly 
felt pain, is a delicate act. But Johnathon Pape's staging carries it off as 
well as Greenberg's script. 
</P>
<P>
The first act is set in a trendy restaurant at lunchtime, immaculately designed 
by Todd K. Little. But despite the cool look, which extends to the costume 
design by Roger Meunier and Douglas Kimble, something's amiss at each of three 
adjacent tables. 
</P>
<P>
At the first, architect Stephen (Richard Waterhouse) confides to his gay 
college chum, up-and-coming artist Drew (Andrew Kreiss), that he swallowed a 
bottle of pills last night. Stephen couldn't abide his soulless job or his 
loveless life any more. He vomited up the drugs, but he's still fretting. 
</P>
<P>
Financial consultant Phoebe (Lorna Patterson) arrives at the next table, soon 
followed by her brother Peter (Gordon Thomson), a gay TV executive. The 
revelations here are even grimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly homeless May (Lynn Milgrim), at a third table, hurls a Perrier bottle 
in the direction of the yuppies, uniting their fates more than they realize. 
Then we see what prompted her to throw the bottle, as we return to the 
preceding conversation between May and would -- be actress Ellen, (Christie 
Mellor) who's waiting on the tables. 
</P>
<P>
In the second act, a month has passed and the four yuppies -- now two couples 
-- adjourn to Stephen's beach house. Stephen has the cockeyed idea to invite 
Ellen, with whom he has struck up a friendship. And Ellen has the crazy idea to 
invite bag lady May, with whom she has struck up a friendship. 
</P>
<P>
May arrives and fits in remarkably well -- until push comes to shove. But then 
May is a veteran at adapting to changing circumstances. The other characters 
have to do some adapting too, to May and to each other, and it's a shock to 
their more cushioned personalities. 
</P>
<P>
As the host and nominal hub of this group, Waterhouse is a touchingly mixed-up 
guy, who makes fun of his own whining. Occasionally Greenberg's more byzantine 
turns of phrase sound a little forced in Waterhouse's mouth; but then who 
wouldn't have a problem making "dumbstruck as ever by the tortuous path of 
bureaucratic concessions" sound natural? Note how Waterhouse's thick shock of 
hair looks like it has been through the wringer by the final scene -- a perfect 
little detail. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson "looks as if she breakfasts on ticker tape," to quote Drew, and the 
arrogance never quite melts, though her concern for her brother is palpable. As 
for Drew, when he stops wisecracking, he starts gushing out his romantic 
feelings; the two impulses don't always sound as if they could co-exist. But 
Kreiss' limber tongue is up to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson broods beautifully, Mellor is a winning ditz, and Milgrim makes the 
unlikeliest transformation believable enough, for the purposes of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8325 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 
p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m., ends July 8. $20-$25; (213) 650-8507.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / 48TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
BRADLEY ENDORSES FARRELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell's bid for the Assembly seat now held 
by Maxine Waters got a formal nod of approval Tuesday from Mayor Tom Bradley, 
an endorsement some observers said gives Farrell a significant -- and needed -- 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
Plagued by past political problems, including two failed efforts to recall him 
from the council, Farrell has had trouble igniting his campaign for the 48th 
Assembly District seat. But Bradley's backing could help him overcome those 
problems, as well as neutralize potentially powerful endorsements given to 
Marguerite Archie-Hudson, one of his three foes in the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
Those supporting Archie-Hudson include Waters and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco). She also won the official endorsement of the state 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
One political observer questioned the value of Bradley's endorsement, saying it 
has become more difficult in recent years to gauge his political clout. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't judge how the mayor's standing is these days, except that his 
margin of victory was down" in last year's mayoral election, said Larry Berg, 
director of the Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bradley's support did not help the 1987 City Council campaigns of 
allies Pat Russell and Homer Broome Jr. Both were defeated -- Broome in 
Bradley's home district. And during the last year, the mayor's squeaky-clean 
image has been tarnished by revelations about his personal financial dealings 
and their possible impact on public policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
But others familiar with the 48th District race viewed Bradley's endorsement as 
crucial to Farrell's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Bradley's endorsement is critical and one you want to have," said Kerman 
Maddox, a former Bradley aide who helped mount an unsuccessful recall against 
Farrell two years ago. "I'm not going to say it offsets all the things against 
(Farrell), but it does neutralize some of those other endorsements." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran political consultant Joe Cerrell said Bradley's is the single most 
important endorsement a candidate could receive in the 48th District, which 
spreads across South Los Angeles and whose population is 50% black. 
</P>
<P>
"Assembly races are not high-visibility races," which makes endorsements by 
high-profile politicians all the more important, Cerrell said. That is 
especially the case in the 48th District, whose residents "know who Tom Bradley 
is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Waters, a Democrat who first won the Assembly seat in 1976, is giving it up to 
run for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, in his endorsement of Farrell, said he thinks the councilman is the 
best person to succeed Waters "based upon my long association with him and my 
familiarity with his commitment to public service." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said his support should be considered a "positive endorsement," and 
not a "negative" assessment of the other three candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not casting aspersions against any other person running," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Archie-Hudson, a former aide to Assembly Speaker Brown and former Los Angeles 
Community College trustee, said she sought Bradley's endorsement, but has known 
for two months that it would go to Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't surprise me," she said of the mayor's action. "The councilman is a 
sitting city official." 
</P>
<P>
Archie-Hudson and Farrell are considered the front-runners in the Democratic 
primary, which also includes Rod Wright, a public affairs specialist who has 
managed numerous political campaigns, and Lynwood City Councilwoman Evelyn 
Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell's current four-year term on the City Council will be up in April, 1991. 
Thus, he is not risking that post by running for the Assembly.

CONFERENCE CENTER PLAN SCRAPPED BY UCLA; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: UNIVERSITY BOWS TO COMMUNITY PRESSURE TO LIMIT EXPANSION. FACILITY 
WOULD HAVE WORSENED TRAFFIC IN AREA, CRITICS CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA Chancellor Charles Young, bowing to pressure from local officials and 
homeowners, announced Tuesday that the university has abandoned plans to build 
a controversial conference center as part of an ambitious long-range expansion 
strategy for the Westwood campus. 
</P>
<P>
Community activists said they hope UCLA's decision not to build the 300-room 
conference center marks a first step in a scaling back of the overall expansion 
plan, announced in March, which would have added 4.45 million square feet to 
the campus and increased the school's size by one-third. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a terrific first step," said Westwood resident Sandy Brown. "Now, what 
else are they going to drop?" 
</P>
<P>
The conference center would have offered overnight accommodations to visiting 
scholars and other university guests, and opponents contended it would have had 
the same impact as a hotel. They said that despite the center's relatively 
small size -- an estimated 300,000 square feet -- it would have exacerbated the 
area's already critical traffic problem. 
</P>
<P>
Young has maintained that UCLA's expansion plans would not increase traffic 
congestion. He said in a statement Tuesday that he was eliminating the 
convention center "out of sensitivity for community concerns." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA also agreed in principle to a joint-monitoring system, under which the 
campus would be bound by its promise that any expansion would not increase 
traffic in the area. If traffic increased, UCLA could be barred from going with 
future development projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for the university to show the rest of the world they are 
willing to hold their feet to the fire on commitments they have made," said 
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents the Westwood area. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's original expansion proposal, combined with projects approved but not yet 
under way, would have exceeded all the commercial development already on 
Wilshire Boulevard in the Westwood community, according to Yaroslavsky who, 
along with other officials, is lobbying UCLA to scale back its plans. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the conference center, which was to be built west of Gayley Avenue in 
Westwood Village, the proposed expansion includes replacing all the hospital 
rooms in the medical center and building 2,700 housing units for graduate 
students and faculty on property that abuts Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The conference center has been a particularly thorny issue for Westwood 
residents, who have battled for years to restrict hotel development in an area 
already besieged with traffic. Alvin Milder, head of UCLA Watch, a group that 
monitors the university's activities, agreed. "We're glad to see some reason 
and common sense is prevailing at our renowned educational institution." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Young last month, Yaroslavsky asked UCLA -- which as a state 
institution is not subject to local land-use guidelines -- to allow city 
agencies to vote on its expansion proposals in order to prevent "the 
surrounding Westwood community from being engulfed by unchecked growth." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal and Assemblyman Terry Friedman, 
issued a joint statement Tuesday proclaiming the decision to forgo a conference 
center as the first step in scaling back an unacceptable amount of development. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Friedman said the conference center was at the top of 
everyone's hit list. "It's unimaginable how a conference center that would 
function in many ways as a hotel would not increase traffic," Friedman said.

BILL BOYARSKY: A MOTHER'S LOVE AND WILLIE BROWN

<P>
As election day nears, Republican Assemblywoman Cathie Wright is counting on 
the fruits of her friendship with Democratic power Willie Brown to overcome the 
excesses of mother love. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, a Republican state assemblywoman from the San Fernando and Simi 
valleys, has become famous for her beyond-the-call-of-duty efforts for her 
speed-demon daughter, Victoria -- the recipient of 27 traffic tickets, 24 of 
them for speeding, and some suspiciously light treatment from certain judges. 
</P>
<P>
At key times, Speaker Brown stepped in to help. In Wright's district, 
Republican activists consider Brown the living symbol of Democratic liberalism. 
</P>
<P>
And so Wright, campaigning for reelection in the June 5 GOP primary, finds 
herself in the awkward position of both defending her relationship with Brown 
and trying to capitalize on it. Let me explain. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, Cathie Wright resembles a decorous member of a suburban 
Republican women's club. Her blonde hair is worn in a tight bun and her clothes 
are crisp. But she fights with the fury of an old pol from her native 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
When her 24-year-old daughter faced a license suspension, mom wrote a letter to 
the motor vehicles director, who assigned a top official to the case. The man 
found Victoria's driving "horrendous" but lifted her suspension so she could 
drive to work. Another time, a judge dismissed two tickets after Wright visited 
him at his house one night to discuss her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
And when things really got rough, Willie Brown offered a hand. One day, 
according to a Wright aide, Brown overheard her trying to find a lawyer for her 
daughter. The speaker located one. 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, the speaker called Ventura County Municipal Court Judge 
Herbert Curtis III just 15 minutes before the judge was to sentence Victoria 
for driving without a license. Curtis said Brown told him he was a friend of 
Wright's and that he didn't think Victoria deserved to go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis fined Victoria $225, gave her a 30-day suspended sentence and put her on 
three years' probation. Later, Victoria violated the probation by failing to 
tell the court of additional traffic violations, and served 20 days on a jail 
work-furlough program. 
</P>
<P>
Now why, you may ask, would Willie Brown help a Republican -- and a 
conservative one, at that? Because, although Democrats have controlled the 
Legislature for more than two decades, they need the Republicans to win in the 
Sacramento power game. 
</P>
<P>
In the Assembly, for example, the Democratic speaker always has to have a few 
Republicans in his pocket to remain in office. That's because he's in perpetual 
danger of political assassination by fellow Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
He always calls on a certain kind of Republican, one from a district so 
Republican that no strong Democrat runs. This assures that, in befriending a 
Republican, he has not stepped on the toes of any aspiring Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
The befriending of Wright came in 1988 -- before her daughter's lead-footed 
tendencies became public fodder. At that time, rebellious Democrats known as 
"The Gang of Five" were mounting an effort to dump Brown as speaker. They got 
most of the Republicans to join them to replace Brown with one of the gang 
members, Charles Calderon of Montebello. Wright abstained from the vote. It was 
a decisive move, helping turn the tide for Brown. And it put him in Wright's 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
Furious, the Assembly Republican caucus demanded that Wright be removed from 
the patronage-rich Rules Committee, whose members assign cars, staff and other 
fringe benefits to themselves and their colleagues. Traditionally, each caucus 
nominates its Rules Committee members. This time, Brown ignored the Republicans 
and kept Wright on the committee. He also gave her a couple more top committee 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Now Wright is facing reelection. Wright's use of clout, including the Brown 
connection, provides the cutting edge of the attack by her opponent, Hunt 
Braly, aide to Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia). 
</P>
<P>
Last week, they debated at a Republican women's group meeting in Simi Valley. 
He brought up the daughter -- "Cathie Wright's abuse of power." He blasted the 
assemblywoman for "creating a political alliance with Willie Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Wright emphasized the benefits of that alliance -- without, of course, naming 
the benefactor. She took credit herself for bills and appropriations won for 
her district. These are the kind of small but important measures that the 
speaker speeds along for friends and bottles up for enemies. 
</P>
<P>
They are the rewards of the big favor she did for Brown. As for the many 
strings she pulled for Victoria, her campaign manager, Mark Thompson, told me, 
"If she's guilty of anything, it's that she loves that daughter too much."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN ROLEX ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men who police said targeted the owners of pricey Rolex watches in at least 
30 armed robberies were arrested Tuesday in Gardena, one after barricading 
himself in a friend's home for 3 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said Christopher Pack and Ron Hinton, both 19-year-olds from 
Gardena, are responsible for many of a string of 75 Rolex thefts around the 
county since the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The pair often approached their victims in office parking structures and 
demanded the watches -- worth from $2,000 to $15,000 -- at gunpoint, said Sgt. 
Mike Foster. 
</P>
<P>
Undercover officers with the Sheriff's Department and South Bay police had been 
monitoring the men for about two weeks, said Deputy Richard Garcia. Officers 
decided to arrest the two Tuesday after they spotted detectives in West Los 
Angeles, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Pack was arrested when he returned home about noon. About 40 officers 
surrounded the house where Hinton was, two blocks away. He surrendered at 3:20 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Pack and Hinton were being held at the Hawthorne Jail on $250,000 bail each.

'DANGEROUS' SKID ROW HOTEL EMPTIED, ITS FATE UP IN AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the last day the Olympia Hotel was open, some things were different and some 
things seemed just the same. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officers, who call the Skid Row establishment a 
drug-infested place, were there, which was not unusual. There just seemed to be 
more of them walking the halls Tuesday, telling people they would have to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
As city officials took the unusual step of shutting down a slum building as 
being too dangerous for habitation, one man packed up a few belongings -- and 
then walked outside in a black miniskirt, high-heeled shoes and net stockings. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel at 1203 E. 7th St. is in a pocket of Skid Row known for male 
transvestites and prostitution as well as drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
The squat three-story brick building looks like a slum -- with broken windows, 
holes in the ceilings, leaky plumbing. Grime cakes the long, dark halls. Human 
waste is on the floor of one common bathroom. People paid about $65 a week to 
live there. 
</P>
<P>
Police say there have been three murders there since January, two in the last 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a thorn in our side for some time," said Central Division Police 
Lt. Lyman Doster. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of conditions and violence led City Atty. James K. Hahn to 
order the evacuation, instead of waiting for the hotel's owners, Schlomo Bina 
of San Marino and Daryoush Daian of Beverly Hills, to complete their sale of 
the building to the nonprofit Skid Row Housing Trust. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, commissioners for the city Community Redevelopment Agency will 
vote whether to authorize $1.1 million to assist the housing trust to buy and 
remake the hotel into 48 low-income housing units. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hate to wait another couple of weeks and have more murders, more 
violence," Hahn said, standing outside the Olympia. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, a busty "woman," wearing heavy makeup, objected to the action in a 
deep, masculine voice. 
</P>
<P>
"This building's not that bad. I don't have any problems here," he said, giving 
his name as Cindy Olivares. 
</P>
<P>
Anna Dominguez, a heavyset woman with short hair and glasses, bustled up and 
down the worn wooden stairs, carrying boxes of clothing belonging to a niece 
whom she described as "a drug addict, a walking dead person." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, of Montebello, said she had come to take her niece to a drug 
treatment program. The 31-year-old had agreed to go, but now she was nowhere to 
be found. 
</P>
<P>
As Dominguez struggled with her niece's belongings, she added: "I've got to go 
look for her." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several people struggled to help Dianne Apt move herself, three 
children -- aged 11, 2 and 6 months -- a cat and a turtle out of Room 103. They 
seemed to be the only family in the building. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to collect things," Apt, a 39-year-old with scraggly dark hair, said 
somewhat apologetically as she stuffed mounds of clothing and other items into 
plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
Her cubicle, typical for the building, was about 12 feet square, lit by bare 
light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. Above the one bed, two windows had no 
glass in them -- and no protective boards to keep the babies from falling out. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Callaghan of Las Familias del Pueblo, a family service agency, said she 
would help the family, which lives on $1,200 monthly welfare benefits, 
relocate. Apt's husband is hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Stephanie Sautner said the family would also be entitled to 
$5,000 in relocation benefits from the landlords. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the residents, under city law, will be entitled to $2,000 per unit, 
provided they lived there more than 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Bina said he would pay the money. The landlord also said he had mixed feelings 
about the city's action to close the Olympia. He said that since he and Daian 
bought the hotel in 1987, attempts to upgrade the building had been frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"The tenants keep destroying the place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bina was not sorry to see the tenants go. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way it's a lot better for us," he said of the city's action. "We could 
not have done this on 24-hours' notice."

MENENDEZ GUN LINK PURSUED; 
</P>
<P>
MURDERS: AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THEY HAVE FOUND SHOP WHERE BROTHERS ALLEGEDLY 
BOUGHT GUNS USED IN PARENTS' SLAYINGS. HANDWRITING SAMPLES OF SUSPECTS WILL BE 
SOUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Authorities believe they have discovered the shop where Lyle and Erik Menendez 
allegedly purchased shotguns used to murder their parents in Beverly Hills, and 
they are attempting in court to obtain handwriting samples that would establish 
the link, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
While sources familiar with the investigation said that the murder weapons have 
not been found, detectives have discovered in a San Diego County gun shop paper 
work that could turn into important evidence to establish that the brothers 
purchased two 12-gauge shotguns used to slay their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle, 22, and, Erik, 19, were arrested last March 8 in the murders of their 
parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, and are being held without bail. Each faces 
murder charges with special circumstance allegations -- multiple murders, 
killing for financial gain and lying in wait -- that could result in the death 
penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The two defendants have pleaded not guilty. No date has been set for their 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The Menendez couple were slain while watching television in the family room of 
their mansion on Elm Drive on the evening of last Aug. 20. Menendez, 45, was 
chief executive of Live Entertainment Inc. of Van Nuys, a video and music 
distributor. 
</P>
<P>
The murder weapons, two 12-gauge shotguns, were purchased in a gun store in San 
Diego County shortly before the murders, the sources said. The name of the shop 
was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor in the case, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Eliott E. 
Alhadeff, has asked for new handwriting samples from the brothers. Alhadeff 
would not comment on why he wants the samples, but sources said it was in 
connection with the sale of the shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
Neither attorney for the defendants, Gerald Chaleff nor Leslie Abramson, would 
comment on the case Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Several gun shop owners along the Interstate 5 corridor in San Diego County 
told The Times that investigators canvassed the area for the weapons about a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, to purchase a weapon, an individual must fill out a "4473" 
form for the gun shop owner. It requires the buyer to provide name, address and 
other vital information and has to be signed by the purchaser, who must also 
provide an identification card with a picture, usually a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Separately on Tuesday, Santa Monica Superior Court Judge James A. Albracht 
ordered the county coroner to release autopsy reports on the slain couple, 
based on motions filed by lawyers representing two television networks, NBC and 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the killers used two types of shotgun ammunition, 
large pellets and birdshot. Five blasts hit Jose Menendez, 10 blasts hit his 
wife, wrote Dr. Irwin L. Golden, who performed the autopsies. 
</P>
<P>
Sources have said knowledge that two types of ammunition were used in the 
slayings could be important evidence at trial, lending credence to the belief 
that two killers were involved. Previously, it was revealed that a former 
Princeton classmate of Lyle Menendez turned over an expended shotgun shell 
allegedly found in one of Lyle's jackets to detectives last fall. 
</P>
<P>
According to the coroner's reports, apparently one of the killers came up 
behind Jose Menendez and fired a round that blew off the back of his head, 
killing him instantly. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the murder investigation, it was believed that a shotgun had been 
fired in the victim's mouth, because of the nature of the fatal wound. It led 
to assumptions by some that the double killing was mob-engineered. But, 
according to the autopsy report, the trajectory of the blast was "back to 
front." 
</P>
<P>
Jose Menendez, dressed in a sweat shirt, shorts and leather shoes, according to 
the report, also was hit in both arms and the chest. 
</P>
<P>
"There was evidence of close-range firing . . . ," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Kitty Menendez, dressed in a sweat shirt, jogging pants and sneakers, was 
struck by 10 blasts, according to Golden's report. Fatal blasts of birdshot 
pellets hit her in the face and chest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigative sources have said that Kitty Menendez was found a few feet from a 
sofa on which the couple were sitting. The angle of the shotgun blasts, 
according to the autopsy, support investigative theories that she was slain 
while attempting to flee. 
</P>
<P>
William Eckert, a nationally known forensic expert who examined the autopsy 
reports at the request of The Times, said it appeared the killings were done by 
amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me (the 15 shotgun blasts) wasn't necessary," he said in a 
telephone interview from his Wichita, Kan., home. "It had to be done by 
amateurs. This was overkill."

FAKE DOCUMENTS FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS, FOUR SUSPECTS SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal agents, in raids on two Southern California homes, have for the first 
time broken up a major counterfeiting ring that was producing fake legalization 
documents and supplying them to illegal aliens nationwide, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Four people were arrested and hundreds of blank documents -- a high-quality 
falsified version of the kind used by nearly 3 million amnesty applicants -- 
were seized in raids in San Bernardino, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But what set this raid apart, immigration officials said, was the discovery of 
the camera equipment, laminating devices and Department of Justice stamps used 
to produce the fake papers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made street buys of these documents before, but never located the 
place where they were being manufactured," said John Brechtel, assistant 
district director for investigations at the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. "This is the first time we've come up with . . . the mill." 
</P>
<P>
Brechtel said investigators were trying to determine how many counterfeit 
documents were being produced at the two San Bernardino locations. The fake 
papers were distributed nationwide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time an operation that counterfeited legalization papers has 
been broken up anywhere in the country, according to Karl Ullrich, intelligence 
officer for the INS Western regional office. The raid culminated a six-month 
investigation that included the arrests of three additional suspects and 
confiscation of 4,000 blank fake cards in March. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is considered the nation's largest market for counterfeit 
papers, which are used by illegal aliens to obtain jobs. Under the 1986 
Immigration and Reform Act, employers must require prospective employees to 
present documents that prove they are entitled to work legally in this country. 
The fake papers enable illegal aliens to sidestep that law. 
</P>
<P>
The papers allegedly produced at the San Bernardino locations were temporary 
resident identification cards and temporary work permit cards that are given to 
people who have qualified for amnesty and are in the process of legalizing 
their immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
The cards, with distinctive red and yellow stripes, carry the picture of the 
bearer, his name, date of birth and other information. The fake cards sell on 
the streets for $350 and are more useful than false green cards or other papers 
because they are more readily accepted by employers, Brechtel said. "We are 
seeing more and more counterfeit legalization documents than ever before," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
INS agents, backed by the U.S. Secret Service and San Bernardino police, 
carried out the raids late Monday, descending on a home and an apartment. Four 
people were arrested and arraigned in Los Angeles federal court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Three suspects charged with felony possession of counterfeit documents for sale 
were identified as Omar Cuevas-Lopez, 22; Cecilia Galieana-Hernandez, 30, and 
Julio Caesar Vales-Lopez, 31. A fourth man arrested, Jorge Luis Cuevas-Lopez, 
30, was charged with possession of a sawed-off shotgun without a serial number. 
</P>
<P>
All the suspects are Mexican nationals, Brechtel said. Additional charges are 
expected to be handed down in an indictment within 10 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the camera and laminating equipment, agents seized stamps 
bearing the Department of Justice insignia, 450 blank legalization cards, 450 
blank Social Security cards, $2,740 in cash, a semiautomatic rifle, two 
shotguns and a 9-millimeter pistol, Brechtel said.

A federal judge ruled that the Constitution limits the government's power to 
require drug tests for job applicants if the job has nothing to do with police 
work, public safety or official secrets. The decision by U.S. District Judge 
Gerhard A. Gesell came in the case of Carl Willner, who filed suit after the 
Justice Department tentatively accepted him for employment in its Antitrust 
Division and then asked him to submit to a urine test. Gesell pointed out that 
Willner would not have access to top secret classified information and was not 
a prosecutor in drug cases.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly upheld a health 
study that found about 250 homes near the Love Canal toxic waste dump are safe 
to live in. Despite opposition from environmental groups, Reilly said he backs 
a four-year habitability study that led state officials to approve the 
resettlement near Niagara Falls, N.Y. Some of the homes formally go on the 
market in about six weeks. State officials said, however, that buyers would get 
no guarantees that problems with PCBs, dioxin and other toxic chemicals would 
not recur.

HILLSIDE ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PLAN RILES RANCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Landowners who live in the ranches above Moorpark are mounting a battle to 
prevent the city's northern hillsides from being carved up into a luxury 
housing development. 
</P>
<P>
A considerable part of Moorpark city lies in the north, a vast area covered by 
cactus and sage and populated mainly by avocado growers and horse ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
But if Westlake Village developer Paul Bollinger is successful in pushing 
through his plan, 101 hillside estates will be built. 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger wants to strike a deal with the City Council tonight to build the 
houses in clusters in return for opening recreational facilities to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The houses Bollinger wants to build are intended for high-income executives 
looking for a ranch-like setting: 4,000-square-foot mansions, priced from 
$800,000 to $1.2 million, that would overlook a championship golf course and an 
equestrian center. 
</P>
<P>
"With such big lots, it's going to feel like you're out in the country," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents bordering the proposed development fume that the mansions would 
take the country atmosphere out of rural Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Bergfield, 58, a retired aerospace engineering consultant, last year sold 
his house in Los Angeles and bought a 17-acre lot and house in Moorpark to 
raise lemons and avocados. He said he is angry that the city is even 
considering the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't move here to be shoulder to shoulder with people," Bergfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, the fastest-growing city in the county, is running out of large open 
spaces, said Patrick Richards, the city's community development director. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid development boosted the city's population an estimated 4.2% last year, 
adding 1,059 people. Over the last decade Moorpark has grown nearly 24%. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growth, Moorpark has maintained a national reputation as an 
equestrian center. 
</P>
<P>
The ranches and surrounding horse trails in the north are well-known to 
championship equestrians on the U.S. Olympic riding team, said Councilman Scott 
Montgomery, who boards three horses at a ranch near the proposed Bollinger 
development. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Bollinger's project, even if it is allowed to be built, 
would never include condominiums. But it would still raise the density of 
hillside development. 
</P>
<P>
Although current zoning limits building to one house for every five acres in 
the northern hillside area, Bollinger is taking advantage of an exception in 
the city's General Plan that allows five times as many houses to be built on 
part of a development if public recreational facilities also are constructed. 
</P>
<P>
"The smallest lot Bollinger will be providing is two acres," Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the landowners supports Bollinger's project. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept of having a golf course there is good for the city, because it 
does provide open space," said Bill Houseman, whose 10-acre property lies 
southwest of the proposed project. But Houseman said he is in the minority 
among the area's landowners. 
</P>
<P>
Other landowners and city officials question Bollinger's ability to purchase 
the property, since it is involved in a legal dispute over the assets of 
Thousand Oaks financier Olen B. Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips' assets were seized pending the results of a criminal investigation 
that involves the defunct Westlake Thrift &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger said he intends to close the deal on the property by September, but 
city officials said it is unclear whether he will be able to buy the land. 
</P>
<P>
After watching Moorpark and other nearby cities being threatened by urban 
sprawl, some landowners have become protective of Moorpark's remaining open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
"I left Hacienda Heights for a more rural atmosphere," said Jiro Trujillo, 58, 
an executive in a bankruptcy liquidation firm. "I like the agricultural area. I 
like to breathe a little more air." 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo said he built his "dream house," a two-story Spanish-tiled hacienda, 
three years ago after he decided to leave Los Angeles. He has grown used to the 
life of a gentleman farmer, raising avocados while commuting to the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Moorpark resident and horse rancher Pete Peters has been the most 
vocal in his opposition to the development. He said he doesn't oppose 
development, but he wants Bollinger to be limited to building one house for 
every five acres. 
</P>
<P>
With a 50-acre horse ranch overlooking the city, Peters said, he has grown used 
to his privacy after living in Moorpark for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, who runs an equestrian riding program for Ventura County's Special 
Olympics team, says he is concerned with overcrowding and the condition of the 
hillsides. The sage- and cactus-covered canyons surrounding his property plunge 
several hundred feet into ravines that are subject to flooding and fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we have a drought, people don't know we have a flood control 
problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, Peters watched as flood waters washed out California 118 
below his ranch. Building more houses could alter the drainage pattern for the 
worse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The landowners have at least one ally on the City Council, Councilwoman Eloise 
A. Brown, who has raised questions about the public recreational value of 
Bollinger's proposed golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger has promised city officials that although membership would be open to 
residents of Moorpark, "fees would easily be $30,000," Brown said. "That is not 
a substantial benefit to the city, that's a private golf course."

PARENTS OF MENTALLY ILL TAKE PLEA FOR FACILITY TO COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THE SUPERVISORS' APPROVAL IS NEEDED BEFORE WORK CAN BEGIN ON A 
LOW-COST RESIDENTIAL PROJECT.

<P>
Art Chapman's son had been an Eagle Scout and such a brilliant math student 
that he was allowed to skip freshman classes at the California Institute of 
Technology and start college as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"Now he throws rocks at police cars because he wants to tell people he's 
alive," said Chapman in a plea to the County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. 
"I'm here to tell you he is alive." 
</P>
<P>
But Duane Chapman, 29, is not well. He is a patient at the Camarillo State 
Hospital. And in a few months, when his schizophrenia abates, he will be 
released with nowhere to go when the voices that tell him he is a Nobel 
laureate physicist begin to return. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest fear of a parent of a schizophrenic child is that when he is 
dismissed he will start another cycle" of homelessness, despair and trouble 
with the police, said Chapman, whose dehydrated son was found near death in a 
Fresno field last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Chapman has been in and out of mental facilities 12 times in a decade, 
his father said. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman and a dozen other parents of mentally ill children attended the board 
meeting to lobby for $600,000 that would be the county's share of a proposed 
$4.5-million low-cost housing project near the Camarillo hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The Lewis Road project would have 50 three-bedroom condominiums that could 
accommodate 150 people, who could live there indefinitely. A 12-person team of 
mental health workers would have offices in the development's community center. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Shinn of Camarillo, who stood at a microphone before the supervisors with 
his arm around his 29-year-old stepson, Jeffrey Strom, told the board that a 
group of parents of Camarillo patients had worked three years to gain state 
land and federal money for the project. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a miracle happening," Shinn said in an interview. But without the 
county funding, he said, "all of our work will have been for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Construction must begin by January or $3.9 million in federal money will be 
lost. Construction bids must be requested at least by August to meet that 
deadline, county officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors, in a rebuke that has angered Supervisor John H. Flynn, refused 
on a 2-to-2 vote last week to earmark the money. Supervisors Madge L. Schaefer 
and Maggie Erickson argued that the $600,000 should not be awarded until after 
the project is balanced against others at budget hearings in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are considering the funding of this project along with a number of other 
projects," Schaefer said Tuesday after the parents' presentation. The need for 
a new jail is particularly pressing, Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said: "It isn't that I don't care about these people. It's just that I 
want to follow proper procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Flynn said he will press the issue with Supervisor James R. Dougherty, the 
swing vote on the project. Dougherty was sick last week when Flynn's motion was 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote a note to Jim this morning," Flynn said. "He wrote back that he needs 
the details. So I'm going out to his office on Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
Flynn said the county's delay in committing to the project might affect the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's view of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel we've got to give a signal that we're behind this 100%," Flynn 
said. "If we don't, I'm afraid the federal money will go someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
County officials who are working with HUD said that the federal agency's 
commitment is solid and that delaying the vote until after budget hearings in 
early August will not affect funding. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe there is a real threat," Mental Health Director Randall 
Feltman said. "In fact, it gives us time to prepare information for the 
supervisors. So far, the information to the board has been verbal." 
</P>
<P>
Feltman, whose department has worked with Flynn and the Camarillo parents for a 
year, said he will emphasize to the supervisors that the county has no 
long-term obligation to the development, which will be maintained by HUD. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a housing project," he said. "The security, the landscaping, the 
maintenance will all be handled by HUD." 
</P>
<P>
Tenants would pay about one-third of their $676 monthly state disability 
stipend for rent, Feltman said. The team of mental health workers, whose 
$1-million-a-year cost would be paid by the state, would be on call 24 hours a 
day, he said.

PRISONERS' WORK PROGRAM MAY GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County Jail inmates performed an estimated $2 million worth of work 
last year. On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors launched a program that could 
triple that production, putting even more prisoners to work in jail kitchens, 
laundries and vegetable gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The county already leads the state in the percentage of inmates involved in 
formal work programs, said Sheriff's Cmdr. Donald R. Lanquist. Some of the 
cattle raised by inmates wind up on the jail menu. 
</P>
<P>
As payment, the 400 of the county's 1,400 prisoners involved in the program are 
able to reduce their sentences by one day for every six days worked. 
</P>
<P>
To expand the program, the supervisors ordered the Sheriff's Department to form 
a Jail Industries Task Force made up of representatives of business, labor and 
law-enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident we will expand the program. But at this point I can't say how 
large an expansion it will be," Lanquist said after the supervisors' meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be careful not to take jobs away from taxpayers. On the other hand, 
we feel the working inmate serves both himself and the taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors' Chairwoman Madge L. Schaefer supported the approach, declaring: 
"We've got 1,000 prisoners in that jail having three squares a day and watching 
TV all day. Let's get them off their bunks." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Maggie E. Erickson pointed out that Rod Miller, a specialist in 
inmate work programs who studied the county's program, found that the county 
uses nearly 650,000 hours of inmate labor annually. That could be increased as 
much as 1.3 million hours, according to Miller. JACK SEARLES

<P>
2 BROTHERS SURRENDER IN DEATH OF BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Thousand Oaks brothers, charged in the death of a 14-year-old boy they 
allegedly goaded into downing part of a bottle of whiskey, surrendered Tuesday 
night in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
David Campbell, 29, and Patrick Campbell, 23, gave themselves up to Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies about 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Arvie Sherman said the two men would be arraigned this morning in 
Malibu Municipal Court on manslaughter charges in the April 14 
alcohol-poisoning death of Leland Scovis, the youngest of a group of five 
teen-age boys the brothers were chaperoning on a camping trip at Leo Carrillo 
State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers were each charged Monday with one count of involuntary 
manslaughter, four counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor and four counts of 
contributing to the delinquency of a minor. 
</P>
<P>
Another chaperon, Priscilla Vernon, 21, of Newbury Park, surrendered with the 
brothers. She has been charged with being an accessory to involuntary 
manslaughter and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
The three were being in lieu of $5,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
Scovis collapsed about 15 minutes after he drank two to three inches of alcohol 
left in a gallon jug of whiskey. The brothers allegedly bet Scovis that he 
could not drink the alcohol without getting sick. Scovis became ill and was 
taken to a nearby hospital. He died two days later.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: BIG 5 FINED $125,000 FOR FALSE ADVERTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County Superior Court judge has levied $125,000 in fines against the 
Big 5 Sporting Goods Store chain for falsely advertising cheaply made, 
imitation brand-name running shoes as the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Edwin M. Osborne also signed an injunction forbidding the chain from 
further acts of misleading advertising and unfair competition, and from trying 
to pass off the imitations as the genuine shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph R. Buckalew said the chain agreed as part of the 
judgment to stop the misleading shoe sales in all of its about 125 stores in 
California, Nevada and Washington state. Buckalew said Big 5 sold at least 
300,000 to 400,000 pairs of the imitation running shoes within the past three 
to four years. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne's ruling resulted from a civil suit filed by the Ventura County 
district attorney's office, which charged Big 5's parent company, United 
Merchandising Corp., with false advertising and unfair business practices. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney began investigating the shoe sales in June, 1988, when 
marathon runner Gary Tuttle, who owns a competing running shoe store, 
complained that the shoes Big 5 was selling seemed to be badly made. 
</P>
<P>
Big 5 had claimed that it was selling running shoes made by companies such as 
New Balance, Etonic and Saucony at discount prices. 
</P>
<P>
The shoes were made by those companies, but they were poorly manufactured 
reproductions of the companies' top-of-the-line shoes, Buckalew said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Big 5 sold a shoe advertised as the New Balance 660 for $19.99 
instead of the list price of $66.99. The real 660 had a plastic heel cup that 
braced the foot, but the copy sold by Big 5 had a flexible cardboard heel cup 
that gives a runner's foot little support. 
</P>
<P>
And the copy of the Etonic Alpha-I shoe, which sold for $19.99 instead of the 
original $62.99, had a rigid sole with a red line painted on its edge instead 
of the flexible sole of the real shoe, which had a red plastic heel support 
sandwiched into the sole. MACK REED

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: NAACP SEEKS REACTION TO BIAS CHARGE

<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter sent to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors this week, the 
county chapter of the NAACP has asked the board for a response to a county 
employee's complaints of racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by NAACP President John R. Hatcher III, alleges that Myra 
Kelley, a clerk who has worked for the county for 16 years, has been the victim 
of "an institutional form of racism that has perpetuated itself and no action 
has taken place to date" in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley, who is black, won a ruling last month from the federal Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, which found that the county retaliated against her 
because she filed a complaint with the EEOC. 
</P>
<P>
The commission report found that Kelley "was disciplined, denied promotion and 
returned to her previous position in retaliation for participation in protected 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
In her complaint, filed in 1985, Kelley said she was made to take written and 
physical examinations that no other county employees were required to take, and 
that she was denied a promotion even though she ranked first on a county 
eligibility test. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley, 45, of Oxnard, said she is awaiting a conciliation meeting with county 
and EEOC representatives to discuss the case. She said she is seeking 
reimbursement of about $15,000 in legal fees, a promotion to the position of 
personnel analyst and back pay. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel James L. McBride said it is not county policy to comment on 
personnel matters. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

HOUSING AGENCY DIRECTOR HONORED

<TEXT>
<P>
The director of a nonprofit housing agency in Saticoy has received a national 
United Way award for developing low-income housing for county residents. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Fernandez, director of the Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., was one 
of three people chosen to receive the annual award from a pool of more than 
1,200 United Way recipients. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. is one of the few recipients of United 
Way funds to use the money to develop low-income housing, said Sylvia Schopp, 
spokeswoman for the United Way of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this encourages other United Ways across the country to look more 
seriously at spending money on low-income housing," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, people in United Way have tended to look at housing as 
complicated and costly projects," Fernandez said. "Now we have shown that we 
can make their dollars work." 
</P>
<P>
The Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. manages 10 housing projects countywide 
and has developed more than 450 units. 
</P>
<P>
The corporation, which has been a member of United Way since 1987, receives 
about $50,000 a year from the agency. CAROLYN KUSKY

NEIGHBORS ASSAIL NEW ELECTRIC PLANT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new electric plant on Diaz Avenue in Oxnard prompted complaints Tuesday from 
neighboring business owners who said it has produced excessive noise and 
pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
Two business owners in northeast Oxnard asked the City Council to take action 
to regulate E.F. Oxnard Inc. Energy Facility, a cogeneration energy plant that 
opened last month. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McCulloch, who owns McCulloch Towing on East 5th Street, told the council 
that the plant on Diaz Avenue has been producing excessive noise in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even hear the phone ring in my own office," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, when the plant began its start-up phase, steam pipes from the plant 
sprayed nearby businesses with a black, ash-like substance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plant operators paid to wash the substance off cars that were stored in the 
tow yard, McCulloch said. 
</P>
<P>
Another business owner who said he owns property behind the plant said the 
high-pitched noise from the plant made him ill. 
</P>
<P>
Plant Manager John Koerber apologized for the noise and told the council that 
the plant operators will try to address all the complaints.

PLANNERS ENDORSE SUBDIVISION PLAN

<P>
The Camarillo Planning Commission recommended Tuesday that the City Council 
approve the subdivision of a 31.51-acre tract at Upland Road and Terra Bella 
Lane. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Guyer is seeking to create 36 parcels for the development of 
single-family residences on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which has final say on whether the property is subdivided, will 
consider the issue June 13. Guyer would still be required to apply for building 
permits to develop the housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, the commission approved a plan allowing Oxnard-based TOLD 
Corp. to remodel a 310,000-square-foot building near Mission Oaks Boulevard and 
Dawson Drive. The decision allows at least three more tenants to use the 
building for offices, manufacturing and warehouse space. 
</P>
<P>
The building on the 38-acre site will include upgrading of the exterior to 
bring the appearance more in line with the city's Heritage Zone. Set up by the 
city, the zone requires an early California architectural style, including 
mission tile roofs and stucco walls. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also voted to allow Ventura Pacific Capital Corp. to build a 
two-story office building on the east side of Camarillo Springs Road, south of 
the Ventura Freeway. The commission agreed to allow the height of the building 
to be 48 feet -- 13 feet higher than the usual 35-foot limit -- to allow for 
additional architectural features, such as two Mediterranean-style towers. RUSS

DELIBERATIONS BEGIN IN GANG SLAYING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The fate of a former gang member, on trial for murder in Ventura County 
Superior Court, was turned over to a jury Tuesday after attorneys tried to cast 
doubt on each other's witnesses during closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Arnel Salagubang, 20, a former member of a Filipino gang called the Satanas, is 
accused of fatally shooting Manuel (Deadeye) Rodriguez, 20, who allegedly 
belonged to a rival Latino gang called the Lemonwood Chiques. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated for three hours Tuesday afternoon before retiring. 
Deliberations are scheduled to resume this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have testified that Salagubang used a single-shot, .22-caliber 
derringer to shoot Rodriguez, who had taunted members of the Satanas with 
anti-Asian slurs and yelled his gang name at them. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. James Ellison told jurors, "Arnel Salagubang showed to his 
fellow gang members that he had what it takes to be a veterano . . . Arnel 
Salagubang cold-bloodedly executed Manuel Rodriguez." 
</P>
<P>
Ellison said most of the witnesses corroborated testimony by key prosecution 
witness Jesse Cortinas. 
</P>
<P>
Cortinas, a 17-year-old Satanas member, testified that he gave the gun to 
Salagubang, who then shot Rodriguez outside Channel Islands High School on Nov. 
22 for insulting and challenging the Satanas. 
</P>
<P>
Cortinas agreed to testify against Salagubang in exchange for escaping an adult 
murder trial. He pleaded guilty to murder in juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
But Willard P. Wiksell, Salagubang's court-appointed attorney, attacked 
Cortinas' testimony, saying Cortinas would only serve 14 months for a murder 
conviction in juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
"If the crime of murder or voluntary manslaughter was committed by anyone, then 
Jesse Cortinas was an accomplice by law," Wiksell said. "The law says that the 
testimony of an accomplice ought to be viewed with distrust. He has a motive to 
lie." 
</P>
<P>
Wiksell also said Ellison presented no independent witnesses to testify that 
Salagubang shot Rodriguez. And he noted the testimony of two bus drivers, who 
said they did not see Salagubang's car leave the scene after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"But let's assume that you believe Mr. Salagubang is the shooter," Wiksell 
added. Salagubang could have feared for his life and shot Rodriguez, who was 
known to carry a gun and appeared to be reaching under his car seat just before 
the shooting, Wiksell said. That would support a manslaughter verdict, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys, however, showed jurors a Styrofoam mannequin head penetrated by a 
metal rod, which the coroner's office used to demonstrate the path of the 
bullet. Wiksell argued that the bullet's angle showed that Rodriguez was 
reaching under the seat before he was shot, while Ellison said it showed 
Rodriguez was looking out his car window and arguing with Salagubang.

<P>
K.C. Jones took over as coach of the Seattle SuperSonics as Bernie Bickerstaff 
became vice president of basketball operations Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bickerstaff, 46, gave up his coaching position with a year left on a five-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us about eight seconds to decide that K.C. was the guy to take over 
Bernie's job," club President Bob Whitsitt said. Jones had been an assistant 
coach under Bickerstaff. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1987-88 season, when he coached the Boston Celtics, Jones, 57, said 
he did not plan to return to coaching. However, he said he missed coaching more 
than he had expected.

SOVIET FIGHTERS EARN RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Red Invasion did not exactly take San Diego by storm Tuesday night, but 
four Soviet fighters did seem to earn the respect of the announced crowd of 
2,100 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Three Soviets won impressively and the other was beaten on a split decision. 
The heavy pro-American crowd cheered for the Soviets after their bouts, but not 
during them. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the most impressive and by far the most advanced of the Soviet 
professionals, was lightweight Sergei Artemiev, who knocked out Robert Olivera 
of San Diego in 1:45 of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Artemiev (3-0) floored Olivera (2-5) with a straight-right hand and then 
finished him off seconds later with a wicked right. 
</P>
<P>
"He has that natural leverage," said Tommy Gallagher, who trains the Soviet 
boxers. "I'm pleased with the win, but we really didn't see anything tonight in 
the opponent. It just tells me we made the right decision on our style of 
opponent." 
</P>
<P>
Junior welterweight Igor Ruznikov was the least experienced and least 
impressive. In his six-round split decision loss to Ramona Zavala of Los 
Angeles, Ruznikov became the first Soviet professional to lose a pro fight. But 
in Ruznikov's defense, he was only fighting his third pro bout, while Zavala, 
32, had won 11 of his 14 fights. 
</P>
<P>
"He's fighting a guy who's a 10-round fighter," said Lou Falcigno, the Soviets' 
manager. "(Ruznikov) should not have been in the ring with him. That's my 
fault." 
</P>
<P>
Zavala compared Ruznikov's awkward style to that of "an old-fashioned boxer." 
</P>
<P>
"They need some more experience in pro boxing," Zavala said. "That style is 
better for amateur boxing." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet heavyweight Yuri Vaulin has also been criticized for his amateurish 
style, but he proved to Joey Parker that he also has some substance. 
</P>
<P>
Although he hurt his right hand in the second round, Vaulin (5-0) dominated all 
six rounds of his lopsided fight with Parker (13-8), who has had 15 more pro 
fights and outweighed Vaulin by 11 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Vaulin never did get inside against Parker, but he didn't need to. He did 
enough damage from the outside. Once in the third round, Vaulin, who never had 
gone more than three rounds, threw about 20 unanswered punches before Parker 
even reacted. Then in the fourth round, Parker was knocked down by a flurry of 
body punches. 
</P>
<P>
"For only five pro fights, (Vaulin) looked like he's been around for a while," 
Falcigno said. "He got whacked a couple times, but it didn't seem to faze him." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher said he was also impressed with Vaulin's showing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great step up for him," Gallagher said. "I'm beginning to understand 
his style and his moves more." 
</P>
<P>
But Gallagher said he would have liked to see his heavyweight keep Parker on 
the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
"Yuri doesn't know how to finish yet, but once he does, he'll be OK," Gallagher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The first Soviet to win was middleweight Victor Egorov (3-0), who disposed of 
Tyrone King (1-2) of Richmond, Calif., in just 2:13. 
</P>
<P>
In the only 10-round bout, San Diego's Tony 'Bazooka" DeLuca was stopped on 
cuts by Jose Quirino of Tijuana at 1:13 of the second round. DeLuca (17-4-3) 
was knocked down in the first round and cut above the eye in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
DeLuca, who lost his last fight to Michael Carbajal on a unanimous decision, 
claimed he was butted by Quirino.

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN NFL IS CALLED EXTINCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pro football will resume without a collective bargaining agreement when 
training camps open in July, representatives of the players said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the NFL's fourth year without such an agreement, and, they said, it 
is unlikely that there will ever be one again. 
</P>
<P>
"Individual bargaining is the wave of the future in major league sports -- as 
baseball and basketball have proved," Tom De Paso, an NFL Players Assn. 
attorney, said from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Former wide receiver Randy Vataha, now a sports agent with Bob Woolf's agency 
in Boston, predicted that there will be no new agreement for at least the 
duration of Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski's pending suit against the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Eighth Circuit) Court decision in the Powell case last fall put the 
players' union out of business," Vataha said. "The court held that, regardless 
of whether there's a player-owner bargaining agreement, the league's antitrust 
labor exemption will last as long as there's a union. That gave the NFLPA no 
choice but to decertify." 
</P>
<P>
It decertified last November. But it did not quit. Seemingly as strong as ever, 
the NFLPA is now doing business as a union that is not a union -- representing 
the players as a professional association. 
</P>
<P>
In the landmark Powell case, which is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, 
various judges have ruled both for and against the NFL's club owners since 
October of 1987. That is when former player Marvin Powell sued the NFL, 
alleging flagrant antitrust violations in matters ranging from the player draft 
to the right of free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski, in association with Freeman McNeil of the New York Jets and six 
other players, is also seeking free agency in a suit filed last month in 
federal court in Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all the players who have heard my cause are glad I'm doing this," said 
Majkowski, who attained stardom last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to change something that I believe is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the Powell and Majkowski cases is that the NFL has been 
tying Powell to an agreement made by a union. 
</P>
<P>
"In the (Majkowski) case, the (NFLPA) is no longer a bargaining agent," 
Majkowski's lawyer, James Quinn, said from New York, adding that the NFL has 
thereby lost its antitrust shield. Quinn will first oppose the NFL in a hearing 
June 11 at Newark. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation throughout the league that the NFLPA's executive 
director, Gene Upshaw, has pledged not to participate in collective bargaining 
discussions with any league representative until the courts have ruled on 
Majkowski's status. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't participate if I wanted to," Upshaw said. "We aren't a union 
anymore. We aren't a bargaining agent." 
</P>
<P>
Could that change? 
</P>
<P>
Said Quinn: "I've seen the NFLPA's new bylaws. They flatly prohibit the 
association from participating in collective bargaining." 
</P>
<P>
In Vataha's view, the courts have already carried the NFLPA to a point of no 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"The Powell decision is much more powerful than most people realize," he said. 
"What it means is that the players are free as long as they don't have a union. 
</P>
<P>
"If they turn around now and sign a new collective agreement -- even if it's a 
good one -- they'll be a union again, and they'll have lost what they've 
gained." 
</P>
<P>
Many NFL owners are still pressing for the collective agreement they need to 
extend the draft beyond 1992 -- they will discuss it again at a Dallas meeting 
next week -- but as a group, they remain divided. 
</P>
<P>
The players are not united, either, although most have been disappointed by the 
results of past collective agreements.

MELVIN DURSLAG: FOR CLIENT'S HAPPINESS, MOORE IS BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Melvin Durslag 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A contender, he says, for the world's heavyweight championship, George Foreman, 
42, expresses pity for those untraveled critics unable to see him as a major 
force in the line of work he pursues. 
</P>
<P>
George dispatches that word here through his emissary and priest of punch, 
Archie Moore, former light-heavyweight champion and renowned as the artist who 
knocked down Rocky Marciano in a fight for the heavyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
Archie did it in the second round with a matchless inside right, and he argues 
to this day that if the referee hadn't given Rocky more time than he had 
coming, Archie would have left the scene with the treasure. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been the jewel heist of the century," he reflects. "And it would 
have been pulled off by one reported to be 39." 
</P>
<P>
Archie is tentative about the age, considering he always claimed he was born in 
Collinsville, Ill., in 1916, while his mother claimed he was born in Benoit, 
Miss., in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
It always has been one of humanity's most intriguing discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mama was right," says Archie, "I would have been 42 when I fought Rocky, 
strengthening the point that my client, George Foreman, and I are making today. 
George is not too old to render into unconsciousness any opponent." 
</P>
<P>
Archie ponders this thought a moment, then adds: 
</P>
<P>
"And you better believe there is no opponent right now the quality of Rocky 
Marciano. Yet at roughly George's age, I came close to rendering Rocky into 
unconsciousness with one punch. Casey Stengel used to say, 'Look it up.' " 
</P>
<P>
"What about the shape of Foreman?" the skeptic responds. "He weighs 260." 
</P>
<P>
"Football players weigh that much," Archie answers. "They used to weigh 215. 
And why do they now weigh 260? Because they feel more secure at 260. Same with 
a heavyweight fighter." 
</P>
<P>
It is Moore's dispassionate view that weight doesn't hurt a fighter as much as 
the changing of weights. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreman doesn't have to endure what I did," Archie says. "I fought Nino Valdes 
at 196. The following month, I scaled down to 173 1/2 to defend my 
light-heavyweight title against Bobo Olson." 
</P>
<P>
"Tell the folks what happened." 
</P>
<P>
"I rendered Olson into unconsciousness in three. Then, three months later, I 
shot up to 186 3/4 against Marciano." 
</P>
<P>
"And he rendered you into unconsciousness." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but it wasn't until the ninth round. And that was after I had decked him 
and suffered from weight changes. But Foreman has weighed 250 or more for 
years. He has a happy body. He suffers no guilt at the table when he indulges, 
which means he has a happy mind, too." 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, we came upon Foreman in the dining room the night before his title 
fight against Ken Norton. We stuck out a hand. He let it hang. We stuck it out 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"I never shake when I'm eating," he announced. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed, however, he could have shifted the fork to his left hand and shaken 
with his right, but it would have interrupted the flow.

<P>
At his home in Texas, Foreman currently is training for a June 16 match in Las 
Vegas against Adilson Rodrigues, billed as heavyweight champion of most of 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
"What parts of the continent does he rule?" Archie is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"He's from Brazil, so he must rule Brazil. I think he also rules as far north 
as the Orinoco and he has Peru and Ecuador, but I'm not sure he is recognized 
by the Indians of Bolivia." 
</P>
<P>
"Would you say he is formidable?" 
</P>
<P>
"He has an imposing record of 33-3, but I can say, without fear of rebuttal, 
that George will render him into unconsciousness, earning a shot at the 
heavyweight title held by Buster Douglas of Columbus, Ohio, where, in 228 
fights, I never appeared." 
</P>
<P>
"How much help are you giving Foreman?" Archie is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"George is pretty self-sustaining," he responds. "But I am helping him with his 
foot-speed." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the way he takes nourishment, George already has hand-speed. 
</P>
<P>
"I also offer navigational tips," continues Archie. "Texas is a flatland, with 
hills not known to many. George likes to train in hills. It is my job to tell 
him where hills can be found." 
</P>
<P>
And is Archie sure that George is a serious combatant? 
</P>
<P>
"People who fought Marciano developed heart palpitations," he replies. "At one 
point, I think my heart stopped for three minutes. But there are no Marcianos 
around now. Anything around I think George can render into unconsciousness."

CHEVALIER TO PLAY FOR NORTHRIDGE; 
</P>
<P>
SIGNINGS: BASKETBALL TEAM LANDS CLEVELAND HIGH POINT GUARD, SKYLINE COLLEGE 
FORWARD; VENTURA COLLEGE'S EGGERT TO JOIN BASEBALL TEAM. 
</P>

Andre Chevalier, the spark plug who ignited the high-octane offense of the 
Cleveland High basketball team, was among three athletes who recently signed 
letters of intent to attend Cal State Northridge, the school announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Troy leBlanc, a 6-foot-6, 205-pound forward from Skyline College in Oakland, 
also signed to play basketball at Northridge. David Eggert, a pitcher and 
outfielder from Ventura College, committed to play baseball for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier, a 5-foot-11, 155-pound point guard, averaged 8.5 points and seven 
assists a game last season in guiding Cleveland to a 21-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very aggressive and a tenacious defender who sees the court well," said 
Pete Cassidy, Northridge's basketball coach. "And he knows how to win." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Chevalier could be invaluable to the Matadors, who finished 12-15 
in their last season in NCAA Division II. 
</P>
<P>
"Starting up, it's hard for everybody," Chevalier said. "We're just going to 
have to work that much harder." 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Chevalier gives Northridge a trio of point guards. Senior 
Eugene Humphrey and junior Andre Henry split time at the position last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt in need of a point guard at the freshman level and we think Andre 
Chevalier is good enough and mentally tough enough to come in and get some 
quality playing time his first year," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier said the chance to contribute as a freshman weighed heavily in his 
choice of Northridge over UC Davis and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, both Division 
II schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be an exciting time to be involved with that program as it enters 
its first year in Division I," said Marc Paez, Chevalier's coach at Cleveland. 
"I think it's a good opportunity for him." 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier is the third Cavalier basketball player to accept a Division I 
scholarship this season. Trent Cornelius (Washington) and Eddie Hill 
(Washington State) are both bound for the Pacific 10 Conference. Bobby McRae 
signed earlier this month with Division II Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge has signed 10 basketball players -- six from junior colleges and 
four out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc's role will be to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
He was second in the Coast Conference in rebounding with an average of 11 a 
game. He also averaged 14 points, scoring most often from inside the key. 
</P>
<P>
Eggert is the second player signed by Northridge baseball Coach Bill Kernen. 
</P>
<P>
The former Ventura High standout batted .313 with five home runs and 26 runs 
batted in this season. 
</P>
<P>
At Northridge, Eggert is expected to pitch and play in the outfield. At Ventura 
this season, he appeared in 22 games and won three of eight decisions. 
</P>
<P>
In 43 1/3 innings, Eggert, a left-hander, struck out 44, but he also allowed 49 
hits and 24 walks.

A PASTIME FOR ALTAR EGOS ; 
</P>
<P>
QUEEN OF ANGELS IS IN THE BUSINESS OF TURNING OUT PRIESTS, BUT IN THE PROCESS 
THE MISSION HILLS SCHOOL HAS MANAGED TO WIN A BASEBALL LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a Wednesday afternoon and the five seniors on the Queen of Angels High 
baseball team are missing from practice again. But Coach Tom Murry has no plans 
to discipline the players. After all, one of those boys might someday be his 
priest. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the players have a good excuse. What coach -- especially a 
God-fearing, church-going Roman Catholic such as Murry -- could reject this 
explanation: "Sorry about missing practice, Coach, but I was out doing God's 
work." 
</P>
<P>
The seniors at Queen of Angels in Mission Hills fan throughout the community on 
Wednesdays performing apostolic work such as catechism instruction at Catholic 
elementary schools. That might be an unusual way for a teen-ager to spend a 
weekday afternoon, but when considering Queen of Angels, one grows accustomed 
to the uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year all-boys' school is more than just one of the area's only 
boarding schools, it's the largest high school seminary west of the 
Mississippi. Students endure an arduous daily schedule that begins at 7 a.m. 
with morning prayers, ends 15 hours later with evening prayers and leaves 
nearly no time in between for the devil to exploit idle hands. 
</P>
<P>
The school, which sits on 40 well-groomed acres adjacent to the San Fernando 
Mission, is a training ground for future priests. But that doesn't mean the 
school's baseball team turns the other cheek on the diamond. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels carry a .372 batting average, average nearly 10 runs a game and have 
waged their own crusade through the Liberty League. The Angels posted a 12-0 
league mark and will bring a 12-4 overall record into the first round of the 
Southern Section Small Schools Division playoffs that begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Queen of Angels competes interscholastically only in baseball, but given the 
positive impact the team has had on campus life, Father Al Burnham, the 
school's principal, may consider reviving the track and basketball programs 
that were scrapped in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"The baseball team is great for the whole school," he said while watching the 
Angels beat Oakwood in a recent league game. "It's a great morale builder. It 
gives us a chance to meet other kids from other schools and that interaction is 
good. Some fellows have a lot of talent and we want them to develop that as 
well as their spiritual life." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the school's interest in athletics, it's unlikely that Queen of Angels 
will start stealing top players from other schools. Burnham realizes that the 
rigorous, Spartan program at his school is a tough sell. Still, the campus 
abounds with converts. 
</P>
<P>
"You get past the strict stuff pretty fast," said Bernardo Osuna, a senior 
outfielder from Pasadena. "All the masks go down pretty soon and you get to 
know a person for who they are. You learn that there are more important things 
in life than free dress." 
</P>
<P>
Students are given only a few elective subjects from which to choose and are 
given no choice about dress. They are allowed to go home on weekends and are 
encouraged to maintain active social lives (Yes, dating is permitted.), but on 
campus their lives revolve around the classroom and chapel. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, enrollment stands at 132 and has hovered near the 150 mark for the 
past five years. The school draws from throughout Southern California and 
enrollment reflects the region's Catholic population: About 50% of the students 
are Latinos and 25% are Anglo. Southeast Asians and Filipino account for an 
additional 15%. 
</P>
<P>
The school opened for the 1953-54 school year and enrollment peaked in the 
mid-1960s at more than 400. Nearly half of all applicants are rejected and 
those who gain acceptance face a tough academic load and a strict regimen for 
the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
And that's only the beginning. Queen of Angels is the first step in a 
three-tiered process leading to the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of its graduates enroll at St. John's College in Camarillo, a 
seminary sponsored by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. After four years of 
undergraduate work, students may apply to the graduate school, which offers a 
four-year program that culminates in ordination. 
</P>
<P>
Students claim they are not pressured to pursue the priesthood, and only about 
8% to 10% of the school's graduates complete the process and become priests. 
But that's a batting average the church leadership accepts. 
</P>
<P>
"Even those who don't persevere to the priesthood have a strong connection to 
the church throughout their lives," Burnham said. "They often take leadership 
roles as laymen and work on other ministries such as parish councils." 
</P>
<P>
Senior pitcher Steve Steger, who said he is not interested in the priesthood, 
may move into the lay ministry in the future. Steger, a 6-foot-1, 195-pound 
right-hander, attended a Catholic grade school in West Los Angeles and dreamed 
of playing football at Loyola. But when he was invited to attend a retreat at 
Queen of Angels, he felt a tug. 
</P>
<P>
Steger comes from a religious family; his father is a lifelong Roman Catholic 
and his mother was raised in Thailand as a Buddhist before converting to 
Catholicism soon after she married. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of being a priest was in my mind and the discipline at the school 
appealed to me," Steger said. "I was into a lot of wild stuff when I was in the 
eighth grade and I knew that if I went to high school with about 4,000 other 
wild guys it would have been crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Steger floundered his first year and thought about leaving. Baseball 
helped turn him into a true believer. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play as a freshman and went out for the team as a sophomore," he 
said. "Baseball made me start liking the school. But it was the school and the 
friends I made that kept me here." 
</P>
<P>
That's a common theme among students. As a group, they appear more mature, calm 
and focused than the average high school student, and they speak about 
themselves as though introspection were a required course. 
</P>
<P>
Steger credits the school with affording him the opportunity for 
self-discovery. To demonstrate the point, he alludes to the secluded nature of 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one entrance here, only one way in," he said. "We're closed off 
and there aren't many outside forces. You have time to learn about yourself. At 
other schools, you might be thinking about girls, or drugs or which friends to 
make. Here, you're kept busy and you concentrate on what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
If you wander from the path, there's always a friend to guide you back. If 
friendships are made quickly here, and connections run deep, necessity could be 
the cause. Freshmen, away from home for the first time and thrown into a 
demanding environment, need support wherever they can find it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came here the transition was tough," Osuna said. "When something 
went wrong I wished I had my dad to talk to. But then you get to know these 
guys and you open up to them." 
</P>
<P>
Still, these Angels aren't always angels, according to Murry, a second-year 
coach. He's a walk-on coach who arrives at school each day from the General 
Motors plant in Van Nuys, driving the 1974 Pontiac GTO that he watched roll off 
the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
Murry, 42, is a 1965 Alemany graduate who was introduced to Queen of Angels 
through his mother, who worked as a bookkeeper at the school. He understands he 
is dealing with a special type of student but often loses sight of that while 
watching the team practice. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are a lot better behaved than most kids, but they can be just as 
rowdy and crazy as any other kids," he said. "I have to sit on them sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
He also has to keep his ears open -- in two languages, if that's possible. 
Apparently, the Third Commandment occasionally takes the afternoon off. "A lot 
of these guys speak Spanish and I sometimes hear them take the Lord's name in 
vain or swear at an umpire in Spanish," Murry said. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the Angels are not immune to frustration, and sometimes they direct 
it at the school. Senior pitcher Danny Herold is the team's pitching ace, a 
6-foot, 160-pound right-hander with a 7-2 record and 2.13 earned-run average. 
He was drawn to Queen of Angels by his uncle, Mike Crowley, who runs the 
school's afternoon intramural athletics program. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball runs in Herold's bloodlines. Crowley pitched for two years at USC and 
was a member of the school's 1963 national championship team. Crowley's father, 
Dan, scouted for the Yankees after completing a career in the minor leagues 
that included membership on the Hollywood Stars teams in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, not the priesthood, is Herold's priority, and he sometimes wonders 
about his decision to attend Queen of Angels. The Angels play on the periphery 
of the area sports scene at the lowest competitive level in the Southern 
Section. He also feared that a member of a seminary school team would be 
subjected to merciless abuse from bench jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that we'd get teased as holy boys, like we were almost girls or a 
softball team, but that hasn't happened at all," he said. "But I thought a lot 
about going to another school, a bigger one that would enhance my chances of 
playing baseball after high school. I think there are more advantages to 
playing at a bigger school." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Herold returned for his senior year at Queen of Angels and brought few 
regrets with him. In fact, he credits the school with his improvement as a 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I've grown from the discipline here, especially on the pitcher's mound," he 
said. "It can be rough out there and you're all by yourself. I have a temper 
and can get down on myself. But I've learned that when things go wrong, you 
have to realize that it's not your fault. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I have regrets about coming here as far as baseball goes. But as 
far as friendships and getting a good education, I'm glad I came here." 
</P>
<P>
Chalk up one more Queen of Angels convert.

GRANADA HILLS, TAFT DOMINATE CITY GOLF TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call it optimism, the same kind of hopefulness that makes a guy break out a new 
golf ball on a bedeviling hole, buy a new set of clubs every other year or camp 
out all night at the pro shop on the outside chance that a tee time will be 
available at dawn's early light. 
</P>
<P>
When the organizers of the City Section golf championships drew up the leader 
board before the tournament Tuesday, they placed 70 at the top of the list and 
left plenty of room for names of those players who would equal that torrid 
number. 
</P>
<P>
Wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto with 71, 72, 73. . . . you get the idea. Only six players broke 80 at 
Griffith Park's Harding Course, and only one broke 75. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers aren't exactly low, are they?" said Tony Bordwell of El Camino 
Real High, who is in a three-way tie for second after shooting a four-over-par 
76. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Nielsen, a junior from Eagle Rock, birdied the first and 18th holes en 
route to a two-over 74, far and away the day's most consistent round. Nielsen, 
who works in the Griffith Park pro shop and whose team plays its home matches 
on Harding, is seeking to become the second consecutive Eagle Rock player to 
win the individual title. 
</P>
<P>
The team competition was close -- that is, for two teams. Granada Hills (417) 
and defending champion Taft (418) are the overwhelming favorites to advance to 
the California Interscholastic Federation-Southern California Golf Assn. finals 
June 11 at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. The low 10 individuals, in 
addition to the low two teams, advance. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham, led by the play of twins Yasu and Aki Amaya -- who fired 78 and 79, 
respectively -- is third at 442. Also making the team cut in the 36-hole event 
are El Camino Real (443), Monroe (446), Grant (453), Eagle Rock (454), 
Chatsworth (461), Marshall (466), Palisades (468) and North Hollywood (469). 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen and Bordwell, who placed third individually last year, will be grouped 
in today's first foursome with Josh Oring of Granada Hills and Young Nam of 
Marshall, both of whom shot 76. 
</P>
<P>
Today's round will be played on the Wilson Course, which is rated two strokes 
harder than Harding and is 454 yards longer. Catching Nielsen, who at 6-foot-3 
and 185 pounds is the largest player in the tournament, might not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Wilson even better," Nielsen said. "Long courses don't bother me much." 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills' position is no upset. Earlier this season, the Highlanders 
snapped a Taft streak of 93 league wins in a row. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Oring, Granada Hills was led by Kevin Kurhajec (81) and Kelly 
Brockway (84).

CHATSWORTH MAKES AN IMPRESSION ON WAY TO VOLLEYBALL TITLE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NAOMI TWARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not uncommon for team members to let their hair grow until they win a 
championship. But at Chatsworth High, the boys' volleyball team is starting a 
new tradition: haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
Weird haircuts -- with numbers, arrows and squiggly lines shaved into some of 
the players' hair. Others have close trims. 
</P>
<P>
"For inspiration," said middle blocker Gene Urcan, who sports a vertical arrow 
with the tip pointed down on the back of his head. "We're getting into the 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Chatsworth (14-2) certainly played with spirit Tuesday, defeating 
visiting Palisades in the City Section 4-A Division semifinals, 15-10, 12-15, 
15-4, 15-13. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth, the defending City 4-A champion, will play third-seeded Taft (13-1) 
in the final at Pepperdine on Friday night. Taft's only loss came against 
Chatsworth, which won in five games. 
</P>
<P>
"More than anything, we wanted this match," Chatsworth's Ryan Labovitch said. 
"It was the most emotional match we've ever played." 
</P>
<P>
Senior outside hitter Mike Nash led the way with 17 kills and six blocks. 
Labovitch had 15 kills. 
</P>
<P>
"They are team leaders both emotionally and physically," Chatsworth Coach Steve 
West said. "They definitely have a boosting effect." 
</P>
<P>
After taking a 12-6 lead in the second game, however, the Chancellors 
temporarily lost momentum, allowing fourth-seeded Palisades to score nine 
unanswered points to even the match. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 14-13, in the fourth game, Chatsworth wasted three chances to earn the 
final point. Twelve minutes later, Palisades returned a shot out of bounds, 
giving the Chancellors their first win over Palisades in three meetings this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"They hit the ball much harder and quicker than they did earlier this season," 
Palisades Coach Howard Enstedt said. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades played a strong passing game. Sophomore John Lee had 26 digs and 
senior Brady Nathan added 18 digs. But the Dolphins had problems hitting over 
the Chancellors' blocking wall. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth's Craig Hewitt had 12 blocks and eight kills and Urcan had nine 
blocks and nine kills. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance that you go to (the finals)," said Urcan. 
"We're going to Pepperdine and we're going to win the City (championship)."

DIGEST: WSC PICKS HEGGEN AS TOP PLAYER IN SOFTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark College's Jamie Heggen was chosen Western State Conference softball 
Player of the Year and teammate Robin Thomas was named the conference's top 
pitcher in voting by coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Heggen, a freshman center fielder, also was a first-team all-state selection of 
the California Community College Softball Coaches' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Heggen batted .488 in conference play and led WSC players in hits, runs (19), 
runs batted in (14), home runs (three) and steals (18) in conference play. She 
batted .393 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, also a freshman, was 12-1 with an 0.48 earned-run average in conference 
play. She was a second-team all-state selection. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Missy Cress, Audra Olive and Melissa Maples were chosen for the WSC 
first team, as were Jill Greenwood of Canyons and Karin Knoop of Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Olive also was named to the all-state second team. 
</P>
<P>
Becca Berline, a two-time All-Southern Section pitcher from Notre Dame High, 
has signed a letter of intent with UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Berline is 15-8 this season with 157 strikeouts in 167 innings and an 0.29 ERA. 
In her career at Notre Dame, she is 67-27 with 725 strikeouts in 665 innings 
pitched. 
</P>
<P>
USC junior utility player Jeff Cirillo and UCLA sophomore outfielder Joe Wolfe, 
who played at Valley high schools, were chosen to the All-Pacific 10 Conference 
baseball team, the league said. 
</P>
<P>
Cirillo played at Providence and Wolfe, whose .382 batting average is third in 
the Pac-10, played at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe also is second in the conference with 30 stolen bases.

<P>
The City Section first-round baseball playoff game between Monroe and host 
University that was scheduled for Friday has been rescheduled for Thursday at 3 
p.m. because of a scheduling conflict at University. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real High players Bobby Kim, Ryan McGuire and Pat Treend will share 
the West Valley League's MVP award after a vote by league coaches. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire (6-1, 2.10 ERA) and Treend (10-0, 1.29) formed the City Section's top 
pitching combination for El Camino Real (18-2-1), which won the league title 
with a 15-1-1 record. McGuire also batted .329 with 23 runs batted in and a 
team-high five home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Treend has a team-high 24 RBIs to go with a .365 average. Kim, a senior 
catcher, is batting .375 and has driven in 23 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Dickmann, Chris Pippins and Ted Hollahan were recognized as the top 
senior athletes at Cal State Northridge during an awards banquet Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dickmann, who is expected to be named an NCAA Division II softball All-American 
for the fourth time, is 102-20 with 73 shutouts in her Northridge career. 
</P>
<P>
Pippins and Hollahan shared the award for top senior male athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Pippins placed second to junior teammate Kevin Hendrix in the 100 and the 200

UC Riverside. He has run the 100 in 10.52 seconds and the 200 in 20.98 
(wind-aided) this season. 
</P>
<P>
Hollahan set Division II swimming records in the 100- and 200-yard freestyle 
events in 1988. He was second in the 200-yard event this spring in the national 
meet and third in the 100. 
</P>
<P>
Thurlow Rogers of Van Nuys who at one point was in 126th place in the $300,000 
Tour de Trump, finished America's richest cycling race in 17th. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers completed the 1,107-mile race, which concluded Sunday, in 45 hours 40 
minutes 8 seconds, 19:59 behind winner Raul Alcala of Mexico. Rogers was 52nd 
in the event's final stage, a 108.5-mile road race from Northampton, Mass. to 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
He earned $1,450 for his overall finish and shared in the $1,500 his seven-man 
Subaru-Montgomery team received for its fifth-place finish in the team 
standings.

<P>
Harry Rudolph III of La Jolla shot a six-under-par 65 at the Los Serranos Golf 
and Country Club in Chino Tuesday to lead the 79th Southern California 
qualifying for next month's state amateur championship. 
</P>
<P>
The final round of the 36-hole event will be played today. 
</P>
<P>
The top 100 golfers from Tuesday's opening field of 400 made it into the second 
round and the top 43 from that field will qualify for the championship, which 
begins June 25 at Cypress Point Golf Club on the Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph, who plays for Oklahoma State, shot a 34 on the front side and a 31 on 
the back nine over the 6,292-yard, par-71 North Course at Los Serranos. 
</P>
<P>
A stroke behind Rudolph was Daniel Baker of Mission Viejo. At 67 were Chris 
Anderson of West Covina and Paul Mohler of Villa Park. Kevin Eden of Granada 
Hills shot a 68 and Mike Blum of Seal Beach, Trevor Jones of Pasadena and Paul 
Holtby of Simi Valley were at 69. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the field played on the tougher, 7,007-yard, par-74 South Course. They 
were led by Bob Imlay of San Diego, who shot a three-under 71. Craig Ballard of 
El Toro and Jim Myers of Oceanside had 72s and Kevin Claborn of Brea, Mike 
Bestor of Laguna Niguel and Scott Schweizer of Placentia were tied at 73. 
</P>
<P>
The players will switch courses for today's round. RICH TOSCHES

PREAKNESS; 
</P>
<P>
REVERSE OF FINISH IN DERBY WOULD RUIN BONUS PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Summer Squall-Unbridled 1-2 finish in Saturday's Preakness might balance the 
Triple Crown rivalry between the colts, but it would do nothing for the series' 
$1-million bonus and turn the Belmont Stakes into an anticlimax. 
</P>
<P>
Triple Crown sponsors and officials are supposed to be neutral, but privately 
they are hoping that the Preakness result doesn't turn out to be Summer Squall 
first and Unbridled second, which would be a reversal of their positions in the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
There's a $5-million payoff for the owners of any horse that wins the Triple 
Crown, but short of that, there's a $1-million bonus for the horse that runs in 
all three races and accumulates the most points based on a system that gives 
five points for a first place, three for a second and one for a third. 
</P>
<P>
If Summer Squall ran first at Pimlico Saturday and Unbridled finished second, 
each horse would have eight points. But since Cot Campbell, manager of the 
28-member syndicate that owns Summer Squall, has already announced that the 
colt will be skipping the Belmont on June 9, Unbridled would win the $1 million 
no matter where he finished in the third race. 
</P>
<P>
The $1 million has been in doubt before every Belmont since the bonus system 
started in 1987. Last year, Easy Goer, despite finishing second to Sunday 
Silence in both the Derby and the Preakness, still could have earned the $1 
million if (1) he won the Belmont and (2) Sunday Silence finished off the 
board. Easy Goer did win the Belmont, but Sunday Silence clinched the bonus by 
placing second. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the 1988 Belmont, Winning Colors, winner of the Derby and third in 
the Preakness, was tied, 6-6, with Risen Star, who was third in the Derby 
before winning the Preakness. Risen Star's owners received the $1 million when 
he romped home in the Belmont. Winning Colors finished last. 
</P>
<P>
The $1-million bonus, as well as the $5-million Triple Crown payoff, slipped 
away from Alysheba in 1987 after he won the Derby and the Preakness. Bet Twice, 
second in both of the first two races, won the Belmont to finish with 11 
points, as Alysheba missed third place in the Belmont by a neck and totaled 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Summer Squall winning and Unbridled running second in the Preakness would not 
be the ideal finish for us," said Ed Seigenfeld, executive director of Triple 
Crown Productions. "But that's only providing that Summer Squall doesn't run in 
the Belmont. I'm not so sure, with 28 owners to consider, that Cot Campbell 
wouldn't think again about running in the Belmont if the $1 million was at 
stake." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who made the Belmont decision last week after consulting with his 
trainer, Neil Howard, did not say that it is flexible. Campbell has not yet 
arrived in Baltimore, but at Pimlico Tuesday, after Summer Squall worked five 
furlongs in an excellent :59 4/5, Howard didn't sound like a trainer who was 
still considering the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
"We threw out the Belmont because of the Lasix thing -- that was the first 
thing we said -- and because it wouldn't be fair to the horse, who's had a 
tough schedule," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, who bled from the lungs during a workout at Gulfstream Park 
before he made his first start as a 3-year-old, has two victories and two 
seconds in four races this year, running each time while being treated with 
Lasix, a diuretic frequently given to bleeders. In New York, however, racing 
with medication is forbidden, and Summer Squall could not be treated with Lasix 
before the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the bleeding, Summer Squall missed some training and didn't make his 
first start this year until March 17. The Preakness will be the fourth tough 
race for the lightly built colt in seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse has been better to us than we have been to him," Howard said. "If we 
ran in the Belmont and won, they'd be saying we were geniuses. But if I had to 
go out to the eighth pole to pick up my horse that day, well, you can imagine 
what the (New York) Daily News would do with that." 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Triple Crown bonus is to encourage owners of the Kentucky 
Derby horses to come back for the Preakness and the Belmont. This year, 
however, only five horses from the Derby -- Unbridled (first), Summer Squall 
(second), Pleasant Tap (third), Land Rush (seventh) and Mister Frisky (eighth) 
-- are running in the Preakness, the smallest field since the bonus started. 
Six Derby horses returned in the 1987 Preakness; there were seven in '88, and 
six came back last year. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled's powerful stretch run in the Derby and his 3 1/2-length victory over 
Summer Squall doubtless contributed to the absence of several Derby horses from 
Pimlico. Even Howard is hard-pressed to suggest ways to turn the tables 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I carried Unbridled's silks (as a favor to trainer Carl Nafzger) in my 
suitcase when I came here from Kentucky," Howard said. "I thought about not 
turning them in (to Pimlico)." 
</P>
<P>
An imaginative scheme, but Howard knows, of course, that missing silks wouldn't 
stop Unbridled from running. Most tracks carry a set of plain silks in the 
event an owner's regular set isn't available. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled finished his preparations for the Preakness at Churchill Downs on 
Tuesday, working five furlongs in 1:00 2/5. Trainer Carl Nafzger said the colt 
is "right on schedule." Unbridled is due at Pimlico about noon today. . . . The 
fastest workout Tuesday at Pimlico was Pleasant Tap's :57 3/5. Trainer Chris 
Speckert said the work was much faster than he wanted but didn't think it would 
hurt Pleasant Tap's chances. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, who hasn't raced since he lost to Sunday Silence in the Breeders' 
Cup Classic last November, will face five horses today in the seven-furlong 
Gold Stage Stakes at Belmont Park. The race is supposed to be a prep for Easy 
Goer, who is scheduled to face Housebuster on May 28 in the Metropolitan Mile. 
</P>
<P>
Frances Genter, 92, the owner of Unbridled, is not expected to make the trip 
from Bloomington, Minn., to Baltimore for the Preakness. Genter is worn out 
from going to Louisville to see her colt win the Derby.

7 NORTHRIDGE PLAYERS ON ALL-CCAA TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Clayton of Cal State Northridge was named the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn.'s Pitcher of the Year while teammates Scott Sharts and Denny 
Vigo were selected to the all-conference first team. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the 39-member team announced Monday included seven players from Cal 
State Northridge, which tied for the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
But the sentiment around the Matador clubhouse a day later was that it was not 
nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, a sophomore right-hander who led the CCAA in victories with 12 and 
also batted .390, was bypassed in favor of UC Riverside's Pete Weber in 
player-of-the-year balloting by conference coaches. Weber, a senior, was among 
the conference leaders in runs batted in and batting average. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding college baseball player, there's no doubt about it," CSUN 
Coach Bill Kernen said. "But he's not the player of the year in this 
conference. Clayton just has to be. He hits .400 and leads the league in wins. 
I've never seen a guy do that before." 
</P>
<P>
Weber was among 10 Riverside players selected for the squad. Including Weber, 
the Highlanders had four players on the first team, four on the second and two 
honorable-mention picks. 
</P>
<P>
On the second team from Northridge was sophomore outfielder Greg Shockey, who 
batted .321, and pitcher Vale Lopez, who was 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
Receiving honorable mention from CSUN were Scott Richardson, a freshman second 
baseman, and Eric Johnson, a freshman outfielder. Riverside's Jack Smitheran 
was named coach of the year. Kernen, who took his team to a share of the title 
while starting four freshman and four sophomores, received two votes. MIKE

CLUTCH HIT BRINGS TITLE TO USDHS

<TEXT>
<P>
David Sanchez of USDHS, the county's second leading hitter, on the county's 
second-ranked team, hadn't had what you'd call a banner day. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Mission Bay made some great defensive plays, but nonetheless, in his 
first three at bats Sanchez flied to right, was intentionally walked and flied 
to left. 
</P>
<P>
We now join Sanchez in the bottom of the seventh, with USDHS trailing Mission 
Bay by a run at USD's Cunningham Field. There is one out. The bases are loaded. 
And reliever Tom LaFever and Sanchez, who is batting .406, have worked to a 
full count. 
</P>
<P>
On the line is the City Western League championship, which Mission Bay had won 
the past seven years. Mission Bay began the season 1-7, but surged and sat one 
game behind USDHS going into this league finale. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay Coach Dennis Pugh and LaFever chat briefly, then Sanchez digs his 
bat into a fastball, a single to left, and USDHS defeats Mission Bay, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
So was Sanchez, who upped his season RBI total to 42, a nervous wreck or what? 
</P>
<P>
"No, not in that kind of situation," he said. "I knew we could do it. I was 
confident. I was just thinking how our club has been hitting really good all 
year and that we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Said USDHS Coach Dick Serrano: "Technically, he's the leading hitter in the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, a junior, stressed that the victory is little more than a stepping 
stone to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an important game, but like coach says," said Sanchez, "we just have to 
take them one game at a time, play our hardest and take them one game at a 
time." 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, USDHS (24-4, 11-1) squirmed its way out of a league tie and 
won the title outright. Mission Bay (14-10, 9-3) finished two games out. Last 
year, Mission Bay won the league title with USDHS finishing one game back. 
</P>
<P>
"They played the way a championship team is supposed to play," said Pugh. "They 
didn't quit. They played like they knew they could do it." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Mission Bay thought it could too, and almost did. The Bucs jumped 
to an early 3-0 lead which USDHS quickly erased with a four-run third inning. 
In the fourth, Mission Bay scored three times, USDHS scored once, and the Bucs 
led, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
USDHS' Gavin Millay, who relieved Tom Shanner after 1 1/3 innings, gave up four 
runs and five hits and went two for four, including a double. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay starter Pat Betancourt gave up successive singles with one out in 
the seventh before Pugh pulled him. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: SANTANA CHASES 20TH CONSECUTIVE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA PALMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santana will compete for its 20th consecutive Grossmont League gymnastics 
championship Saturday at Mt. Miguel. Until this year, the 2-A and 3-A have been 
combined, but this year the meets will be held together but scored separately. 
</P>
<P>
Santana Coach Becca Webster said scoring the two leagues separately will be 
good for the teams involved because, she said, the stronger teams, including 
Santana, are in the 2-A. Webster said barring extenuating circumstances, her 
team should win the 2-A meet. 
</P>
<P>
"So far we've beaten everyone in our league so if we can stay together and 
compete the way we have been, we should win," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
Santana's top optional competitors are junior Dawn Cogar, sophomore Leslie 
Davis, senior Kim Canino and freshman Amy Vance. In the compulsories, Santana 
is led by senior Missy Meadows, junior Missy Moelter and sophomore Jennifer 
Blofsky. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, Santana has won the Section title 10 times (consecutively from 
'74-'78) and finished second five times. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, a 1986 Santana graduate and the Section gymnast of the year that year, 
has been on the coaching staff for four years and is in her second year as head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Crawford badminton team will go into Wednesday's Section team playoffs with 
hopes of capping two successive unbeaten seasons and wrapping up John King's 
six years as coach on a positive note. 
</P>
<P>
King, who also has been Crawford's basketball coach for 15 years, resigned from 
both positions two weeks ago to spend more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford (14-0), which has not lost a regular-season match the past two 
seasons, lost to Hoover, 11-6, in the Section final last year. 
</P>
<P>
This year King said his top-seeded team probably will be challenged by Serra 
for the title. Crawford defeated Hoover, 13-4, and Serra, 12-5, in the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover and Serra advanced to the tournament with 12-2 records. Hoover will be 
the second seed because it won the match between the two teams. Rounding out 
the top four is La Jolla (11-3). 
</P>
<P>
"We have better individuals from top to bottom than other teams," King said. 
"They are committed and they don't want to be second." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford's No. 1 and No. 2 boys' players are brothers, Khuong Thai and Tho 
Thai. Among the girls, Tammy Tran, the top student in the junior class with a 
grade-point average higher than 4.0, also is one the team's top players. 
</P>
<P>
"She's won two real tough matches recently," King said. "She's just a bulldog 
out there and won't quit. She's such a competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Negrete, a 1988 El Cajon Valley graduate, will return to his alma mater 
to coach the girls' soccer team. Negrete, who attends San Diego State and is on 
the Aztec soccer team, replaces Kurt Madden. 
</P>
<P>
The luck of the draw has belonged to Poway in the Palomar League. The 
second-place Titans have not faced three of the league's best pitchers, Vista's 
Rodney DeLeon (5-5), who has thrown two no-hitters this season, and Mt. 
Carmel's Doug Hill (7-1) and Mario Israel (7-2).

runs in the second and four in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
City Central League 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 4, Hoover 2 -- San Diego (9-3, 17-7) pulled into a tie for first 
place with Crawford, but will take the league's top seed into the playoffs 
because it finished 2-1 against Crawford. Josh Stepner struck out nine to move 
his season total to 53. 
</P>
<P>
Madison 9, Lincoln 6 -- Madison (8-4, 14-10) could have pulled into 
second-place had San Diego lost, but should get an at-large bid in the playoffs 
with its third-place finish. Matt Campbell went three for four with a double, 
triple and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
City Eastern League 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa 2, Morse 1 -- Marc Nielsen (6-2) pitched a four-hitter and went two 
for three with an RBI to help Mira Mesa end the season on a high note. Nielsen 
scored the winning run in the bottom of the ninth. Drew Arnold tripled twice 
for Mira Mesa (18-7, 7-5). 
</P>

Silva improved to 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
Hilltop 1, Bonita Vista 0 -- A day after forfeiting all its victories, Hilltop

NINTENDO TO FUND LEARNING PROJECT AT MIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nintendo Co., the computer-game maker whose ubiquitous machines have penetrated 
one in five American homes, announced Tuesday a strategic tie to a leading U.S. 
research institution to probe the future of child learning, artificial 
intelligence and information media. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchi said the company will contribute $3 million 
over five years to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media 
Laboratory, specifically to support studies of how children learn while at 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsorship of work in progress at the media lab, though limited in scope, will 
give Nintendo access to a wide range of cutting-edge research in related areas 
such as electronic publishing, advanced television, computer music and 
holography. 
</P>
<P>
The research alliance comes at a time when Nintendo is enjoying phenomenal 
success, dominating the U.S. computer-game scene with an 80% market share. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Nintendo has come under attack from some parents, who worry 
that their children are virtually addicted to the games to the detriment of 
learning. The company has also been the target of accusations that its business 
methods are anti-competitive. Its chief American rival, Atari Corp., has filed 
an antitrust suit alleging that Nintendo unfairly restricts its outside 
software developers. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Nintendo has said it plans to diversify outside of home 
entertainment in the United States sometime this year and establish a 
communications network for its Nintendo Entertainment Systems hardware. This 
would give users the ability to shop, trade stocks, conduct banking 
transactions or make travel arrangements -- as well as play long-distance 
computer games. Home brokerage services have been offered to Nintendo customers 
in Japan for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo's $3-million commitment to MIT will help support the work of Seymour 
A. Papert, a pioneer in artificial intelligence who is using computers in a 
curriculum-free setting to teach children at a public elementary school in 
Boston. Papert developed a computer language for children that is standard in 
the field, and his students are writing computer programs to control machines 
they build out of Lego blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Yamauchi said Nintendo's contribution to MIT reflects a sense of responsibility 
-- as the world's largest computer-game maker -- to provide educational 
opportunities through its machines. 
</P>
<P>
"We teamed up with MIT's Media Lab because we want to go beyond entertainment," 
Yamauchi said in an interview at Nintendo headquarters in Kyoto. "We think 
children ought to learn while they're having fun." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Media Laboratory, said Yamauchi was 
reluctant when Negroponte approached him in February to propose the research 
sponsorship, accompanied by Papert and Marvin L. Minsky, another pioneer in 
artificial intelligence, who was awarded the prestigious Japan Prize in April. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, Nintendo didn't know what to make of the idea," Negroponte said. 
"But I think they're following their instincts." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Yamauchi said, he has built Nintendo into a multibillion-dollar 
corporation by "trial and error." 
</P>
<P>
Founded 101 years ago by Yamauchi's great-grandfather as a modest manufacturer 
of traditional hanafuda playing cards, Nintendo now projects sales of 400 
billion yen, about $2.6 billion at current exchange rates, and after-tax profit 
of more than $360 million in the fiscal year that began April 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply followed the computer revolution and found out what people really 
wanted," Yamauchi said. 
</P>
<P>
Exports to the U.S. market of Nintendo's 8-bit NES home system, its new 
hand-held Game Boy computer game and software cartridges for both lines account 
for nearly 75% of the company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo, which makes all its products in Japan, ships 850,000 units of the NES 
to the United States each month, according to Minoru Arakawa, president of 
Redmond, Wash.-based Nintendo of America Inc. Arakawa said he plans to travel 
to Frankfurt, West Germany, at the end of the month to start a new, wholly 
owned subsidiary that will market Game Boy in Europe, where sales have lagged 
because of "cultural differences." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nintendo holds such a commanding lead in the American computer game 
market that it is occasionally accused of monopolistic practices. Last 
December, for example, Rep. Dennis Eckart (D-Ohio) asked the Justice 
Department's antitrust division to investigate Nintendo's "significant 
intimidation in the retail market," which supposedly stifles competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect Mr. Eckart is seeking publicity," Yamauchi said. "Nintendo doesn't 
consider this as a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Yamauchi said the company's lawyers will have no difficulty defending 
against Atari's antitrust suit, which he expects to go to trial in federal 
court in San Francisco in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the company's practice of demanding tight contracts with its 
outside software developers, which prevents them from selling their computer 
games to other hardware vendors, such as Atari. Also controversial is 
Nintendo's strategy of pricing its hardware very low (about $100 a set) and 
reaping huge profits on subsequent sales of software game cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
"Nintendo's system of controlling its software developers has caused an awful 
lot of resentment," said Colin Mills, a securities analyst for the brokerage 
firm of W. I. Carr in Tokyo. "But it's really a brilliant move. Who cares if 
you have enemies when you're making money like this?" 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo, which recently shifted its fiscal year, reported sales of $1.4 
billion and net profit of $178 million for the seven months ended March 31. 
Annualized, this represents sales of $2.4 billion, a dramatic jump of about 25% 
over the company's performance in its latest full fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Yamauchi said the structure of the computer-game industry naturally tends to 
create one manufacturer who takes all the spoils, because most families cannot 
afford more than one set of hardware. And Nintendo's software subcontractors 
are free to go elsewhere if they like, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If our terms are so strict they make people unhappy, they're always free not 
to accept them," Yamauchi said. "But so many companies are satisfied because 
they see the merits of doing business with us. It's always their choice, not 
ours."

LEISURE TECHNOLOGY WILL SKIP PAYOUTS ON PREFERRED SHARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

In another sign of California's slowing real estate market, Los Angeles-based 
Leisure Technology announced Tuesday that it will not pay the upcoming 
quarterly dividend on its preferred stock, a move that should save the 
struggling home builder more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Leisure Technology, a leading developer of retirement housing 
nationwide, blamed their problems on the residential real estate slowdown that 
began more than two years ago in the Northeast and has recently spread to 
states such as California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure Technology has been modestly profitable in recent months, but has shown 
a slight loss after preferred-stock dividends have been paid. 
</P>
<P>
"In California, we started to feel the slowdown last fall," said Michael L. 
Tenzer, Leisure Technology's chief executive and major shareholder. "It's not 
been as critical or serious as it has been in the Northeast, but it has been 
significant." 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the California housing market, which began about a year ago, 
has picked up momentum in recent months, propelled by a sharp rise in the cost 
of fixed-rate mortgage loans that began in December and slowed down only 
recently. Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages in California now stand at 
about 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate brokers and economists now expect that sales of existing 
single-family homes statewide in 1990 will be more than 10% below last year's 
levels, while housing prices have barely appreciated in the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in sales of existing homes hurts Leisure Technology because some 
of its customers, mainly retirees, can no longer get the prices they want for 
their homes in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, means they cannot afford a retirement home in Leisure 
Technology's affluent retirement communities, such as the one in Oceanside -- 
known as Leisure Village Ocean Hills -- where prices start at more than 
$275,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a growing number of cases, buyers agree to acquire the homes, but the deals 
never close escrow, company officials say. Tenzer declined to say how many 
sales have actually fallen through, but he did say that the ratio of successful 
sales had "deteriorated moderately" as it had elsewhere in the housing market. 
</P>
<P>
Though the short-term outlook is cloudy, Tenzer predicted that housing is 
generally in such short supply in Southern California that the current slump 
will end within 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
"The housing is just not available" because of the region's numerous 
environmental and regulatory restrictions, Tenzer said. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure Technology's disclosure about the payment halt sent the value of its 
preferred shares plunging. They closed at $5.625 per share on the New York 
Stock Exchange, down $1.375. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension affects the company's 915,000 shares of Class C cumulative 
preferred and is expected to temporarily save the company about $515,000. 
Tenzer declined to say when the payments would resume. 
</P>
<P>
In the nine months ended Dec. 31, the firm earned $82,000 on revenue of $128 
million, compared to earnings of $613,000 on revenue of $81.7 million in the 
year-earlier period. But after preferred dividends were paid, the firm lost 27 
cents per share in the latest nine-month period (the firm did not disclose an 
absolute dollar figure).

JAMES FLANIGAN: U.S. SHOULD FOLLOW EC'S TURNAROUND LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JAMES FLANIGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If we could see ourselves as others see us, as the poet Robert Burns put it, we 
might make sense of the contradictions swirling around the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush and Congressional leaders began emergency talks 
on the federal budget deficit Tuesday, even as the stock market hit yet another 
historic high. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the stock market is rising because U.S. interest rates are headed 
lower, but the budget summit is occurring because interest rates have stayed 
high this year, when budget planners had counted on them being a full 
percentage point lower. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that the government's interest payments on the national debt may 
rise by $30 billion to more than $200 billion. That's right, $200 billion in 
interest. The understandable fear in Washington is that the deficit may be out 
of control. 
</P>
<P>
What does it all mean? You won't find out by looking at the U.S. economy in 
isolation but only by seeing it as part of the mosaic of the world economy. And 
there the news is challenging, yet hopeful -- the U.S. faces a crisis of 
confidence related to the government's handling of the budget deficit but could 
turn the situation around the way Europe did in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The old continent is now the chief attraction for global business investment -- 
with $10 billion a year flowing from Japan alone -- just as the United States 
attracted such investment in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"To some extent, investment is being diverted from Latin America and the U.S.," 
says Peter Rogge, senior vice president of Swiss Bank Corp. And investment in 
Europe is only increased by the opening of Eastern Europe. The result, says the 
Swiss Banker, is that global demand for investment capital has made interest 
rates 1.5 percentage points higher than they would otherwise be. 
</P>
<P>
So the U.S. deficit has been hit by a double whammy -- the foreign investment 
that made it easier to finance the deficit in the '80s is no longer flowing 
this way, and Europe's demand for investment capital is keeping interest rates 
relatively high. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, says Rogge, that pattern may continue for at least five years -- with 
the West German economy growing 6% a year and many of the other European 
countries growing 4% -- compared to slower growth, perhaps 2% a year, for the 
U.S. economy, in the estimate of Swiss bankers. 
</P>
<P>
It's a picture of a changing world. At those rates, the combined economies of 
the 10-nation European Community will be as large as the U.S. economy in five 
years -- with Japan third, at roughly 60% the size of the United States or 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than worrying about waning influence, the United States would do 
better to look where Europe came from. Half a dozen years ago, Europe's 
economies were moribund and lagging in investment -- which was then flowing to 
America. "The world thought Europe's only future would be as a theme park for 
visiting Japanese business people," says Peter Sutherland, a former member of 
the European Commission, the EC's ruling body, and now chairman of Allied Irish 
Bank in Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
But the Europeans woke up. In 1984, at a conference outside Paris, the EC 
nations set a goal of true economic union by 1992 and have been working toward 
that vision ever since. Yet investment capital started flowing immediately 
after they set the goal, says Sutherland. "Capital is an incident of 
confidence, really," he says. "If there is confidence, investment follows." 
</P>
<P>
Which is just the point. Capital seems very scarce in America these days. Both 
Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Sen. James 
Sasser (D-Tenn), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, talk of a "capital 
shortage." 
</P>
<P>
But confidence also seems in short supply. Swiss banker Rogge, who has visited 
America for years, says he misses the old dynamism. "I find American business 
people skeptical these days -- skeptical that prosperity will continue 
indefinitely, skeptical that U.S. industry is really competitive . . . " 
</P>
<P>
What accounts for that? Observers foreign and domestic trace the problem to the 
budget deficit, which they see in terms of national will more than economics. 
</P>
<P>
The Economist magazine calls the U.S. deficit "an unmistakable symptom of a 
dishonest political culture." Its strong words refer to all the tricks of 
off-budget financing, use of Social Security funds and borrowing from abroad 
that U.S. administrations have used to mask the true size and impact of the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
And Herbert Stein, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, says 
the budget deficit -- by limiting funds for private industry -- curbs growth in 
U.S. investment, productivity and incomes. Stein, 73, says the idea that the 
United States lacks capital is nonsense. "In an economy with a gross national 
product of $5.5 trillion, it is not credible that we do not have the money to 
deal with our national and social needs," he says. But Stein blames cowardly 
politicians, afraid to raise taxes or cut programs for people who are not poor 
-- including many elderly -- for sapping of the nation's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the diverted flow of foreign money and the deficit's frightening 
rise may force a change. The aftermath of the budget summit will likely see 
some higher taxes -- possibly a gasoline tax, although not the 50 cents a 
gallon that Easterners call for and Westerners oppose. Alcohol and tobacco will 
be taxed. Changes in Social Security taxes and capital gains will be closely 
argued, at least. 
</P>
<P>
Will taxes be bad for the economy? Not if they represent an honest attempt to 
narrow the budget deficit. The very action itself could restore confidence, 
bring down interest rates and spur investment. The rising stock market may be a 
hopeful sign -- but then it had better be. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high. Six years ago, as EC commissioners gathered near Paris, 
the rest of the world thought Europe was finished -- but it is disproving that 
judgment. Now many people and nations think the United States is in decline. 
Whether they can be disproved may depend on Americans asking why they think 
that way.

NORDSTROM FIGHTS LABOR ALLEGATIONS AT ANNUAL SESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nordstrom Inc. launched a counterattack Tuesday against allegations that it 
makes employees work without pay, defending its business practices and 
challenging union officials to hold a referendum to see if they have the 
backing of employees. 
</P>
<P>
Management's defense took center stage at the annual shareholders' meeting at 
the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach, overshadowing disappointing earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce, James and John Nordstrom, the Seattle-based retailer's co-chairmen, 
managed to avoid any direct clashes with union officials. Their closest brush 
came when a pro-union shoe salesman from a Nordstrom store in Seattle walked to 
the front of the room and told shareholders that the company "has serious 
problems that need to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Nordstrom's continuing problems with labor grievances and a 
union class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of the firm's roughly 100,000 
employees alleging that clerks were encouraged to work extra hours without pay. 
The retail chain, known for its attentive customer service, also faces a 
shareholders' lawsuit that claims the company failed to reveal the extent of 
its labor problems. 
</P>
<P>
Several pro-management workers were applauded when they rose to say they backed 
the store's policy of personal service and were proud to be associated with 
Nordstrom. Earlier, they had joined in a rally in front of the hotel to show 
their support for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom, with $2.7 billion in sales last year, operates 59 stores in 
Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, Virginia and Utah. Employees in 
California do not belong to a union. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nordstrom, in a defense of what he termed "a media smear campaign" waged 
by two Washington state locals of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, 
said the chief issue was freedom. Employees should have the freedom to decide 
their representation and the company should have the freedom to continue to 
conduct business as it has in the past, he declared. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people resent having to be members of a union that to them represents 
mediocrity," Nordstrom said. If Nordstrom workers seek a decertification vote, 
"we will stand by whatever the employees tell us," he added, receiving a round 
of applause. 
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly defended company sales policies, in which clerks receive both an 
hourly wage and commission. He asserted that the company's workers are the 
best-paid in the retailing industry. He offered examples of a men's suit 
salesman who earned $100,000 in salary and commissions last year and a shoe 
salesman who garnered $82,000. 
</P>
<P>
The company's defense drew a sharp rebuttal from Joe Peterson, president of 
UFCW Union Local 1001 in Seattle. Peterson, dressed in a tuxedo, noted that the 
National Labor Relations Board has pending complaints against Nordstrom, 
including an allegation that the company tried to sidestep the union by 
illegally encouraging employees to negotiate directly with the company to 
resolve back-pay disputes. In addition, the Washington State Department of 
Labor and Industries has found Nordstrom in violation of minimum-wage laws and 
ordered it to pay back wages. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the union has filed a lawsuit demanding back pay for all Nordstrom 
workers who worked unpaid hours performing such duties as writing thank-you 
notes or making deliveries. Peterson estimated that Nordstrom faces a potential 
$300 million in back-wage claims. The company has established a $15-million 
fund to pay such claims. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the company recognizes we're not going to go away," said Peterson. But 
he said the company refuses to meet the union at the bargaining table and can 
expect a continued "public relations nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
A group of Seattle-area Nordstrom employees who said they paid their own way to 
Orange County to attend the annual meeting joined in Bruce Nordstrom's 
challenge to the union to allow a decertification vote. 
</P>
<P>
Larry McCargar, an NLRB official in Seattle, said the agency would not 
authorize a decertification election "until the unfair labor practices are 
remedied." 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom officials downplayed the effect of labor problems on lackluster 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom earnings plunged 43% for its first quarter ended April 30 to $13.2 
million, down from $23 million a year earlier. Sales, however, were up 8%. 
</P>
<P>
James Nordstrom said the retailer lowered its prices to keep pace with 
competitors, which squeezed profits. Also, he said, inflation and expenses 
related to the labor strife kept costs high. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it believes that the $15 million set aside to pay back-pay 
claims is sufficient and that the claims should not substantially affect 
earnings this year. 
</P>
<P>
John A. McMillan, Nordstrom's president, said the firm's earnings for its 
fiscal year ended Jan. 31 were hurt by the effects of the San Francisco 
earthquake in October, and by general disarray in the retail industry. 
Nordstrom had earnings of $31.4 million in fiscal 1990, compared to $47.5 
million in 1989.

Eastern Says Advance Bookings Up Sharply: Eastern Airlines said its advance 
bookings have improved dramatically. Eastern, which has been mired in Chapter 
11 bankruptcy proceedings for more than a year, said it made 625,000 advance 
bookings last week, nearly double its level a month ago. While the jump mainly 
reflects Eastern's May 7 offer of bargain children's fares to Florida and a 
money-back guarantee for first-class travelers, the naming of Martin Shugrue as 
a trustee to run Eastern on April 18 has helped by bringing the carrier a 
measure of stability, said Eastern Vice President George Brennan.

Aviation Fuel Recalled: Chevron Corp. said it completed a recall of more than 
500,000 gallons of below-standard small-airplane fuel from aviation fuel 
customers and airports in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron began the recall late last week, when it found the fuel to have lower 
than permissible octane levels. Chevron estimated that it has spent more than 
$1 million replenishing aviation fuel supplies in a distribution area bounded 
by Bakersfield, Medford, Ore., and Reno. Chevron stressed that the fuel posed 
no danger and that the recall was merely a precaution. The recall did not apply 
to commercial jet fuel, which is an unrelated product.

GREAT AMERICAN BANK NARROWS LOSS IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great American Bank on Tuesday reported a $1.2-million first-quarter loss, an 
encouraging sign after the troubled San Diego-based thrift nearly drowned in a 
tide of red ink in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But Great American also reported a continued deterioration of the overall 
quality of its loans and said it is enmeshed in a dispute with the federal 
Office of Thrift Supervision over the value of certain loans. 
</P>
<P>
If OTS auditors prevail in the dispute, to be settled during the current 
quarter ending June 30, a revaluation of the loans could ensue, resulting in 
writedowns of up to $65 million to be charged against Great American's 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's loss for the quarter ended March 30 contrasted with an 
$11-million profit for the same period last year. But Great American executives 
took heart in the fact that the loss was an improvement from the $198.9 million 
and $263.4 million losses for the 1989 fourth quarter and full year, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's loss, caused largely by loss provisions set aside to cover 
non-performing commercial and apartment loans in Arizona, put Great American on 
the brink of insolvency. As of Dec. 31, Great American was deficient in all 
three standards applied by the OTS to test a thrift's capital, or its financial 
cushion against loss. The S&amp;L was given a Dec. 31, 1990, deadline to sell 
itself or raise $350 million in outside capital to avoid a possible regulatory 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are signs that Great American still has not turned the corner on 
its bad loans. Its non-performing assets as of March 31 rose to $556.7 million, 
or 3.61% of assets, from $539.4 million, or 3.39% of assets, as of Dec. 31. The 
percentage increase also reflects the shrinkage in Great American's assets, to 
$15.4 billion as of March 31 from $15.9 billion at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Another bad sign for the S&amp;L was that its classified assets, a broader 
category of problem loans, increased over the three-month period to $1.389 
billion, up from $1.297 billion as of Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
That OTS inspectors have not fully completed their field reviews of Great 
American loans could be another ominous sign for the S&amp;L. The OTS has 
reviewed all of the S&amp;L's Arizona loans and those of its real estate 
development subsidiary, but not Great American's loans made by its California 
and Washington branches. 
</P>
<P>
The strict standards imposed by OTS audits of Great American's Arizona loans 
were factors in the S&amp;L taking huge loan losses in 1989. Great American 
expects to receive written results of the examination during the current 
quarter ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to an accounting technique, Great American reported that its capital 
position improved somewhat over the first quarter. The technique involved a 
reallocation of $34.6 million in retained earnings from Great American's real 
estate development operation to the S&amp;L. Despite this, Great American's 
so-called tangible capital is still $99.1 million short of minimum regulatory 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L also declined to comment on reports that it has offered its chief 
executive post to James M. Cirona, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of 
San Francisco.

</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard invested an undisclosed amount for a minority interest in 
Cascade Microtech of Beaverton, Ore., the two companies said. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Hewlett-Packard licensed Cascade's technology for high-speed

PERKIN-ELMER MAJORITY STAKE IN CHIP UNIT

<P>
Perkin-Elmer Corp. sold most of its semiconductor business to a California 
company Tuesday in a move that should ease concerns about a possible loss of 
leading-edge computer technology to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Silicon Valley Group Inc. of San Jose said it will buy more than 60% of the 
Wilton, Conn.-based business for more than $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Perkin-Elmer will retain a minority interest and International Business 
Machines Inc. also will buy a minority stake, officials announced through a 
telephone conference call with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
IBM also will provide funds to help develop the division's latest technology 
and will place large orders with the unit, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The division produces machines that are used to manufacture computer chips. As 
such, it is a critical link in the semiconductor industry. 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk-based Perkin-Elmer reportedly had been discussing a possible sale of 
the division to Nikon Corp. last year. The reports touched off concern that a 
loss of such vital technology could hamper the ability of American chip makers 
to compete with Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
Perkin-Elmer has refused to comment on speculation about a sale in Japan, but 
analysts believe that a number of Japanese companies were interested in buying 
the business when Perkin-Elmer put it up for sale two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The real story here is that we're seeing U.S. companies band together to 
defend a key technology for future chip development," said Mark FitzGerald, 
senior industry analyst with Dataquest of San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
The division makes machines that use optical lithography to etch patterns on 
computer chips. Its critical technology is called the Micrascan System, a tool 
that can etch a pattern on smaller wafers with greater sharpness. 
</P>
<P>
The technology still is under development and will not be used in full-scale 
manufacturing for two to three years, although IBM is using three machines in 
Essex Junction, Vt., to develop new semiconductors, said company spokesman Paul 
Bergevin. 
</P>
<P>
FitzGerald said the United States is ahead of the Japanese in developing the 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have such an insurmountable lead at this point in time that if 
this technology went to a Japanese company, the U.S. suppliers would be totally 
out of leading-edge work" in the semiconductor business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal adds another dimension to SVG's semiconductor business. The company 
already makes equipment that prepares wafers for the lithography patterning. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you, with the right partners here, we have an excellent chance to 
be a global supplier and global competitor," said Papken S. Der Torossian, 
president and chief executive officer of SVG. The company earned $9.6 million 
on sales of $130 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
He said his company already has paid $20 million for the business, to be called 
SVG Lithography Systems Inc. He would not place a total value on the deal but 
said the financial arrangements would be detailed in a filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
FitzGerald said he valued the unit at under $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
IBM will provide an unspecified amount of funds to develop the lithography 
equipment, along with a chemical compound used to coat the wafer surface for 
the etching process. 
</P>
<P>
It also has committed to buying "tens of millions of dollars" worth of the new 
machines, Bergevin said. 
</P>
<P>
Sematech, a consortium of government and industry leaders, also will provide 
development funding along with technical support.

PATHE WILL SELL 60% OF CANNON TO DUTCH FIRM

Pathe Communications Co., which is trying to acquire MGM/UA Communications 
Corp., agreed Tuesday to sell its controlling stake in Cannon Pictures to a 
Dutch production firm in a $15-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
Trihoof Investments B.V. submitted a tender offer of 13.6 cents per share for 
the 60% of Cannon's stock held by Pathe. Trihoof President Ovidio Assonitis 
already owns 20% of Cannon Pictures and has served as the Beverly Hills 
company's chairman and chief executive since last year. 
</P>
<P>
Assonitis, seeking to establish a greater presence in Hollywood, would get a 
film library, a Beverly Hills office building and Cannon's staff under the 
agreement. Also included in the package are a six-film contract between Cannon 
Pictures and action-adventure star Chuck Norris and a one-film deal with 
another popular star, Charles Bronson. 
</P>
<P>
But other major assets, including a separate Cannon Group film library with 800 
titles, a chain of theaters and foreign distribution rights to Cannon films, 
would be retained by Pathe. Pathe also would get the rights to three films on 
the current Cannon Pictures release schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon Vice Chairman Bill Immerman said the deal will make Trihoof a more 
important player in the filmmaking community. "The primary intent . . . is to 
replace Pathe as our majority shareholder," Immerman said. "We want to chart 
our own course." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides denied that the sale has any connection to Pathe's bid to acquire 
MGM/UA. Craig Parsons, a spokesman for Pathe, said the deal simply made sense 
economically for the parties. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the deal, Trihoof has offered $5 million for Pathe's 32.7 
million shares of Cannon common stock, 28.8 million Class A warrants and 26.1 
million Class B warrants. Trihoof has agreed to buy the Cannon Pictures office 
building on Wilshire Boulevard for $9 million and will also assume 
responsibility for a $15-million loan from Credit Lyonnais to Cannon Pictures.

LOOKING AHEAD: COMPUTERS COULD SOON TACKLE PERSONNEL TASKS

Computers may one day take over a significant portion of job interviewing and 
candidate screening for businesses. In fact, job-interviewing software has 
already been developed. 
</P>
<P>
Computer Employment Applications (CEA) is a program that uses a personal 
computer as the initial interviewer in the hiring process. 
</P>
<P>
The applicant reads questions on the computer screen and types answers into the 
computer. The process is a private encounter between applicant and computer, 
with no interviewer present. 
</P>
<P>
No computer skills are necessary for the interview, according to CEA developer 
Richard J. Phannenstill, who maintains, "No one has ever not been able to use 
this system." 
</P>
<P>
After the interview, the computer prints out a comprehensive summary of the 
information collected. It can be used by the employer to evaluate the applicant 
and to help check references. 
</P>
<P>
Phannenstill points to estimates that half of all resumes or job applications 
are false or embellished. Employers using computerized interviewing have found 
applicants more truthful with computers than humans, he says. 
</P>
<P>
For example, CEA-interviewed applicants were more likely to admit illegal drug 
use than in face-to-face interviews. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, employees may find their performance reviews conducted by 
computer. Performance Mentor, Inc., has developed software that allows managers 
to profile employees, do performance appraisals and keep a record of employee 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The hot jobs of the 1990s will be determined by factors beyond demographics and 
changes in the composition of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue University researchers say new technologies and changing social concerns 
will greatly increase the need for workers in certain jobs and will create 
whole new categories of jobs.

Among occupations that will have the greatest demand for new workers:

Many businesses in the United States seem willing to become "points of light" 
to help the disadvantaged. But over 82% of business leaders in a national 
survey said they believe that it is unrealistic to ask business to come up with 
funds to make up for government cutbacks in social service programs. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Save the Children, a community development and relief 
agency, indicated that more than half of business leaders believe that 
corporations should participate in charitable efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Younger executives are particularly inclined toward charity. Sixty-nine percent 
of those under 50 said businesses should participate in such efforts -- a 
positive sign for the future of business-driven charitable efforts. 
</P>
<P>
However, the company owners, presidents and chief executive officers polled 
don't think business should bear the burden alone. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the business leaders expect support for charities to remain 
at about the same level as now during the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
A third project that charitable giving by businesses will increase in the next 
few years; only about 12% anticipate that giving will decrease. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate sponsorship of charitable events and programs will be increasingly 
popular in the 1990s, as will direct corporate gifts, the business leaders 
added.

IN NEW SIGNAL OF SLOWING, APRIL FACTORY OUTPUT FELL

The nation's mines, factories and utilities operated at a lower rate last month 
than in March, with a sharp drop in the output of motor vehicles and parts, the 
Federal Reserve Board said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new signs of economic sluggishness followed reports last week that retail 
sales weakened in April while wholesale prices dropped from March levels, which 
economists said might encourage Fed policy-makers to consider lowering interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed said industrial production for April fell 0.4%, the first decline since 
January, when it fell a steep 1.0%. The rate rose 0.5% in March and 0.9% in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed said production of autos and light trucks fell nearly 14% in April from 
March. But excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial output was unchanged 
in April and has shown little movement since January, the Fed added. 
</P>
<P>
"We are accumulating a dossier that the economy lost some momentum during the 
last month," said economist William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Carson, an economist at Chemical Bank, said that when all of the recent 
data is analyzed collectively, the greater risk for the economy is slow growth, 
not rising inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"What today's data tells us is that the manufacturing sector has yet to hit 
bottom and that talk of an inventory-led rebound in the economy is mistaken," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer goods production was down 1.0% in April after rises of 0.9% in March 
and 1.1% in February. Business equipment, a category also affected by the auto 
industry, dropped 0.9% last month after gains of 1.5% in March and 1.6% in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed said output of construction supplies also weakened in both April and 
March, erasing gains from last fall and early this year when unseasonably warm 
weather made it possible for builders to continue projects. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, industrial operations ran at only 83.0% of capacity in April 
compared to 83.5% in March and 83.2% in February. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the rate was lower was in January, when capacity use fell to 
82.7% because auto producers cut output and laid off workers temporarily while 
dealers reduced stocks of unsold cars left over from late 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output dropped to 82.2% of capacity in April from 82.9% in both 
March and February, the Fed said. Operating rates for auto plants dropped to 
65.1% in April from 75.6% in March. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, mining output increased to 88.3% from 87.4% because of gains in 
the oil and gas sector and continued strength in coal mining, the Fed said. 
</P>
<P>
Utility companies' operating rates were up to 87.1% in April from 86.6% in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Carson believes the Fed will not change its credit policy in a hurry, but when 
it does it will be toward reviving the economy with easier interest rates.

Some of the nation's top corporations and business groups Tuesday announced a 
coalition aimed at shoring up foundering international trade talks, which they 
said are crucial in heading off global trade wars and a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The Multilateral Trade Negotiations -- or MTN -- Coalition said it has the 
support of businesses and trade groups representing 13,000 companies. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's chairmen, William Brock and Robert Strauss, former top U.S. 
trade negotiators, said the current round of GATT trade negotiations are the 
most crucial ever conducted but the public seems unaware of the stakes. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition is aimed at strengthening the hand of U.S. Trade Representative 
Carla A. Hills in the forthcoming bargaining, Brock and Strauss said. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition said its supporters include General Motors, American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph, General Electric, International Business Machines, American 
Express, the National Assn. of Manufacturers, the National Federation of 
Independent Business and the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Absent from the list of coalition supporters were labor organizations, which in 
recent years have questioned the benefits of an open trading system to the 
United States while other nations, especially Japan, impose barriers. 
</P>
<P>
"Go out on the street and ask the first 100 people about the Uruguay round of 
trade negotiations, and not one person would know what you're talking about," 
Strauss said.

U.S. TO SET UP $500-MILLION TRADE AID FUND

The United States said Tuesday that it will go on the offensive against rich 
nations that use aid to promote their own business interests in the developing 
world by setting up a $500-million fund to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be split roughly evenly among Indonesia, Pakistan, the 
Philippines and Thailand to help U.S. companies win business in the 
telecommunications, transportation, power and construction equipment fields. 
</P>
<P>
"It's designed to fight fire with fire," U.S. Export-Import Bank Vice Chairman 
Eugene Lawson told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson refused to single out any country for criticism but U.S. officials have 
said in the past that France and Japan were two of the biggest offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has long opposed the use of aid by industrial countries to help 
their businessmen win development projects, arguing that the practice distorts 
trade. But the use of so-called tied-aid credits has exploded in recent years 
as rich nations compete fiercely for business in the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
Tied-aid credits reduce the cost of a project to a developing country by mixing 
aid with commercial credits. 
</P>
<P>
The Agency for International Development will kick in $100 million to the pool, 
with the balance provided by the Export-Import Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson said the United States might be able to have half or more of the 
$500-million fund in place for use by the countries concerned by Sept. 30, the 
end of the government's fiscal year.

CRITIC AT LARGE: HESTON REVISITS 'TEN COMMANDMENTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once, after being introduced at a large dinner party in San Diego, Charlton 
Heston announced that later on he would part the waters of the swimming pool. 
It was a bittersweet acknowledgement that of all the historic figures he has 
played -- among them Andrew Jackson, Buffalo Bill, William Clark of Lewis &amp; 
Clark, John the Baptist, Cardinal Richelieu, General Chinese Gordon and 
Michelangelo -- Heston is most indissolubly associated with his portrayal of 
Moses parting the Red Sea in Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 epic, "The Ten 
Commandments." 
</P>
<P>
The landmark film with its cast of thousands opens a short run today, in a 
restored cut that will be shown in 70mm format at the Cinerama Dome through 
Monday and in 35mm at the Crest (where it is scheduled to run through May 24). 
</P>
<P>
Everyone, says Heston, has always reminded him that they've seen "The Ten 
Commandments" on television and often they add that they've taped it. "But I 
stop and think that by now there are two generations who haven't seen the 
picture on the screen it was made to be seen on. And the picture they've seen 
has also had the edges cut off to fit on the small screen." 
</P>
<P>
Heston himself will see "The Ten Commandments" for the first time in years at 
the Cinerama Dome. He can't wait, even if it entails two more generations of 
jokes about his parting of the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The actor recalled the making of the film in an interview Tuesday at his 
hilltop house in the Santa Monica Mountains. Just 30 when shooting began, he 
had come West from Broadway and live television with a five-picture commitment 
from producer Hal Wallis. Wallis dealt one of the commitments to Paramount for 
"The Greatest Show on Earth," Heston's first association with DeMille and, 
because of the long shooting schedule, another two commitments to DeMille for 
"Ten Commandments." 
</P>
<P>
"With the exception of two months on location in Egypt we shot the film on the 
Paramount lot, on what is now a parking lot." There was a vast sky cyclorama, 
used in many a Western, and a rugged environment that had been used in an 
earlier Heston film, "The Naked Jungle." 
</P>
<P>
"There were 14 film elements in the parting of the Red Sea sequence," Heston 
says. Some of them, including the chariots and the throngs rushing through the 
gap in the waters, shot in Egypt, the rest on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
The location work was done first. DeMille's people had built an enormous set in 
Europe. As Heston recalls, "The only one that might have been comparable was 
the one Sam Bronston had built for '55 Days at Peking.' He built most of Peking 
and didn't use all of it, at that. But DeMille had that double row of Sphinxes, 
some of them 120 feet high and the row must have been a quarter of a mile 
long." 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government urged DeMille to leave the set standing and promised to 
make a museum of it. "But DeMille took it down. He knew that there would be 17 
Italian film companies using the location the week after we left, and who 
knows, he may have been right." 
</P>
<P>
Yul Brynner flew in for one day's shooting, interrupting his run in "The King 
and I." Doubles were used for other principals, who did not appear in close-ups 
until shooting resumed at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
"Egypt was essentially a second-unit shoot, which is usually done concurrently 
with the main shoot, or later. But this was DeMille's own second unit." When it 
was finished, DeMille shut down the production for several weeks while he 
edited the footage together and blocked out specifically what he needed to do 
at the studio." 
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime," says Heston, "I went off to Universal and did another 
picture, 'The Private War of Major Benson,' on a fairly brisk schedule." 
</P>
<P>
DeMille, says Heston, "was courteously formal, very pleasant, although he could 
be a holy terror with AD's (assistant directors) and prop men. He arrived each 
morning at the set in suit and tie, although jacket and tie would be gone and 
the sleeves rolled up by midmorning. He was famous for his jodhpurs and puttees 
out on location, but," Heston says, "he explained to me that he just wasn't as 
young as he had been, and wanted the support for his legs." 
</P>
<P>
It drove DeMille crazy when performers were late to a shot. "But he couldn't 
rebuke them. It wasn't done; there was a scene to be photographed. Instead he 
would rebuke -- not scream, it was icily done -- wardrobe or makeup. If Anne 
Baxter was late, he would say to the makeup people, 'Do you realize that you've 
delayed Miss Baxter for 20 minutes. Don't you realize how important this scene 
is to her, and to the picture?' But Anne, of course, knew who was really being 
rebuked." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, DeMille was remarkably kind and courteous to his extras, 
explaining scenes to them in great detail. "And if he had some big production 
scenes, he would try to schedule them between Thanksgiving and Christmas, so 
there would be a kind of Christmas bonus for the extras." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Heston, "He used to say he'd made 73 films and one flop. That was a film 
called 'Four Frightened People' (1934) with Herbert Marshall and Claudette 
Colbert. He said that when it was released, there were five frightened people." 
</P>
<P>
Heston occasionally saw DeMille socially. "But I always called him Mr. DeMille. 
Yul rather daringly called him C.B., and he didn't seem to object. But for the 
most part the only people who called him C.B. were people like his cutter and 
his cameraman, who'd been with him forever." 
</P>
<P>
Three of the great directors he worked with had remarkably different 
approaches, Heston says. 
</P>
<P>
DeMille, who had come out of the silent era, was especially obsessed with the 
images. "He knew exactly how he wanted you to say the lines, and he told you," 
says Heston. "But he worked endlessly over the composition." William Wyler, for 
whom Heston was to do "Ben Hur" three years later, was legendary for the many 
takes he demanded. "It was not usually quite as many as legend says. But there 
would be seven or eight. DeMille would sometimes go with one take, but that was 
after he had rehearsed meticulously. George Stevens might only do three or four 
takes, but he did an usual number of set-ups, enormous coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"DeMille was a highly efficient director."

'DIE HARD 2': BITING THE BULLET OVER BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: THE DELAYED OPENING OF BRUCE WILLIS' ACTION-THRILLER ADDS FUEL TO TALK 
OF A $20-MILLION COST OVERRUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Twentieth Century Fox appears to have further underscored Hollywood talk that 
"Die Hard 2" may be as much as $20 million over its $40 million production 
budget. Fox officials vehemently deny huge overruns, but this week they delayed 
release of the Bruce Willis thriller from June to July. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Fox said the producers of "Die Hard 2" would deliver the final 
version of the film June 17, making the advertised opening of June 22 nearly 
impossible to meet. As a result, the movie will have a July 2 premiere in Los 
Angeles, followed by a national release on the July 4th weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Saying "We're saving the best for last" and "We're waiting for a whole weekend 
of Friday nights," Fox officials attempted to put the best face on the delay. 
They have pointed out that June is already loaded with a potential blockbuster 
movie a week. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, the sequel to the 1988 box-office hit, set in a snowed-in, 
terrorist-overrun Dulles International Airport outside of Washington, has been 
the subject of speculation about runaway production costs. The original "Die 
Hard," set in a Los Angeles high rise, cost $28 million to make and turned into 
an $80 million hit. 
</P>
<P>
But at a lavish 35th birthday bowling party for Willis, rumors of a 
studio-ordered audit to see how producer Joel Silver handled production funds 
and other stories have clouded the prospects for this summer's sequel. 
</P>
<P>
The huge cost overrun stories are all bunk, according to Fox production 
president Roger Birnbaum. He declined to say how much "Die Hard 2" might have 
gone over its reported $40 million budget, but he dismissed reports that the 
cost of the film may have soared past the $60 million mark. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I will tell you is that (the movie) went five days over 
budget," Birnbaum told The Times. "That was due to unfortunate circumstances. 
Quite honestly, I don't know where all these rumors emanate from." 
</P>
<P>
Birnbaum pointed to similar over-budget rumors surrounding Carolco's "Total 
Recall" and two Paramount films, "Days of Thunder" and "Godfather III," adding, 
"I wouldn't be surprised if rival companies put these stories out to take the 
heat off themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The "unfortunate circumstances" that put "Die Hard 2" over budget was the 
weather, not Willis' birthday party or Silver's alleged profligacy, according 
to a Fox spokeswoman. "Our problems were either finding actual snow or a 
temperature in which we could make snow," she said. "We needed a blanket as far 
as the eye could see for the exterior of the airport." 
</P>
<P>
Pre-production, special effects and initial sound-stage filming began last 
December in Los Angeles, but then the Larry &amp; Charles Gordon/Joel Silver 
production hit the road. First stop in January was normally snowed-in Stapleton 
International Airport in Denver, where Deputy Director of Aviation Richard 
Boulware said the cast and crew spent an estimated $50,000 a day for three and 
a half weeks, just on per-diem expenses such as hotels, car rentals and food. 
</P>
<P>
"We loved having them here," said Boulware. 
</P>
<P>
But the snow melted early and the "Die Hard 2" odyssey moved farther north to 
Moses Lake, Wash. By March, the snow melted again and the crew packed up and 
headed to Alpena, Mich. Spring caught up with them there as well and they had 
to go even farther north to Kincheloe Air Force Base near Kinross, Mich., in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Willis's salary is a factor in the higher cost of producing "Die Hard 2," but 
not a significant one. He is earning $7.5 million for reprising his role as a 
police officer who single-handedly devastates terrorists -- $2.5 million more 
than he got the original. 
</P>
<P>
"Die Hard" also transformed Willis from a TV-comedy star into a full-fledged 
action-thriller movie star, rivaling Sylvester Stallone and Arnold 
Schwarzenegger at the box office. The original shooting budget climbed 
proportionately, from $28 million for "Die Hard" to a reported $40 million for 
"Die Hard 2." 
</P>
<P>
When he turned 35 on March 19, Willis was feted with a Los Angeles bash that 
had a bowling alley theme. In homage to the actor's blue collar New Jersey 
persona, "Bruno," bowling shirts for each guest were flown to New York, 
personalized with their names at a company that specializes in embroidering 
bowling shirts, and messengered back to each guest who had to wear them to the 
door as their invitation, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murphy, who came to the party in street clothes, supposedly had one of 
his gofers carry his shirt to the door on a hanger in order to get inside. 
</P>
<P>
But the cost of the party did not come out of "Die Hard 2" production funds, 
according to the Fox spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
And Silver, who has a longstanding reputation as a free-spending producer, did 
not permanently alienate Fox executives by going over budget, according to 
Birnbaum. He has just completed two other movies for Fox -- "The Adventures of 
Ford Fairlane" and "Predator II" -- and is under contract to produce two more. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me clarify all of this very, very simply: at the premiere of 'Die Hard 2,' 
you will see Joel Silver sitting next to me," said Birnbaum. "We audit every 
single movie that we make during and in post-production. That's what we're 
doing with 'Die Hard 2,' just like every other movie. There's no special movie 
audit going on." 
</P>
<P>
Fox's current strategy calls for a "Die Hard 2"opening on 2,000 screens. 
Several exhibitors are expected to use more expensive, but higher quality 70 
millimeter prints to maximize the impact of the opening. 
</P>
<P>
But postponing a promised blockbuster can have disastrous results, as the 
studio learned last summer when it repeatedly put off release of "The Abyss" 
until August, after the momentum from such early summer entries as Warner's 
"Batman" and Disney's "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" had already eaten up the 
lion's share of America's summer movie dollars.

BILL FOR A RESTRICTION-FREE NEA IS INTRODUCED; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: DEMOCRAT'S MEASURE, BACKED BY THE WHITE HOUSE, WOULD EXTEND THE LIFE 
OF THE AGENCY FOR FIVE YEARS WITHOUT ANY CONTROLS OVER THE CONTENT OF ART. 
</P>

<P>
A key Democratic congressman on Tuesday introduced White House-backed 
legislation to extend the National Endowment for the Arts' life without 
restrictions on the content of art it supports. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.) to introduce the bill supported by 
President Bush -- but without any GOP co-sponsors -- was described by 
congressional observers as a rare tactic intended to outflank Republicans who 
are threatening to break with the President and propose a radical restructuring 
of the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
The bill calls for extending the NEA's life for five years without language 
that impedes the endowment's freedom to make artistic judgments. 
</P>
<P>
"I really do think it is 'High Noon' for the arts endowment," Williams said in 
a telephone interview. Williams chairs a House subcommittee that is responsible 
for initiating legislation to extend the legislative authorization of the NEA, 
which expires in September. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, however, three House Republicans announced an agreement among GOP 
congressmen for substitute legislation that would impose at least some controls 
over the content of NEA-funded art. An aide to Rep. Tom Coleman (R-Mo.) said 
the content-control language would stress "accountability and community 
standards" for such problem areas as obscene, indecent or sacreligious 
artworks. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican substitute was to be announced in detail this morning at a 
Washington press conference. It is the product of negotiations involving 
Coleman, Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) and Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio). Coleman 
is the ranking minority member of the Williams subcommittee and Regula is the 
top GOP member of a subcommitee considering NEA appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in Coleman's office said the Republican's alternative NEA plan would 
also redistribute some portion of the endowment's budget, sending money to 
state arts councils and local arts agencies -- presumably in the form of block 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush announced several weeks ago that he opposes content restrictions 
on the NEA and formally sent legislation to the Williams subcommittee two weeks 
ago renewing the NEA with only minor technical changes. 
</P>
<P>
But Republicans on Williams' subcommittee, led by Gunderson, have indicated 
that they may attempt to change the structure of the NEA completely, reshaping 
it in the form of a controversial proposal made over the weekend by the 
National Assembly of State Arts Agencies. The plan calls for 60% of the NEA's 
money to go to state arts councils -- three times the proportion now allotted 
-- and strip away most of the money now channeled to individual artists and 
small arts organizations. 
</P>
<P>
There were indications that opposition within the arts establishment to the 
restructuring proposal was beginning to solidify. The director of the 
California Arts Council publicly opposed the plan, saying he believed other 
state art agencies would join him. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Robert Reid, director of the council, contended that the 
proposal was counterproductive. "I think it's too early to abandon the NEA," he 
said. "If you send this (issue) out to the states, instead of the focus being 
on one institution, it's going to be focused all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
It also was learned that NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer would attend a 
Thursday Washington summit of a half dozen major arts organizations at which 
arts advocates hoped for a showdown. Some congressional observers said that 
they believed the Gunderson faction on the NEA subcommittee would retreat from 
the restructuring if arts groups resolve their differences and present a united 
front opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the NEA's political situation has so damaged the NEA that it may 
not be possible to complete a five-year legislative renewal without 
restrictions being imposed on the content of government-funded art. 
</P>
<P>
"I think two things have occurred now that bring the reauthorization to 
critical mass and both are troubling for the endowment," Williams said. "The 
first is that Republicans have decided that, despite the President's best 
efforts, this issue shall be partisan. 
</P>
<P>
"The second (is that) the communities within the art world have begun to 
scramble after the pieces. I have worried about a type of cannibalism occurring 
within the art community and I worry that that is now becoming reality." 
</P>
<P>
Williams also indicated that he was studying the revival of a strategic option 
considered late last year, but abandoned at the time, whose implementation may 
be made necessary if the NEA situation worsens. Under that option, Williams 
said, he may seek a one-year, status-quo extension of the NEA, seeking to buy 
time for the agency by putting over substantive deliberations until 1991 and 
removing it from the heat of a congressional election year.

RETALIATE AGAINST TERROR, FLIGHT 103 PANEL ADVISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A presidential commission that investigated the bombing of Pan American Airways 
Flight 103 urged the United States on Tuesday to retaliate for acts of 
terrorism by launching military strikes or other punitive steps against 
terrorists and the nations that support them. 
</P>
<P>
While the panel sidestepped the question of whether such action ought to be 
directed at Iran and Syria, the suspected sponsors of the 1988 attack, 
commission Chairman Ann Dore McLaughlin declared: "When the perpetrators are 
found, they should be punished." 
</P>
<P>
The commission also concluded that a deeply flawed aviation security system 
leaves the nation vulnerable to terrorist attack. It blamed Pan Am and the 
Federal Aviation Administration for failing to enforce requirements that it 
said could have prevented the catastrophic bombing. 
</P>
<P>
And in a blow to what had been touted as a promising new safeguard, the panel 
urged the government to halt deployment of hundreds of bomb detectors in 
airports around the world. It concluded that the costly devices are incapable 
of detecting sophisticated plastic explosives in the small quantity that blew 
the London-to-New York jetliner and its 259 crew members and passengers from 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The 182-page document, drafted by a highly respected team that included four 
members of Congress, offered a sweeping menu of reforms that it said could help 
the nation better fend off such terrorist attacks in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But in a grim conclusion certain to reopen a national debate, the commission 
warned that such attacks will end only if the United States takes aggressive 
new steps to strike back against terrorists and their sponsors -- even if 
available evidence falls short of criminal standards of proof. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, it recommended that the Bush Administration prepare to launch 
direct military strikes against terrorist hideouts abroad. When such action 
appears inappropriate, it urged that the government authorize covert operations 
against the targets. 
</P>
<P>
"State-sponsored terrorism must be faced and must be deterred -- with methods 
that are consistent with the nature of the threat and the U.S. system," said 
the commission report, presented to President Bush by McLaughlin, a former 
secretary of labor. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin disclosed that the commission delivered to the President a separate 
memorandum outlining more specific recommendations about an appropriate U.S. 
response for the Pan Am attack. But the chairman declined further comment, 
saying that the panel's advice would remain confidential. 
</P>
<P>
The public call for retaliation won praise from most American family members of 
those killed in the Pan Am 103 attack, but it was criticized by some British 
relatives of those who perished when the jetliner crashed in Lockerbie, 
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 11 on the ground in addition to those on 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to comment on specific 
recommendations, but he said: "We certainly agree that we need to be as 
aggressive as necessary to fight terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence officials believe that the Pan Am 103 bombing was carried out 
by a Palestinian guerrilla leader with the support of Iran and, to a lesser 
extent, Syria. But the seven-member President's Commission on Aviation Security 
and Terrorism drew no public conclusions about responsibility for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, with a focus on how the bombing occurred, it found fault at nearly 
every level with the system designed to protect American air passengers from 
terror in the sky. Among other conclusions, the panel found that: 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, in violation of FAA regulations, routinely neglected at its high-risk 
airport in Frankfurt, Germany, to hand-search luggage not accompanied by a 
passenger on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA appeared to have condoned the security violations and never disciplined 
Pan Am, even though its investigators warned before the Pan Am attack that the 
airline's security system in Frankfurt was "held together only by . . . the 
tenuous threads of bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
Luggage from Pan Am 103 was left unguarded on a Heathrow Airport tarmac for 
more than half an hour before being loaded aboard a Boeing 747 for the 
London-to-New York leg of the flight, which originated with another plane in 
Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
In contending that the disaster could have been prevented, the McLaughlin 
commission said that more aggressive measures might have intercepted the bomb, 
secreted inside a Toshiba radio-cassette player, before it was loaded onto the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
The commission found that at least one piece of unaccompanied luggage was 
loaded onto the flight in Frankfurt after only an X-ray search -- a technique 
incapable of detecting the deadly Semtex plastic explosive hidden inside the 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
The commission reported that the Pan Am security breach in Frankfurt 
"incredibly" persisted for nearly nine months after the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
But the panel aimed most of its criticism more broadly. 
</P>
<P>
"Terrorists were able to place a bomb on Pan Am 103 not because some one thing 
failed, but because the aviation security system failed," McLaughlin said. "The 
system was flawed and did not provide an effective defense against sabotage." 
</P>
<P>
FAA Administrator James Busey said that he welcomed the report, although he 
objected to some of the adjectives used to describe the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The system was flawed," said Busey, who took over the FAA several months after 
the bombing. "Mistakes were made. I want to own up to those mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett noted that he disagreed with some of the 
commission's criticisms of the airline but said that the report made several 
positive recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
In recommending that the FAA halt its $175-million program to supply Thermal 
Neutron Analysis bomb-detection machines to 150 airports around the world, the 
commission said that it believes the devices cannot detect small but deadly 
quantities of plastic explosive without an unacceptably high rate of false 
alarms. 
</P>
<P>
But Busey, the FAA administrator, said that the agency plans to persist with 
the program.

KREMLIN WARNS U.S. OF TOUGH WEAPONS TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who arrived here Tuesday for four days 
of negotiations with Soviet leaders on arms control issues, will find the 
bargaining tougher than the United States has come to expect from President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Kremlin officials warned. 
</P>
<P>
While hopeful that progress can be made on agreements reducing the two 
superpowers' strategic arsenals and cutting back conventional forces in Europe, 
Soviet officials said that Gorbachev has gone about as far as he can without 
significant U.S. concessions. 
</P>
<P>
"The era of the cheap compromise is over," a senior Soviet foreign policy 
specialist said, "and we have already done about all we dare do unilaterally. 
The next moves will require some difficult decisions for both sides." 
</P>
<P>
While denying that Gorbachev has buckled under pressure from the Soviet 
military and conservatives within the Communist Party leadership, Soviet 
officials acknowledge a new firmness -- much commented upon in the West -- in 
Moscow's approach to arms control negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"We have spoiled the Americans in arms control, and they now expect endless 
unilateral concessions," Leonid Dobrokhotov, a senior party official, commented 
in advance of the Baker visit. "But we have reached the bottom line, the line 
beyond which unilateral moves cannot be made, the line at which the United 
States will have to match us." 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for Baker's talks with Gorbachev and Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the 
Soviet foreign minister, is consequently more somber than at previous rounds of 
negotiations, and the success of the summit meeting between President Bush and 
Gorbachev in Washington starting May 30 is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
While promising "flexibility" and readiness to move on key issues, a senior 
U.S. official traveling with Baker said the U.S. side would be "bitterly 
disappointed" if these talks did not restore agreements that American 
negotiators believed they had won on sea-launched and air-launched cruise 
missiles only to find that Moscow had apparently retreated. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major litmus test by any standard," the U.S. official commented, 
asking not to be quoted by name. "It would be very disturbing if they were not 
willing to go back to what we had in February." 
</P>
<P>
For both sides, the restrictions to be placed on the sea- and air-launched 
cruise missiles -- the number each side may have, how they will be counted, 
what range they may have -- are central to the conclusion of a strategic arms 
reduction treaty. 
</P>
<P>
There are also serious differences over mobile missiles with multiple warheads 
and on heavy, land-based missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement also must be reached on means to verify each side's compliance with 
the proposed treaty, which itself is a highly complex and sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials in recent days have seemed less apprehensive than their U.S. 
counterparts about the possibility of falling well short of even the reduced 
goals they have set for the arms talks. 
</P>
<P>
"We will go as far as we can in these talks, and it may not be that far because 
we will not go for an agreement for its own sake," a Soviet arms specialist 
said. "Then, at the summit, we will seek what agreement we can on the 
outstanding issues and perhaps on principles for the next stage. A smaller 
agreement is better than a bad agreement." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, expressing hope that some issues can be resolved here this week 
and others agreed to in principle at the summit, said that the strategic arms 
negotiators for the two countries will resume work in Geneva on Monday and will 
continue through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda for the Baker visit are the negotiations in Vienna between 
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact on 
reducing conventional armed forces in Central Europe and future arrangements 
for European security after the unification of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot simply let Germany slide by -- for us it is key," commented Andrei 
Kortunov, a foreign policy specialist at the United States of America and 
Canada Institute here. "We know we are not going to war and can assume that a 
strategic arms agreement will be worked out. That is an issue left from 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
"The future of Germany, the shape of the new Europe and its security structure 
-- these are the issues of tomorrow. They are also issues we feel much more 
now." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, U.S. and Soviet officials will discuss a wide range of other 
questions -- human rights, trade, regional conflicts, space cooperation and 
international issues, including terrorism and narcotics trafficking -- to 
prepare the agenda for the Bush-Gorbachev summit. 
</P>
<P>
The secession efforts by the Soviet Union's three Baltic republics -- Estonia, 
Latvia and Lithuania -- will also be discussed, U.S. and Soviet officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Their drive to recover the independence they enjoyed between the two world wars 
has added to the domestic crises facing Gorbachev and has become a potential 
issue in Soviet-American relations. 
</P>
<P>
"To ensure success in Washington in two weeks, there must be real progress in 
the talks with Baker," a Soviet Foreign Ministry official said. "These talks 
will have a big, even decisive role." 
</P>
<P>
Who must move first and who must make the greater concessions to achieve 
last-minute compromises are naturally contentious issues in themselves, and 
each side is maneuvering to place the onus on the other. 
</P>
<P>
"We have serious expectations for a series of agreements on disarmament," a 
senior Soviet foreign policy official said in advance of the Baker visit, 
requesting that he not be quoted by name, "but the current U.S. proposals do 
not take into account our national security. They are fine for the U.S., but 
not for us. There is no balance. . . . We thus are placing great hopes on the 
talks with Baker." 
</P>
<P>
Although many factors are involved, the Soviet Union's multiple crises -- 
economic, political and ethnic -- have restricted Gorbachev's ability to 
maneuver and put him under mounting pressure to ensure the country's national 
security, according to senior Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of many Gorbachev supporters, including senior officials in the 
government and party, the Soviet president must balance himself and all he does 
very carefully to ensure the success of perestroika, his program of political 
and economic restructuring, and his own survival as a political leader. 
</P>
<P>
"For Gorbachev, just as for Bush, any agreement we reach must be ratifiable," 
said Dobrokhotov, the senior party official. "That means it must be clearly in 
our national interests, and our security must be enhanced by it. The cost -- 
what we give up -- moreover, must be balanced and fair, for us as well as to 
the United States, and it must be perceived that way. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The point, made repeatedly by Soviet officials, is that Gorbachev must win 
approval not only within the party's ruling Politburo and its Central Committee 
but from the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, before any arms control 
treaty is signed, and an agreement perceived as one-sided will face strong 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the United States should remember that Gorbachev is not a ruler in 
the Stalinist mold, that he has constituencies, that he must deal with 
contending forces," Prof. Vitaly I. Goldansky, director of the Soviet Academy 
of Sciences' Institute of Physical Chemistry and a Gorbachev adviser on arms 
control, said in an interview Tuesday. "He let that genie of democracy out of 
the bottle, and he has to take into account the views of others." 
</P>
<P>
Those views now include outspoken, even harsh criticism from the far right and 
from some ranking officers of the Soviet military of much of Gorbachev's 
foreign policy, including the unilateral troop reductions now under way, the 
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia and Hungary and some of the 
terms already agreed upon in the strategic arms reduction talks. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev has had to show increased firmness to deal with our multiple, 
compounded crises, and you cannot be tough in one sphere and soft in another," 
one Soviet political commentator remarked. 
</P>
<P>
"And, as much as we want better relations with the United States and arms 
control agreements, the future of perestroika and Gorbachev's continued 
leadership take precedence because they are the key to everything else."

VAN GOGH PAINTING SELLS AT RECORD $82.5 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
ART: 'PORTRAIT OF DR. GACHET' IS AUCTIONED TO A JAPANESE BUYER. THE PREVIOUS

<P>
Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" stunned the art market Tuesday when 
it was auctioned for $82.5 million, shattering the world record price for a 
painting by more than $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
The price was double the estimate by Christie's, a spokeswoman for the auction 
house said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is by far the world's most expensive painting," surpassing the previous 
auction record of $53.9 million bid by Australian businessman Alan Bond for Van 
Gogh's "Irises" in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The money for Bond's bid was largely borrowed from Sotheby's, the house that 
handled the auction. The debt-ridden Bond was eventually forced to sell the 
painting for an undisclosed price to the J. Paul Getty Museum of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified Japanese bidder was in the room during the about 10 minutes of 
bidding that opened at $20 million, Britman said. Toward the end of bidding, 
just two people were vying for the painting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Portrait of Dr. Gachet" was painted six weeks before Van Gogh committed 
suicide in 1890. Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet tended Van Gogh in the weeks before 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
The record price quashed all reports of an art market in recession after last 
week's disappointing contemporary sales. More than 35% of the works had gone 
unsold last week. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd gasped when the bidding reached $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
It had been expected to fetch between $40 million and $50 million at a sale of 
major works by Impressionist and Modern artists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great painting," said Manhattan art dealer Richard Feigen. "It's by a 
rare artist. It's in fine condition. There are practically no paintings like it 
in private hands." 
</P>
<P>
After the bidding, which was tensely conducted between the Japanese dealer and 
a telephone bidder, the jam-packed gallery broke into a standing ovation, 
prompting auctioneer Christopher Burge to pound his gavel to control the house. 
</P>
<P>
The painting was lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1984. It is from the 
collection of Siegfried Kramarsky, a German-born New York banker who died in 
1961. It was put on the block by a trust created under his will. 
</P>

In a letter to artist Paul Gauguin, Van Gogh wrote on June 16 that he had 
painted Gachet "with the heart-broken expression of our time" and that it was 
"not destined to be understood." 
</P>
<P>
Gachet, a practitioner of homeopathic medicine, was Van Gogh's friend and 
physician. He was also close to other Impressionist painters of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh painted a second, slightly larger version of the portrait, which hangs 
in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. It lacks the details of the Kramarsky painting 
and its colors are flatter. 
</P>
<P>
Another Van Gogh from the Kramarsky collection was auctioned in 1987 for $20.24 
million. It too had been lent to the Metropolitan. 
</P>
<P>
The next-highest prices paid for paintings at the world's major auction houses 
are:

MARIJUANA HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT CASH CROP IN IMPOVERISHED EASTERN KENTUCKY. A 
LOOMING EFFORT TO DESTROY POT FIELDS THERE PARALLELS THE COCA BATTLES OF THE 
ANDES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Here in the heart of Appalachia, the silence of spring will soon be shattered 
by the roar of National Guard helicopters. The federal government is taking aim 
at America's No. 1 cash crop -- marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
In a decade of stern anti-drug rhetoric, figures from the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration show that domestic marijuana production has jumped sixfold, 
tripling in the past three years alone. And perhaps nowhere has the 
transformation been so striking as in these hills and hollows of eastern 
Kentucky. This poverty-cursed land, which once drained dollars from moonshine 
stills, now depends largely on a marijuana economy. The back yard boom here in 
America has spawned hostility and an unanswered question in Peru and Bolivia: 
Why is the U.S. government cracking down on coca production in those countries 
while allowing Americans to grow marijuana with impunity at home? The impending 
Bush Administration crackdown marks a belated American attempt to set a better 
example. 
</P>
<P>
But even with a proposed 400% increase in anti-pot spending, the prospects for 
inroads against American marijuana remain bleak. Even the most optimistic 
Administration officials say that an all-out, two-year effort might reduce 
domestic production by a modest 10% at most. 
</P>
<P>
For those who have watched marijuana take control of this impoverished rural 
region, the obstacles appear even more considerable. Far from being a hippie 
pastime, marijuana has become a way of life -- a garden-path to prosperity in 
places where residents have little to lose. 
</P>
<P>
With summer fast approaching, the impending clash in the Marijuana Patch looms 
as a home-grown parallel to the intractable coca struggles of the Andes, as 
governments search for ways to persuade farmers to abandon crops that are 
lucrative but illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky operation will be costly, as helicopter-borne National Guardsmen 
slash and burn marijuana crops. But because the crackdown is intended primarily 
for foreign consumption, the Administration plan is likely to renew an old 
debate about the wisdom of a war on marijuana, a widely used drug about which 
the public has long been ambivalent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to cost a lot of money to get a little payoff," federal drug czar 
William J. Bennett acknowledged recently. But, he hastened to add: "If we don't 
act on our own land, we have no place to stand when we ask others to act on 
theirs." 
</P>
<P>
At least 5,000 tons of American marijuana made its way to the U.S. marketplace 
last year -- enough to meet an unprecedented 35% of the domestic demand. Now 
more potent than dope grown anywhere else in the world -- with eight times the 
kick of 1960s-vintage pot -- a single 1-pound plant brings an average $1,200 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers combined last year to push marijuana higher than corn as the 
nation's biggest cash crop. Farm-gate receipts for pot-growers currently are 
estimated at more than $13 billion. At street prices, the domestic industry is 
even larger, government experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"At minimum, this business is worth $20 billion to $30 billion a year," says 
John P. Sutton, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration's cannabis 
investigations branch. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky is hardly alone among the states as a major marijuana grower. The top 
five states -- which together produce 90% of American-grown pot -- also include 
Hawaii, California, Tennessee and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
But it is in eastern Kentucky, frustrated federal anti-drug officials say, that 
the pot boom most typifies the out-of-control germination that brought the 
marijuana rage to the nation's unlikeliest places. And it is in dirt-poor 
places like Booneville, seat of Appalachia's most impoverished county, that the 
potent weed appears to have assumed the most control. 
</P>
<P>
While the mountain terrain is too steep and remote for any exact accounting, 
the evidence is overwhelming. A full one-third of all the marijuana plants 
cultivated on U.S. public lands are found in this region's multi-county Daniel 
Boone National Forest. And state officials say that even among its pot-rich 
neighbors, Booneville's Owsley County stands out in emerald-green at 
harvest-time when it is viewed from a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Informants tell prosecutors that as many as four in 10 residents now grow 
marijuana for profit. When the crop comes in, the marijuana-growers settle 
their grocery store debts in C-notes. Field hands who earlier seemed to be 
unemployed pay cash for new trucks. Even those who do not grow marijuana 
themselves make clear where their loyalties lie. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean we're bad people," protests Jody Sizemore, a sixth-generation 
Owsley County resident. "We're just poor as Jobe's turkey." 
</P>
<P>
"People used to get out and bad-mouth the growers," said Judge Jimmie W. 
Herald, a bearded young man with a bowl-haircut who is the newly elected top 
official in the county of 6,000 persons. "Now, they just stay quiet." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the transformation began outside eastern Kentucky. By focusing 
its attention on foreign marijuana, the federal government for years provided a 
de facto subsidy for the home-grown market. Meanwhile, a paraquat herbicide 
scare tainted Mexican marijuana in the '70s, and interdiction halted a 
Colombian flow in the '80s. As a result, domestic growers flourished, producing 
the marijuana of choice for the nation's estimated 12-million regular users. 
</P>
<P>
That meant easy cash for anyone willing to take the risk. It was the depths of 
Appalachia, where a moonshiners' legacy gave a particular allure to 
lawlessness, that held the readiest crop of risk-takers. 
</P>
<P>
The rugged terrain proved an ideal camouflage for marijuana, even as it grew to 
three times a man's height. And at big-city prices -- paid to local brokers by 
eager Eastern merchants -- even a small plot could bring profits of thousands 
of dollars. "Topography used to be our curse," said one grower of a 
particularly potent local variety. "But for Bible Weed, it has been a 
blessing." 
</P>
<P>
The result throughout the region was a near-epidemic of pot-growing in 
communities where earlier it had been hard to find even a marijuana cigarette. 
"The people we're finding in the marijuana patches -- by education, skills and 
economic class -- are exactly the same kinds of people as we used to arrest at 
the moonshine stills," said Michael Murphy, an assistant U.S. attorney who 
specializes in drug cases in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"People's out of work, and naturally they got to feed their families," said 
Sheriff Edd Jordan, whose Clay County office already is cluttered with 
marijuana seedlings seized in recent raids. "That's why they got this stuff 
coming in." 
</P>
<P>
If Owsley County has now become home to the most concentrated of the state's 
pot-growing, residents and outside experts both say the most important 
explanation lies in its down-and-out economic status. With a per-capita income 
of less than one-fourth the national average, the county is devoid of any real 
industry. Of the 20 coal mines in operation in 1980, only two remain. The 
average tobacco plot brings in about $2,000 a year. Nearly everyone who works 
must cross county lines. 
</P>
<P>
"What else are our people going to grow?" asked Charles Beach Jr., vice 
president of a Beattyville bank that serves much of Owsley County. "Nobody 
thinks anything more of growing marijuana than when they were stripping tobacco 
stalks and hauling it to market." 
</P>
<P>
Over a pork-chop lunch at the Purple Cow restaurant, Food Town grocery store 
owner Junior Brewer nodded his head in agreement. "A lot of these people just 
don't have anything to lose," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
As in the case of moonshine-making during the 1930s, such Appalachian 
desperation has bred stubborn resistance in the face of just about every 
government effort to beat back the Marijuana Patch. While in Northern 
California the seven-year Campaign Against Marijuana Planting shrank the crop 
there by about two-thirds, Kentucky and its neighboring states can hardly claim 
a single success. Every year, machete-wielding lawmen cut down more marijuana; 
and every year, more of it is grown. 
</P>
<P>
The difference, federal officials contend, is that the old California growers 
were largely outsiders who fled in the face of government pressure. In eastern 
Kentucky, the problem is home-grown. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it's going to take to get control of it," said an 
exasperated Jack Gregory, a Forest Service official who heads up anti-marijuana 
efforts in the South. "The fact is, the dope growers outnumber the good guys." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when the Kentucky state police and National Guard mounted a joint 
"whack-and-stack" offensive against Owsley County marijuana early last summer, 
they found locals so hostile that one storekeeper padlocked his store rather 
than sell soft drinks to the "brought-ins." 
</P>
<P>
And when the lawmen pulled into a nearby gas station for a fill-up, they found 
the pumps suddenly rendered inoperable. By day's end, the team had to regroup 
at a makeshift supply depot on safer ground -- the parking lot of a fast-food 
restaurant in a neighboring county. 
</P>
<P>
If the government has its way in the new war on marijuana, huge increases in 
manpower and machinery this summer will make such resistance irrelevant. The 
Administration proposes to increase anti-pot spending from about $9 million 
last year and $18 million this summer to more than $36 million beginning Oct. 
1. Millions of dollars more in Pentagon assistance already is on its way to the 
National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the White House is planning a major prosecution effort aimed 
at interrupting a pattern that has resulted in the destruction of millions of 
plants, yet permitted most growers to go free and plant again. 
</P>
<P>
But with the initial stage of Kentucky's operations already under way -- and 
the first of a projected fourfold increase in National Guard air missions 
slated to begin in less than two weeks -- pressure on both sides is such that 
it is uncertain what the effect of the crackdown might be. 
</P>
<P>
In eastern Kentucky courtrooms, lawyers and judges say, past prosecution 
efforts have stalled -- not because evidence has been lacking but because 
small-town juries no longer recognize marijuana-growing as a serious crime. 
Prosecutors strain to recall when last they won a marijuana case, telling 
instead of countless hung juries even in the face of ironclad evidence. So 
clannish are these counties that a defendant is inevitably an acquaintance, 
causing jurors to think twice about judging a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in court, the people really do have a lethargic attitude when it comes to 
marijuana," said Commonwealth Atty. Thomas K. Hall, whose responsibilities 
include Owsley County. Adds another embittered prosecutor: "The judge is not 
going to put his people in jail." 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly," said Commonwealth Atty. B. Robert Stivers of Clay County, "it's 
almost impossible to get a conviction." 
</P>
<P>
In frustration, the state now plans to turn to federal courts for help with 
marijuana-cultivation cases from the most-blighted counties. In that 
more-removed system, prosecutors have succeeded in winning prison sentences of 
as much as five years. 
</P>
<P>
But at all levels, officials acknowledge that such a stop-gap solution is 
unlikely to affect the so-called small-time grower, whose 50 well-tended plants 
might bring a net income of close to $50,000 a year. In Owsley County, such an 
entrepreneur still need have little fear of prosecution. A significant reason, 
officials hint: Marijuana-induced apathy has not stopped at the line of the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to be a fool not to notice that all these big 'uns everybody's 
talking about, nothing's ever happened to them," said Stivers, the county 
prosecutor. "Hell, yeah, there's corruption. And that's all I'm going to say." 
</P>
<P>
The airborne assaults may bypass courts and sheriffs, but critics remain 
skeptical that even an all-out air war this summer can finally reverse the 
marijuana boom. Public opposition to aerial spraying leaves the government with 
one hand tied. 
</P>
<P>
And already, some growers have sought to blunt the more-rudimentary "machete" 
offensive, either by planting decoy crops or by scattering their pot plants to 
ensure that at least some remain unscathed. While authorities contend that the 
growers' new caution is a sign that the government is making progress, they 
acknowledge that the 750,000-acre Daniel Boone Forest still offers plenty of 
places to hide. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been one for the thieves, one for the helicopters, and one for 
me," said Harper Corder, a Forest Service special agent. 
</P>
<P>
In a land where guns and mining explosives are commonplace, there are also new 
signs of resistance of a more-assertive sort. Deadly booby-traps, now rarely 
seen around marijuana fields elsewhere, tripled in number last year in eastern 
Kentucky. Marijuana-related murders took three lives in Owsley County. And in 
these heavily timbered woods, arson is a constant -- and often-heard -- threat. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in counties mistrustful of outside authority and grateful for 
even illicit riches ("Marijuana?" a grinning car dealer said. "That is the 
economy.") there are new indications that the crackdown will face stiff 
resistance. Some Owsley County residents tell of the 21-year-old who cracked up 
his brand-new Corvette on a mountain road last month, then walked away 
untroubled. "It was paid for," he told onlookers, "And so's the next one." 
</P>
<P>
And even when the stories are scornful -- the backwoods family that weekly 
squandered hundreds of dollars in marijuana riches on store-bought potato soup, 
a pre-prosperity delicacy -- there is solidarity in a mountain kinship. 
</P>
<P>
"You might not like what some of your neighbors are doing, but you like the 
people," said Sizemore, the lifelong Owsley County resident. "You might wish it 
to stop, but not so bad that you'd wish anything bad to happen to them." 
</P>
<P>
"Every time they go out there with those helicopters, that's a vote for me," 
chortled Gatewood Galbraith, a Lexington lawyer who is gambling a dark-horse 
gubernatorial campaign on a legalize-marijuana platform tailored for eastern 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
In South America, politicians will be watching as well -- but for different 
reasons. Resentful of an Administration plan to link foreign aid to 
coca-eradication, Peru and Bolivia have already made clear that they view the 
marijuana-crackdown as a test of U.S. hypocrisy. "In reality, we have to prove 
to these countries that we're serious about our own effort," said the DEA's 
Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, with the Administration preparing to dispatch $175 million in 
assistance to help wean Andean farmers from their illegal coca crops, some 
wonder whether the parallel ought to be drawn more exactly. 
</P>
<P>
"Marijuana has become a way of survival for some of these folks," said Richard 
(Smitty) Taylor, who heads the Drug-Free Kentucky Commission for Gov. Wallace 
Wilkinson. "If you don't address the economic system in these places, 
ultimately, you're not going to be successful."

MEXICO REOPENS PROBE OF CAMARENA'S KILLING 
</P>

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mexican government is reopening its investigation into the 1985 murder of a 
U.S. drug enforcement agent, a move apparently designed to confront new 
allegations that might emerge from the trial of four suspects in the killing, 
which began in Los Angeles on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican attorney general's office announced late Monday the opening of a 
special affairs office that will "review in its totality" the investigation 
into the torture and murder of Enrique Camarena in Guadalajara. A special 
prosecutor is to be named today. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials privately have expressed concern that the Camarena trial will 
be sensationalist and possibly implicate current or former government officials 
in drug trafficking. They fear that the U.S. government will use the trial to 
pressure Mexico to hand over other suspects. 
</P>
<P>
In a hint of what lies ahead, the prosecution released a memo earlier this 
month alleging that Mexico City Police Chief Javier Garcia Paniagua, once head 
of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, had attended an October, 1984, 
meeting to plan Camarena's murder. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials were angered by the public allegations, noting that Garcia 
Paniagua has never been indicted in the case. Mexico's drug czar, Javier Coello 
Trejo, said last week that the government has had no reason to suspect Garcia 
Paniagua or to investigate him. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a very respected politician in Mexico who has demonstrated his honesty," 
Coello said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that several prosecution witnesses in the Camarena case are 
"delinquents. . . . No authority can value the testimony of a delinquent." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials expressed skepticism about the attorney general's decision to 
reopen the Mexican investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it could be damage control," said one U.S. source who asked not to be 
identified by name. He noted that Mexico does not have strong conspiracy laws 
that would be needed to prosecute officials suspected of complicity in the 
killing and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo previously has maintained that all 
those involved in the Camarena killing have been brought to justice. About two 
dozen people have been convicted in Mexico of involvement in Camarena's 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's press release said the government will "proceed 
according to Mexican law" on the case, implying that any future charges would 
be handled in Mexico.

FEINSTEIN'S BUDGET 'DEFICIT' CREATION OF AN ACCOUNTANT; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: SAN FRANCISCO SHORTFALL WAS CALCULATED WITH ASSUMPTION OF SPIRALING 
COSTS AND FLAT REVENUES. VAN DE KAMP MADE USE OF ISSUE DURING GUBERNATORIAL 
CANDIDATES' DEBATE.

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, the situation seems like political dynamite: San Francisco 
Mayor Dianne Feinstein is handed a $152.6-million budget surplus in 1982 and 
six years later leaves office with a $174.2-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Is this the kind of manager Californians want for governor? Atty. Gen. John Van 
de Kamp, running against Feinstein for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, 
thinks not -- and made the point forcefully in Sunday's televised debate. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a word Mrs. Feinstein just can't use. . . . Say the word 'deficit,' 
the 'D' word," Van de Kamp told Feinstein during the debate. "It's easy, and I 
think you'll feel better. All of us make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
The facts about Feinstein's Administration, however, are far murkier than 
campaign polemics. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Feinstein never produced a deficit budget during her tenure as San 
Francisco mayor. As with all San Francisco mayors, she was forbidden by law to 
run a deficit. Her final budget in 1987-88 actually ended with a $16.2-million 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
The next year -- 1988-89, the year in which the massive deficit was predicted 
-- the new mayor, Art Agnos, worked with the city Board of Supervisors to shape 
a budget that ended with a $40.9-million surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Where did the "deficit" go? Nowhere. It never actually existed. It was not a 
real deficit but only a projected budget shortfall -- an over-cautious 
accountant's paper nightmare that assumed spiraling costs and flat revenues. 
</P>
<P>
City Budget Analyst Harvey Rose said San Francisco has projected a deficit 
every year since the surplus -- it is pegged at $23 million in 1990-91 -- and 
every year the city deals with it by scaling back spending and raising revenues 
until a small surplus is left to carry ahead to the next year. 
</P>
<P>
But while the 1988 shortfall -- and, to a lesser extent, the 1982 surplus -- 
was the creation of an accountant's pen, it nevertheless can give some insight 
into Feinstein's administrative skill, which is critical to her sales pitch in 
the June primary for governor. 
</P>
<P>
The surplus -- really more like a one-time windfall than a carefully husbanded 
municipal savings account -- gave Feinstein the opportunity to set her own 
agenda while demonstrating her ability to manage political pressures to spend. 
</P>
<P>
The shortfall -- a yearly phenomenon ballooned to politically damaging size by 
events largely beyond her control -- illustrated how she dealt with a hungry 
bureaucracy and how she approached necessary but unpopular tax hikes and 
service cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 surplus was the product of a happy confluence of two events: heavy 
rains and a favorable state Supreme Court decision. The rain filled the city's 
Hetch Hetchy Reservoir near Yosemite, letting the city generate a lot of cheap 
hydroelectricity at a healthy profit. The court let the city keep business tax 
hikes made to compensate for the property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, with the consent of the Board of Supervisors, spent most of that 
money in the next two years, said Rose, mainly on items that had been deferred 
because of fears of the effects of Proposition 13. Buses were bought, potholes 
patched, police officers hired and the city's permanent payroll expanded. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the surplus went to these areas, assisting white-collar and service 
workers and downtown business interests. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, new social problems were taking more of the city's attention -- and 
resources. A growing homeless population pushed up welfare costs, for example, 
while AIDS was starting to nibble away at public-health funds. A smaller share 
of the surplus was spent on those programs. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have chided Feinstein for using the surplus to balloon the city's 
24,000-person payroll, which already was unusually large because of the wide 
range of public-transit and other services provided directly by the city rather 
than by the independent public agencies used elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Rose said the city had 2,777 more permanent full-time employees at the end of 
Feinstein's tenure than when she entered office. But, the budget analyst noted, 
many of those people already were long-term city workers at the time they were 
formally added to the payroll; they had just been hidden in the books as 
"temporary" workers or outside contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Rose said relatively few additional jobs were created. He noted that Agnos, a 
Feinstein rival who blamed her for wrecking the city's finances, has expanded 
the city payroll this fiscal year alone by 1,150 positions, including a 
controversial team of highly paid deputy mayors. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos spokesman Scott Shafer said the mayor is not interested in discussing 
Feinstein's record. City Controller Samuel D. Yockey, an Agnos nominee who had 
been critical of Feinstein in the past, also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she did extraordinarily well, considering the tremendous pressure to 
spend," said Rudolf Nothenberg, the city's Chief Administrative Officer, a 
Feinstein appointee. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Nothenberg said, conservatives urged her to cut taxes or invest 
the surplus in capital improvements -- roads, buildings and buses. About half 
the surplus eventually was spent that way. Nothenberg said some surplus was 
used for expanded services, which eventually would have to be withdrawn or 
supported by taxes or fees. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine denying all those needs, all those requests while sitting on 
this pile of money? That clearly is impossible," he said. "It is not even clear 
to me that to do that would have been good public policy." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very generous city," said a private consultant to the city who asked 
not to be named. "People want, and expect, certain services, and do not want to 
be told we can't afford it when the city has a surplus." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein critics in San Francisco counter that saying no is a crucial part of 
being the city's chief executive. They contend she sometimes could not deny 
bureaucrats and legislators, as when she chose not to veto a generous Board of 
Supervisors' pay package even though she objected to its cost. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor has the budget team and the mayor knows the budget so the mayor 
should be able to keep things under control," said veteran Supervisor Richard 
Hongisto, who vocally needled Feinstein in 1985 for overcommitting the surplus 
and setting the city up for fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Hongisto and others said, was that after four years of tighter 
budgets after Proposition 13 property-tax cuts, city department heads hungrily 
grabbed for a slice of surplus to make up for earlier cuts and to cushion 
potential future budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"Department heads all collected in her office like little birds in a nest, 
constantly chirping for more, more, more," Hongisto said. "The mayor of San 
Francisco can control those urges, but in this case just didn't." 
</P>
<P>
But did spending launched by a surplus-rich Feinstein push San Francisco to the 
brink of bankruptcy, as Van de Kamp's ads imply? Not according to Rose and 
Yockey. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint report presented to an alarmed Board of Supervisors in February, 
1989, at the height of the did-Dianne-or-didn't-she frenzy, the city's top two 
budget-watchers concluded that blame for their projected $172.4-million budget 
shortfall lay outside the mayor's suite. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of it, $53 million, was because of city worker pay hikes mandated 
by the city charter. Another $48.4 million was lost to lower than expected tax 
revenues, in part because the October, 1987, stock market tumble had inhibited 
consumer spending. This meant lower city revenue for everything from sales tax 
to real estate transfer fees. 
</P>
<P>
To cover a possible settlement of a back-pay lawsuit by city employees, the 
city had to set aside $40 million. Drought, another surprise, cut Hetch-Hetchy 
power sales by $15 million. Voters contributed to the shortfall by repealing a 
city utility tax that had raised $10 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos remedied the problem by deferring worker pay hikes for a year, paying off 
legal liabilities over several years rather than at once, shaving down reserve 
funds and hiking a variety of fees and business taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein urged many of those measures herself -- though she left them for the 
more liberal Agnos to actually implement -- after the large size of the 
projected shortfall became public. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my impression when she left (City Hall) that more was made of that 
'deficit' than there really was," said San Francisco political consultant Sam 
Singer, who is not involved in the gubernatorial campaign. "I personally find 
it hard to believe she'd leave the city in a bind, knowing her . . . spending 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," he added, "she knew she was going to run for higher office in the 
near future. So why would she let it happen? Why would she open herself up for 
that kind of criticism?"

FEINSTEIN AND VAN DE KAMP CALL FOR SPRAYING HALT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic candidate for governor Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday called for an end 
to aerial malathion spraying against the Medfly. And she said her Democratic 
opponent, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, should cease carrying out any duties 
as attorney for the government in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco, said the spraying has gone on long 
enough. And if she were governor, she continued, she would stop it now. 
</P>
<P>
"Urban malathion has demonstrated in terms of city environment it is harmful," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp responded that if he were governor, he too would halt the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't worked and it's time to stop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he would continue to represent the pro-spraying policies of 
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian in court "because he has the legal right to 
implement his policy." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein did not accept that reasoning. She noted that on other issues, 
whether a logging controversy on the North Coast or implementation of an 
anti-toxics initiative, Democratic Van de Kamp has declined to represent the 
policies of Republican Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come, Mr. Attorney General, if you are opposed to urban malathion 
spraying, to say, 'Governor, I cannot in good conscience support you,' and then 
withdraw." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein once supported limited spraying with the condition that it be halted 
at a date certain. The state did set a deadline but has now exceeded it. Van de 
Kamp had held a similar position. Tuesday was the first time either has called 
for an immediate end to the flights of helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson, the Republican who one of the Democrats will meet in 
November, has supported the state's spraying program. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not simply a threat to California agriculture," Wilson told reporters 
last week. "(It) is a threat to the entire nation." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he backs the spraying of "dilute malathion" -- adding that if state 
officials were to abandon the spraying program, federal agriculture officials 
would be pressured to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson won his Senate seat in a 1982 contest with former Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr., whose reputation suffered when he held off spraying malathion during a 
Northern California infestation in the early 1980s.

OPENING VOLLEYS IN CAMARENA CASE; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: PROSECUTORS SAY THEY WILL SHOW AGENT'S MURDER WAS PART OF A CAMPAIGN TO 
'INTIMIDATE THE DEA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Leaders of a Mexican narcotics cartel tortured and murdered U.S. drug agent 
Enrique Camarena in retaliation for raids that had cost the traffickers $5 
billion, a federal prosecutor said Tuesday as a trial began for four men 
accused in the 1985 slaying. 
</P>
<P>
In opening arguments before a federal jury in Los Angeles, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
John L. Carlton said he would prove that the narcotics cartel, which involved 
high-placed officials of the Mexican government, had been stung by two 
successful raids by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1984, and began a 
campaign "to intimidate the DEA." 
</P>
<P>
"The cartel's anger and frustration," Carlton said, "increasingly focused on 
one DEA agent," and that agent was Camarena, a veteran based in Guadalajara at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
His murder has become a rallying point for U.S. law enforcement engaged in the 
self-described war against drugs, and the DEA's dogged crusade to avenge the 
death of one of its own has brought additional controversy to the case, 
heightening tensions between the U.S. and Mexican governments. 
</P>
<P>
Carlton said much of the prosecution's case against the four defendants would 
depend on the testimony of confidential informants, some of whom he 
acknowledged had committed crimes. He attacked Mexican law enforcement, saying 
that members of the federal security directorate, that country's equivalent of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, were on the payroll of drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The four defendants claim they are wrongly accused, and in opening statements 
their individual attorneys attacked the credibility of paid prosecution 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Carlton's 75-minute presentation, Jose Antonio Ortiz, an assistant 
to Mexico's Los Angeles consul general, sat in the audience on the second floor 
of the federal courthouse downtown, busily taking notes, evidence of the 
Mexican government's concern about the U.S. handling of the case. 
</P>
<P>
The four defendants are Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a convicted Honduran drug 
kingpin; Ruben Zuno Arce, the brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis 
Echeverria Alvarez; Juan Bernabe Ramirez, a former Mexican policeman; and 
Javier Vasquez Velasco. 
</P>
<P>
Carlton said that Matta and Zuno were among the plotters of Camarena's 
kidnaping and murder, and that Bernabe acted as a guard at the house while the 
agent was interrogated and tortured. Matta is accused of murder, although the 
prosecution has not alleged that he did the killing. All three of these men are 
charged with conspiring to kidnap Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez is alleged to have killed John Walker and Alberto Radelat, two U.S. 
tourists who were mistaken for DEA agents after they stumbled into a restaurant 
meeting of Guadalajara drug traffickers one week before Camarena was slain. 
Vasquez has been charged with committing a violent crime in aid of 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
All four defendants face life imprisonment if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the first day of the long-awaited trial was devoted to opening 
statements before the jury of six men and six women. The first witness, a 
former DEA agent, took the stand in mid-afternoon. The courtroom was filled for 
the trial, which is expected to last two months. 
</P>
<P>
Among accusations leveled by Carlton in his opening statement was that Zuno 
acted as a link between the drug cartel and the highest levels of the Mexican 
government. 
</P>
<P>
In a new assertion, he said that Zuno gave specific instructions on how 
Camarena should be interrogated at a Guadalajara house after he was kidnaped on 
Feb. 7, 1985, outside the U.S. Consulate there. 
</P>
<P>
More than two dozen persons have been convicted of crimes related to the 
slaying in Mexico and several are serving long prison sentences. Last year, 
after two of Mexico's leading drug kingpins -- Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto 
Fonseca Carrillo -- were convicted of the murder there, Mexico's attorney 
general declared that all the killers had been brought to justice and that the 
case was closed. 
</P>
<P>
None of the four men on trial now has been charged in Mexico. As the trial 
opened, however, the Mexican attorney general announced in Mexico City that he 
was reopening his country's investigation of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers attempted to persuade the jury to consider their clients 
individually, not as part of a group. One of Matta's lawyers, Michael Burns, 
stressed that the defendants were sitting at separate tables. 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution will attempt to fool you into convicting an innocent man," 
said Burns. Last year, Matta was convicted in U.S. court on separate charges of 
moving cocaine worth $73 million through Los Angeles. He was given a life 
sentence. Burns acknowledged in court that Matta, 45, currently faces other 
drug trafficking charges in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's in another court. . . . that's for another day," Burns said. "This 
is not a drug trial. This is a murder trial . . . What I want you to understand 
is that you should give a man who may or not be a drug dealer a fair trial on 
other charges." 
</P>
<P>
The trial's first fireworks erupted before Carlton had finished his remarks. 
Another of Matta's defense team, Martin R. Stolar, objected vociferously to 
Carlton's statement that two strands of Matta's hair were found at the 
Guadalajara house where Camarena was tortured and murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Stolar asked Judge Edward Rafeedie to allow him to call an expert 
witness to examine the hairs with an electron microscope, which he said is more 
sophisticated than the method used by the FBI in determining that the hair was 
Matta's. Rafeedie has not ruled on that motion. Outside the presence of the 
jury, he denied Stolar's request to declare a mistrial because of Carlton's 
reference to the hairs. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the jurors took notes as they tried to absorb a blizzard of names -- 
many of them long Spanish names -- involved in the tangled case. 
</P>
<P>
According to Carlton, on the day Camarena disappeared he had made arrangements 
to meet his wife for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"He never made that appointment," Carlton said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he was kidnaped outside the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara. A month 
later, Camarena's mutilated body was found at a ranch 65 miles from 
Guadalajara, along with that of Alfredo Zavala Avelar, a pilot for the Mexican 
agriculture department who had served as a DEA informant, scouting for 
marijuana fields. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Zavala had led Camarena and other agents to two major marijuana fields 
operated by the Guadalajara cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Carlton said Camarena and Zavala "were kidnaped, tortured and murdered because 
they did their work too well." 
</P>
<P>
Zuno's attorney, Edward Medvene, a federal prosecutor some years ago, made the 
lengthiest opening statement of the defense lawyers. He called Camarena's 
killers "animals" who were not connected to his client. 
</P>
<P>
Medvene emphatically denied that Zuno had any involvement in the Camarena 
killing and said that it took the government four years and nine months to come 
up with a witness against his client -- a man who is now a government-paid 
informant, Hector Cervantes Santos. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said Cervantes had been found by a DEA operative named Antonio 
Garate Bustamante, a figure of controversy in the case. The government does not 
plan to call the L.A.-based Garate as a witness. He is the self-proclaimed 
architect of the kidnaping of a Mexican doctor who also has been indicted in 
the case and is facing charges. 
</P>
<P>
Medvene stressed that Cervantes had been relocated to the United States by the 
DEA. He told the jurors that Cervantes and three other prospective witnesses 
against his client had been paid $188,000 for information and expenses by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney added that a group of confidential informants expected to testify 
in the case had been paid a total of more than $800,000 by the government. 
Medvene utilized a large chart to illustrate the payments for the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Medvene accused the government of having a convicted drug dealer put into 
solitary confinement at a federal prison after he refused to testify against 
Zuno and told the jurors that one of the witnesses against his client would be 
a man who had committed 35 murders. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he said that Zuno, 59, would take the stand in his own defense. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Nicolaysen, Vasquez's lawyer, and Mary Kelly, Bernabe's lawyer, made 
only brief statements proclaiming their clients innocent. 
</P>
<P>
The government's first witness was James Kuykendall, who retired from the DEA 
last June after 16 years with the agency. He headed the DEA's Guadalajara 
office from 1982 to 1985, and worked extensively with Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
Kuykendall, who will return to the witness stand today, gave a detailed 
presentation of DEA operations in Mexico. Carlton asked him several questions 
about Mexican law enforcement agencies, including the federal security 
directorate. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure what their function was," he said. "Many of the ones we met acted 
as henchmen for major narcotics traffickers." 
</P>
<P>
This is the second Los Angeles trial stemming from Camarena's murder. Three men 
were convicted in a 1988 trial and given long prison sentences. Sixteen other 
persons have been indicted, including the four currently on trial.

<P>
BOTH SIDES IN PACIFIC NORTHWEST'S SPOTTED OWL FIGHT AGREE MEASURE HAS MERIT.

<P>
In a move that jumped onto the front pages in the Pacific Northwest, Sen. Bob 
Packwood (R-Ore.) recently won overwhelming Senate approval of a measure to 
give states the power to ban log exports from state-owned land. 
</P>
<P>
It has turned out to be a masterstroke of politics. Tensions in the region are 
rising over an anticipated decision next month by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service declaring the rare spotted owl a threatened or endangered species. 
Timber interests say that could reduce logging on federal lands in the 
Northwest by 50%, resulting in a loss of 13,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists, including a large number of city dwellers in the region, 
believe the owl should be saved and that clear-cutting practices have gone too 
far. 
</P>
<P>
Packwood's measure has united both sides, at least for a while. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated one in four trees felled in the Northwest is loaded onto ships for 
export. Two-thirds of those unmilled logs go to Japan. The commonly held belief 
is that because of trade barriers in Japan, relatively small amounts of 
finished lumber products produced in Northwest mills are exported. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides see a gain in the legislation. Millworkers believe a log export ban 
would pressure Japan into increasing its imports of finished lumber, thus 
increasing employment in the mills. While lumber exports are increasing, the 
volume of logs sent overseas last year -- 4.33 billion board feet -- dwarfed 
the 2.33 billion board feet of exported lumber. 
</P>
<P>
For millworkers in the Northwest, "the squeeze is really starting," said Julia 
Brim-Edwards, spokeswoman for Packwood. " . . . They want some type of action 
now in anticipation that things are going to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, environmentalists and the increasingly urban populations of 
the Northwest see the potential in the measure for less logging of old-growth 
forest where the spotted owl lives. 
</P>
<P>
A Seattle Times poll showed that by a margin of 52% to 38%, people in 
Washington want the spotted owl saved, even if it means job losses. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Lands Commissioner Brian Boyle, who is responsible for managing 
state timberland, said "our environment can't keep up" with clear-cutting 
practices. "The industry has brought down the wrath of the public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The move to ban log exports redirects some of the wrath. Virtually everyone in 
Oregon wants to ban log exports. Last June, more than 90% of the voters cast 
ballots favoring an end to exports of logs cut on state land. 
</P>
<P>
Packwood's measure wouldn't affect Washington state, at least not immediately. 
Washington's constitution requires that the state sell its logs to the highest 
bidders, all of which happen to be countries in Asia. There is, however, a move 
to repeal that provision from the state constitution. Washington is the 
nation's largest log exporter. The payoff for the state is big. Several hundred 
million dollars annually from state timber sales help fund public schools in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Packwood's measure is expected to go to a conference committee this week. At 
the same time, Rep. John Miller (R-Wash.) is pushing a measure that seeks to 
limit exports from Washington state land, allow complete bans on exports from 
state land in California and Oregon and reduce by half the amount of federal 
timber that could be sold to exporters. 
</P>
<P>
One catch: Will a log export ban really put the squeeze on the Japanese? 
</P>
<P>
The day after the Senate passed the measure by an 81-17 vote, U.S. and Japanese 
trade negotiators announced a pact that proponents say could increase the sale 
of finished U.S. wood products by $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
But that could be the extent of the U.S. leverage. John E. Keatley, land and 
timber manager for the Weyerhaeuser Co. in Longview, Wash., pointed out that 
there are plenty of other suppliers for Japan's 18,000 sawmills, including the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think they're going to let us put the skids on 18,000 sawmills?" 
Keatley asked. "Come on."

As Dominicans prepare to elect a president today, the paradox, like the

<P>
Almost half of the population of 7.2 million is too young to vote, and more 
than half of the rest are under 40. Yet both leading candidates are over 80 -- 
and it shows.

President Joaquin Balaguer, 83, seems as mentally sharp as he was as a young 
lawyer, but he is physically frail, blind and vulnerable to a widely asked 
question: "When they hand him an official paper, how does he know what he's 
signing?" 
</P>
<P>
His lifelong opponent, Juan Bosch, has enjoyed an edge in pre-election polls, 
but he will be 81 next month, and already his occasional attention gaps and 
memory lapses have begun to embarrass supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two octogenarians reportedly share warm personal feelings toward 
one another, Balaguer has not hesitated to take unsubtle digs at Bosch's 
apparent autumnal failings. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Balaguer campaign broadcast a television commercial that showed 
an apparently befuddled Bosch take a 19-second pause to collect his thoughts 
while replying to a question at a meeting with the local American Chamber of 
Commerce. The awkward pause ended with a Balaguer announcement that "a man who 
thinks like that can't govern the country." 
</P>
<P>
The incumbent's campaign has also stressed its slogan "Balaguer, a Road Without 
Danger" to remind voters of Bosch's Marxist past and his reputation for 
unpredictability. 
</P>
<P>
Bosch may unwittingly have bolstered that image near the end of the election 
campaign when, while speaking to a group of Protestant leaders, he implied that 
he would loosen ties between the government and the dominant Roman Catholic 
Church by naming Protestant chaplains to prisons and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The pledge reminded some voters of Bosch's brief term as president in 1963, 
when he angered Catholics by proposing a constitutional ban on religious 
education in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Balaguer jumped immediately on Bosch's remark and led off his final campaign 
speech Sunday with the cry: "We have no such disposition! The Dominican people 
believe in God!" 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that by opening the religious issue, Bosch may have 
thrown away the 10-point lead that most polls have given him during the past 
year. After confidently predicting a Bosch victory over a Balaguer 
administration that has presided over 50% inflation and deteriorating public 
services, they now view the race as too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
Today's voting marks the fifth time the old warhorses have faced each other at 
the polls, with Balaguer winning the previous four contests. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the candidates have had a lifetime preoccupation with governing the 
Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Bosch, a self-educated high school dropout, poet, novelist and historian who is 
called "the Professor" because of his wide-ranging knowledge, opposed the 
31-year dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and spent three decades in 
exile, much of it in Communist Cuba. After Trujillo's assassination 29 years 
ago, Bosch won the country's first democratic election in December, 1962, and 
served as president for seven months until ousted in a military coup. 
</P>
<P>
When dissident officers triggered a civil war in 1965 to restore the 
constitution and put Bosch back in office, President Lyndon B. Johnson sent in 
27,000 U.S. troops to protect the country from "becoming another Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Balaguer was in exile, widely reviled for having served as the 
unelected figurehead president under the hated Trujillo. But when new elections 
ended the U.S. presence in 1966, Balaguer won and has missed only two 
presidential terms since. 
</P>
<P>
As president he has patched together a failing economy by spending sums, 
estimated at more than $2 billion, on public building projects, including a 
towering lighthouse monument to Christopher Columbus just outside Santo 
Domingo. Balaguer makes no secret of his ambition to remain president long 
enough to dedicate the monument in 1992, the 500th anniversary of Columbus' 
voyage to America, when Pope John Paul II and King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia 
of Spain will visit. 
</P>
<P>
Criticized for running government money-printing presses overtime to erect 
monuments to himself, Balaguer is said to have replied, "The Pharaoh isn't 
remembered for what he did to the price of flour." 
</P>
<P>
But his greatest weakness at the polls, analysts say, remains his inability to 
curb inflation and restore public services. Inflation has left the peso with 
361% less purchasing power than when he was last sworn in four years ago, and 
about half of the work force is unemployed or underemployed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their frailties, neither man appeared the least burned out by the 
three-month election campaign, which ended Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are six other candidates, only two are expected to receive as 
much as 10% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
At a political rally for Pena Gomez in Santiago on Sunday, an onlooker was 
asked if he stood a chance of winning. "None," was the reply. Then who will 
win? he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, the old man."

<P>
The following are among the recommendations of the President's Commission on 
Aviation Security and Terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
SECURITY MEASURES 
</P>
<P>
The FAA must develop stronger security for checked baggage, persons with access 
to aircraft and screening of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA administrator should establish an office of security reporting directly 
to administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA should defer any program of purchasing new passenger screening 
equipment until it is sensitive enough to detect very small amounts of plastic 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
DEALING WITH TERRORISTS 
</P>
<P>
The United States should ensure that all government resources are prepared for 
active measures -- preemptive or retaliatory, direct or covert -- against 
targets in countries engaged in state-sponsored terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
The United States must refuse to allow terrorist attacks to alter U.S. 
political and economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
TREATMENT OF VICTIMS' FAMILIES 
</P>
<P>
The State Department should always contact victims' families, even when airline 
already has announced deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department should, whenever possible, assign to each family one 
person and an alternate to act as liaison. 
</P>
<P>
The President should seek legislation authorizing and permanently appropriating 
funds to provide monetary benefits and tax relief for any American victim of a 
terrorist act.

ARMS CONTROL STICKING POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are some main points of disagreement in U.S.-Soviet arms control 
negotiations, one of the issues to be discussed at the superpower summit that 
begins May 30. 
</P>
<P>
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks: The two sides disagree on range limits for 
cruise missiles deployed on aircraft and naval forces. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is resisting limits on future deployments of sea-launched cruise 
missiles. Also disputed are limits on mobile land-based intercontinental 
ballistic missiles and anti-cheating measures. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional Forces in Europe: Two main obstacles are defining limits on 
aircraft and personnel. Work also remains on tanks, armored combat vehicles, 
artillery and helicopters. Anti-cheating provisions are in an early stage of 
discussion, and the virtual dissolution of the Warsaw Pact has opened new 
debate about how the treaty would be applied to individual nations. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical Weapons: Soviets are resisting an American plan to retain about 500 
tons of poison gas, or about 2% of the U.S. stockpile, after signing a global 
ban on the weapons. As a precursor to such a ban, the superpowers are 
negotiating a bilateral deal to reduce their stockpiles to 5,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Open Skies: These NATO-Warsaw Pact negotiations to allow unarmed aircraft of 
each alliance to fly over the territory of the other are snagged on quotas for 
such flights and what types of sensors would be allowed on the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear Testing Talks: Highly technical and relatively minor disagreements 
remain, and settlement is expected in time for signing at the summit. The aim 
is to set verification measures for two existing but unratified treaties that 
limit the yield of nuclear tests.

HUNGARY'S PRESIDENT SAYS BALTIC STATES' INDEPENDENCE DRIVE IS UNSTOPPABLE

Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia's bids for independence "cannot be stopped," new 
Hungarian President Arpad Goncz said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here after meeting U.S. Jewish leaders, Goncz also said 
that Hungary's newly formed non-Communist government will want out of the 
Warsaw Pact, but it will have to find a way that will satisfy all parties, 
including the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the move by the Baltic republics for independence from the Soviet 
Union, Goncz said: "It is my opinion that historic processes cannot be stopped, 
but they can be slowed. . . . This is something statesmen should be aware of. 
Solutions satisfying both sides can be found." 
</P>
<P>
Goncz, a writer and founder of the Free Democratic Party who spent six years in 
jail after the 1956 Hungarian Uprising, said of the Warsaw Pact, "It is the 
opinion of the new Hungarian government that Hungary will sooner or later leave 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's non-Communist government takes office May 22, and Parliament on 
Tuesday voted to postpone a debate on the country's future in the Soviet Bloc 
alliance for at least a month.

VATICAN AND ROMANIA WILL EXCHANGE ENVOYS; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN EUROPE: THE MOVE CONTINUES A TREND TOWARD WARMER TIES BETWEEN THE 
CHURCH AND FORMER SOVIET SATELLITES.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Completing its official re-entry into Eastern European countries with major 
Roman Catholic populations, the Vatican on Tuesday announced resumption of 
diplomatic relations with Romania. 
</P>
<P>
A terse one-paragraph announcement ended a 40-year rupture begun with the 
triumph of communism in Romania after World War II. Relations will be resumed 
at full ambassadorial level, the Vatican said, without naming the envoys to be 
exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The return of an official Vatican presence in Eastern Europe has quickly 
followed the fall of communism there. The process began last July when 
relations were restored with Pope John Paul II's native Poland. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, relations have been resumed with Hungary, which the Pope will 
visit in 1991, and with Czechoslovakia, which he visited last month. Official 
ties have also been resumed with the Soviet Union, although not yet at 
ambassadorial level, in the wake of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
visit to the Vatican last December. 
</P>
<P>
There is no sign yet of renewed links between the Holy See and Bulgaria and 
Albania, but neither has ever had full diplomatic relations with the Vatican. 
Both are officially atheist, and neither has a large Roman Catholic population. 
</P>
<P>
In Romania, relations were broken by an insurgent Communist government in July, 
1950, which gave the Vatican nuncio 72 hours to leave the country. They are 
being resumed by the government that succeeded dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who 
was executed last Christmas Day during a popular uprising. 
</P>
<P>
By the Vatican's count, there are 1.4 million Roman Catholics in Romania today, 
and some 1.5 million followers of the Byzantine or Eastern rite affiliated with 
Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Of Romania's 23 million residents, about 18 million are members of the Romanian 
Orthodox Church, which was tolerated by and cooperated closely with the 
government under Communist rule that began in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
As in the Soviet Union, Byzantine rite churches in Romania were officially 
incorporated into the Orthodox Church under Communist rule, and Orthodox 
bishops seized the cathedrals of Roman Catholic bishops, according to the 
Catholic Almanac. More than 50 priests were executed, and another 200 died in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
In March, John Paul named seven Latin rite bishops and five Byzantine rite 
bishops to restore the Romanian church hierarchy to its pre-Communist level. 
The decision to renew relations was made during a visit to Bucharest last month 
by Archbishop Angelo Sodano, the Holy See's secretary for foreign relations.

HONORARIUMS PAY WAXMAN $60,300; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: MOST OF THE LAWMAKER'S FEES CAME FROM HEALTH INDUSTRY GROUPS. OTHER 
OFFICIALS' FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE REPORTS ARE ALSO MADE PUBLIC.

<P>
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who chairs a House subcommittee on health 
and the environment, received $60,300 in honorariums from special interest 
groups in 1989, most of it from health industry associations, according to 
financial disclosure information made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, long a House leader in honorarium receipts, pocketed $26,808 of his 
honorariums in accordance with House rules, which allow members to keep up to 
$26,850 each. Waxman gave $31,296 of his honorariums to charity and used $2,196 
to cover unreinbursed expenses incurred while earning the appearance fees. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in January, 1991, members of the House will be prohibited from 
accepting honorariums from special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman's largest honorariums were $5,000 each from the American Health Care 
Assn., Merck Pharmaceutical Co., the National Council on Prescription Drugs, 
the Trial Lawyers Assn. and the American Veterinary Medical Assn. He also got 
$4,000 from the Illinois Hospital Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Under House rules, a member cannot pocket an appearance fee in excess of 
$2,000. As a result, Waxman's gifts to charity came largely from the excess 
money he received from these and a few other groups. He also was reimbursed for 
travel in connection with many speaking engagements, but did not disclose the 
amounts or where the speeches were made. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman's was one of many annual financial disclosure reports made public 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who is under investigation by the Senate Ethics 
Committee, reported that he stopped accepting speech honorariums in 1989 and no 
longer takes trips at the expense of voter registration groups. 
</P>
<P>
A millionaire, Cranston was criticized last year for his many all-expenses-paid 
trips in 1988 on behalf of voter registration groups for which he was raising 
money. His success in persuading Charles H. Keating Jr., owner of the failed 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, to give $850,000 to these groups is one subject of 
the ethics inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, however, Cranston took only two trips for which he received 
reimbursement from outside groups. Both trips -- to Jamaica and Yugoslavia -- 
were paid for by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan group that runs programs 
for top public officials. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston decided to stop accepting honorariums from special interests early 
last year when the Senate, responding to widespread criticism, was debating 
whether to prohibit members from receiving fees for speaking and other 
activities. Although honorariums will be banned in the House next year, it will 
continue to be legal for senators to pocket up to $35,800 of such fees. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), another Senate millionaire, received 
$27,000 in honorariums last year, $2,000 of which he donated to charity. He and 
his wife also took four trips paid for by others: to Palm Springs at the 
expense of the American Leadership Conference; to a tennis tournament in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., paid for by the Hospice of the Valley; to Los Angeles, paid 
for by the firm of Overton, Moore &amp; Associates, and to Brooklyn, paid for 
by Bais Yaakov. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's report, also made public Tuesday, provided little new 
information because he already had released his 1989 income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the report shed some light on the kinds of gifts that a President 
of the United States receives: 51 neckties, 36 T-shirts, half a dozen sets of 
fishing gear, an $800 cup and saucer from Nelson Rockefeller's widow, statues 
of Mickey and Minnie Mouse from Disney Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer Michael D. Eisner, a football helmet, 14 pairs of cowboy boots, a 
gingerbread house for his dog and 79 baseball caps. Those are among the gifts 
that Bush kept. 
</P>
<P>
Uncounted on Bush's financial disclosure form are dozens of gifts from foreign 
leaders that Bush turned over to the government under rules that limit the 
sorts of gifts he can accept. One of the few gifts from a foreign leader that 
Bush kept is $125 worth of Christmas ornaments and children's books from Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife Raisa. 
</P>
<P>
Among other financial disclosure reports made available Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) received $22,700 in honorariums and 
took trips at the expense of the National Assn. of Broadcasters, the National 
Cable Television Assn., the Committee for Immigration Justice, the Washington 
Institute for Near East Policy, the Japan Society and the Religious Action 
Center of Reform Judaism. He traveled to Tokyo at the expense of the Japan 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), a member of the Agriculture Committee, 
received $28,150 in honorariums -- $10,000 of it from the Ceres Foundation of 
Deerfield, Ill. He gave $8,000 of it to charity because of the $2,000 limit on 
members of Congress.

The National Trust for Historic Preservation, which is supported by the federal

development, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the designation carries no money with it and does not outlaw new

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; 
</P>
<P>
CLAIMS SHOULD BE PAID WITHIN 30 DAYS, GARAMENDI SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), diverging from what an opponent had 
branded "a non-campaign of silence and absence," vowed Tuesday that if elected 
state insurance commissioner, he will institute a program requiring "insurers 
to pay claims as quickly as consumers must pay premiums." 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi said a 1973 law gives the commissioner authority to establish 
procedures under which insurers would have to pay valid claims within 30 days, 
the same period of time policyholders usually have to pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
The senator said that as commissioner he would provide computerized printouts 
to consumers comparing not only prices but how fast various insurers are paying 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the campaign has only three weeks to run, Garamendi said in an 
interview, the voters will be paying more attention to the candidates and he 
intends to speak out more frequently about plans to make the commissioner's 
office "the best consumer protection agency in the nation" and to enforce 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
"I will change (outgoing Insurance Commissioner) Roxani Gillespie's record of 
delay, stall, obstruct and delay some more on (implementing) 103," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the senator spoke out, one of his opponents in the race for the 
Democratic nomination, Walter Zelman, charged at a Sacramento news conference 
that Garamendi's campaign has made "a mockery of the democratic process." 
</P>
<P>
Accusing Garamendi of saying nothing and refusing to appear with the other 
candidates while concentrating on raising money from "special interest" 
political action groups, Zelman declared that "the ability of politicians to 
run issue-less campaigns while attempting to buy elections . . . is destroying 
the fabric of our politics and our democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another Democratic candidate, Bill Press, renewed a challenge to 
Garamendi to join him in a one-on-one debate. 
</P>

Garamendi, who has termed the crowded field in the Democratic race "a zoo," 
said Tuesday that he fears the race "has degenerated into a discussion of who 
is close to or furthest away from the insurance industry" and that he has been 
falsely tagged as on the industry side. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, I'm not on the side of the industry," he said. But on some issues, 
such as limiting malpractice claims against doctors, he said the public 
interest coincides with that of the industry, and he will not be afraid to 
choose what is in the consumer's interest, even if it opens him to charges of 
sometimes siding with insurers. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Garamendi said, he will not repudiate the recent endorsement of 
him by Michael J. Brady, an officer of an insurance company defense lawyers 
association. He noted that Brady, in a letter asking his colleagues to 
contribute to Garamendi, had acknowledged that whatever Garamendi did to keep 
California's insurance industry healthy would be done in a way consistent with 
consumers' interests. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the race for the Republican nomination, one of the candidates, 
Tom Skornia, criticized another, John Perise, for making plans to put more than 
$100,000 of his own money into two statewide slate mailers. In the poorly 
funded Republican primary, Skornia said he feared this could be decisive. 
</P>
<P>
Perise, a trial lawyer, is the only one of five candidates for the GOP 
nomination to favor trial lawyer positions on insurance issues.

SUPERVISORS EXTEND PESTICIDE SPRAYING TO FIGHT NEW PEST -- THE MEXFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday grudgingly extended an emergency 
proclamation to cover pesticide spraying to eradicate a new pest, the Mexican 
fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
The action came only after board members complained bitterly about the state's 
lengthy battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the supervisors in condemning the state were city officials from 
infested neighborhoods in the southeastern part of the county. They complained 
about the state's plans to spray their communities every other week into June. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman chided agriculture officials Tuesday for failing to stick 
to a May 9 deadline to end the spraying against the Medfly. And Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum griped about continued use of El Monte Airport, in his district, as 
the base for the malathion-spewing helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
"You announced that May 9 was going to be the last date for malathion spraying, 
and that has already slipped," Schabarum told state Department of Food and 
Agriculture officials. "So you don't mind if I have a little bit of reservation 
about the genuineness of your representation." 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, questioning the effectiveness of the 10-month aerial attack on the 
Medfly, said: "I am wondering if it makes sense to embark on the same kind of 
program for the Mexican fruit fly. If it hasn't worked as effectively in 
ridding Southern California of one bug, how is it going to work in ridding the 
county of this other bug?" 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors, nonetheless, approved the emergency proclamation, which shields 
the county from liability in connection with the eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
Don Henry of the state agriculture department assured Schabarum that the 
helicopters will stop using El Monte Airport after tonight. He said Medfly 
officials are looking for another airport. 
</P>
<P>
Compton College Trustee Emily Hart Holifield said Tuesday that urban areas, 
such as Compton, have already suffered enough without the health problems that 
pesticide spraying might cause. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had gang-bangers, shootings and, now, we have malathion," she told a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood City Councilman Armando Rea said the spraying is only aggravating a 
related environmental problem -- the water shortage. After each spraying, he 
said, thousands of cars have to be washed, as do playground equipment and 
outdoor picnic tables.

STERILE MEDFLIES CAN'T READ THOSE 'WET PAINT' WARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The arrival of hundreds of millions of sterile Medflies may be cause for 
celebration for most Southern Californians, but don't try telling that to 
Martin O'Connor or Annette Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
These two Whittier residents have heard all about the stained cars, upset 
children and possible allergic reactions caused by malathion. But for them, it 
is the sterile Medflies -- the supposed relief from malathion -- that are the 
real trouble. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor and Dodge, who do not know each other, each have filed financial 
claims with the state. They contend their homes were attacked by rampaging 
sterile flies that stuck themselves to their freshly painted walls. 
</P>
<P>
The proof, they say, can be seen in all its speckled glory in walls that are 
still dotted with hundreds of dead flies -- not quite the paint job they had in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
It was a January afternoon, just after agriculture workers had through his 
neighborhood as part of a limited release of sterile Medflies in selected 
areas, when O'Connor first noticed the problem. He was putting a fresh coat of 
paint on his house. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up and, God in heaven, those flies were coming at us by the 
thousands, just sticking to the house. All over the place. . . . The smell 
must've just attracted them," said the 68-year-old O'Connor, who is retired. 
</P>
<P>
"And you know, those doggone things stayed on there alive for four days, still 
squirming around -- you can't get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said he sanded down the spotted walls and started painting anew -- 
only to have the same thing happen the next time the sterile release crews came 
around. It wasn't as bad the second time, he said, but the flies still dot the 
place, and he is seeking $800 from the state to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Dodge, meanwhile, wants $1,840 to cover the cost of repainting her dining room 
walls -- which she says are a vertical graveyard to hundreds of sterile 
Medflies after her misadventure in November. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all still there, stuck to the enamel," Dodge said. 
</P>
<P>
A bit suspicious at first, state agriculture inspector Arturo Castillo went to 
the Whittier homes to look at the reported damage -- only to find that the 
flies do indeed appear to have been attracted by the fresh paint. 
</P>
<P>
"The flies had just attached themselves," he reported.

SCHULLER TAPE ASKS SOVIETS FOR SUMMIT PRAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television minister Robert H. Schuller, edging toward a possible regular 
broadcast on Soviet television, said Tuesday he has videotaped a message asking 
prayers for the success of the upcoming summit meeting in Washington. The 
videotape was made at the request of Moscow officials. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-minute sermon by Schuller, pastor of the Crystal Cathedral in Garden 
Grove, is scheduled to be shown May 27 in the Soviet Union, three days before 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is due to arrive in Washington for his 
meeting with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Schuller said that Gosteleradio, the state-run broadcasting agency, 
specifically requested that the minister tape a "heart to heart" theme, using 
his large glass church building and its gardens as a backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
"They even wanted the sounds of birds on the tape," said Michael Nason, a 
Schuller associate. Schuller was traveling in the Midwest on Tuesday and 
unavailable for interviews, but a transcript of his message was released by the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking about faith, hope and unconditional love, Schuller calls upon viewers 
"to pray to God as you believe in him. Or even if you don't believe in God, 
pray anyway. He might be there. What can you lose?" 
</P>
<P>
Schuller then asks for prayers that in the summit "Gorbachev and Bush together 
will have been used by all of the good forces in this universe to bring the 
world ever closer to the total absence of war." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet Union has been officially atheistic for seven decades, 
Gorbachev's reforms have included numerous gestures toward greater religious 
expression in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The upcoming broadcast will be Schuller's second appearance on Soviet 
nationwide television. 
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, with the help of industrialist Armand Hammer, the minister 
has been negotiating for a regularly scheduled program on Soviet television. 
Schuller went to Moscow last December, hoping to get his weekly "Hour of Power" 
Sunday services shown on Soviet television. 
</P>
<P>
Gosteleradio officials resisted that suggestion but instead asked him to tape a 
15-minute segment in Moscow for a new Soviet religious program. That tape was 
broadcast on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller, known for his enthusiasm in the pulpit, later called the event "the 
high point" of his ministry. 
</P>
<P>
During subsequent talks by a Schuller representative with Valentin Lazutkin, 
vice chairman of Gosteleradio, the Soviet agency made a tentative proposal for 
monthly broadcasts by Schuller starting in the fall, Nason said. If the new 
program is approved, it will be called "Heart to Heart," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Schuller has the most-watched weekly religious program 
with an audience of 1.7 million. His "Hour of Power" also is seen in 31 other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Cathedral spokesmen also announced Tuesday that Schuller will hold a 
news conference with Soviet officials Thursday in New York to announce a major 
shipment of donated medical supplies to aid children who were victims of the 
1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster in the Ukraine. The church made an 
initial $50,000 gift to the Children of Chernobyl fund last December.

SPRAYING WITH THE RELEASE OF MILLIONS OF STERILE FLIES IN NORTHERN ORANGE

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nori Tanaka, a scruffy, gray-haired entomologist, trudges through a converted 
tuna-packing shed, flicking flies off his face. It is just before the dawn of 
another humid day. In one corner of the ramshackle building, workers grind out 
sticky, brown fly food in a cement mixer. In another, fly pupae are sifted 
through a makeshift device of cardboard, old broom heads and wire mesh. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka reeks mightily of sugar, yeast and other odors that come with the job of 
mating insects. A cloud of flies surrounds his face. He gazes about the shed, 
proudly surveying the noisy scene. A few flies float in his coffee cup. He 
drinks it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a certain man," Tanaka says, "to be a rearing man. You have to dream 
this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka is the country's foremost fly "rearing man." His domain is the 
California-Hawaii Agriculture Medfly Project -- a facility that throughout this 
summer will be the most important outpost in the state's war against the Medfly 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials are about to attempt a tactical shift in their effort to 
eradicate the Medfly, replacing aerial malathion spraying with the release of 
millions of sterile flies in northern Orange County and around Los Angeles. If 
all goes well, and if no fertile flies are found by the end of next month -- a 
major qualifier -- the sterile fly releases will replace the controversial 
pesticide program over all but about 10% of the large infestation area. 
</P>
<P>
Devised 40 years ago, the simple concept calls for the release of millions of 
sterile Medflies in successive waves. The steriles, made so by exposure to 
radiation, are intended to numerically overwhelm their sexual competitors in 
mating with wild flies. With no offspring from the mating, the wild flies 
eventually will die out. Or so the theory goes. 
</P>
<P>
Largely undetectable by the public, harmless to the environment and, as far as 
anyone can tell, harmless to people as well, the sterile Medfly approach not 
only will eradicate the pest, agricultural officials believe, but will also end 
the public outcry over pesticide spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the task hinges on Tanaka, who as operator of two of the three major 
sterile breeding facilities here must be able to deliver the irradiated flies 
in sufficient numbers to support the campaign. It is a difficult challenge; 
shortages of sterile flies, coupled with a rash of Medfly discoveries over the 
last few months, already forced the state to retreat from its original May 9 
deadline to end spraying. 
</P>
<P>
There are other hazards. Improperly sterilized flies can be explosively 
dangerous to the eradication campaign; some officials still maintain that this 
occurred with a batch of South American flies brought in to battle the 1981 
infestation. There have also been complaints from residents that the clouds of 
sterilized flies have an uncanny knack for knocking into freshly painted walls. 
</P>
<P>
And the central question -- do the sterile releases work? -- remains less than 
resolved in scientific circles. No scientist can explain precisely how the 
approach works, nor can they say with certainty if it will succeed on the scale 
to be attempted in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot we don't know," Tanaka said in an interview last month. "I 
believe it works, but there have been so many failures, too." 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka, who has been rearing flies for four decades, is considered the dean of 
sterile Medfly production. Most of the techniques and equipment used in the 
United States for raising Medflies were developed by Tanaka, a born tinkerer 
who constantly prowls the facilities in a grimy T-shirt, checking on food 
mixtures or adjusting the temperature in the rearing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, he has spent almost every waking hour inside 
the tuna shed, located in an industrial section of Honolulu, breeding the 
millions of flies demanded by California. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only thing I know," he said. "It's my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
The state's new battle plan is actually a return to a strategy that agriculture 
officials originally intended to use last summer, before the Medfly outbreaks 
exploded throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
When the first Medfly infestation was detected last July 20 in Elysian Park, 
officials believed that the outbreak was an isolated case and could be quietly 
eradicated with one or two aerial spraying followed by the release of sterile 
flies. 
</P>
<P>
But by December, the Medfly had spread through 200 square miles of Los Angeles 
and Orange counties and state officials admitted that had exhausted their 
supply of sterile Medflies. Their only alternative was to spray wide sectors of 
Southern California with repeated aerial doses of malathion, deploying steriles 
in only a few pockets of infestation. 
</P>
<P>
For the last four months, the state has pushed to increase sterile fly 
production and is now receiving about 300 million sterile flies a week -- 
enough to treat about 300 square miles of the infestation. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the sterile releases are to be limited to an 
eight-square-mile area of North County that includes parts of Brea, La Habra 
and Fullerton. Hit nine times by malathion spraying in the last six months, 
that area is scheduled for the release of hundreds of millions of sterile flies 
over coming months. The releases started last week. 
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 residents in the county's larger Medfly zone -- a 36-square-mile 
zone centered in Garden Grove -- will continue to face spraying. Faced with a 
potential shortage of sterile flies, state officials decided to treat Garden 
Grove with three more malathion applications -- tonight, May 23 and May 30. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka's two breeding facilities turn out a weekly supply of about 150 million 
sterile Medflies. Another 120 million are arriving from a breeding facility in 
Mexico, along with about 40 million from a third rearing facility in Hawaii. 
The flies are raised in places where the pest is already established. 
</P>
<P>
The process begins in the breeding facilities where the flies are raised, dyed 
(to make sure they are not confused with wild flies), sterilized by exposure to 
radiation, and then shipped to California in long, sausage-like bags that each 
contain thousands of fly pupae. 
</P>
<P>
The adult flies emerge after arrival and are then scattered by truck or 
airplane throughout an infestation zone at a rate of about 1 million every 
square mile every week. Prior to the introduction of steriles, an infested area 
usually is sprayed once or twice with malathion to reduce the wild fly 
population. 
</P>
<P>
The flies are released for three generations -- about three or four months 
during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
It's a virtually benign treatment that seems to make scientific sense, although 
the record has been less than perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason why it can't eradicate an insect," said Edward F. Knipling, 
the now-retired originator of the idea. "I don't know how you can miss." 
</P>
<P>
Knipling was a junior entomologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture when 
he hatched the idea of using sterile insects as a weapon of eradication in the 
1930s. At the time, much of the southern United States was infested with a pest 
called the screw-worm fly, whose burrowing larvae killed livestock. 
</P>
<P>
His colleague jeered the idea. Knipling himself thought of it as a "long shot." 
</P>
<P>
It took nearly 15 years before Knipling heard of a way to sterilize flies using 
radiation. The series of eradication programs he eventually launched cleansed 
the United States and Mexico of the screw-worm pest. The program still 
continues today and is now poised to push through Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Not all such eradication programs have been as successful. Consider the massive 
Northern California Medlfy infestation in 1980-82, which some officials and 
scientists contend was spread through hundreds of square miles by the release 
of sterile flies from Peru that may have been improperly sterilized. 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists say generally that California has never had much luck in using 
sterile techniques against the Medfly. James R. Carey, a UC Davis entomologist 
and one of five scientific advisers in the state's eradication campaign, said 
sterile Medflies have been released in this state eight out of the last 15 
years and yet infestations continue to crop up, sometimes in the same place 
over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
Carey and other scientists agree that the technique has succeeded each time in 
substantially reducing the Medfly population but, they ask, did it wipe out 
every last vestige of the pest? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good tool for suppression of a population. The evidence of that is 
clear," said Ronald Prokopy, an entomologist at the University of Massachusetts 
and an expert on the Medfly. "But eradication, that is a different story. I 
have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
Little is known about how the technique actually works. For example, scientists 
are not certain about such fundamental questions as whether it is the sterile 
male flies, sterile females, or both, that break the reproduction cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Prokopy, who was chairman of the state's science advisory panel in the 
eradication of the apple maggot in the early 1980s, said scientists have only 
begun to understand how sterile flies act in the wild. What they have seen is 
not entirely encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, he said, the sterile flies appear to be less competitive than 
wild flies, partly because the sterilization process itself slightly weakens 
them. On top of that, Prokopy said, the artificial environment of the breeding 
labs seems to produce domesticated weaklings. 
</P>
<P>
"They're different, that's a fact," Prokopy said. "They haven't forgotten how 
to do things, they just don't do them as well. It's like chickens, you put them 
in the wild and they'll get eaten." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Kaneshiro, director of the Hawaiian Evolutionary Biology Program at the 
University of Hawaii and a Medfly expert, agreed, saying that flies fall into 
two general categories: duds and studs. Sterile flies are generally duds. 
</P>
<P>
In the wild, he said, lab-reared flies are lousy at performing their species' 
complex mating rituals, are 
</P>
<P>
not good at defending their territory, and they are downright miserable at 
finding mates. "Sexually inadequate," Kaneshiro said. 
</P>
<P>
The qualities of sterile flies aside, there are constant problems in rearing 
them in the huge quantities needed for an eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
When state Department of Food and Agriculture Director Henry J. Voss announced 
in March his decision to replace spraying with sterile fly releases, a key to 
his plan was receiving millions of flies from a just-completed U.S. Department 
of Agriculture facility in Waimanalo, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The $7-million Waimanalo facility, the one Hawaiian facility not run by Tanaka, 
is a modern, concrete-and-glass building packed with the latest high-tech 
fly-rearing equipment. Its insides bristle in shades of stainless steel and 
plastic. It was designed to produce up to 500 million sterile flies a week. So 
far, it has been lumbering along at a pace of 40 million a week. 
</P>
<P>
The problems at the facility are legion. The heating system can't keep the 
building hot enough. The humidity is not quite correct. The plant has become 
infested with another type of fly that eats the Medflies' food. 
</P>
<P>
There are dozens of variables in the touchy rearing process that might be off 
and no one is certain which are to blame. Is it the diet? Is it the humidity? 
Maybe it's the way the trays of larvae are stacked, which could hamper air 
circulation? 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's not the best, but it's the best we can do," said Glenn L. 
Hinsdale, facility director. 
</P>
<P>
The problems in many ways are inherent to starting a large facility such as 
Waimanalo. "It's still an art," said Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of 
Agriculture entomologist and the chairman of the state's Medfly Science 
Advisory Panel. "They're trying to make it a science, and they still have a 
long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Even Tanaka has experienced problems with his far simpler operation. He once 
received a bad shipment of wheat, used for fly food. The wheat was contaminated 
with a small amount of malathion -- just enough to wipe out an entire batch of 
flies. In the current push to increase shipments to California, he's had 
workers spill jugs of fly eggs and barrels of larvae. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka said the problems at his facilities and Waimanalo are to be expected and 
eventually will be ironed out. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials believe that when the Waimanalo plant reaches full 
potential, Southern California may never have to face the repeated aerial 
malathion assaults that have inflamed the region. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the political and economic stakes riding on the success of the 
sterile fly technique are high. The state has only two weapons -- sterile flies 
and malathion -- to fight the Medfly, a voracious pest that could do 
substantial damage if it reached California's agricultural regions, producers 
of over half the nation's fresh fruit and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Voss said in an interview that repeated malathion spraying is becoming 
unacceptable because of the intense public opposition. Thus, sterile flies 
offer the only feasible long-term strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole desire of society is to have less amounts of pesticide used," Voss 
said. "It's very likely even one spray may become unacceptable. In the long 
term we have to move away from where we are." 
</P>
<P>
But he said no matter how well the state plans for the future, there are no 
guarantees when it comes to dealing with the unpredictable Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly stunned officials last winter when the infestation spread like 
wildfire throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties. And there is always the 
grim possibility that another infestation the size of the 1,300-square-mile 
Northern California outbreak of 1980-82 could hit again and throw their plans 
to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are far better prepared today," Voss said in a recent interview. 
"But how prepared is prepared?"

GAS LEAK FORCES EVACUATION OF 500 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A gas leak forced the evacuation of about 500 people Tuesday from a building 
that houses the Orange County Juvenile Court and Probation Department, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The evacuation began about 9 a.m. after a backhoe accidentally ripped through a 
two-inch natural gas main at the side of the Manchester Building in the 300 
block of the City Drive in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Ray Montoya of the Orange Fire Department said the gas leaked 
from the line for about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty lucky that no one was hurt," Montoya said. "When that much 
volume (of natural gas) spews into the air, it can be very touchy." 
</P>
<P>
About 200 probationers and juvenile offenders were among those evacuated from 
the five-story building, a Juvenile Court spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya said authorities cut off the electricity to the building after pockets 
of natural gas seeped inside and accumulated in the attic. 
</P>
<P>
Fire and police officials blocked off Dawn Way to prevent motorists from 
entering the building's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that a small spark could ignite an explosion, fire officials told 
employees and visitors that they had to leave their vehicles in the parking lot 
until the gas dissipated. Some employees walked over to the nearby the City 
Mall while a crew from Southern California Edison Co. attempted to repair the 
broken main. 
</P>
<P>
Employees and others were allowed to return to the building about 1 p.m. DAVAN

MINIMAL RISK SEEN IN REBUILDING PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In demolishing the city pier, workers will chop hundreds of wooden planks 
coated with a hazardous substance, which could minimally contaminate the 
surrounding surf, according to an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
The study concludes that the threat of creosote pollution is slight, but that 
it is one of several "unavoidable environmental risks" when the pier 
reconstruction project begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the 76-year-old pier is constructed of concrete, the platform 
underside and some support braces are made of wood saturated with creosote, a 
black, tarlike goop once commonly used to protect telephone poles and railroad 
tracks from weather. 
</P>
<P>
As the planks are dismantled and cut, the sawdust could sully the waters below 
with the hazardous, petroleum-based material, city engineer Bob Eichblatt said 
Tuesday. To minimize the dust, the wood will be wetted and cut "as little as 
possible," and workers who may be exposed to creosote will wear rubber gloves 
and masks, the report said. The removed planks and soiled gloves will be 
disposed into Bee Canyon Sanitary Landfill, a hazardous waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
Eichblatt said that because the wooden planks are so old, the contamination 
risk is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be more of a danger, I would think, if we were dealing with 
(planks) freshly covered with creosote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The remains of the pier's concrete, meanwhile, may be added to an artificial 
reef about three miles off Bolsa Chica State Beach. City officials are studying 
that proposal, which would create a haven for fish while diverting tons of 
concrete from landfills. JOHN PENNER

MOLA CORP. LOSES VOTE ON TRACT MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a victory for residents, the City Council failed Monday in its weeklong 
attempt to give the initial approvals required before Mola Development Corp. 
can build a controversial $200-million project in the city. 
</P>
<P>
After a week of marathon special meetings, the council adjourned its Monday 
meeting at 4:30 a.m. Tuesday without approving a tentative tract map for the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a victory for the people," said Councilman Frank Laszlo, an opponent 
of the Mola project. "They gave their message loud and clear" that the new 
council sworn in Tuesday should vote on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved items amending the city's General Plan and adopting a 
parcel map to clear the way for the development, but stopped short of approving 
a tentative tract map for the project. A 4-1 majority of the council believed 
that approving the tract map might give Mola a legal right to expect final 
approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
However, not all city officials agree with this assessment. City Atty. Greg 
Stepanicich said an initial approval does not give Mola that right, which comes 
when the company's development agreement with the city has received two 
approvals. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Councilwoman Joyce Risner, who wanted to approve the Mola tract map, 
was disappointed that the council failed to pass it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would have made that much difference" in the event of a legal 
challenge, Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
Mola now holds an option on the 149-acre Hellman Ranch parcel where the company 
wants to build a 329-unit residential project. The development also includes 41 
acres of restored wetlands and 26 acres of public parks. 
</P>
<P>
Mola has been trying to get the project approved for more than four years. The 
City Council passed the project last fall, but the approvals were invalidated 
by Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Ronald L. Bauer in March because 
they were granted while the city was without a state-mandated plan for 
accommodating future housing needs. The new City Council is scheduled to 
consider the project May 29. MICHELLE NICOLOSI

A developer will get a $2-million check from the city for achieving 70% 
occupancy of the Garden Promenade shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, City Council members voted 4-1 to carry out part of a 
development agreement with Hughes/Lyon Garden Grove Associates of Newport Beach 
for the reconstruction of the former Orange County Plaza/Garden Grove Mall at 
the northwest corner of Brookhurst Street and Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
That agreement calls for the city to pay $2,025,000 to the developer when at 
least 70% of the city-subsidized project is occupied. 
</P>
<P>
In other action Monday night, the city approved: 
</P>
<P>
* A three-month extension of a negotiating agreement with the Haagen/Smotrich 
Partnership for the development of a commercial project on a 28-acre site at 
the southwest corner of Garden Grove Boulevard and Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
* A six-month extension to a negotiating agreement with Burke Commercial 
Development to build a 118,000-square foot retail and industrial project at 
Nelson Street and Garden Grove Boulevard.JAMES TORTOLANO

BUCHANAN SUPPORTS SISTER, OPPOSES TAXES 
</P>

<P>
President Bush is at risk of losing the conservative support that helped him 
into the White House unless he holds the line on taxes and sends a stronger 
message to the Soviet Union on the Baltic republics' independence, said 
conservative Washington commentator and former Reagan Administration adviser 
Patrick J. Buchanan on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's now coming to a fork in the road in his administration," Buchanan said at 
a fund-raiser at the Santa Ana Country Club for his sister, state treasurer 
candidate Angela (Bay) Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to have to choose whether he stands with those of us who stood with 
him in 1988 against Dukakis when . . . he said, 'No new taxes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan said Bush's recent decision "to put everything on the table" in budget 
discussions with Democrats -- including taxes -- was "a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
"He has not explained the nature of the crisis being so severe that you should 
immediately throw aside the most important pledge he made," Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan's appearance Tuesday evening was one of eight scheduled stops on a 
three-day Southern California swing he is making on behalf of his sister, a 
former U.S. treasurer who is now locked in a tough battle for the Republican 
nomination for state treasurer with incumbent Thomas Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrat who will face the winner of the Republican primary is another 
woman with a famous brother -- Kathleen Brown, a member of the Los Angeles 
Board of Public Works and the sister of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
About 120 people attended the $200-per-person reception, and Ken Rietz, one of 
Buchanan's consultants, said her brother's appearances should bring in about 
$200,000 for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"People like to talk to him," said Rietz. "They may not always agree with him, 
but they like to hear him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bay Buchanan: "He brings some attention and some excitement to the 
campaign."BOB SCHWARTZ

BOTH SIDES TAKE PART IN GAY-RIGHTS TALKS 
</P>

<P>
Orange County activists on both sides of the gay-rights issue sat down together 
in Santa Ana on Tuesday for the first time and denounced any use of violence in 
furthering their respective viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
Christina Shea, an Irvine homemaker who successfully pushed for the repeal of a 
sexual-orientation clause from her city's anti-discrimination law, said she 
regrets that hostility had existed between fundamentalist Christians and gays 
during the campaign last November. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be one of those who helps both sides find a common ground. We can 
work together in peace," Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
Stereotypes were broken during the meeting, said Lisa Kaye, a member of the 
Eleanor Roosevelt Democratic Club, a gay organization. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to sit down and talk to each other," Kaye said. "We became people 
instead of sides to an issue." 
</P>
<P>
But there were some viewpoints that were noticeably missing from the meeting, 
which was held in a conference room at the county Human Relations Commission 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Among those not invited were the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, leader of the 
Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, which vehemently opposes homosexual 
rights, and Jeff LeTourneau, who heads the Orange County Visibility League, a 
vocal gay organization. 
</P>
<P>
"For such a meeting to exist, we needed moderate voices, or else emotion will 
stand in the way," said gay-civil-rights attorney John J. Duran, who joined 
with Christian radio talk show host John Stewart in arranging the meeting of 
more than a dozen representatives from religious and gay organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, gays and Christians in the county have literally wrestled 
over a number of gay civil rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
Fistfights broke out between gays and fundamentalists last September during the 
county's first gay pride festival at Santa Ana's Centennial Park. And last 
November, Irvine voters narrowly approved Shea's Measure N, which repealed 
protections for gays from the city's broad anti-discrimination law. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said he became aware of the hostility between gays and some Christian 
groups after his KKLA show addressed the topic of discrimination against gays 
in employment and housing. 
</P>
<P>
A flurry of hostile telephone calls from both sides convinced him that a 
discussion between Christian and gay leaders was needed, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Duran, who represented organizers of the gay pride festival, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting began tentatively with some fierce disagreement over each 
side's viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
Gay supporters said they do not like having homosexuality referred to as a 
"lifestyle," and some of the Christians said they disliked the connotation that 
fundamentalists are "dumb or stupid." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to discussing their opposition to the use of violence, the group 
talked about discrimination against homosexuals in housing and employment. 
</P>
<P>
While unable to agree on a common view, the representatives agreed to continue 
their dialogue at a second meeting within a month. LILY ENG

FILM EXTRAS GET KICKS AT BREN CENTER 
</P>

<P>
A glamorous haze swathed the boxing ring, sliced by a single blue spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
This was no cigar smoke. This was purple haze, Hollywood style: a giant 
humidifier spewing out mineral oil-laden vapor. It seems the shimmery stuff 
looks good under stage lights. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood came to Orange County Tuesday as the makers of "Kickboxer II" took 
over the Bren Events Center at UC Irvine and recruited nearly 2,000 extras to 
pack the auditorium for several fight scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically a 'Rocky'/'Karate Kid'-type story of revenge," explained 
location manager Edward T. Parmelee, who chose the $15-million 
gymnasium-auditorium for its "modern and glitzy" look. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what we call a 'virgin location,' " Parmelee explained. "So much of what 
you see has been filmed over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it is a sequel. The original "Kickboxer" starred martial arts buff 
Jean-Claude Van Damme as an American kickboxer taking revenge on an evil Thai 
fighter who had paralyzed his brother, raped his girlfriend and crippled his 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
Van Damme is killed in the opening scenes of "Kickboxer II," according to line 
producer Tom Karnowski. Sasha Mitchell of "Dallas" and "Spike of Bensonhurst" 
fame plays another brother forced out of retirement to face the terrible Thai. 
In both versions, the fearsome Tan Po is played by Michele Qissi, a 6-foot-1 
Belgian boxer in Asian makeup and a four-foot ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it when they hit each other," said one extra, Don Ricco, a 20-year-old 
UC Irvine student. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody goes for the plot. We go for the fight," said Jon Chan, 
a UC Irvine biology major who had waited 2 1/2 hours for a seat in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
Other bleacher creatures included high school students cutting class for a 
glimpse of glitz, martial arts aficionados, mostly male, and more than a few 
overdressed young women who said they had come to see the muscular stars. 
</P>
<P>
"Is Jean-Claude Van Damme going to be here? That's why I'm here," said Melanie 
Mistretta, 26, who had driven down from Temple City. 
</P>
<P>
"Jean-Claude, he's a stud," said 16-year-old Thad Martin of Irvine. "We envy 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the scenes, world kickboxing champion Benny (The Jet) Urquidez, who 
trained the actors, and stunt man Jimmy Nickerson, veteran of "Rocky" and 
"Raging Bull," were choreographing the action. 
</P>
<P>
Urquidez said kickboxing does not deserve its reputation for violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful art," he said. "We've never had a death, never had a bad 
injury." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, Urquidez wound bandages around the fists of props coordinator 
Tiger Barry. They were making casts for a scene in which the fighters dip their 
fists in resin, then in ground glass. 
</P>
<P>
Barry made the harmless version by coating the bandages with soft silicone ice. 
To make the bloody bandages for the later scenes, he makes the fake silicone 
"glass" with karo syrup and red food dye. 
</P>
<P>
"When they have all the cuts, the makeup takes four hours," Barry said. SONNI

But all jesting aside, 77-year-old television personality Art Linkletter came 
to a daylong medical symposium here Tuesday to discuss a serious subject -- 
Alzheimer's disease -- and the need to find a cure for "this dreadful scourge." 
</P>
<P>
He gave the keynote address, telling 100 neurobiologists, doctors, nurses and 
relatives of Alzheimer's victims who gathered at the Beckman Center of the 
National Academies of Science and Engineering that Alzheimer's "is one of those 
terrible things that happens." 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how hard you work, no matter how hard you take care of yourself," 
the disease can progress relentlessly from confusion to dementia to death, 
Linkletter said. 
</P>
<P>
For all Linkletter's jokes about memory loss, he at least was healthy, he said; 
he surfs in summer and skis in winter and was clearly still on top of his game 
as a humorist. 
</P>
<P>
But Alzheimer's affected Linkletter deeply several years ago when a good 
friend, UCLA brain researcher John Douglas French, died of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Linkletter touched briefly on the pain of French's death, describing the 
ultimate irony that "the man who spent his life on the mysteries of the brain 
died because of a disease of the brain." 
</P>
<P>
After that death, Linkletter became chairman of a West Los Angeles foundation 
named after French, which has raised more than $5 million for Alzheimer's 
research. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the $2.5 million in grants so far has gone to several of Tuesday's 
speakers: to UC Irvine psychobiologists Carl Cotman and Christine Peterson and 
to psychiatrist Stephen Read, medical director of a Los Alamitos nursing home 
for Alzheimer's patients. 
</P>
<P>
For all the promising research, Linkletter still called dealing with 
Alzheimer's "a frustrating business -- with no known cure, no known cause and 
it keeps increasing by leaps and bounds." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, an estimated 40,000 people have Alzheimer's, said a 
spokeswoman for the Alzheimer's Assn. of Orange County, a support group for 
patients and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, more than 4 million people are said to have the disease, but 
Linkletter estimated "there are several more millions hidden -- because 
families do what they did with madness and leper's disease earlier," keeping 
the victims out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's symposium, "Alzheimer's Disease: Recent Insights and Developments in 
Research," was sponsored by UC Irvine, the Alzheimer's Assn. of Orange County 
and the John Douglas French Center for Alzheimer's Disease. LANIE JONES

SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE COULD BE HEADED FOR A FALL; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOLS: ADMINISTRATORS, AND EVEN SOME COACHES, ARE WONDERING IF MORE IS 
BETTER FOR THE PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Last November, Ron Barney proposed an idea that some football coaches figure 
borders on heresy. The principal of Nordoff High School in Ojai, while 
addressing the Southern Section's general council, suggested that spring 
football practice be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal feeling is that spring football has become practice sessions for 
summer passing leagues and could be eliminated," Barney said. "I question our 
academic values when we're running spring football just prior to final exams. 
What purpose does this serve our student athletes?" 
</P>
<P>
Barney also introduced a proposal -- approved by the general council last month 
-- that will end summer competition on Aug. 1, beginning with the 1990-91 
school term. He will pursue the issue of spring practice when the council meets 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
These days, however, it seems Barney isn't the only one questioning whether 
more is better when it comes to prep sports. Administrators, and even some 
football coaches, are asking the same question this week because spring 
football is scheduled to begin Monday during one of the busiest times on high 
school campuses throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most hectic time of the year on our campus," said Tom Jacobson, 
Corona del Mar's principal and president of the Southern Section executive 
committee. "The kids are tired and busy. We have social activities. Students 
are preparing for final exams. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we really need spring football or other spring sports practicing at this 
time? We're trying to control the competitive nature of athletics and keep the 
emphasis on academics. Personally, I think it would be a good idea to do away 
with spring football." 
</P>
<P>
Barney, who chaired a committee that surveyed section schools on the 
possibility of eliminating spring football, said they received responses from 
259 principals. Results showed that 193 principals were opposed to eliminating 
spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
"What I found very disturbing is that some schools are practicing during final 
exam week," Barney said. "I couldn't believe that. I will certainly bring (a 
proposal to eliminate spring practice) back as a discussion item." 
</P>
<P>
Barney's committee figures to have plenty of opposition again in September, 
particularly from some football coaches who contend that spring football is an 
important part of a successful program. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a necessary ingredient to an overall successful program," said 
Mike Milner, Fountain Valley's football coach. Milner led Fountain Valley to 
the Division I title in 1988 and has helped develop about 75 Division I college 
football players over the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have spring ball, it would be difficult to field as good a team 
as you would normally have in the fall," he said. "If spring ball is 
eliminated, the type of player that has been developed in Orange County over 
the past 20 years will be dramatically reduced." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of coaches in the county will conduct 10 to 15 spring practices 
for two to three hours after school. Coaches are allowed to conduct practices 
with tackling dummies, blocking aprons and sleds until the close of school. 
</P>
<P>
Players are not allowed to wear pads and helmets and no live tackling is 
allowed. Most schools conclude the three-week period with an intrasquad 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
"We only go 11 days," said John Barnes, Los Alamitos' coach. "It's basically a 
great time to get acquainted. We talk to each kid individually and let them 
know where he stands and fits into our plans following spring ball." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos has won 20 consecutive Empire League games and four league titles 
in the past five years despite the laid-back atmosphere in the spring. Barnes 
said he has mixed feelings about the possibility of eliminating spring 
football. 
</P>
<P>
"My first thought is that there would be somebody out there breaking the rule 
and practicing if we eliminated spring ball," he said. "When we trimmed three 
weeks off (in 1986-87), it was pretty reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go overboard in the spring. You can only ask so much of a kid. I 
want all the kids excited about the season in the fall, not in spring ball." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Anderson, who has coached for 18 years at Lynwood and Katella, is 
uncertain when spring football will start at Katella this year, but he 
certainly has some set opinions about the activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting a little tired of it," he said. "Spring is important in trying to 
get students involved in sports, but I don't know when we'll start because my 
two quarterbacks (Wayne Briggs and Chris Reed) are both on the baseball team 
that's competing in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"If they closed shop on spring football, I wouldn't fight it. I'd also like to 
see summer football changed. We could start Aug. 1 and go with three weeks of 
passing leagues and then go into two-a-days." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Witte, athletic director and football coach at Saddleback, said his 
league (Sea View) has considered eliminating spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
"We've talked about a dead period where coaches would only work with their kids 
during sixth period or open up the weight room," he said. "That's fine with me. 
But it's one of those Catch-22 situations where you're wondering if you're 
falling behind while others are practicing. 
</P>
<P>
"I know at this time of the year my coaches are tired from coaching other 
sports. We receive a stipend ($500) for coaching spring football for three 
weeks, but we're certainly not in this for the money." 
</P>
<P>
Dave White, Edison football coach, says little is accomplished in spring 
football because the players are restricted from wearing pads. 
</P>
<P>
"I have mixed emotions about spring ball," he said. "We do basically the same 
thing in our sixth-period class that we do in spring ball with the only 
difference being we can practice a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
"The real plus is that a lot of reserve players can get a good look by the 
coaches in the spring. But we could live without it. If someone told me we 
could only play 10 games in the summer, that would be fine with me, too." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes has an immediate answer for administrators who are concerned about the 
academic consequences of conducting spring football before final exams. He says 
the extra season of football is beneficial to some student athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"My advice to any educator who advocates ending spring football is this: The 
kids are better off being under a coach's supervision in the spring," he said. 
"We continue six-week grade checks in the spring. I'm sure we'd have some 
ineligible players in the fall if we didn't have spring football." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are coaches who would support a move to emulate the spring programs 
in Texas and Florida where players are allowed to wear pads and coaches conduct 
full-contact drills. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to do what Texas does and go full contact for a week," said Tim 
Devaney, Sunny Hills coach. "If we could get 10 days in pads in the spring, I'd 
give up 10 days in pads in the fall. But I know that's just a pipe dream. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't favor eliminating spring ball because I like the time working with 
the kids. I think the finesse part of the game would deteriorate if spring ball 
was eliminated. But it wouldn't bother me if spring ball was eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
Edison will practice only four days a week with Fridays reserved for the 
traditional coaches vs. players basketball games. White says the pickup games 
have helped develop friendships among the players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids really look forward to trying to beat the coaches in basketball," 
White said. "It's a lot of fun. Let's face it. If it's not fun for the kids in 
the spring, it won't be any fun in the fall." 
</P>
<P>
RULES FOR FOOTBALL SPRING PRACTICE 
</P>
<P>
1422 -- Spring football practice may be conducted from May 21 until the close 
of school in June (excluding Sundays). It is recommended, however, that the 
entire period not be devoted to football and that provisions be made for 
practice in other sports. 
</P>
<P>
1422.1 -- Eighth- and ninth-grade students from elementary and junior high 
schools may not take part in spring football practice at the high school. High 
school coaches may not conduct spring football practice at elementary or junior 
high schools involving students from those schools. It is permissible for 
ninth-grade coaches to conduct spring practice with eighth-grade students in a 
three-year, on-campus junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
1422.2 -- The following equipment will be permitted during spring football 
practice provided it is used in a safe and sane manner: (a) air dummies; (b) 
stand-up dummies; (c) two- or seven-man sleds; (d) tackling dummies; (e) 
blocking aprons. 
</P>
<P>
1422.3 -- High school students participating in football practice may wear the 
following type of clothing or uniform: (a) football shoes; (b) "T" or sweat 
shirts (football jerseys prohibited); (c) trunks or sweat pants; (d) protective 
equipment for the ears (Football or other hard plastic helmets will not be 
permitted because of the hazard to other players). 
</P>
<P>
1422.4 -- In spring football, no live tackling will be permitted and blocking 
will be allowed only when the offensive player is making contact against the 
air dummy, which is being held by the defensive players. If students are to 
work on the tackling dummy, they should be equipped with a water polo cap or a 
similar soft and pliable covering to protect the ears. Students should not be 
permitted to bang against the sled, but a drill that would have the students 
contact the sled and then move it is permissible. Common sense should be the 
keynote regarding the type of activity to be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
1442.5 -- An intrasquad flag or touch football game may be played as a windup 
to the spring practice period. Football jerseys may be worn. The intrasquad 
game my be played at night and admission may be charged if desired. 
</P>
<P>
1442.6 -- Interscholastic scrimmages or interscholastic touch football games 
are not permitted.

WITHOUT MAY DRILLS, REGULAR SEASON COULD BRING CHILLS, NOT THRILLS

<P>
For those who question the importance of spring football practice, Western High 
School Coach Jim Howell refers them to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
It had been 10 years since Western had won a league title. During that time, 
the Pioneers had not qualified for the Southern Section playoffs. Even winning 
seasons were few and far between. 
</P>
<P>
The time had come to shake things up a bit. So Howell installed the Wing-T 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers spent the spring learning the Wing-T -- the options, the dives, 
the sweeps. Because it's a complicated offense, based on deception, the players 
needed time to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
But they did. 
</P>
<P>
The following fall, Western finished 7-3 and won the Orange League. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't really sure about the offense at first," Howell said. "We didn't 
know whether the kids could run it properly. Fortunately, we had the spring to 
work on it." 
</P>
<P>
Football practice has always been one of the rites of spring. Coaches say the 
two- or three-week period in May and June can make a difference in the fall. 
Besides learning the intricacies of an offense or defense, it is also a time to 
develop leadership and camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
Under Southern Section rules, a team can practice from May 21 through the end 
of the school year in June, excluding Sundays. Although no contact drills are 
allowed, coaches say a lot can be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
"It serves a purpose," El Modena Coach Bill Backstrom said. "We get our kids 
together for 10 days in the spring. You're not going to find a quarterback in 
that amount of time, but it's a chance to blend the team's personalities and 
for the coaches to get to know the new players." 
</P>
<P>
Or for the players to get to know the new coach. 
</P>
<P>
Over the winter, Martin Luczaj was hired as the coach at Buena Park. Luczaj has 
taught and coached at Fullerton for the past nine years and knows little about 
the Coyotes' program and its players. 
</P>
<P>
During the spring, the Coyotes will have to learn their coach and his offensive 
and defensive philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
"Spring is probably more beneficial to someone in my position than it is to a 
coach who has already established his program," Luczaj said. "It will give me a 
chance to introduce my techniques and terminology." 
</P>
<P>
In six years as Fullerton coach, Luczaj compiled a 52-19 record, winning three 
league titles and a Southern Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of Luczaj's success was a sophisticated passing offense, which 
he also plans to use at Buena Park. This spring, there will be a lot for the 
Coyote players to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to come out of the spring organized to the point where we know 
where we're going," Luczaj said. "It's really a good time to get some teaching 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Luczaj said spring practice also will prepare his team for the summer passing 
leagues, which have become more prevalent in recent years. Teams participate in 
passing leagues and tournaments in late June and throughout July. 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches and administrators have said that, with the increased activity in 
the summer, spring practice has become obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
However, summer participation is limited to skill-position players: 
quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers and defensive backs. Southern 
Section rules do not allow tackling, and prohibit the use of tackling dummies 
and blocking sleds in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"If the only people who played football were wide receivers and defensive 
backs, then only having the summer would be fine," said Herb Hill, who retired 
last fall after 38 years of coaching, 28 of which were at Loara. 
</P>
<P>
"But in the summer, you can't use blocking bags or blocking sleds, so there 
really isn't anything you can do with the linemen. You need time to work with 
them. Linemen are made, they're not born." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Brown of Century will be trying to find some players who can play on line 
this spring. The school opened two years ago and the Centurions will play on 
the varsity level in the fall for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Century had teams on the sophomore and freshman levels last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be lifting weights like crazy, trying to get our kids big enough to line 
up against varsity teams," Brown said. "We'll also do a lot of work on blocking 
sleds just to get the basics down." 
</P>
<P>
Several coaches said they don't do much conditioning during the spring practice 
time, mainly because it would be wasted. The season is still too far away and 
the kids will be out of shape again by the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a mental edge to be gained from spring workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, the juniors realize that they will be seniors the next year," 
Trabuco Hills Coach Jim Barnett said. "It gets through to them that it's their 
year of high school football. If they're going to be good leaders and take 
charge in August, they have to start thinking about it in May." 
</P>
<P>
Backstrom said he uses spring practice as a way to develop unity among his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards go through drills, work on technique and push around blocking 
sleds. But the last day of spring practice is a beach party. 
</P>
<P>
"It really brings the team together and the kids start getting excited about 
the fall," Backstrom said. "We eat hot dogs and play volleyball and football. 
At the end, we elect the team captains for the following season. It really 
brings the kids together." 
</P>
<P>
Spring practice, though, is not just for the players. With the constant 
turnover of assistant coaches, head coaches need the time to drill their 
staffs. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to teach the staff as well as the kids," said Howell, who has been 
the coach at Western since 1979. "We have staff meetings to go over how our 
practices will be run, then we got out and have some real life experience at 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many benefits from spring football to eliminate it. I know we 
probably wouldn't have won the league title in 1982 without it."

LA QUINTA FAILS TO STOP LOS ALTOS' HEAVY HITTER

<P>
Playing in the Garden Grove League, the La Quinta High School boys' volleyball 
team didn't play against any team with a hitter as powerful as Los Altos' 
Raymond Thorsky. 
</P>
<P>
And the Aztecs' introduction to the 6-foot-4 senior Tuesday night wasn't a 
welcome one. 
</P>
<P>
Thorsky had 31 kills to lead Los Altos to a 14-16, 15-6, 15-8, 15-7 victory 
over La Quinta in the second round of the Southern Section 3-A playoffs at the 
La Quinta gym. 
</P>
<P>
"Thorsky's as good a hitter as we've seen," La Quinta Coach Larry James said. 
"Of course, we play in the Garden Grove League and I don't mean to disparage 
the league, but he's better than anyone else we've played against." 
</P>
<P>
Los Altos Coach Dana Brega said Thorsky "had an off-night." 
</P>
<P>
"He usually plays a lot better," Brega said. "He can hit better than that. I 
thought he was a little inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
Thorsky had 10 kills and a stuff block in the second game as Los Altos erased a 
3-0 deficit. Mike Allen added five of his 15 kills in the game. 
</P>
<P>
James said La Quinta's short lineup -- the Aztecs have only one player taller 
than 6-3 -- struggled against Los Altos' tall front line, which included 6-6 
Brian Burgess and the 6-4 Thorsky. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta didn't appear to be intimidated by the height disadvantage early. The 
Aztecs rallied from a 5-1 deficit in the first game behind seven kills by Green 
to take a 14-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Altos fought off four game points and eventually tied the game at 
14-14. But a Los Altos hitting error and a kill by Chris Doherty gave La Quinta 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Altos started playing a lot better defense after the first game," James 
said. "They just stood around a lot the first game." 
</P>
<P>
Brega agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We start slow sometimes," Brega said. "We haven't been doing that a lot 
lately. We didn't practice (Monday) and it seemed like we hadn't played in a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Price had 16 kills and four blocks, Green had 13 kills and Doherty added 
11 for La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we played reasonably well," James said. "We're not very big and they 
were. We didn't pass well in the middle games and I think we lost some of our 
composure at the end." 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta hit two flat spots in the final two games. 
</P>
<P>
Los Altos built an 8-1 lead in the third game, but La Quinta capitalized on 
four errors and cut the deficit to 9-7. But a kill and a block by Burgess 
helped Los Altos pull away for a 15-8 win. 
</P>
<P>
Burgess' blocking and five La Quinta errors helped Los Altos pull away from a 
6-6 tie in the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A division: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita 3, Simi Valley 2 -- Zak Pelzel had 13 kills and eight blocks as 
host Santa Margarita (16-4) rallied for a 12-15, 12-15, 15-12, 15-9, 15-13 
victory.

CHRIST COLLEGE IRVINE OFFERS JOB TO MARSHALL

<TEXT>
<P>
Christ College Irvine has offered its men's basketball coaching position to 
Westmont College assistant Greg Marshall. Marshall will meet with college 
officials today to discuss the offer. 
</P>
<P>
After a search process of more than two months, college officials narrowed the 
field to Marshall and Estancia High School Coach Tim O'Brien, and Monday 
offered the position to Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said the process, which included two day-long series of interviews and 
a mock basketball practice with the Christ College team, was the most 
exhaustive he has ever gone through. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish it would have happened sooner but that process showed that they knew 
the importance of this position," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, 34, who was an assistant basketball coach at Idaho State and Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo, is also the associate athletic director in charge of 
fund-raising at Westmont. If he accepts the offer from Christ College, he also 
will be taking a fund-raising position. MARTIN BECK

<TEXT>
<P>
Ann Van Dortrecht can't explain why her pitches start straight and then seem to 
take a hop, skip and a jump as they reach the batter's box. 
</P>
<P>
About all the Cal State Fullerton sophomore knows is how she grips the ball and 
flicks her wrist upon release. 
</P>
<P>
She leaves all the physics to those aeronautical engineers known as pitching 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's centrifugal force or something, that's what they tell me," Van Dortrecht 
says. "I never think about it. I just trust what the coaches say and throw it." 
</P>
<P>
Like a superstitious batter during a hot streak, when something works and 
you're not sure why, you don't question it. You just keep doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"I always think my pitches stay straight, but people have told me there's a hop 
to them, so I believe it," Van Dortrecht says. "I can't really tell they hop. I 
just use the split-fingered grip, flip my wrist and they go up somehow." 
</P>
<P>
That's the same direction the Titans (44-21) have gone with Van Dortrecht in 
the pitcher's circle. 
</P>
<P>
The right-hander has a 28-10 record with a Big West Conference-leading 0.44 
earned-run average and 211 strikeouts going into Friday night's NCAA regionals. 
The Titans, ranked fifth nationally, will play host to fourth-ranked Cal State 
Long Beach in a best-of-three series with the winner advancing to the College 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Coach Judi Garman doubted she would have a World Series-caliber pitcher 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
The staff suffered two setbacks in the past year. The first came when Kristen 
Jacobs, a Fullerton College standout who had signed with the Titans, decided to 
return home to Oregon last summer, and the second when 1989 ace Anjie Bryant 
was declared academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Garman didn't know if Van Dortrecht, who went 19-8 with an 0.90 ERA and 136 
strikeouts as the team's No. 2 pitcher last season, was good enough to inherit 
the stopper role, especially when she closed the 1989 season with a sore arm. 
But Van Dortrecht has stepped in nicely. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Ann, we'd be in a world of hurt," Garman said. "She sure has saved us 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
"When school started, I gave the ball to Ann and said, 'The ball's in your 
hands. How well we do depends on how well you do.' I told her to be more 
assertive, take a leadership role and do a good job. She has." 
</P>
<P>
Garman, however, says Van Dortrecht can do even better. Her pitches are 
effective and her control has improved over last season, but there's one 
missing ingredient: A killer instinct. 
</P>
<P>
"To become a great pitcher, she needs to develop more mental toughness," Garman 
said. "She has had success, but she lacks the mental toughness to be 
consistently good. She has had some mental lapses that have gotten us in 
trouble, but with killer instinct, she can block out those distractions." 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, Van Dortrecht said, she was afraid of most hitters. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked a lot of batters because I tried to work around them instead of going 
straight at them," Van Dortrecht said. "But this year, I'm not intimidated by 
many people at all. I feel I can go right at them with my pitches." 
</P>
<P>
For four years at Santa Maria High School, Van Dortrecht went at hundreds of 
batters. She pitched all but five of the Saints' games in four seasons and led 
her team to the Southern Section playoffs four times. The Saints made it to the 
third round every season Van Dortrecht pitched. 
</P>
<P>
Garman recruited Van Dortrecht, but by June of her senior year, the pitcher had 
not scored the required 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test to gain freshman 
eligibility under the NCAA's Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dortrecht took the test again -- the morning after her school's all-night 
graduation party at Disneyland -- but the results were not available until 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Garman couldn't wait that long for a commitment and ran out of scholarships. 
Van Dortrecht had other offers from Arizona State and Nebraska but didn't want 
to leave California to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
So she waited and hoped. In early August, she got back her SAT scores: She had 
surpassed 700. Her father, Ben, called Garman to see if she was still 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
As luck would have it, Julie Jones, a high school pitcher from Yuma, Ariz., who 
had signed with the Titans, decided to attend an Arizona community college 
instead, leaving Garman with an available scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a car and on my way up there with the paper work as fast as I could," 
Garman said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones is now pitching at the University of Arizona and Van Dortrecht is the 
Titans' ace. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really lucky that girl decided not to come here," Van Dortrecht said. 
"It all worked out rather well. She stayed in her home state and I stayed in 
mine."

Hoping to get a leg up in the Japanese market, Rainbow Technologies Inc. in 
Irvine said it has begun marketing in Japan a device designed to prevent 
unauthorized copying of computer software for NEC Corp. personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Craig, Rainbow's sales and marketing vice president, said a custom 
microchip makes the device compatible with NEC's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
NEC dominates the PC market in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes several weeks after Irvine-based AST Research Inc. 
reported plans to sell NEC-compatible PCs in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to reach American software companies that want to export to Japan," 
Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
Craig added that Rainbow is also targeting Japanese software makers who do not 
want their program illegally copied. "With Japan setting new sales records for 
PC software, Rainbow is in a position to offer copyrighted versions of their 
best-selling programs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Japan does not have as many software developers as the United States 
does, software development is expected to grow rapidly in the 1990s. Craig 
estimated that Japan will have 10,000 to 20,000 software developers in the next 
few years, the United States 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Giken-Shogi, a Tokyo-based trading company that markets computer peripherals, 
will sell Rainbow's new device.

Care Enterprises Inc., the Tustin-based company which owns and leases nursing 
homes, posted a loss of $686,000 for the first quarter ended March 31, 
contrasted with earnings of $273,000 for the first quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue fell 9% to $60.4 million from $66.4 million. The company attributed the 
revenue decline to changes in the Medicare program that have reduced the number 
of Medicare patients at the company's facilities and also to a decline in the 
number of facilities operated by the company. 
</P>
<P>
Care Enterprises operates 79 facilities with 8,046 beds during the latest 
quarter, compared with 94 facilities and 9,707 beds a year ago.

ICN Biomedicals, a Costa Mesa supplier of biotechnology research and medical 
diagnostic products, said Tuesday that its price for acquiring Flow 
Laboratories has been reduced from $41.5 million to $37.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Flow Laboratories is a supplier of life sciences research products that was 
acquired by ICN in November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The adjustment in the purchase price was based on a financial review of Flow 
Laboratories by an independent auditing firm, said Jack Sholl, an ICN 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"The acquisition of Flow Laboratories was intended to provide ICN Biomedicals 
with international sales, marketing and distribution capability that it did not 
have before, particularly in the European economic community." Sholl added.

COLLEGE THEATER WINS APPROVAL 'IN PRINCIPLE'

A proposal to build a theater with a capacity of 1,500 to 2,000 seats at 
Saddleback College has taken a tentative step forward, college President 
Constance M. Carroll said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The college trustees "agreed in principle with the scope and function" of an 
ambitious campus arts complex recommended Monday by a planning committee. There 
was, however, no discussion of cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"A year from now, after an architect has been selected and we have a design, 
we'll know better how much it will cost," Carroll said. "We have selected a 
figure of $10 million, but that is just for planning purposes. It could 
fluctuate." 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the 750-seat Irvine Theatre is being built now at UC Irvine for 
$17.6 million. Theater experts who asked not to be named were highly doubtful 
that a professional facility of the size recommended in the Saddleback proposal 
could be built for less than $30 million, particularly if construction were not 
to begin for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said the college hopes to file preliminary architectural plans in 1991 
with the State Chancellor's Office of Community Colleges. The $10-million 
estimate that Saddleback is using for the overall arts complex also includes 
the proposed construction of an art gallery, sculpture garden, rehearsal studio 
and administrative offices. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the planning committee is considering whether to recommend an 
architectural-design competition for the complex or simply to seek low bids. 
The college trustees will make that decision in July, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
If a competition were held, it would delay "the whole planning schedule by a 
year," Carroll added. Thus, preliminary architectural plans would not be filed 
with the state until 1992. Nevertheless, the committee is leaning toward a 
competition, Carroll said, because it wants "not only a functional building" 
but also one with "a design signature." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said that "in the best of all possible worlds" the theater might be 
open by 1996, depending on such variables as future state budgets, construction 
priorities at 107 other community colleges and private fund raising for a 
capital campaign, which has yet to begin.

A woman bystander was killed during a confrontation between sheriff's deputies 
and a gunman, who was wounded, at a South-Central Los Angeles liquor store, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Gianna Marie Blue, 30, was shot twice in the upper torso in the incident that 
broke out late Tuesday at E &amp; W Liquor on South Central Avenue., said 
Deputy Roger Hom, a Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles woman died at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center about 
90 minutes after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez Benson, 25, of Los Angeles was shot and wounded after the gunman 
allegedly pulled his gun on the deputies and pointed it at them. He was 
reported in critical condition after surgery at the same hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Sheriff's Department said it was not clear whether 
bullets fired by the deputies or the gunman killed the woman. An autopsy will 
be conducted to determine that.

POLHILL TO HAVE CANCER OPERATION

Freed American hostage Robert Polhill has a cancerous growth on his left vocal 
cord and his entire larynx -- voice box -- will be removed by surgeons 
Thursday, doctors at Walter Reed Army Hospital said today. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill was released by his Shiite Muslim captors in Lebanon on April 22, and 
has spent most of the time since at Walter Reed. 
</P>
<P>
His raspy voice prompted an early discovery of the tumor, which proved 
malignant in biopsy tests, according to Col. Russ Zajtchuk, deputy commander of 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill's wife, Fifi, and his mother, Ruth Polhill, were at Zajtchuk's side 
when the announcement was made. Polhill remained in his room. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill "will have a recovery period of about 14 days, and then will be 
discharged, and then will come back for a course or radiation therapy," said 
Jim Stueve, hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Stueve said Polhill, 55, has already been working with a speech therapist to 
learn ways to communicate after his larynx is removed. He said there are "three 
or four options" for that, including use of an electronic device that emulates 
the voice box. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the prospects of Polhill's living a full life after the 
surgery are "good." 
</P>
<P>
"He has a very positive attitude," Stueve said.

South Africa's white government announced plans today to abolish decades of 
racial segregation in state hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid doctors immediately welcomed the move, the latest in a series of 
proposed reforms announced this month by President Frederik W. de Klerk's 
8-month-old white government. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has decided that the available capacity of beds in all 
hospitals must be accessible to all persons and that a model be designed to 
manage this in an orderly fashion," Health Minister Rina Venter told 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Venter announced that state health services would be restructured on the basis 
of equality and accessibility to ensure proper treatment for the black 
majority.

Senate, was sworn in today to succeed the late Spark M. Matsunaga as Hawaii's 
junior senator. 
</P>
<P>
Akaka, 63, was escorted to the well of the Senate chamber by the state's senior 
senator, Daniel K. Inouye, also a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
The oath of office was administered by Senate President Pro Tem Robert C. Byrd 
(D-W.Va.). 
</P>
<P>
After taking the oath, Akaka signed his name in the official Senate register as 
colleagues stood and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
Inouye introduced Akaka as the first native Hawaiian to serve in the Senate and 
said he "epitomizes the highest virtues of what we proudly call the aloha 
spirit of Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
Akaka was appointed by Gov. John D. Waihee III to serve until the November 
election. Akaka and the islands' other House member, Rep. Patricia Saiki, a 
Republican, are expected to square off in November for the right to complete 
Matsunaga's term, which expires at the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Akaka has served since 1977 in the House, where he compiled a liberal voting 
record. He is a former schoolteacher.

First Lady Barbara Bush will invite Raisa Gorbachev to join her for an 
appearance at Wellesley College, where students have objected to Mrs. Bush's 
being chosen to receive an honorary degree. 
</P>
<P>
"I will invite her" to attend the June 1 commencement exercises at the 
all-woman college in Wellesley, Mass., Mrs. Bush told reporters Tuesday night 
during a state dinner for Tunisian President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. 
</P>
<P>
"If she wants to come, I'd love to have her go," Mrs. Bush said, adding she was 
not sure what commitments Mrs. Gorbachev has during the May 30-June 4 U.S. 
visit of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
A group of students at Wellesley has protested the selection of Mrs. Bush for 
an honorary degree, saying her only accomplishment was marrying George Bush.

Mrs. Bush dropped out of Smith College during her first year there to marry

BAKER WANTS EXPLANATION FROM SOVIETS; 
</P>
<P>
KEYWORD: SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS HE'LL ASK SHEVARDNADZE WHY MOSCOW HASN'T BEGUN 
TALKS WITH BALTIC STATES.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today the Soviet response to pleas 
that they open negotiations with Baltic republics pushing for independence is 
"not encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, starting four days of talks with Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze, said he would press Soviet officials to explain why they have not 
negotiated with leaders of the restive Baltic states. 
</P>
<P>
"That dialogue has not yet developed," Baker said before going into talks with 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who also is visiting Moscow. "It's not 
encouraging to us to see the absence of a dialogue between leaders there and 
the Kremlin." 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Mubarak, Baker met with Jewish "refuseniks" who have been 
denied Soviet exit permits. He then sat down with Shevardnadze to prepare for 
the U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who also will meet Friday with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
hoped to revive stalemated arms control talks as well as discuss the unrest in 
the Baltics. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze told reporters before his session with Baker at the Soviet Foreign 
Ministry that the fact "we are able to discuss any problem shows we have 
reached a new frontier." 
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to try to speed arms control agreements that were to serve as a 
centerpiece for the summit. "We have been working very intensively," 
Shevardnadze said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Soviets had retreated, as some U.S. officials insist, Shevardnadze 
replied through an interpreter: "I don't think so. This is the view of those 
who really don't know what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, meanwhile, said the effort now to bridge differences "is very important 
when you consider we have only two weeks to go." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders in the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have been 
attempting to open talks with Gorbachev over independence efforts, but the 
Soviet leader has balked. 
</P>
<P>
A pro-independence newspaper, The Estonian Independent, reported that Estonian 
Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar told Baker in a telegram that the Estonian 
government "would be deeply surprised were the incidents in Estonia and Latvia 
not to find reverberation" in his talks with Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
Tension between Moscow and the three breakaway republics casts a shadow over 
the summit, which is due to begin May 30. There are also deep differences 
between U.S. and Soviet negotiators over missile reductions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our desire -- and I hope it's the desire of the Soviets, they say it is 
-- that we can close the gap on all of the major substantive issues by the time 
the two presidents get together in Washington," Baker told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that "We still have a pretty good road to travel. . . . There 
are still a number of issues between us."

The wife of Republican Gov. John Ashcroft had the state library opened on 
Mother's Day so her 12-year-old son could do research for a school report. 
</P>
<P>
Ashcroft said Tuesday, "I was in church, with my other son," when his wife 
opened the library for her son Andy on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thinks it was unfair for his son to enjoy the privilege, he said: 
"I don't know, I wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
Janet Ashcroft and Andy, a seventh-grader, spent more than two hours in the 
library used primarily by the executive and legislative branches of government. 
It is normally open only Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
State Librarian Monteria Hightower said that after she unlocked the library's 
doors on her day off Sunday, an unidentified library staffer remained in the 
building while the Ashcrofts were there from 5 p.m. to about 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do homework assignments for children," she said. "It is odd. When the 
services are closed, they are closed." 
</P>
<P>
The employee will not be paid for the Sunday work, Hightower said.

Also contributing to the increase in operating expenses was $41.9 million

INFLATION RATE COOLS; APRIL PRICES RISE .2%; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE FIRST MODERATE REPORT SINCE SEVERE COLD SENT COSTS SPIRALING SHOWS 
THE SMALLEST INCREASE SINCE SEPTEMBER. 
</P>

<P>
Falling costs for vegetables, fuel oil and women's clothing helped hold 
consumer price inflation to 0.2% in April, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
It was the smallest increase since September and the first moderate report 
after a severe cold snap sent prices spiraling 1.1% in January. The Labor 
Department's consumer price index had risen 0.5% in both February and March. 
</P>
<P>
"We're correcting from the unusually high prices of the winter," said economist 
Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University. "You could argue the worst of 
inflation is behind us, certainly for this year." 
</P>
<P>
Even with the April improvement, inflation for the first four months of the 
year was running at a 6.8% seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from 4.6% for 
all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In April, food and beverage prices fell 0.2%, the first decline since July, 
1987. Non-alcoholic beverages and dairy products were down, while prices rose 
for cereal and bakery products, beef, pork, sweets and oils. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh vegetable prices, which rose 29.2% in the first two months of the year, 
fell 15.5% last month, bringing the decline for April and March to 19.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Energy prices dropped 0.4% after declining the two previous months. Gasoline 
prices, with the start of the warm weather driving season, climbed 0.3% and 
electricity costs were up 0.2%. However, fuel oil fell 0.6%, the third 
consecutive decline, while natural gas dropped 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose a moderate 0.2% 
after rising a worrisome 0.7% in March. Economists say this "core" number is 
often a better indicator of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
New automobile prices fell 0.2% in April. Clothing price inflation moderated 
from a month earlier. Apparel prices overall were unchanged after rising 1.7% 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
Women's and girls' clothing costs fell 0.5%. However, men's and boys' clothing 
costs were up 0.4% while infants' and toddlers' costs rose 1.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Health care costs rose a steep 0.8%, the third increase in a row at that level. 
They were up 8.9% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wholesale prices as measured by the government's producer 
price index have recovered from the winter weather shocks much more swiftly 
than consumer prices. As a result, wholesale prices for the first four months 
of the year have risen at a more moderate annual rate of 4.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the slower recovery of consumer prices to the heavy 
influence of the service sector, which accounts for slightly more than 50% of 
the consumer index and none of the wholesale index. 
</P>
<P>
The economic slowdown of recent months has slowed demand for goods, pulling 
down wholesale costs, but until very recently it hasn't affected employment. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. said 
sluggishness in the goods-producing sector of the economy may finally be 
spreading to services. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're breaking the upward trend of inflation that was introduced 
earlier in the year," he said.

DOW DROPS OFF 2.77 AS TRADERS MULL STATISTICS

Stock prices slipped a bit from record levels today while traders assessed 
inflation statistics that came in close to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 0.92 Tuesday to its second straight 
closing high, dropped 2.77 to 2,819.68. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 703 up, 792 down and 520 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 159.81 million shares, against 165.73 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index lost .17 to 193.14. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported this morning that the consumer price index rose 
0.2% in April, compared to 0.5% increases in the two preceding months. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that reinforced recent evidence inflation was not reviving to the 
extent that traders had feared through much of the winter and early spring. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they said, the market seemed largely to have anticipated the 
news with its rise to record highs earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that investors now are looking for signs that inflationary 
pressures and interest rates can continue their recent decline. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell amid profit-taking today despite the government's reports on 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which fell 13/32 point on Tuesday, was 
off 5/16 point, or about $3.10 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises 
when prices fall, edged up to 8.64% from 8.61% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Market observers pointed to heavy selling in the futures market, which spilled 
over to the cash market. They suspected that some traders were taking profits. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Reiners, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said there 
was "no reason, no information, no rumors" that would have prompted the 
selloff. "It might have been profit-taking," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still others suggested that market participants were looking beyond the April 
inflation figure to the fact that inflation for the first four months of the 
year was running at a 6.8% seasonally adjusted annual rate, despite last 
month's improvement. That's up from 4.6% for all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were 3/8 point lower to 1/32 point higher, intermediate maturities between 1/32 
point to 1/8 point lower and long-term issues were down by 3/16 point, 
according to the Telerate financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
fell 1.14 to 1,148.76. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.91% as the discount rate rose 2 
basis points to 7.66%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.09% as the discount 
gained 1 basis point to 7.68%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.22% as the 
discount rose 2 basis points to 7.65%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity.

Ames Department Stores Inc. has received approval from a bankruptcy judge in 
Manhattan to borrow $250 million in crucial interim financing the troubled 
retailer needs to restructure, a source close to the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ames, whose 1988 acquisition of the Zayre stores triggered its financial woes, 
filed for Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection from creditors April 25 in 
the Southern District of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Ames had submitted to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman a 
request to allow the retailing group, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., to borrow up 
to $250 million in much-needed fresh funds from Chemical Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"The borrowing of new funds has been approved," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Ames, which employs 55,000 people at its 600 stores in 20 states, needed at 
least $150 million to remain in operation.

The Soviet Union, stepping up its drive to integrate into the world economy, 
took a seat as an observer at GATT today for the first time since the 96-nation 
trade forum convened more than four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreed to 
Soviet observer status after Washington and Tokyo dropped objections, and 
Soviet Ambassador Evgeny Makeyev was immediately ushered to a seat in the 
group's assembly chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the White House may have been trying to send a positive signal 
to Moscow ahead of a superpower summit in Washington in two weeks, at a time 
when doubts are being raised on whether the two sides can agree on a strategic 
arms pact. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a general desire to see the summit go well," one Western 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Makeyev expressed Soviet interest in becoming a full member of GATT and said 
Moscow is also studying what kind of relations would be appropriate with other 
institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"This (observer) status offers to the Soviet side an opportunity to get 
acquainted with the methods of work of various GATT bodies for studying the 
conditions of a future accession to GATT," he told the trade forum's council.

Frank Sinatra brought the house down but had to sit down on the job to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get to be my age, you got to sit down once in a while," Sinatra said, 
pulling up a stool and crooning "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered" in front 
of a sellout Radio City Music Hall crowd that gave him several standing 
ovations. 
</P>
<P>
Sinatra, 74, sang for nearly an hour Tuesday night, pumping his fists, jabbing 
his finger and joking with fans who kept calling for "New York, New York" that 
he was going to sing "Secaucus, Secaucus" instead. 
</P>
<P>
He credited "My Way" with "doing more for my career than just about any other 
song," but recalled hating it at first. 
</P>
<P>
And as a huge backdrop of the Manhattan skyline was lowered to the stage, 
Sinatra closed with "New York, New York."

BUYER PLEASED TO GET VAN GOGH AT $82.5 MILLION

The manager of the Japanese gallery that bought Vincent Van Gogh's 1890 
painting "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" at a New York auction for a record $82.5 
million said today he got a good deal for his money. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured people would be surprised by the price, but I think it was not 
really that expensive," said Kazunori Tanabe, the manager of the Kobayashi 
Gallery, which purchased the painting Tuesday for a major Japanese company that 
has not been identified. 
</P>
<P>
The painting, consigned to auction at Christie's by the estate of Siegfried 
Kramarsky, a German-born New York banker, was valued at between $40 million and 
$50 million before the auction. 
</P>
<P>
The sale price of $82.5 million far eclipsed the previous world art auction 
record of $53.9 million paid in 1987 by the Getty Museum in Malibu for another 
Van Gogh work, "Irises." 
</P>
<P>
"Such an exquisite painting rarely appears on the market," Tanabe said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanabe would not say which company bought the painting or whether the company 
intends to show it publicly. Japanese companies often display famous works of 
art at their headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies have purchased many major works of art since the value of 
the Japanese yen began to rise in 1985, making purchases in other currencies 
cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co. Ltd. bought Van Gogh's "Sunflowers" in 
March, 1987, for $38 million and displays it in its head office.

SHELLEY MARSHALS 'THE TROOPS'; 
</P>
<P>
MINISERIES: SHELLEY LONG HANDLES DRAMA ON MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES DEFTLY, 
FLIPPING FROM CHARACTER TO CHARACTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mean Joe is a big black man who protects the children, Lady Catherine is 
stuffy, Sister Mary Catherine is a nun, Ten-Four knows how to cut a business 
deal -- and they are all personalities of Truddi Chase. 
</P>
<P>
A woman with multiple personalities brings out the best in actresses -- Joanne 
Woodward in "Three Faces of Eve," Sally Field in "Sybil" and now Shelley Long 
in "Voices Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase," a four-hour miniseries to air on 
ABC on Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, but the women afflicted in these dramas also seem to develop 
more and more personalities -- Eve had three, Sybil had a batch and Truddi has 
so many of them she refers to them as "The Troops." "Voices Within" is based on 
the book, "When Rabbit Howls," by The Troops for Truddi Chase, written as part 
of Truddi Chase's psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
For Long, the role is a considerable stretch from Diane Chambers on "Cheers," 
and she handles it deftly, flipping from character to character. 
</P>
<P>
The Troops first come to Truddi's rescue when she is 2 years old and assaulted 
by her sadistic stepfather in a cornfield. He's a monster who enjoys subjecting 
her to torture and sexual abuse and the worse things get, the more Troops 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
The show starts with the adult Truddi, who lives in Minneapolis, tracking down 
a man named Paul Schmidt in a small town in Upstate New York and telephoning 
her psychiatrist, played by Tom Conti, that she has found him and will kill 
him. 
</P>
<P>
She boards an airplane and during the trip she and the viewer travel back in 
time to her brutal childhood. "Flicks," as she calls them, are brief memories 
of that time. Then there are the blackouts, and the voices, some of whom talk 
to each other. The one called Rabbit Howls goes back to what her stepfather did 
to her pet white rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
As a young adult, she applies for a job at an ad agency owned by John 
Rubinstein, who falls in love with her and whom she marries. 
</P>
<P>
There are problems in the marriage, and they become increasingly severe after 
Truddi has a baby, a daughter named Page. At the hospital, she obviously 
doesn't even remember the baby's name. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, her loving husband, becomes unable to cope with her peculiarities, her 
strange shifts of mood and personality, her frequent shrewishness interspersed 
with baby talk. Eventually he can't take any more and the marriage breaks up. 
</P>
<P>
Finally she seeks help from a hot line, speaking first to a police officer 
(Alan Fudge) and then to a psychiatrist he recommends. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor wants to find Truddi among The Troops, but he is told that Truddi 
died and that The Troops held a wake for her. "Those who could cried," she 
says, "and Rabbit howled." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the miniseries, Truddi finally confronts the stepfather.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: FILTERING THROUGH COFFEE VS. CHOLESTEROL CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

Question: When are the researchers going to make up their minds about coffee? 
First the commercials tell us that caffeine is bad because it makes you jumpy. 
Then the papers say filtered coffee is better because it won't raise 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
Now I hear that decaf makes cholesterol go up. I won't give up coffee, but 
what's the safest way to drink it? 
</P>
<P>
A. The coffee and cholesterol controversy has been raging for years. At long 
last we are starting to get answers to some puzzling contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago Scandinavian scientists reported that coffee raised cholesterol 
levels, but U.S. investigators couldn't confirm the findings. Now there's an 
explanation. New research shows that the way the coffee is prepared may 
influence the results. 
</P>
<P>
Scandinavians generally boil the grounds, and coffee prepared that way raises 
cholesterol. Americans mostly make coffee with a paper filter, which appears to 
eliminate whatever component raises cholesterol. Unfortunately, decaffeinated 
coffee, even if filtered, may raise the bad LDL cholesterol level. Unless 
another study contradicts these findings, stick with regular filtered coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I had to laugh when I read about all the interest in Bag Balm for dry skin. 
We have been using an udder product called Bova Cream for years. It is 
greaseless, odorless and doesn't stain. You can't get a better hand cream. 
</P>
<P>
A. We have been inundated by enthusiastic readers endorsing both Bag Balm and 
Bova Cream for dry, cracked skin. Several catalogues now carry Bag Balm, 
including Burpee and the Vermont Country Store. You can also order it directly 
from the Dairy Assn. Co., Lyndonville, Vt. 05851. Bova Cream is sold by 
agricultural co-ops across the country.

A one-time Arkansas beauty queen who dreams of running 2,000 miles along 
China's Great Wall said today she has won government approval for the adventure 
but may have to detour around areas closed by the Chinese military. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Miller Perdue, 51, said she hopes to attract "key Americans who the 
Chinese people identify with" to eat lunch with during stops along the famous 
wall in northern China that was built as a defense against invaders in the 3rd 
Century BC. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Jackson could certainly afford to do that, couldn't he?" she said at a 
news conference at the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The blonde Miss Arkansas of 1958 and Miss America finalist joked about her 
"fading beauty" and her "bird legs" but said she hopes to inspire women around 
the world "to believe in yourself at any age, whether you are rich or poor, 
whether you have a husband or don't have a husband." 
</P>
<P>
In response to her proposal, she said, "All I got from Chinese businessmen was 
the statement, 'You must be an insane female to want to do this.' Maybe I was 
insane but I don't think it was because I was female."

The District of Columbia, fighting an uphill battle to get a National League 
expansion team, has thrown out a proposal to create a lottery game that would 
allow residents to vote on professional sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
D.C. Councilman Frank Smith, who is also chairman of the city's baseball 
commission, said the game would cripple efforts of the nation's capital to 
return a major league team to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The D.C. lottery board tentatively approved legalized sports gambling May 2 and 
planned to launch its "Sports Pool Lottery" with football betting when the NFL 
season opens in September. 
</P>
<P>
The district council took the emergency action, which does not require a 60-day 
congressional review period, on Tuesday because of the lottery board's 
intention to move quickly to establish the sports lottery. The measure, 
effective for 90 days, would prohibit the board from establishing lotteries to 
bet on football, basketball and other professional sports. The council is 
expected to permanently bar sports lotteries.

Vince Coleman and Terry Pendleton each homered, pacing a 10-hit St. Louis 
attack and Bryn Smith won his fifth game as the Cardinals defeated the slumping 
Houston Astros 10-6 today. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 5-3, had a no-hitter through five innings against the Astros, who have 
lost six in a row and nine of 10 and scored only 15 runs in their last eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
He tired in the sixth when Rafael Ramirez hit a leadoff home run and ended up 
allowing six hits and five runs, three of them earned, in 6 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman batting eighth -- the first time he's started out of the leadoff spot 
in his career -- responded with his first home run since Sept. 8. His two-run 
shot off Jim Deshaies, 1-2, highlighted a seven-run fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton hit his second home run in the sixth. Willie McGee had a pair of 
RBI-doubles and Todd Zeile had a two-run double for the Cardinals.

<P>
After eliminating the team of the '80s, the Phoenix Suns say they're ready to 
stake their claim as the NBA's team of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns arrived at Sky Harbor International Airport about 1 a.m. and were 
greeted by 9,000 screaming fans jamming the concourse level. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how much basketball can do for the morale of a city," guard Kevin 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix advanced to the Western Conference finals for the second consecutive 
year by beating the Lakers, 106-103, Tuesday night. (Story, C1). 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be the team of the next decade," said Johnson, who scored a playoff 
career-high 37 points in Game 5. "We want to play well not just for one year, 
but for the decade. The way to do that is to start here." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson said the Lakers will remain a power to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just our year to beat them. As long as they have Magic Johnson, 
they'll be a great team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were great during the regular season, going 63-19 for the league's 
best record. But they came into the playoffs flat, and, with the exception of a 
few explosive quarters, remained that way. 
</P>
<P>
"We really played out of character against Houston and Phoenix," Lakers Coach 
Pat Riley said. "We played like we were capable of playing in maybe 2 1/2 of 
our nine playoff games." 
</P>
<P>
In the '80s, the Lakers won eight consecutive division titles and five world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great win for our team, our fans and our whole city -- and it's about 
time," said Suns President Jerry Colangelo, who coached the team in 1970 when 
it blew a 3-1 lead against the Lakers and lost a seven-game playoff series. 
"This is a milestone." 
</P>
<P>
"It feels like the world championship," all-star forward Tom Chambers said. 
"But it's only the second round. We have to continue to play like this and not 
let this be the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix has won only one conference title, in 1976. The Suns upset the Golden 
State Warriors in seven games that year, then lost to the Boston Celtics in six 
games in the NBA Finals. It's the only time in the Suns' 22-year history they 
have played for the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Suns struggled through injuries to a 54-28 record and needed a 
last-second jumper by Johnson in Game 5 at Utah to eliminate the Jazz in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
"The Suns are a great team. If they continue to play like they did against us, 
they are going to have a dream season," Riley said. "They have a lot of great 
weapons and they have a great opportunity to win the NBA championship."

TAC, the overning body of track and field competition in the United States, 
said Bill Payne, 22, of Joshua, Tex., tested positive for pseudoephedrine, a

<P>
The test was made from a sample taken Feb. 23 at the USAMobile Indoor Track and

A review panel upheld the suspension earlier this month. It will be effective 
April 4 through July 4.

TRUMPETER HUBBARD A JAZZ MUSICIAN OF MANY STYLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, who opens tonight for a five-night stint at Elario's 
in La Jolla, is a gambler. He has played everything from be-bop to free jazz to 
'70s fusion and now a sort of '90s take on fusion, with the help of 
synthesizers. 
</P>
<P>
Like all gamblers, Hubbard doesn't always come up with aces. He is decidedly 
ambivalent about "Times Are Changing," a collaboration with composer and 
synthesizer wiz Todd Cochran released last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, Oh," he said by phone from his home in Hollywood Hills when asked about 
the album. He laughed a little. "I experimented, I tried it and it didn't work. 
The music is a little too far away from what I was doing, as far as acoustic 
versus electric music. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people were ready for it. My normal jazz fans weren't into it. 
They aren't that much into synthesizer." 
</P>
<P>
Although the album made an appearance on Contemporary Jazz charts and received 
some radio play on stations Hubbard referred to as "New Age," it didn't get 
much support from Blue Note, Hubbard's label at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Note executives Bruce Lundvall and Michael Cuscuna had expected an album 
of more traditional jazz. When Hubbard told them about the synthesizers, they 
flew to Los Angeles for a listen and gave the project their blessing. 
Apparently that didn't translate into adequate marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they followed with promotions like they should have," Hubbard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the trumpeter is little gun shy and in search of a label that will give 
him better support. 
</P>
<P>
He has toyed with ways of merging rap and funk with his own jazz leanings, but, 
after the "Times Are Changing" experience, wonders whether another departure 
from his norm could be successful. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, his next recording will be with singer Betty Carter, hailed by critics 
as one of the few true jazz vocalists around. 
</P>
<P>
"She's deeply rooted in that be-bop/scatting thing," Hubbard said. "I always 
wanted to record with Sarah Vaughan before she died. Betty will pick up the 
torch." 
</P>
<P>
Another project later this year will pair 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard with the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra for an album of standards. 
</P>
<P>
Commonly thought of as a trumpeter, Hubbard has made some of his best music 
using the fuller, mellower sound of the fluegelhorn. 
</P>
<P>
"I still play a lot of fluegelhorn, especially on ballads," Hubbard said. 
"Lately, I've been using a mute a lot with the trumpet." 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard has long been hoping to match the '70s success he attained with "Red 
Clay," made for the CTI label, where producer Creed Taylor pioneered the idea 
of merging jazz with rock and funk. 
</P>
<P>
Artists like Hubbard, saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. and guitarist George 
Benson enjoyed their first big commercial successes with CTI. The title track 
from "Red Clay" is still a favorite with Hubbard's fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I did a State Department good-will tour of South America: Mexico 
City, Guatemala, Nicaragua. 'Red Clay' was all they wanted to hear. I found out 
that the music is down there, they knew more about me there than some places in 
the States. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for another 'Red Clay.' I'd like to have another song with that 
impact that crossed over." 
</P>
<P>
At 52, Hubbard wants to taper his frenetic traveling schedule, but he is in 
constant demand, especially in Japan, where American jazz musicians are revered 
almost like Madonna is stateside. 
</P>
<P>
"They put us on big billboards and television," Hubbard marveled. He has 
already played Yokohama and Tokyo this year, and will visit Japan again in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in Indianapolis, Hubbard began working with local players like 
the Montgomery brothers (guitarist Wes and bassist Monk) while still in his 
teens. His first recordings were made with Wes Montgomery in the late '50s. 
</P>
<P>
He took a brief flyer into the avant garde in the early '60s, teaming with 
Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane for various projects. In 1961, he replaced 
trumpeter Lee Morgan in drummer Art Blakey's hard-charging Jazz Messengers. The 
big band setting seemed natural for Hubbard's bright, polished sound, with its 
signature high trills and honey-smooth runs through the scales. 
</P>
<P>
He recorded several albums as a leader and as a sideman with players like 
Herbie Hancock, Bobby Hutcherson, Jackie McLean and Dexter Gordon before 
hitting his big CTI success of the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Sax man Gordon, who died last month, left quite an impression. Hubbard last 
worked with him on the sound track for the jazz movie "Round Midnight." 
</P>
<P>
"If you listen to Dexter, you'll see a lot of young guys came out of him, even 
John Coltrane and Sonny Stitt. He had a big sound, but he could also articulate 
fast. He wanted me to work with him because he thought I had a big enough sound 
to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember he hit a low B flat on that tenor and it shook the whole studio 
like one of those boat horns in a harbor. He could play ballads so beautiful, 
man. You could almost hear the lyrics. He taught me a lot of old standards." 
Hubbard began singing "You've Changed" over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
As for his own music, Hubbard wants to assemble a steady acoustic jazz group he 
can grow with. Pianist Benny Greene, drummer Carl Allen, and saxophonists Bob 
Shepard and Don Brayden are among the musicians he mentions. 
</P>
<P>
New music and new projects are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote a thing based on 'Giant Steps' for 'Trane called 'Dear John.' Cedar 
Walton, Billy Higgins and Herbie Lewis, we might do an album of (Thelonious) 
Monk stuff." He pounded out some Monkish piano over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Hubbard will be backed by Shepard, Marshall Hawkins on bass, 
Sherman Ferguson on drums and Randy Porter on piano. 
</P>
<P>
The material will include several songs from his 1987 "Life Flight" album, 
possibly a few tunes from "Times Are Changing," plus standards and other 
Hubbard originals.

A SURVIVOR'S STORY; 
</P>
<P>
EL SALVADOR: FATHER JON DE CORTINA RECOUNTS THE STILL UNSOLVED MURDERS OF HIS 
JESUIT BRETHREN ON MISSION IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an address last Friday to a hastily assembled group of priests and rabbis at 
St. Nicholas Episcopal Church in Encino, the best-known of the surviving 
Jesuits of El Salvador provided grim, previously unreported details about the 
murders that may have changed the course of the war in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Spain, but an El Salvador citizen and resident of that country for most 
of his adult life, Father Jon de Cortina has become the point man in a dialogue 
that the Jesuits' enemies clearly want halted. 
</P>
<P>
Six Jesuits were murdered during the Marxist FMLN guerrilla offensive last 
November, half of the Jesuit faculty of the tiny University of Central America 
in San Salvador. Though William Walker, U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, 
initially suggested they had been slain by the FMLN, Alfredo Cristiani, 
president of El Salvador, later admitted the Salvadoran army was the principal 
suspect. An investigation, faulted by many as a cover-up in the making, has 
been in progress for months. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a Times reporter after his address, Cortina -- slender, 
soft-spoken, an intellectual more at ease with precise, even elegant, 
distinctions than with confrontational rhetoric -- says that he expects the 
killers to go unpunished because El Salvador "is effectively without civilian 
government." Two days before the slaughter, he says by way of explanation, a 
group of army officers had arrived, unannounced, at the Jesuit residence. Such 
intrusions were nothing new. What was new was that, this time, the intruders 
had only one question: They wanted to know which priest slept where. 
</P>
<P>
The surviving Jesuits have pieced together a chronology of the murder by 
talking to neighbors who, though housebound because of the army-imposed curfew, 
could hear a great deal. None of these people are expected to testify, however, 
and, Cortina says, the Jesuits do not wish them to do so: The cost could be too 
great. 
</P>
<P>
The house where the murders occurred, though still habitable, is empty because, 
for the Jesuits who might move in, "the emotional associations are simply too 
powerful to endure." The killers incinerated all the priests' research archives 
and audiovisual equipment -- with a flamethrower, it is speculated, because 
"the heat was so intense that it melted glass." They sprayed the Jesuits' house 
and cars with bullets. Some time before leaving, "they put a bullet through the 
heart of a portrait of Oscar Romero," the slain archbishop of San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Cortina explains that the two women slain that night, the Jesuits' cook and her 
daughter, had been taken in, ironically, for safety during the guerrilla 
offensive. They had not been in residence during the army's scouting visit two 
days earlier. According to a soldier who has defected and is now in hiding, 
Cortina adds, the killers telephoned headquarters about the women and received 
explicit instructions to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
Where will the investigation lead? "The intellectual authors of this crime will 
never be punished," Cortina says, for if they were, "a chain reaction of mutual 
recriminations would result that could destroy the ruling structure of the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on a proposal by House Democrats to halt one-half of U.S. aid 
to El Salvador but preserve the remaining half so long as President Bush finds 
the Salvadoran government is making a good-faith effort to bring the killers to 
justice, Cortina shrugs. For several years during the previous administration, 
he recalls, aid was made contingent on then-President Reagan's certification, 
every six months, that the Salvadoran government was making good-faith efforts 
to restrain human-rights abuses by the army. "The certification never failed to 
come," he says, but the abuses continued. "Some of the very worst of the 
massacres were during that period." 
</P>
<P>
He adds that the Salvadoran army has recently established its own bank. 
"Neither the U.S. government, I fear, nor the government of El Salvador knows 
whether the aid money is even staying in the country." 
</P>
<P>
The slain Jesuits have been replaced, in one sense. Worldwide, more than 200 
Jesuits offered to take their places, and half a dozen of the volunteers have 
now been accepted. A labor of mediation, however, has been hideously disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
The slain men had been prominent in San Salvador, functioning as urbane bridges 
between the ruling Arena party and the FMLN. Indeed, the cordiality between 
Ignacio Ellacuria, the slain head of the university, and President Alfredo 
Cristiani was such that even after the FMLN offensive last November, Cortina 
says, Ellacuria saw no reason to evacuate his men. He was confident Cristiani 
could protect them. 
</P>
<P>
Cortina himself, until the slaughter forced him into the role of spokesman, 
preferred to build another kind of bridge. He is a practicing as well as a 
teaching engineer, less in his element barnstorming across the United States 
than piloting a Jeep across the mountain trails of rural Chalatenango. In parts 
of rural El Salvador, an American priest reports, Cortina's death-defying 
manner at the wheel is a minor legend. The priest-engineer was in Chalatenango 
on El Salvador's night of the long knives. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he was or is safe in Chalatenango. The Salvadoran army, which would 
turn the remote, mountainous province into a free-fire zone in its war on the 
FMLN guerrillas, has seen him frustrate its strategy by leading peasants back 
from government-imposed exile in Honduras to their abandoned homes and fields. 
The army was prepared to destroy Chalatenango to save it. Jon de Cortina was 
not, and his 20-city tour of the United States is in part a fund-raising tour 
for his embattled campesinos. 
</P>
<P>
A local Salvadoran jokes of Cortina's 20-city U.S. tour: "He'll have to go back 
to El Salvador for a rest!" 
</P>
<P>
"For arrest?" Cortina quips dryly. The question -- Cortina as a marked man -- 
has been heavy in the air. Laughter clears the air, at least for a moment. The 
friend then recalls a Cortina quip on another occasion that may have saved them 
both from arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm talking to the army," Cortina smiles, "I begin every conversation 
with the assumption that, of course, they are right and I am wrong. And then we 
go on from there." The smile, on a cleric with a faint resemblance to Alec 
Guinness, is one Graham Greene might appreciate, or Robert Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Cortina's remarks approach fatalism. "We touched the idols of death, 
and the idols answered back," he says. He adds: "They haven't had enough yet." 
And yet he claims the radicalism that cost his brethren their lives was not 
Marxism of any kind but simply radical hope, and he remains radically hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
The intervention of U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar in El 
Salvador has enhanced the prospect of genuine negotiations, he says. The 
slaying of the Jesuits may have been inevitable, given the social structure of 
the country, he says, and the suppression of any serious investigation of the 
slayings may be consistent with the same structure, and yet he sees a striking 
benefit: "The church has been trying to make a 'preferential option' for the 
poor, but since these deaths, I think the poor are making a 'preferential 
option' for the church." Finally, if against all likelihood the killers are 
brought to justice, "it will be a proof that serious dialogue is beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman-in-spite-of-himself, the engineer with the steady gaze 
and the thin smile, is on his way back to El Salvador, back to Chalatenango. 
There is a half-built bridge waiting there. He wants to finish it.

MICHELE LAMY SOMEHOW KNITS IT ALL TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When she was a teen-ager she performed the striptease at county fairs in 
France. In time, she settled down and got a law degree. 
</P>
<P>
He was a performance artist who had a street evangelist act, "The Great and 
Glorious Reverend Rick." 
</P>
<P>
To pair them up would be either the act of a twisted Hollywood scriptwriter or 
a delicious twist of fate. In their case the fates took the upper hand. The 
French country girl, Michele Lamy, has become one of the best known clothing 
designers in Los Angeles. Her artist husband, Richard Newton, is now a movie 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
The unlikely couple live in Hancock Park with their 9-year-old daughter, 
Scarlett Rouge, in a white clapboard Colonial house. From the flower-lined 
front sidewalk it looks very American. The mailing address could be Anywhere, 
U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
But peeking out from behind the second-story roof line is the telltale sign 
that all is not as it seems. A Dijon mustard-colored stucco structure, a studio 
addition by contemporary architect Frank Israel, smacks up against the Colonial 
clapboards. When they are not gallivanting about town, the Lamy-Newtons hole up 
inside the Israel room. That is where the large-screen television, exercise 
bike, dining table capable of seating 20, kitchen and two worn sofas are 
located. 
</P>
<P>
"There were other houses we liked better, architecturally," Newton said about 
his house that he described as "Beaver Cleaver-style." "But Michele wanted to 
be in this location, close to everything." 
</P>
<P>
Everything, for Lamy, is a multifaceted career and diverse family obligations. 
She heads a $10-million fashion business, owns a retail store, Traction Avenue, 
in the Beverly Center and more recently she opened a homey, French bistro, Cafe 
des Artistes, in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
While other parents keep tabs on their childrens' scout meetings, Lamy's family 
obligations include keeping tabs on her daughter's performances in a rock 'n' 
roll band, Visiting Kids. She is also the executive producer for Newton's first 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
Her fashion designs have bankrolled her diversification. Each season her 
collections combine old favorites with new shapes. Among the recurring themes 
are her most popular knitwear garments: fly-away vests, tunic tops (both short 
and long) and leggings. The silhouettes of her jackets change from season to 
season. 
</P>
<P>
For the coming fall she draped web-like constructions of knitted fabric around 
the shoulders and waists of her models who wore a basic under-layer of 
bustiers, miniskirts and leggings. The close fitting stretchy knit separates 
for women are so popular that the I. Magnin Palm Desert store is adding a 
full-scale Lamy boutique. 
</P>
<P>
"Because her things are easy fitting and unconstructed, they fit a multitude of 
figures and figure problems," said Carolyn Biggs, the store's manager. With 
economical price tags starting at $65 the sales associates have found it easy 
to sell five or six pieces to each Lamy customer. "We always sell multiples," 
Biggs said. 
</P>
<P>
For a while there was a Lamy men's wear line, but that was short-lived. The 
Star Trek look of the clothes, with their stretchy leggings, body-hugging 
jackets and the like, were futuristic by any standards -- perhaps too much so 
for most men. While the line came and went in just one year's time, there is 
speculation among Lamy's staff that it will resurface next year. Customers 
still call the designer at her factory, asking for more. 
</P>
<P>
But before there was any of this, there was Lamy the French lawyer. She 
switched to a fashion career in 1974 when she began having philosophical 
problems with the French judicial system. She says she had more of an affinity 
for the people she had to defend than those involved in the legal profession. 
</P>
<P>
When she gave up law, Lamy moved to New York City and started making plastic 
jewelry. The accessories business was a logical career change since her family 
owns an eyewear company in France. For one year she lived in Manhattan's 
Chelsea Hotel, then the hotbed of the emerging punk scene ("the good years," 
Lamy calls them). But in 1975 she was looking for a new direction. Her brother, 
who had visited Los Angeles, suggested she move here. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me Los Angeles was like New York City and the Riviera. I came here 
just to see how it looked and I stayed. I felt at home when I arrived." 
</P>
<P>
Lamy is a petite woman with piercing eyes, given to wearing rag-tag pieces of 
clothing and yarmulkes, who binds her burgundy-colored hair in twists of 
fabric. She uses body language more than direct verbal responses. Her voice is 
smoky with a heavy Gallic accent. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel especially French. I feel like I'm from here," she said. She has 
taken to Los Angeles with a vengeance and considers herself a native. It is 
only when she speaks that she gives herself away. 
</P>
<P>
Lamy does not look or act like an polished French fashion designer. "I thought 
it was nice with my provincial bourgeoise background to look like this," she 
said amid the clutter of her office, dressed in an knit shirt that had lost its 
memory for elastic response, and a pair of leggings. 
</P>
<P>
Even though she has a multimillion-dollar fashion business, she pointed to her 
foot and said, "See? I have a hole in my sock." 
</P>
<P>
For eight years, Lamy and Newton worked together to build the Michele Lamy line 
of contemporary knitwear. Newton ran the business and Lamy did the designs. 
Eighteen months ago, Newton left to pursue his film ambitions. Lamy took on a 
partner, David Guez, to help with the business and to free her time so she was 
able to work as executive producer on Newton's "Small White House," a 
low-budget film shot in Tijuana. She found the money to produce the film, which 
was recently finished. The couple is shopping for a distributor. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's just our temperaments, but Michele and I are good for each other," 
Newton confided, reflecting on their 11 years together. 
</P>
<P>
Since their marriage, Lamy and Newton have become fixtures and catalysts of the 
nighttime club scene in Los Angeles. When the trendy nightclub, Flaming 
Colossus, was in business they had a special table, where they were likely to 
be found on a regular basis. Now that Lamy has her restaurant they are hosting 
some of the season's hot-ticket events there. 
</P>
<P>
Several seasons ago Lamy abandoned the formatted fashion shows at the 
California Mart in favor of showing at Cafe des Artistes. "The kind of shows 
she wanted were more like happenings than fashion shows," remembered Yvette 
Crosby who worked at the Mart during the years that Lamy participated. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of fashion I am doing is not meant for the runways," said Lamy. "It's 
made to be lived in. The people are more important than the clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Lamy's fashion shows are a gathering of her friends. She uses them for models, 
and when the show is over they move back into the crowd of musicians, artists 
and fashion folks. 
</P>
<P>
At her last fashion week show, Anne Crawford, society editor of L.A. Style 
magazine, and Barbara Leary, wife of Timothy Leary, were two of the gamboling 
manikins in the back yard at Cafe des Artistes. 
</P>
<P>
Before the show Lamy calmly greeted her guests and saw to their comfort. Her 
minions dashed about looking for shoes, reseated people and cleared a path for 
the models to pass through the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd. In short, it was 
bedlam, but Lamy was completely unfazed. She waits until the last possible 
minute to plan her shows and lets the details sort themselves out. 
</P>
<P>
Lamy's style can wreak havoc at the office. "Everything is completely 
unplanned, there is something unexpected around every corner," said Brian 
Watson, one of her employees. But she is also capable of instilling a rabid 
devotion from the same people who find her management style unorthodox. "If her 
unpredictability is a problem, then it is a problem for us, not her," says 
Watson. 
</P>
<P>
Lamy has found her niche in Los Angeles and surrounded herself with supportive 
people, who she, in turn, nurtures. "There are a lot of people I like, and I 
like the way they see things. It's visual, artistic and tough," she said. 
"Here, I feel comfortable in my skin."

CATCHING HIS DREAM OF MAJORS;

<P>
BASEBALL: THE WAIT SOON WILL BE OVER FOR SDSU CATCHER ERIC CHRISTOPHERSON, WHO 
EXPECTS TO BECOME A FIRST-ROUND PICK IN THE JUNE MAJOR LEAGUE FREE AGENT DRAFT.

<P>
Eric Christopherson is sitting in a San Diego State assistant baseball coach's 
office. It is about one month before he expects to cash in a lifetime dream and 
become a first-round pick in the June major league free agent draft. 
</P>
<P>
He stares down at his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's wise to say anything," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He looks back up. His lips curl into a smile, his eyes glimmer. Here it comes. 
</P>
<P>
The Eric Christopherson Scouting Report. On Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't hit, and they can't run," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Pause. 
</P>
<P>
Laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Just kidding." 
</P>
<P>
Hey. Seems only fair. So many scouts have filled out so many forms on 
Christopherson that he might as well get the chance to turn the tables. 
</P>
<P>
See, he knows these people well. They started following him in his final years 
at Ocean View High School in Huntington Beach, then tracked him to San Diego 
State and continued the watch. 
</P>
<P>
Their reports prompted the Oakland A's to draft him in the 14th round after his 
senior year at Ocean View in 1987. When he decided to wait, it only meant they 
would spend many more nights at the ballpark watching Christopherson develop, 
filling out new reports. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, he notices the scouts during batting practice. They arrive early, 
cluster around behind home plate and watch him take infield. They carry 
briefcases stuffed with index cards, notebooks filled with observations, and 
stopwatches and radar guns packed with hard numbers. 
</P>
<P>
They're pretty easy to spot. 
</P>
<P>
"They usually show up by themselves," Christopherson said, continuing his 
scouts' report. "They're dressed nice. Casually nice. Some of them straight out 
wear a hat or jacket with what team they're from." 
</P>
<P>
Their phone calls interrupt his days and their mail litters his apartment. The 
calls are constant and, lately, have been coming as early as 7:30 or 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all right," he said. "Whatever is convenient for them. It doesn't 
bother me." 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the games, when the baseball diamond is a big fishbowl and 
Christopherson is the prize catch. There have been as many as 30 scouts at a 
single game this spring, grading him and thickening their notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
"The poor guy is getting hammered," SDSU Coach Jim Dietz said. "I'll be glad to 
get back out on the road for his sake." 
</P>
<P>
Even when the Aztecs are on the road, two or three scouts generally show up. 
</P>
<P>
But with Christopherson's junior year coming to a close, the scouts are about 
to close their notebooks on him. 
</P>
<P>
Christopherson says he is ready to chase his dream. 
</P>
<P>
The word on the grapevine is that the kid is legitimate. He's a catcher, which 
is a high-demand position in the major leagues. Baseball America says he is one 
of the top 10 college prospects for the June draft. 
</P>

A cross-section of a couple scouting reports on him: soft hands, outstanding 
arm, quick release, better-than-average velocity and ball carry, agile, quick 
feet and a good catcher's body. (Christopherson is 6-feet-1, 190 pounds). 
</P>
<P>
In a sport in which a player's future is determined by the sum of his parts, 
this isn't a bad start. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the better catchers in the U.S.," said one full-time scout, who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity for both himself and the organization for 
which he works. "College-wise, he should be ranked in the top three. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether he'll hit for a high average in professional baseball. 
But with his defensive skills, if he hits .240 it would be a plus. . . . His 
baseball has improved each year (in college). He has gotten to the point where 
he is close to major league ability in catching right now." 
</P>
<P>
The scouts say he needs to work on his hitting. Christopherson says he can hit 
better than the scouts think. Whatever, he has improved at the plate. Entering 
this week's Western Athletic Conference playoffs, he is batting .340, with six 
home runs, five triples and 16 doubles. He also has 44 runs-batted in, third on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
In his first two years at SDSU, he had no homers and one triple. He batted .283 
his freshman year and .256 his sophomore season, but it wasn't enough to 
satisfy him. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't ever play as well as I could have the first two years," he said. "I 
knew that, and it was really frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Dietz thought Christopherson did fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Freshmen are freshmen," Dietz said. "It's like a disease. It only goes away in 
a year. My expectations for him are just what's happened. To see him improve 
each year." 
</P>
<P>
Christopherson was frustrated enough that he decided to work harder than ever 
over the summer, fall and winter. He decided to play in Alaska over the summer 
with several other top college players. The way he figured it, they didn't know 
him and he didn't know them. He could just play, without expectations from 
other people. 
</P>
<P>
Then he set a goal. Pretty simple, really. 
</P>
<P>
"To be in the position I'm in right now," he said. "To do well enough to be a 
first-round draft pick." 
</P>
<P>
All he ever wanted to be was a baseball player. He is in his third year of 
majoring in baseball at SDSU, and he doesn't try to hide it. 
</P>
<P>
"School isn't exactly my favorite thing," he said. "School has definitely not 
been a priority. I'll admit to that." 
</P>
<P>
So many college athletes breeze through classes while chasing a professional 
dream. So many times, they drift off toward what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
"He loves the game of baseball," Dietz said. "That's about the only thing he 
really lives for. Some guys live and die to become an engineer. Some guys live 
and die to become CPAs. He's living and dying to become a major league baseball 
player. I think he's probably got the ability to pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
The times Christopherson regretted passing on Oakland's offer came late at 
night, when the only sounds in his apartment were the rustles of him turning 
the page of a textbook as he studied for an exam. Sometimes his mind would 
change directions and at times he would find himself thinking of Brent 
Knackert. 
</P>
<P>
Christopherson and Knackert were teammates at Ocean View High, and Knackert is 
one of Christopherson's best friends. One day, they assured each other, Brent 
would be pitching to Eric in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Knackert made it first. He is a rookie pitcher with the Seattle Mariners, and 
Christopherson is pretty impressed. He last talked with Knackert in April, when 
Seattle was in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me some stories," Christopherson said. "It's unbelieveable . . . I was 
playing high school three years ago with the guy. He was telling me that a 
couple of nights ago, he struck out Jose Canseco twice and Mark McGwire once. 
He was telling me he'd probably be pitching the next day against Wade Boggs. 
Just thinking about it . . . wow! I caught him all through high school and the 
summer leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Those weren't the first stories Knackert told Christopherson. He was with the 
Mets during spring training, and they also talked then. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really weird to hear about Howard Johnson, Dwight Gooden and Darryl 
Strawberry," Christopherson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Christopherson had his reasons for turning down Oakland. He thought he 
could go to college and improve both his game and his draft position. He told 
his mother he would be a first-round draft pick in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought I needed to get better and stronger and mature more," 
Christopherson said. "I think I've done that." 
</P>
<P>
The statistics bear him out. His average and power numbers at the plate are up, 
but perhaps most telling is that he is tied for the team lead in walks with 53. 
He has become much more patient at the plate than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't take him too long to be catching in the big leagues," said Dan 
Dixon of the Major League Scouting Bureau. "He's the best defensive catcher 
I've seen in seven years of scouting." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon is responsible for San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
"As a receiver, he could probably be there right now," Dixon continued. "Same 
with his arm. It just seems like he is learning how to deal with the pressure. 
That was one of his weaknesses his first two years (at SDSU)." 
</P>
<P>
His SDSU teammates started calling him 'Stro during the summer before his 
freshman year. It's short for Astro, the dog on The Jetson's television show. 
</P>
<P>
"He was kind of in his own world," said outfielder Jeff Barry, a freshman with 
Christopherson and one of his closest friends. "When he was catching, if he 
wasn't up (to bat), he would keep all of his gear on and sit in the corner of 
the dugout and not talk. And he had long hair and he always had a hand in it, 
curling it, like his mind was on something else." 
</P>
<P>
Said assistant coach Gary Brown: "He kind of had that spacey demeanor, like 
you're on a planet somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, he is still called 'Stro, but he has grown up. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he waits for the June draft, and his first summer in professional 
baseball. He doesn't even try to count how many tests the scouts have given him 
-- motivational, personality, eye . . . he runs through them all, knowing that 
his most important tests will come in the future. 
</P>
<P>
