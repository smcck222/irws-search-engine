RECIPES WITH A HISTORY OF PLEASING; 
</P>
<P>
'CENTENNIAL COOKBOOK' SERVES UP OLD-TIME DISHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Traditional American food is experiencing a renaissance, which makes the Orange 
County Pioneer Council's "Centennial Cookbook, 1889-1989" a work of special 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
Recipes that might have been disregarded when nouvelle, "trendy" food dominated 
the scene receive the attention they deserve in its pages. They are old-time 
dishes from area pioneers, compiled along with segments of oral history by the 
Orange County Pioneer Council. The book was printed at the Friis-Pioneer Press 
in Santa Ana and celebrates the county's centennial year. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered throughout are recipes with titles that indicate strong family ties, 
among them mom's applesauce cake, my Grandmother Steffen's persimmon pudding, 
Grandmother Yost's sour cream-raisin pie, Grandma Ross' Lemon Cream Pie, mama's 
Boston brown bread and Great-Grandfather Lunt's spoon bread. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oldies but Goodies 
</P>
<P>
A chile sauce originated with a woman born in Santa Ana in 1893. A bride who 
arrived in California in 1885 handed down a recipe for rock cookies, and a 
family of El Toro pioneers passed a recipe for pickled green beans from one 
generation to the next. A recipe for strawberry mousse was found in "Aunt Lois' 
old recipe book," and a golden loaf cake appeared in a cookbook dated Santa 
Ana, 1885. 
</P>
<P>
The contributor's name and the pioneer family represented accompany each 
recipe, along with remembrances of times almost forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no refrigeration in those days. Only ice boxes and no ice man. 
People would go to town to get ice," reads an entry attributed to Irvin Clarke 
Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
Insight into the way people once ate is provided by such statements as these: 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Dowling had a garden and the family had lots of fruits and vegetables in 
their diet. Breakfast, however, was always steak, gravy and bread or waffles or 
pancakes." -- Marquita Salveson Dowling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Living on Vegetables 
</P>
<P>
"We used to practically live on vegetables and then have meat maybe two or 
three times a week. I remember mama would send us to the store for ground steak 
for dinner. She would give us a quarter to buy it." -- Jo Sawdey Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"The only two kinds of ready-made cereal were shredded wheat and corn flakes. 
All those other things that fill the shelves down there in the store nowadays 
were never thought of, which was a darn good thing. Mostly, we cooked cereals. 
Mom would make corn meal the night before and let it solidify. The next morning 
she would slice it and fry it for breakfast." -- Claire Sharpless Marks. 
</P>
<P>
Other passages recount the roles played by family members in Orange County 
history. Photographs of early homes were also gathered for the book. 
</P>
<P>
The recipes remain in their original state, which means such essentials as pan 
sizes and baking times and temperatures are sometimes omitted. But most of the 
recipes are quite workable. And the four chosen to accompany this story not 
only worked but disappeared rapidly when they were set out for tasting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Procedure 
</P>
<P>
Grandma Ross' Lemon Cream Pie, provided by Elsa Wilson Edwards, includes an 
unusual procedure for making a meringue that, according to the recipe, "will 
not weep." 
</P>
<P>
Esther Ridgway Cramer of La Habra contributed an old family recipe for holiday 
cookies, Leutwiler Leckerlis. According to Cramer, Jacob Leutwiler was an early 
Swiss settler who came to La Habra before 1900. Cramer's mother, Ida, moved to 
La Habra in 1912 with the John Leutwiler family. "John helped found the first 
bank in La Habra and became La Habra's first photographer," Cramer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Leutwiler Leckerlis are rock hard when first baked and require a month of 
storage to mellow. The softening procedure can be hastened by adding an apple 
wedge to the airtight storage container. 
</P>
<P>
Mother's Date and Nut Cookies were contributed by Mr. and Mrs. Leonard Brewster 
Parker of San Diego. The cookies are firm when first baked but then soften and 
become chewy, revealing the rich taste of the dates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cookhouse Recipe 
</P>
<P>
Crazy Cake no doubt got its name because it includes neither eggs nor butter 
nor milk, yet is moist and full of good chocolate flavor. According to 
Charlotte Moulton Mathis of Hollister, the recipe "came from a cook in the old 
Moulton Ranch cookhouse." Mathis' father, Lewis Fenno Moulton, purchased Rancho 
Niguel, an old Spanish land grant that came to be known as the Moulton Ranch, 
in the 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
The centennial cookbook can be ordered by mail. The price is $12.50, which 
includes $2.50 to cover postage and handling. Make checks out to the Orange 
County Pioneer Council and send them to OCPC, c/o Shirley Parker, 400 Vista 
Parada, Newport Beach, Calif. 92660.

COOKBOOK CORNER: TIME-SAVING CUISINE WITH A FRENCH FLAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cuisine Rapide by Pierre Franey (Times Books: $22.50, hard cover, 372 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
No one knows better about "Cuisine Rapide" than Pierre Franey, the 60-minute 
gourmet, whose series on PBS-TV and the 60-Minute Gourmet column in the New 
York Times spanned more years than the topic probably deserved. 
</P>
<P>
Now, switching collaborators to Bryan Miller, who has replaced Franey's old 
partner, Craig Claiborne, as food writer and restaurant critic for the New York 
Times, as well as co-author of Franey's books, Franey offers more 60-minute 
gourmet recipes, this time the published version of a 52-week cooking show on 
PBS that premiered in April. 
</P>
<P>
And it does have a familiar ring. Deja vu. But what the heck, the recipes are 
basic, good and easy enough for today's no-cook cooks to perform, and if you 
are looking for something French, you can't go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Here are your French recipes with a lazy American twist that even Julia Childs 
could not provide as effectively. Franey combines classic techniques with 
contemporary tastes, emphasizing calorie-light ingredients, herb sauces, with 
little or no salt. There is fat and use of roux in the recipes, but even they 
are tempered, considering their normally heavy use in French recipes. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, instead of using all whipping cream for sauce, as many French 
chefs might do, Franey dilutes the whipping cream with milk, broth or wine for 
a less rich, but also less fatty sauce. Instead of 1/2 cup butter for sauteing 
meat and vegetables, Franey cuts the fat down to 1/3 cup. What more can today's 
health-obsessed cook ask for? 
</P>
<P>
By the way, if you have to be restrictive about cutting down on fats, sugars, 
salt and calories, French recipes are not the way to go. 
</P>
<P>
Franey's culinary past is not particularly illustrious -- really no more or 
less illustrious than that of the many fine French chefs working their heads 
off at any of the grand and not so grand French restaurants anywhere in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that Franey, who has a friendly, outgoing manner, happened to be at 
the right place at the right time when opportunity knocked. 
</P>
<P>
At 18, Franey came to the United States to operate the French Pavilion at the 
1939 New York World's Fair and remained. After a brief stint at the 
Waldorf-Astoria, he joined (as poissonier) his old Pavilion days colleague, 
Henri Soule, who had just opened a restaurant by the same name in New York. 
After a brief career as a G.I., he returned to Le Pavilion as executive chef 
and remained until 1960, during which time Howard Johnson Sr., the founder of 
the restaurant chain, hired Franey as vice president of his organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rewarded With a Job 
</P>
<P>
It was at the Pavilion where Franey and Claiborne, then food editor for the New 
York Times, met. Franey's friendship with Claiborne was rewarded with a job as 
collaborator with Claiborne at the New York Times. Together they produced the 
60-Minute Gourmet column, which Franey has since taken over and which appears 
weekly to this day, plus numerous co-authored books. 
</P>
<P>
Personable Franey works hard at what he does and the book shows it. 
</P>
<P>
The recipes have no time limit attribution this time around, but they are 
quick, relatively easy and healthful. 
</P>
<P>
Hark: Classic chicken with mustard sauce, using skinless chicken breasts and a 
sauce made with cream seasoned with balsamic vinegar and Dijon mustard takes 
but minutes to prepare, whether you plan it for company or a quick meal after a 
day's work. 
</P>
<P>
There is an a la minute cassoulet, which, explains Franey, was developed to 
satisfy a friend (my guess the friend was co-author Miller). He substituted 
canned white kidney beans for the haricot blanc beans that require prolonged 
soaking. For the garlic sausages, which also require inordinate simmering, he 
used kielbasa (Polish sausage) from a local market. For meats, he used boned 
duck cut into bite-size pieces, lean pork and lamb. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the recipes are nicely divided among appetizers, soups, seafood 
(salmon burgers sound good), poultry and game, beef, ham and pork, lamb and 
veal, pasta and rice, plus sauces, condiments and bread (quick French bread is 
the only bread). Vegetables and eggs (which include a very nice deep fried 
eggplant dish and omelette fines herbes, as only the French know how to make 
properly), and desserts are last among the chapters. 
</P>
<P>
What's for dessert? We like the sorbets -- passion fruit, melon and green apple 
are among them. There are a couple of nice souffles (hot and cold) and a few 
tarts, which are to be expected. 
</P>
<P>
A nice surprise is the inclusion of a few non-French recipes that slipped in 
between the covers, such as this one: 
</P>
<P>
CHINESE-STYLE 
</P>
<P>
BROILED CHICKEN 
</P>
<P>
BREASTS 
</P>
<P>
4 chicken breast halves (about 2 pounds) boned but unskinned and with wings 
attached 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons maple syrup 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon sesame or olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon finely minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Combine soy sauce, maple syrup, oil, 
vinegar, garlic and pepper flakes in dish large enough to hold breasts in 1 
layer. Blend well. 
</P>
<P>
Add chicken breast halves and coat with marinade. Arrange, skin side up, in 
dish and cover with plastic wrap. Let stand 15 minutes or until ready to cook. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, preheat broiler or charcoal grill. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange chicken breasts, skin side down, in 1 layer in baking dish. Place 
chicken under broiler about 6 inches from heat. Leave door partly open. Cook 
about 5 minutes and turn pieces. Cook, skin side up, about 2 minutes. Shift pan 
to lower rack so pieces are about 12 inches from heat. Continue broiling, skin 
side up, with broiler door partly open about 5 minutes longer. 
</P>
<P>
Turn pieces, skin side down, and broil 5 minutes longer on bottom rack. 
</P>
<P>
Turn pieces, skin side up and pour remaining marinade over all. Place chicken 
pieces about 6 inches from heat and broil about 2 minutes. (If you barbecue, 
cook chicken on hot grill, covered. Cooking time is same.) Makes 4 servings.

 WINE NOTES: PARTISANS OF THE GRAPE PUSH PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two new organizations set up to promote wine and combat the growing demand for 
more taxes and warning labels on their products are battling for a share of the 
public's attention. 
</P>
<P>
The latest group to enter the parade is the San Francisco-based trade 
association Wine Institute, which announced a $200,000 grant to set up the 
National Wine Coalition. Its goal is to represent the wine industry and wine 
consumers with a program promoting the joys of wine. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition set as an agenda development of programs linking wine with food; 
a campaign to educate the public about "the positive aspects of wine," and "to 
encourage responsible drinking behavior and moderate use, differentiating 
wine's role in the problem of alcohol abuse in America." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recruiting Consumers 
</P>
<P>
One goal is to recruit consumers as members and to send them a newsletter 
discussing wine. This is similar to an effort in 1981 in which Wine Institute 
hoped to sign up consumers for an organization called Americans for Wine. After 
about two years, Americans for Wine folded. 
</P>
<P>
The Coalition, which still had not yet filed incorporation papers and had no 
members as of last Monday, will not be an arm of the Wine Institute, but a 
separate entity, the announcement said. It will be based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The other group is the American Wine Alliance for Research and Education 
(AWARE). Founded last November, AWARE says it has collected more than $60,000 
in donations and another $36,000 pledged. Members include the Washington Wine 
Institute and New York Wine and Grape Foundation State, which have each 
contributed $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Shoup, president of Chateau Ste. Michelle winery in Washington, is 
chairman of AWARE. Jerome Draper, a San Francisco wine merchant, is president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approved by Board 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Vorpahl, head of public relations for Wine Institute, said the idea of 
the Coalition was formulated shortly after he joined the institute last 
September. It was approved by the institute's board of directors on March 13 
and announced April 17. 
</P>
<P>
He said a number of allied industries "have indicated their interest in 
supporting the coalition, people like WSWA, the National Restaurant Assn., the 
American Trucking Assn., the National Assn. of Broadcasters." 
</P>
<P>
Both the coalition and AWARE are seeking to hire executive directors. 
</P>
<P>
Two other groups, the Washington-based National Vintners Assn. and Assn. of 
American Vintners, have small membership lists and hope to act as lobbying 
groups to do similar work. 
</P>
<P>
AAV was formed in 1978 as a lobbying group by Tony Debevc of Chalet Debonne 
Vineyards in Madison, Ohio. It has 185 members from 32 states (all but two east 
of the Rockies) and focuses on "legislative effectiveness," said Debevc. 
</P>
<P>
The NVA, formed recently by Rick Feeney, has only 15 members, "but a lot of 
wineries -- several in California -- are actively talking with us about 
joining," said Feeney. 
</P>
<P>
He said his group was set up to represent wine interests with legislators in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Domaine Laurier, a small premium winery in Sonoma County's Russian River area, 
is being acquired by a limited partnership set up by Vintech Inc., a Sonoma 
County agricultural investment company. It is Vintech's second winery 
acquisition in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Bade, president of Vintech, said the deal, valued at $3.5 million, will 
close escrow in mid-May. He said Vintech's limited partnership will acquire 40 
acres of property in Forestville in Western Sonoma County, 18 planted to 
vineyards, a partially completed winery, and inventory. A home in the center of 
the property is not part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Narrow Escape 
</P>
<P>
Jacob Shilo, a Polish citizen who narrowly escaped Nazi internment in 1939 and 
became an Israeli citizen, and his wife, Barbara, founded the winery in 1978 
and built a home on a knoll in the middle of the vineyard. Barbara, a respected 
artist, set up an art studio there to continue her art career. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob Shilo died of a heart attack in January 1988, and Barbara continued to 
operate the winery, producing 18,000 cases of wine, notably Chardonnay, Pinot 
Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon. 
</P>
<P>
However, marketing of the wine and other elements of the business became a 
strain on her, say friends, and eventually she chose to sell the winery. She 
will continue to live on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Vintech, founded in 1971, sets up limited partnerships to invest in 
agricultural projects. It has done more than two dozen successful almond 
orchard partnerships and today manages more than $150 million in invested 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deal Valued at $4 Million 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, a Vintech partnership acquired Lyeth Winery in northern Sonoma 
County, a deal valued in excess of $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Partnership units in the Domaine Laurier winery sell for $25,000 each. 
Investors must meet strict state-mandated restrictions. Accredited investors 
must have a $1 million net worth exclusive of home and car and an annual income 
of $200,000. Such investments are structured for 15 or 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"These are sophisticated investors who know what they are doing," said Bade. 
"These investments are not liquid and they are not short." 
</P>
<P>
Bade said the winery will increase production to about 30,000 cases and will 
limit its varieties to Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 Reunion, the super-premium red wine of Inglenook, has been released 
and the wine is a superb blend of three vineyards that historically were used 
to make the Inglenook Cask Cabernets. 
</P>
<P>
The '85 Reunion, which sells for $35 a bottle, shows more finesse and fruit 
than the fairly rich 1984 Reunion. It is a more generous wine, with marvelous 
fruit and structure to age well. 
</P>
<P>
Wine maker John Richburg said he had a hard time making the final blend because 
two or three other potential blends stood out as being as impressive too. He 
finally settled on the present blend because of a more classical nature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owned by Film Director 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, this is the first Reunion to be 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. 
</P>
<P>
The three vineyards that comprise Reunion were originally blended to make 
Inglenook's top wine. One is adjacent to the winery. Another is a vineyard up 
the hill from the winery now owned by film director Francis Ford Coppola, and 
which contributes to his wine called Rubicon. The third, the Napanook vineyard, 
is owned by the daughters of the late John Daniel, former owner of Inglenook. 
</P>
<P>
The Napanook vineyard, the property that creates Dominus, gives hard, tart 
fruit and is considered by Richburg to be "the backbone of the Reunion blend." 
</P>
<P>
One of the Napa Valley's least publicity-conscious wineries, Louis Honig 
Cellars, is hoping to shed its shy image by releasing some new wines that are 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
The property, acquired by the Honig family 30 years ago, has until now made 
only Sauvignon Blanc and sold it mostly to restaurants. Now wine maker James 
Hall has been given the freedom to make classic varietal wines such as 
Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon, and the first wine will be released on June 
1. 
</P>
<P>
It is a 1987 Chardonnay ($15), a broad, toasty wine with a hint of onionskin in 
the aroma and a creamy, fleshy mouth feel and ample fruit and oak. Only 580 
cases were produced; the wine will be available in California only. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 Cabernet (which won't be released for some months; it will be $15) is a 
spicy wine with an olive and nutmeg complexity. It's balanced and attractive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Than Past Vintages 
</P>
<P>
The new 1987 Sauvignon Blanc ($8.75) is better than past vintages, and Hall 
said that is because the use of a small amount of new oak barrels and aging the 
wine in the barrel in the French sur lie method gave the wine a distinct 
complexity lacking in past vintages. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt the wine needed a little more personality," said Michael Honig, son of 
the present owner and national sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the property is Bill Honig, California's superintendent of public 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Four New Zealand wineries have begun jointly marketing wine in California in an 
effort to unveil the range of styles available from that country. 
</P>
<P>
Delegat's, Hunter's, Morton Estate, and Matua unveiled their wines at a dinner 
recently at Cafe Pierre in Manhattan Beach. The wines, selling for between $10 
and $20, are well made and represent different wine making styles. 
</P>
<P>
Ten restaurant personnel -- nine of them from the Los Angeles area -- have been 
awarded scholarships that cover the cost of a wine education course and a trip 
to the Napa Valley to see wine production techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The awards were presented by Domaine Mumm in the Napa Valley, the sparkling 
wine operation that is a subsidiary of Seagram Classics Wine Co. 
</P>
<P>
Scholarship winners will see sparkling wine being made at Domaine Mumm and 
still wine production at Sterling Vineyards, another Seagram property. 
</P>
<P>
The winners were William Baker of the Calabasas Inn; William Brandel of the 
Dynasty Room at the Westwood Marquis Hotel; F.C. Carter at Johnny Reb's in Long 
Beach; Calogero Drago at Celestino in Beverly Hills; John Evans at the Rex in 
Newport Beach; Rolando Guerrero of Marianne in Pasadena; Greg Lockwood of Les 
Joues Hioux in Torrance; Tom Miller of Caruso &amp; Me in San Pedro; Patrick 
Scott of Hy's in Los Angeles, and Kathleen Shy of Stars in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The scholarship winners were selected by the California Restaurant Writers 
Assn.

 NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: YOGURT FILLS THE BILL AS LOW-CALORIE DAIRY INGREDIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Very low-calorie diets present a bit of a logistical problem for individuals 
who are also concerned about good bone health. 
</P>
<P>
While dairy foods are viewed as the best dietary source of calcium -- a vital 
component in bone mass maintenance -- they are typically perceived by dieters 
as too high in fat to be worth their calcium merit. 
</P>
<P>
This aversion to dairy products may be responsible for the escalating rise in 
osteoporosis in this country, which is the underlying cause of the nation's 1.3 
million bone fractures each year. Of those, 250,000 are fractures of the hip, 
according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
But the results of a study, conducted at the University of San Diego and 
published last year in the British medical journal Lancet, may underscore the 
importance of dietary calcium in reducing risk for osteoporosis and influence 
calorie-counters who may be avoiding rich sources of the mineral in an attempt 
to lose fat. 
</P>
<P>
At a Dairy Council of California nutrition press conference in Costa Mesa 
recently, Dr. Troy Holbrook, assistant adjunct professor of community and 
family medicine at UCSD, described calcium as estrogen's pre-menopausal equal 
in preventing hip fractures. Her 14-year study of calcium intake by men and 
women in Rancho Bernardo was the source of this data. 
</P>
<P>
It has been known for some time that women suffer from the bone-thinning 
disease at a disproportionately higher rate than men. And the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services estimates that osteoporosis afflicts more than 24 
million Americans each year, more than half of all women in this country older 
than 45 and 90% of those older than 75. 
</P>
<P>
In its classical manifestation, osteoporosis is seen as "a gradual, but 
increasing number of vertebral fractures as the spine begins to collapse on 
itself," said Holbrook. "When the process has progressed far enough, you see a 
decrease in height and the classic spinal hump." 
</P>
<P>
But hip fractures also are common and occur at very high rates among elderly 
white women in this country. Holbrook estimated that by the age of 80, some 
white women have a 1% to 2% annual risk of fracturing their hip. The estimated 
cost of hip fracture treatment alone was $6.1 billion a year in 1984, Holbrook 
said, and as many as one third to one half of those who suffer hip fractures 
never return to a functional level of activity. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1987, however, despite all this knowledge, a low-calcium diet 
was still considered only a "proposed risk factor" for osteoporosis, said 
Holbrook, which might explain a nationwide reluctance to meet the requirement 
through dietary sources. 
</P>
<P>
Holbrook's research undertook to establish low calcium intake as a known risk 
factor. This would place it among other established hazards including being 
female, being white, being thin relative to fat, consuming alcohol and certain 
drugs and being a sufferer of rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Because calcium is withdrawn from the bones (where it is stored) when dietary 
intake is too low, decreased calcium intake was always a strong candidate for 
the risk factor list. The theory was that if during youth, calcium intake is 
increased, a heavier, more dense skeleton might develop. This could protect 
against fractures later in life, researchers surmised. 
</P>
<P>
While there is still considerable debate over the effects of increasing calcium 
in the diet of post-menopausal women -- whether or not it can prevent, or at 
best, retard bone loss without estrogen supplementation -- studies have 
indicated with some certainty that added calcium is of benefit to 
pre-menopausal women. 
</P>
<P>
The UCSD research verified this, reporting that risk could be reduced by as 
much as half. 
</P>
<P>
Based on what the participants in the Holbrook study said they ate during a 
24-hour recall period, she observed a distinct difference in the occurance of 
hip fractures between the low calcium consumers and the high. In both the men 
and the women, the chances of having a hip fracture declined as the intake of 
calcium went up. Her conclusion: Adequate dietary calcium intake is a valuable 
measurement of risk factor for osteoporosis later in life. 
</P>
<P>
"When we did this comparison, the only difference that we saw nutritionally 
between the hip fracture group and the non-hip fracture group was their intake 
of calcium," Holbrook stated. "No other dietary nutrient made any difference in 
men or women. The average level of calcium intake was much lower in those who 
got hip fractures," she explained, adding that the study was based on dietary 
intake and not supplementation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Good Place to Start 
</P>
<P>
From this, Holbook concluded that it is possible to obtain the Recommended 
Dietary Allowance of 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day from low-fat dairy 
sources as well as some others such as fish by making simple changes in eating 
habits. Adding nonfat or low-fat milk, yogurt and cheese to an otherwise 
balanced diet is a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not impossible, (to meet the RDA for calcium)," Holbrook said. "You don't 
need to supplement, unless you have some other kind of health problem." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to replacing other mealtime beverages with milk and substituting 
yogurt for ice cream or other high-fat desserts, try using nonfat yogurt in 
place of mayonnaise when making creamy salad dressings, sandwich fillings and 
main dish, fruit or vegetable salads. Plain nonfat yogurt stands in nicely for 
sour cream when topping baked potatoes or when preparing dips, sauces and 
stroganoffs. It provides more calcium, and far fewer grams of fat, cholesterol 
and calories. 
</P>
<P>
One cup of milk provides about 300 milligrams of calcium. Some comparable 
servings of other calcium-rich, but low-fat foods are: one cup fruit-flavored 
low-fat yogurt, one-half cup ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 ounces part-skim mozzarella, 
one-half cup tofu processed with calcium sulfate and three ounces sardines. 
</P>

In cooking procedures such as baking, roasting, candy making and deep-fat 
frying, accurate temperatures are critical. Using a thermometer can mean the 
difference between success and failure of a recipe. 
</P>
<P>
There are two basic types of thermometers -- bimetal and glass-tube. "Cooking A 
to Z" (Ortho Books: 1988, $32.95) explains: "Bimetal thermometers have a face, 
like a dial, and a pointer. The pointer moves by action of a spring made of two 
metals welded together, which react differently to heat. A change in 
temperature causes the spring to wind or unwind and move the pointer around the 
dial. Bimetal thermometers are less accurate than the glass-tube type, but the 
dials are easier to read and they hold a temperature reading longer." 
</P>
<P>
The book goes on to say: "Glass-tube models register temperature by the 
expansion or contraction of a fluid -- mercury or a colored liquid -- trapped 
in a thin column of glass." It notes that "Glass-tube thermometers are very 
accurate and responsive, but are fragile and more difficult to read than a dial 
type." 
</P>
<P>
Some thermometers are multipurpose and have a wide temperature range (all 
temperatures in this column are given in Fahrenheit). Others have a more narrow 
range for greater accuracy and are intended for a single purpose, such as the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
Oven Thermometers -- Although conventional ovens have internal thermostats, 
they may not always be calibrated accurately and sometimes become defective. 
Ovens also tend to have hot and cold spots. A supplemental thermometer provides 
an added check that the appliance is working properly and pinpoints problem 
areas. Oven thermometers typically register temperatures up to 600 or 700 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
In years past, oven temperatures were often expressed in words, but today the 
use of exact degrees is standard. Here's a translation of the terms: 
</P>
<P>
Very slow -- 250 to 300 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Slow -- 300 to 325 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Moderately slow -- 325 to 350 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Moderate -- 350 to 375 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Quick moderate -- 375 to 400 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Moderately hot -- 400 to 425 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Hot -- 425 to 450 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Very hot -- 450 to 500 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Extremely hot -- 500 to 525 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Refrigerator/Freezer Thermometers -- Like their oven counterparts, these 
thermometers are used to double-check the appliance's internal thermostat. The 
recommended setting for refrigerators is between 32 and 40 degrees; freezers 
should be kept at zero degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Meat Thermometers -- Internal temperature is the best indication of doneness 
for meats, poultry and game. Slow-response type thermometers register 
temperatures up to about 200 degrees and are recommended for use in 
conventional ovens. Insert the probe into the meat or poultry before cooking 
and leave it in position throughout the cooking period. 
</P>
<P>
Instant-read thermometers register internal temperatures between 60 and 220 
degrees after being inserted into food for about 10 seconds. They are 
particularly useful for taking quick readings of foods cooked by rotisserie and 
microwave. Only plastic, slow-response thermometers should be used inside 
microwave ovens. 
</P>
<P>
These are the recommended cooking temperatures for meat and poultry, in 
Fahrenheit: 
</P>
<P>
Beef -- 125 to 130 degrees for rare; 140 to 145 degrees for medium; 160 degrees 
for well-done. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb -- 130 to 140 degrees for rare; 145 degrees for medium; 160 degrees for 
well-done. 
</P>
<P>
Pork -- 145 to 150 degrees for medium; 160 degrees for well-done. 
</P>
<P>
Poultry -- 170 to 175 degrees for medium; 180 degrees for well-done. 
</P>
<P>
Veal -- 140 to 145 degrees for medium; 160 degrees for well-done. 
</P>
<P>
Candy-Making Thermometers -- An upper limit of approximately 325 degrees is 
necessary to provide a margin of safety above the high of 310 degrees required 
for some candies. Most are glass-tube types and have a clip so they may be 
attached to the side of the pan. 
</P>
<P>
Within this classification there are also thermometers designed especially for 
chocolate. They measure temperatures from about 50 to 140 degrees in wide, 
one-degree increments that are easy to read. 
</P>
<P>
As with older baking and roasting recipes, candy temperatures are sometimes 
described in terms of appearance rather than degrees. Here are the equivalents: 
</P>
<P>
Thread -- 230 to 234 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Soft ball -- 234 to 240 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Firm ball -- 244 to 248 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Hard ball -- 250 to 266 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Soft crack -- 270 to 290 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Hard crack -- 300 to 310 degrees 
</P>
<P>
Deep-Fat Frying Thermometers -- To accommodate the high temperatures used for 
frying, these thermometers typically have an upper limit of 500 degrees. Many 
can be clipped to the side of the pan so they suspend in the fat without 
touching the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
It's common to find combination candy and deep-fat frying thermometers.

Bonifacio Guenechea is a very generous man and has some very special cooking 
ware. I first met Boni only a few months back when I borrowed three of his pans 
to cook at a benefit beach party for cystic fibrosis at my brother's home in 
the Florida Keys. Boni's pans (he calls them magic pans) are giant paella pans 
that come with their own butane burner and tripod, and are perfect for cooking 
for a crowd. With three of them, I cooked beef, chicken and Florida lobster for 
250 people in just over an hour. 
</P>
<P>
My brother called again last month, "Hey how about coming down and cooking for 
the Florida Keys Fishing Guides Assn.? They do a lot of conservation work and 
they are gonna be doin' a fund-raiser and thought maybe you'd help out. Whadda 
ya say! Maybe we could use Boni's pans again." 
</P>
<P>
I called Boni. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," he replied, "you can use 'em. How many will ya be cookin' for?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure," I said, "maybe 200, maybe 400." 
</P>
<P>
"Tell ya what," he said, "I'll come down and help ya. I'll bring my big pan. We 
can do paella." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paella's Spanish History 
</P>
<P>
Boni's big pan is almost 4 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep -- big enough to 
cook paella for about 150 people at a time. Two batches was all it took. As we 
stood around his pan stirring, Boni told me a bit about the world-famous dish 
from his native Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Paella gets its name from the pan it is cooked in. The pan is the paella. The 
dish can be made from a variety of different ingredients, meat, fish, poultry 
or a combination. The only ingredients that are traditionally used are olive 
oil, rice and saffron. Boni said he sometimes uses yellow food coloring in 
place of the very expensive saffron, "but it's not nearly as good." He also 
said that you don't have to have the traditional paella, you can make it in any 
casserole dish, "but it's not quite the same." 
</P>
<P>
Paella can be simple, inexpensive family fare with chicken and pork, or elegant 
festive fare with lobster and stone crab. Either way, it's fun food. Boni sent 
me the following recipes to document paella's versatility. 
</P>

TROUBLED TEENS

Although I agree with much of Richard Polanco's (D-Los Angeles) remarks ("Bad 
Medicine for 'Troubled Teens,' " Op-Ed Page, May 7) regarding forced private 
hospitalization for "troubled teen-agers," I believe he misses the real mark. 
</P>
<P>
Troubled teen-agers come from troubled parents. Unless we "hospitalize" the 
troubled parents we will never solve the problems of the troubled teen-ager. 
But how can we ever expect such actions from the legal system when it 
represents some of the worst troubled parents?

LET'S LEAVE THE ICE AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The antiquated system will sound instantly familiar to anyone accustomed to 
county government in California: The article by John Herbers in Governing 
magazine talked about a state in which most county governments remain 
essentially what they were in the 19th Century, ruled by five members of a 
board of supervisors who wield both executive and legislative authority. The 
supervisors rule their districts like little fiefdoms, and often it is 
impossible to have a new facility or a new program without having five of each. 
There is no single elected official to speak for the county or to take overall 
responsibility for decisions. 
</P>
<P>
That is essentially the case in California, with identical forms of 
supervisorial government in the smallest rural counties as well as the largest, 
including 8.5-million-resident Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Herbers was not writing about California, however, but Mississippi, where a 
reform movement was launched following the disclosure of widespread corruption 
in county government. The plan sponsored by Democratic Gov. Ray Mabus was 
adopted in only 47 of Mississippi's 82 counties, losing in some areas where the 
wrongdoing was most prevalent. "Mississippi's resistance to change has many 
parallels in other states with mostly rural, small-population counties and is a 
major cause of keeping county government collectively with one foot in Colonial 
America," Herbers wrote in the magazine edited for officials of state and local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
If Mississippi has one foot in Colonial America, Los Angeles County has both 
planted firmly in the last Ice Age. An underfunded initiative measure to create 
an independent county executive failed narrowly back in the mid-1970s. Since 
then, the quickest way of getting booted out of the county Hall of 
Administration is to dare whisper the word reform. Today, the Board of 
Supervisors even has dug in against a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Justice 
Department seeking to force a redrawing of the five supervisorial districts to 
allow Latinos the prospect of fair representation. 
</P>
<P>
But even this minimal attempt to achieve some political equity will not correct 
the inherent defects of a system of government that might have been adequate to 
county needs nearly a century ago, but is ill-equipped to handle the modern 
problems of an area that has more residents than most states. Without even 
taking into account the clashing political philosophies and agendas of the 
current supervisors, the system lacks cohesion, direction, efficiency and 
accountability. Most grievously, the present structure lacks the most basic 
checks and balances that are the foundation of American democracy. The same 
five men who make the laws as the legislature also administer them and, to some 
degree, interpret them. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, the major argument against the reform plan was the cost of 
creating the executive's office. But that price was negligible compared with 
the waste built into the present system, as noted on these pages earlier this 
year by Jerry B. Epstein, a developer of Marina del Rey and member of two 
county commissions: "Hundreds of millions of dollars are wasted in 
inefficiencies instigated by an administrative system rife with bureaucratic 
end runs to five different supervisors divided as often by personal animosity 
as by political philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
County government today is on the front line of erupting problems like growth 
management, transportation, emergency health services and homelessness. The 
challenge demands innovation, efficiency and coherent leadership. Some dynamic 
areas of California are rising to the challenge. The city and county of 
Sacramento are considering a merger. In Los Angeles County, a governmental 
structure rooted in rural Colonial Times, or glacial ice, is not up to the 
task.

HART ON PEACE WITH THE SOVIETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many thanks to Gary Hart ("U.S. Policy Indecision Suggests Fear of Peace With 
Soviets," Op-Ed Page, May 10) for reminding us that our main archenemy and 
scapegoat is really in the midst of as major a change as any country has gone 
through in this century. It is difficult not to notice how hesitant our leaders 
are to acknowledge the Soviets' difficult struggle. Their decision to enter a 
world economy which we have considered ours and end their dependence on the 
Cold War as a national focus ought to be respected and supported. Instead, we 
seem to be pooh-poohing and negating it to death. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's not so easy to imagine Russia as a market competitor with us. Maybe 
we can't deal with the thought of competing with a socialist-capitalist 
country. Or maybe we just can't let go of our Commie-baiting history. It 
remains to be seen whether we can change along with the Soviet Union and accept 
the inevitability of its entrance into our world. 
</P>
<P>
If we don't, and if we keep putting our resources into what is fast becoming an 
imaginary Cold War, we may find ourselves, down the line, as a second-rate 
power in the world economic community.

FAIRNESS IN TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I commend Father Alfred LoPinto for his column "Tax Policies Rule Out a Kinder, 
Gentler Nation" (Op-Ed Page, April 30). He points out and gives statics showing 
how the tax policies increasingly favor the wealthy and increase the tax burden 
of the rest of the people. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of good government is to establish and promote fairness for all its 
people. If we judge our government on a basis of fairness to all people, it 
must fall far short of being classified as "good." Adam Smith, who wrote his 
"Wealth of Nations" many years ago, set the principle of fair taxation that 
"Taxes should be levied according to the ability to pay." This can only mean 
that individuals should be taxed according to their wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Wealth is the only true measure of "the ability to pay." A wealth-only tax is 
fair. It is right because people enjoy the benefit of living in our country 
according to their wealth. A tax on each person's net worth would be taking the 
place of all other taxes. There is no other tax that is even remotely fair. 
Consider these advances: 
</P>
<P>
1. People who have nothing, who are probably in debt, would pay no taxes. They 
would have a chance to get out of poverty and not be a burden on the government 
nor the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
2. People in the middle-income group would pay about the same amount of taxes 
they do now. 
</P>
<P>
3. The wealthy would pay more -- a fair share of taxes -- which they in no way 
do now. 
</P>
<P>
A net worth tax seems simplistic, and it certainly is when you think of the 
complexity and extent of the tax system, the mountain of complex laws, the 
bureaus, the offices, the agents, etc. we are subjected to now. Fairness is 
usually simple. The government spends a great deal of time and money devising 
and changing the tax system. This gives the government opportunities to extend 
favors and punishment, a power it should not have. The rules of a net worth 
tax, once fairly established, would seldom, if ever, have to be amended, 
eliminating the unfair threat. 
</P>
<P>
A 1% tax on the wealth of people would produce revenue enough for the entire 
obligations and operation of government, and in time retire the enormous, 
threatening national debt. It is unfair to future generations to have to deal 
with a huge national debt. 
</P>
<P>
Fair taxation is a step on the long road to fairness in all things from which 
our government has strayed. We must exert whatever influence we can muster to 
put it right.

FOREST LANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times offers incorrect information in its editorial on proposed federal 
listing of the northern spotted owl as threatened ("Protection -- at Last," May 
2) when it cites U.S. Forest Service estimates that only "2.7 million acres of 
old-growth forest are left in Washington and Oregon." The correct figure is 
that the agency reports more than 6 million acres in the national forests, and 
more than half of this lies in areas that will never be harvested. An estimated 
million more acres of old-growth timber are contained in national parks in the 
two states. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, with such an abundant resource already preserved, options must exist 
to accommodate both the owl and the timber-dependent communities of the region. 
The Times also errs in blaming the decline in employment in the forest industry 
on modernization. It was instead due to some mills closing down. The modernized 
mills, rather than laying off people, are producing more product from the logs 
they process. There is no prospect of running out of timber in the Pacific 
Northwest. But by Forest Service estimates, federal listing of the owl is 
expected to throw 250,000 people out of work in the small mill communities of 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
A mill shutting down in many of these little towns is utterly devastating. 
People have to move away. Home values are destroyed. The tax base for schools 
and municipal services is demolished. Surely it is time for some common sense 
on this issue.

CANADIENS TALK IT OUT, RALLY TO DEFEAT FLAMES, TIE SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
CALGARY, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The brave words in the Calgary Flames' dressing room sounded hollow, like the 
whistling in the dark of a lone youngster walking past a graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
No, the Flames said Wednesday night after the Montreal Canadiens had come back 
to beat them, 4-2, before a capacity crowd of 20,062 at the Saddledome to even 
the Stanley Cup series at one game each, they were not giving a thought to what 
had happened in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Flames want keep the two series separate in their minds. In '86, 
the only other time the Flames have been in the Stanley Cup finals, they won 
the first game at home. They lost the second game at home. And then they lost 
the next three. 
</P>
<P>
End of story. 
</P>
<P>
So the Flames aren't spooked by the same scenario? They aren't afraid the 
ghosts of games past will come back to haunt them, that this series might have 
the same, scary ending? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not even thinking about 1986," Flame wing Joey Mullen said as he fielded a 
string of questions about that year. "That's history." 
</P>
<P>
Flame Coach Terry Crisp acknowledged that the team was haunted by its 
near-misses in the second period. "When we were hitting the post and missing 
the net by inches, I was standing behind the bench saying to myself, I hope 
it's not one of those nights when these shots come back to haunt us." 
</P>
<P>
It was. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames got two goals in the second period to tie the score, but they didn't 
put the game away. Montreal's Brian Skrudland went so far as to suggest that 
the Canadiens might have actually won the game in the second period by keeping 
it close even while the Flames were dominating. 
</P>
<P>
Skrudland said: "We didn't roll over and play dead. . . . Anybody on our team 
can put the puck in the net, and that makes us a scary team." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal defenseman Chris Chelios put the game away for the Canadiens with his 
goal at 8:01 of the third period, beating goalie Mike Vernon with a shot that 
he slapped from the right circle as he carried the puck into the zone. 
</P>
<P>
"I used the defenseman as a screen and I had a lot of speed on the shot, but as 
soon as I shot it, I didn't see it. . . . In the playoffs, you see a lot of 
goals that you don't really think should go in. But you have to shoot the puck. 
I guess we caught them at the end of a shift, and the defense was backing in." 
</P>
<P>
Crisp said: "Once Chelios put that one by us, they put up their (defensive) 
blanket. They forced us to open up and, bingo, they put another one past us." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal's final goal was scored on the power play by wing Russ Courtnall. 
</P>
<P>
"After the second period, we were scared," Courtnall said. "We talked it out. 
Nothing was said about them, only about us. We thought we could play a lot 
better, and we came out in the third period and played well." 
</P>
<P>
One of the Canadiens who spoke up between periods was Chelios, a player who, by 
his own assessment, really isn't much of a talker. "I thought we needed some 
other voices in here to get our heads up," Chelios said. "I didn't want 
everybody to get frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I had taken some stupid penalties (roughing and cross-checking) and I wanted 
everyone to know that I wasn't frustrated, and that those things wouldn't 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I just said that it was like a zero-zero game going into the third period. We 
needed to play better, and we could win it." 
</P>
<P>
The Flames put on a show of strength in the second period, outshooting the 
Canadiens, 16-4, and getting consecutive goals from Joe Nieuwendyk and Joel 
Otto to make the score 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuwendyk's goal, at 5:14 of the second period, was a slap shot through the 
slot that went past goalie Patrick Roy and into the back of the net. 
</P>
<P>
Otto's power-play goal 17 seconds after an elbowing penalty on Skrudland was 
the result of a second rebound. Defenseman Al MacInnis had bounced a hard shot 
off the boards behind the Canadiens' net that went back out front to Mullen, 
whose shot went off Roy and right to Otto, who tapped it in to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal defenseman Larry Robinson had given the Canadiens the early lead, 
waiting back by the blue line for a pass out after a faceoff and slapping the 
puck through traffic and between the knees of Vernon, who had dropped to the 
ice to try to make the stop. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Smith, like Robinson a veteran of previous Montreal Stanley Cup 
championships, put the Candiens ahead, 2-0, on his power-play goal at 1:55 of 
the second period. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't like the Canadiens to let a two-goal lead slip away. No wonder they 
needed that heart-to-heart talk between periods. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a team to panic," Montreal Coach Pat Burns said. "We had a good talk 
after the second period. Chellie was one who was up and talking and showing 
some leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of those guys who works hard all of the time. He won it for the team. 
He's a team-oriented hockey player. He has taken a lot of heat in Montreal, for 
many things. But he's a professional, and his heart is in Montreal." 
</P>
<P>
The series now moves to Montreal for Game 3 Friday night and Game 4 Sunday 
before coming back to the Saddledome for Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
That was as far as it went in 1986. But, then, nobody is even thinking about 
that.

SOCKERS HAVE NO ROOM LEFT FOR OFF NIGHTS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sockers left overcast skies in Dallas and were greeted by the same in San 
Diego Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Perfect. It fit the mood, which wasn't necessarily down in the dumps or even 
solemn. Just businesslike. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there were a few smiles. While waiting to get off the plane, some players 
enjoyed looking at an incriminating newspaper picture of defender George 
Fernandez grabbing Sidekick forward Tatu during the Sockers' 4-1 loss Tuesday 
night. Front-page stuff, full color. 
</P>
<P>
But in general, this was a serious group. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Brian Quinn was asked what else can be said about this best-of-seven 
series, which the Sidekicks lead, 3-2, and could wrap up tonight at 7:35 in the 
San Diego Sports Arena. Quinn's response was concise. 
</P>
<P>
"Just do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers haven't done it the past two games. After a spirit-lifting, 
come-from-behind, 5-4 victory Friday night, the Sockers find themselves in need 
of two victories at home after losing Saturday and Tuesday. All this just for 
the opportunity to defend last season's Major Indoor Soccer League title in the 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
The big question is whether this wounded bunch can upset the odds as their 
predecessors have. Twice in club history, the Sockers have pulled themselves 
out of 3-1 deficits to win either a semifinal or a championship playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, facing elimination by Kansas City in the Western Division final, 
the Sockers won three consecutive games, advanced to the championship series 
and ripped Cleveland four in a row. The latter was without the services of 
Branko Segota. 
</P>
<P>
In this series, Segota is playing, though he doesn't have his usual zest. 
Injuries to his big toe and hamstring are still bothering him. He hit several 
scorching shots Tuesday night but was unable to beat defenders one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, bothered by a right hip strain, was limping slightly as he left the 
airport Wednesday. Usually an effective passer and even a scoring threat, 
Quinn, by his own admission, hasn't been up to snuff in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
And defender Kevin Crow might be tiring. His duties have included marking the 
ever-active Tatu and serving as the Sockers' sixth attacker. 
</P>
<P>
Tired legs prompted Socker Coach Ron Newman to dress an extra field player in 
two of the three games in Dallas in lieu of backup goalie Otto Orf II. Newman 
was caught in a bind doing this once earlier this season and had to use a 
defender, Ralf Wilhelms, in goal when starter Zoltan Toth was forced to leave a 
game with a head injury. 
</P>
<P>
History favors the Sockers to come back. The immediate past -- Saturday and 
Tuesday -- might not. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers have been one game from elimination in a playoff series in each of 
their four MISL championship seasons. But in the past two games, the Sidekicks 
have tied down the Sockers' offense with superior defense, specifically shot 
blocking. Of 150 shots the Sockers have taken, Dallas has blocked 77. Joe 
Papaleo, one of two Sidekick starting goalies, is 3-0 against the Sockers in 
this series and likely will start tonight. 
</P>
<P>
In scoring one goal Tuesday, the Sockers tied the club record for lowest score 
in a playoff game. Tuesday also was the first time the Sockers have lost the 
fifth game of a playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, statistics and records mean little. The Sockers accomplished a 
mission of sorts in forcing the series to return to San Diego. But after 
winning the first game in Dallas, the end result was somewhat of a moral 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really disappointed that we didn't steal another one here," Newman said 
after Tuesday night's loss. "I haven't really felt good all through the 
playoffs. Maybe we're not as good as we think we are." 
</P>
<P>
Or it could be this team is just like all the others, saving the best for the 
final act. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," Crow said, "this team is very similar to the last couple of years, 
when we don't react until our backs are against the wall."

NELSON FINDS HIS RANGE, HELPS PADRES FINISH SWEEP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rob Nelson knew he was supposed to be patient and all that. It was the sixth 
inning of a tie game between the Padres and the Montreal Expos and there were 
runners on first and second and none out. This was not the time to swing 
himself into a new dance step. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson came to the plate Wednesday night and told himself to wait, battle, find 
the right pitch. 
</P>
<P>
But here it came, on Pascual Perez's first pitch. A fastball about thigh high. 
And Nelson, who has been waiting for more than two lousy seasons, could wait no 
more. 
</P>
<P>
He swung, the Expos in the field froze and the ball didn't stop until it had 
cleared the Petro-Canada sign. 
</P>
<P>
It was a three-run homer that eventually gave the Padres a 6-5 victory in front 
of 10,485 paying customers at Olympic Stadium and completed a three-game sweep 
against the team that began this week with the best home record in the National 
League. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos, who already had won home series this year against such teams as New 
York and San Francisco, are now a mere 14-8 at home. The Padres are now back to 
even at 21-21. 
</P>
<P>
And Nelson, who celebrated his 25th birthday with his season's first homer, 
feels as if he could blow out a church full of candles. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson has been the Padre regular first baseman since being recalled from 
triple-A May 7, after John Kruk was disabled with a hip injury. He hasn't 
committed an error, he hasn't done anything really stupid. And Perez gave him 
the fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I had to swing," Nelson said. "Ball was right in my wheelhouse. Ball was 
a fastball. Sometimes, you just have to swing." 
</P>
<P>
And then sometimes you have to hold your breath. That was Nelson's plight three 
innings later, when it looked as if the Expos were going to ruin his fun before 
rookie reliever Greg Harris fooled Mike Fitzgerald into a game-ending grounder 
with two outs and the bases loaded in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' slide was quick and unexpected. After Mark Grant showed his bosses 
all they wanted to see with four innings of one-hit relief after replacing 
struggling starter Bruce Hurst, Mark Davis was brought into the ninth with the 
Padres still leading, 6-3. For all the times Davis has been asked to save 
one-run games, this supposedly easy appearance was meant as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured, other guys get saves with three-run leads, why can't we give one 
to Mark?" pitching coach Pat Dobson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis not only looked the gift horse in the mouth, he allowed it onto the 
bases. He was, in his word, "terrible." 
</P>
<P>
He allowed a walk, a single, another walk and then an RBI grounder by Andres 
Galarraga and an RBI single by Hubie Brooks to put the game in jeopardy. After 
he walked Tim Wallach to reload the bases, Davis was gone, having blown his 
first save opportunity this year after succeeding in each of his first 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't just bad," Davis said. "I wasn't even close." 
</P>
<P>
And was Harris ever surprised -- "When Mark Davis is in there, you never expect 
to follow him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But there he was, against Fitzgerald. And with the crowd standing and rattling 
their chairs and whistling, Harris threw one fastball and the game was over. 
Fitzgerald grounded it to third baseman Randy Ready, who threw to Roberto 
Alomar at second to give Harris his second save. On just one pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"Now wait a minute, it wasn't like it was easy . . . " complained Harris, who 
has had quite a trip with two saves and two losses in the Padres' nine games 
thus far. "Anytime you have the bases loaded, it ain't easy." 
</P>
<P>
Sure. Let's let Rob Nelson tell you about easy. Nelson has had it so easy, he 
was afraid to even think about celebrating his homer. Even though he has only 
had two of these things in his big league career, about as close as he came to 
showing excitement was nearly running up the back of Jack Clark, who was on 
base with Tony Gwynn when Nelson hit it out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't show up the pitcher because next time, he could be striking me out 
four times," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
In his 96 career at-bats, he has had 42 strikeouts, including two in two 
at-bats against Perez Wednesday. He doesn't know how many people notice this, 
but he knows one who does -- buddy and former rival Mark McGwire. Thursday 
morning's box score is for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he and those guys (Oakland teammates) will be reading the paper and 
seeing it, I know the way they are," Nelson said. "I've been following them . . 
. it's good that they will be following me." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, you may remember, lost the Oakland first base competition to Nelson in 
the spring of 1987 when both were rookies. But after Nelson hit .167 with no 
homers in seven games, McGwire took over. 
</P>
<P>
The past couple of years, while McGwire was spending most of his time in the 
headlines, Nelson was spending most of his in triple-A Tacoma and Las Vegas. 
But Nelson hasn't looked away. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday night Nelson correctly guessed how many homers McGwire has hit 
this season -- eight. Nelson, of course, has one. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson even came within a couple of homers of guessing McGwire's career total 
of 92. Nelson has two. 
</P>
<P>
But Nelson said that he can handle the discrepancy. One homer Wednesday. Now, 
maybe one homer Friday and one homer . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I have learned, whatever happens happens," said Nelson, hitting .226 with four 
RBIs in eight games. "I don't expect anything, I don't think about what might 
come along, I just go out every day and think about that day." 
</P>
<P>
It appears that day is finally all his. Even though Kruk is eligible to come 
off the disabled list this weekend, and will probably return sometime during 
the nine-game Padre home stand that begins next week, it appears Nelson will 
stick around. 
</P>
<P>
This is because at the same time left-handed hitting Nelson was recalled, 
right-handed hitting Jerald Clark was recalled for backup shortstop Gary Green, 
who was simply demoted. Clark has done nothing to impress the bosses, going 
zero for 11, including a flyout on the first pitch from reliever Mark Gardner 
in a pinch-hit appearance in the ninth inning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
So Clark is the leading candidate for demotion. But when right fielder Kruk 
returns, will Jack Clark go back to first and Nelson hit the bench? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel now I'm going to play, but ever since spring training, I've said, I'll 
accept what Jack gives me," Nelson said. "If he decides a bench role is best, 
that's fine with me. I'll accept anything." 
</P>
<P>
"He's done what we've asked," McKeon said. "He does have that kind of power 
that can get us the three-run homer, which would be the difference in a lot of 
our games lately." 
</P>
<P>
"For now," Nelson said quickly, "I just want to get out there Friday (in 
Philadelphia) and go at it again."

Shortstop Garry Templeton's left knee had returned to near normal size 
Wednesday. Barring further complications, he could be back in the lineup by 
Friday. "It's fine, I knew it would be fine," said Templeton of the one-day 
scare Tuesday in which he needed the knee drained of fluid and shot with 
cortisone. He was even out hitting grounders to the infielders before the game 
. . . Reliever Dave Leiper is still experiencing stiffness in his left shoulder 
and did not throw hard Wednesday. His condition is still the ambiguous "day to 
day." . . . Mark Grant was Wednesday's winning pitcher by allowing just one hit 
and no runs from the fifth through the eighth innings. And it wasn't just any 
victory. It was his first since last July 2 in Houston. "I'm glad of the way I 
pitched, but I want to forget about the results and just remember the feeling," 
said Grant, whose shutout work marked only the sixth time in 12 appearances 
this year when he did not allow a run . . . In case you're wondering why Bruce 
Hurst was lifted for pinch-hitter Carmelo Martinez so early, even though he 
allowed just three runs in four innings, well, he had walked five batters and 
allowed a two-run double to pitcher Pascual Perez. "Hey, we won, I'm glad, 
that's all that matters," said Hurst, still 4-2, who has put together 
back-to-back quality starts just twice this year.

PINCAY WILL SKIP THE PREAKNESS TO RIDE IN HAWTHORNE HANDICAP 
</P>

<P>
While Laffit Pincay was debating whether to ride Houston or Bayakoa Saturday, 
Ron McAnally was trying to help. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked around for another race, something that wouldn't conflict with the 
Preakness, but I couldn't find anything," said McAnally, who trains Bayakoa. 
</P>
<P>
So Bayakoa will run Saturday in the Hawthorne Handicap at Hollywood Park with 
Pincay aboard. Houston will undergo a switch in jockeys, from Pincay to Angel 
Cordero, for the 114th Preakness at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
That is not exactly a vote a confidence for Houston, Pincay opting for a minor 
stake in California when he has the chance to ride a speed horse -- the kind 
that occasionally steals off and wins the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Bayakoa is no ordinary mare. She might not be nationally known yet, 
but the 5-year-old has beaten Goodbye Halo twice recently, by two lengths in 
the Santa Margarita Handicap at Santa Anita and by four lengths in the Apple 
Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, on the other hand, has beaten mediocre opponents in two races this 
year, but in the stakes that really counted -- the Santa Anita Derby and the 
Kentucky Derby -- he finished fifth and eighth, respectively, with Pincay 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Well after the fact, trainer Wayne Lukas blamed the heat at Santa Anita for 
that loss. However, there was no such excuse in the Kentucky Derby, which was 
run on a sub-50-degree day that was the coolest in the history of the race. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay told Lukas after the Kentucky Derby that he thought Houston was a race 
short of being able to run 1 1/4 miles. Since then, Houston, the Seattle 
Slew-Smart Angle colt that cost Lukas $2.9 million as a yearling, has been 
worked slowly at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas has won the Preakness before without working his horse at Pimlico, first 
with Codex in 1980 and then with Tank's Prospect in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980 Preakness, Cordero rode his typical race aboard Codex. His colt 
forced Genuine Risk, the filly who had won the Kentucky Derby, into the middle 
of the track in the stretch before she lost by almost five lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Cordero won his second Preakness aboard Gate Dancer in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally, like Pincay, can't be in two places at the same time Saturday and 
will be at Pimlico to saddle Hawkster in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster hasn't won a race since he took the Norfolk as a 2-year-old last 
October at Santa Anita, but he seems to have survived the hoof problem that 
bothered him when he loosened a shoe in the Kentucky Derby. McAnally said that 
Hawkster deserves a chance in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
In the Derby, Hawkster trailed by 15 lengths early, was closer to the 
grandstand than the inner rail through the stretch and finished fifth, 3 1/4 
lengths behind the victorious Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a lot of ground," McAnally said. "I think we lost enough to cost us 
second place." 
</P>
<P>
There's a $5-million bonus for the horse that sweeps the Triple Crown, and if 
there's no Triple Crown champion, there's a $1-million bonus for the horse that 
has the most points for first-, second- and third-place finishes in the Derby, 
Preakness and Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
A horse has to run in all three races to be eligible for the $1-million bonus. 
With the chance for the extra money comes the danger that horses will be run in 
the three races although they are not ready for the grind. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Charlie Whittingham, who owns 25% of Sunday Silence, is not the kind 
who would fall into that trap. Whittingham needed to know from his private 
veterinarian, Alex Harthill, whether Sunday Silence had recovered from his hoof 
problem before he considered entering him today for the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence apparently gave Harthill and Whittingham the assurance they 
needed with strong gallops at Pimlico on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled workouts for both Sunday Silence and Hawkster were postponed 
Wednesday until today because of a sloppy track. After 13 straight days of 
rain, the sun came out and temperatures rose to the high 70s late Wednesday 
afternoon. That weather is supposed to last through Saturday, meaning there 
should be a fast track for the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
When Sunday Silence's status was doubtful earlier this week, Whittingham was 
asked about the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"What if he pulls the (starting) gate Saturday?" Whittingham said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
I visited Howard (Buddy) Jacobson in prison in Attica, N.Y., in January of 
1988. Earlier this week, Jacobson, who was the country's leading trainer for 
several years in the 1960s, died of cancer of the spine at the prison. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson, 58, was serving a sentence of 25 years to life for the 1978 murder of 
a man in a notorious love-triangle case in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson insisted that he was innocent. His lawyers were busy recently 
preparing an appeal that was keyed to testimony from a witness who said she had 
been afraid to appear at the first trial. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson appeared to be dying 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't move my head right or left much," he said then. "I'd like to look you 
in the eye when we talk, and if you sit directly in front of me, I'll be able 
to do that." 
</P>
<P>
I tended to believe Jacobson. It was a complicated case and I had the feeling 
that Jacobson, considering his poor health, wouldn't subject his family to a 
costly appeal if he weren't innocent. Many of Jacobson's friends said that they 
didn't know whether he had committed the murder or not. 
</P>
<P>
Although owner Allen Paulson has won the Arlington Million with Estrapade and 
the $2-million Breeders' Cup Turf with Theatrical, he considers last Saturday's 
victory in the $700,000 Pimlico Special with Blushing John his biggest. 
</P>
<P>
Paulson bought Estrapade from Nelson Bunker Hunt after her career had already 
begun and he owned Theatrical in a stormy partnership with Bert Firestone. 
Blushing John has raced only for Paulson, since he bought the horse for 
$850,000 as a yearling. 
</P>
<P>
Blushing John needs Lasix -- the anti-bleeder diuretic -- to run effectively. 
This will preclude his running in New York, where horses aren't allowed to run 
on medication. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious, who is undefeated in six starts, runs in the 1 1/16-mile Gold 
Rush Handicap on Saturday at Golden Gate Fields. Kept out of the Triple Crown 
races because of a knee injury, the Hollywood Futurity winner made his 
3-year-old debut at Golden Gate last month and won by 21 lengths against only 
two opponents. . . . Sam Rubin, the New Yorker who raced John Henry, is looking 
for a home someplace between Santa Anita and Del Mar. Rubin still has a few 
horses with trainer Ron McAnally, who managed most of John Henry's career. 
</P>
<P>
Winning Colors, winless since her victory in the Kentucky Derby last year, has 
been unimpressive in two starts this year and her career is in jeopardy because 
of respiratory problems. . . . Hal Ramser, vice president of the Oak Tree 
Racing Assn. at Santa Anita and a horse owner and breeder, died at 81 on Monday 
night at his Bel Air home. . . . Bill Shoemaker is riding at Pimlico today as 
part of his farewell tour of American tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Wayne Lukas will start two horses each in the $250,000 Black-Eyed Susan 
for 3-year-old fillies and the $150,000 Dixie Handicap for grass runners at 
Pimlico on Friday. Imaginary Lady and Some Romance will run in the Black-Eyed 
Susan at 1 1/8 miles, and Waki River and Dynaformer are entered in the Dixie at 
1 1/2 miles. The Black-Eyed Susan has a field of nine and also drew Dreamy 
Mimi, Seraglio, Tactile, Misty Ivor, Proper Miss, Noblest Heart and Moonlight 
Martini. . . . Sixteen are entered in the Dixie, including Top Guest, Salem 
Drive, Ten Keys, Dance Card Filled, Intensive Command, Master Speaker, 
Castelets, Morewoods, Kadial, Couer De Lion, Free Colony, Ask Not, Jim Bowie 
and Blue Nug. The last four horses listed are on the also-eligible list.

PARAMOUNT JET WINS FEATURE AT HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paramount Jet, under Alex Solis, caught the leader with less than a furlong to 
go and went on to win the $32,000 feature by three-quarters of a length 
Wednesday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Even-money favorite Sabulose, with Corey Nakatani aboard, finished second, nine 
lengths in front of Sure Swift, ridden by Gary Stevens, in a field of seven. 
</P>
<P>
The winner covered one mile over a fast track in 1:34 1/5 and earned $17,600. 
It was the colt's second victory in six starts this year and boosted his career 
earnings to $102,450. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Jet paid $25.60, $7.40 and $3.80. Sabulose, who won the Debonair 
Stakes on Hollywood Park's opening day, returned $3 and $2.40. Sure Swift paid 
$2.80.

CLU'S FIRST LADY SEEKS REDEMPTION; 
</P>
<P>
PILKINGTON WELCOMES CHANCE TO HELP MAKE AMENDS IN NAIA SOFTBALL FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics have a way of distorting things, so for the time being let's skip 
the fact that DeeAndra Pilkington's earned-run average is best seen under a wet 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
And let's also forget that, as a hitter, the Cal Lutheran junior has accounted 
for more singles than the Beach Boys and a slugging percentage that would make 
Mike Tyson proud. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers, while impressive, are not nearly as captivating as her face. It 
is a tanned face. A face that is quick to smile. The face of the captain of the 
CLU cheerleading squad. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a face that can look as if it belongs to a person who has just had a 
three-quarter-ton pickup truck dropped on their big toe. This is the face 
Pilkington makes just as she releases a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
You think going 18-4 and batting .413 was easy? Look again. 
</P>
<P>
See DeeAndra play. Count the veins bulging in her neck. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all right there in living color," said Wendy Beckemeyer, Cal Lutheran's 
coach. "With Dee, what you see is what you get." 
</P>
<P>
And what you get most is effort. 
</P>
<P>
Pilkington will take center stage today when she leads Cal Lutheran (35-16) 
against Kearney (Neb.) State (28-14) in the first round of the National Assn. 
of Intercollegiate Athletics softball championships in Midland, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second consecutive appearance in the national tournament for Cal 
Lutheran, which was eliminated in two games last season. The Regals dropped 
their first game, 6-2, to Minnesota-Duluth, and then were eliminated by West 
Florida, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
The early exit did not sit well with Pilkington, a 5-foot-4 All-American whose 
performance in the finals last season was subpar. Pitching in relief, she hit 
the first two batters she faced. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for her to wait the whole off-season for a chance to redeem 
herself," Beckemeyer said. "She's really hungry this time because she wants to 
do so much better." 
</P>
<P>
Pilkington's improvement has been evident all season. She compiled a pitching 
record of 14-7 with a 1.61 earned-run average as a sophomore. This season, the 
numbers were 18-4 and 0.99. 
</P>
<P>
On offense, Pilkington, who plays center field when she isn't pitching, 
bettered her .273 career average by 140 points this season batting in the 
leadoff position. She also stole 14 bases in 15 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"She's our little spark plug out there -- so intense," Beckemeyer said. "Dee 
gets the whole team going." 
</P>
<P>
Pilkington also has a habit of getting the whole team laughing, even in some 
rather bleak situations. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Teri Rupe, the team's senior captain, recalled such an instance two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Pilkington, then a freshman, was struggling with her pitching and a timeout was 
called. Rupe approached the pitching area and was joined by several Cal 
Lutheran infielders. 
</P>
<P>
But before anything constructive could be said, Pilkington blurted out, 
"Everyone look toward the sun. I get my energy from the sun." 
</P>
<P>
Pilkington, who grew up near the beach in Carpinteria, says now, "I was kidding 
. . . I think." Rupe is convinced that she was perfectly serious. End of chat. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone just laughed, turned around and went back to their positions," Rupe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pilkington, by all accounts, has matured significantly. Still, occasionally, 
even Yogi Berra would be hard pressed to match Pilkington's, er, perspective. 
</P>
<P>
At the national tournament last season, Pilkington offered this profound 
prediction: "The team that scores the most runs will win." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Beckemeyer says, Pilkington was wondering aloud which state the 
team from West Florida was from. Again, she was serious. 
</P>
<P>
"She keeps us all laughing," Rupe said. "But she doesn't really mean to. That's 
the best part." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Cal Lutheran, Pilkington's spontaneity usually ends when she 
plays softball. In fact, as a pitcher, she is known for being somewhat 
deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
"She takes her time out there. She walks around, kicks the dirt, licks her 
hand, wipes it off, grabs some dirt, rubs the ball . . . it can drive a batter 
crazy," Beckemeyer said. "But it makes them anxious, kind of prolongs their 
agony. It's like the only thing that's important to her is that next pitch." 
</P>
<P>
The pitch usually is a curve or a rise. Pilkington lacks the size needed to 
generate an overpowering fastball -- so she rarely throws one. 
</P>
<P>
"At the top of the order you have girls who, if you throw a fastball down the 
middle, they're going to kill it," Pilkington said. "Then, if you throw one to 
someone at the end of the order they're probably just going to stick their bat 
out and bloop it in. I figure if I throw one down the middle I'm giving up a 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
Pilkington has only 61 strikeouts in 148 2/3 innings, but while opponents hit 
her, they usually don't hurt her. Of the 115 hits she has allowed, all but 12 
were singles. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing with Dee is she hates to lose," Rupe said. "When someone gets on 
base she just gets that much tougher. She'll do whatever it takes to beat you, 
and the better you are, the better she gets." 
</P>
<P>
All of which should come in handy against Kearney State, a team that has made 
the national tournament an annual destination. 
</P>
<P>
Kearney, which won the NAIA title in 1987, is making its eighth appearance in 
the nationals, more than any other NAIA school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they're a good team, but we're good, too," Pilkington said. "We think 
we can win it this time. Last year, I was really disappointed. It was 
depressing. I don't want to have to feel like that again."

PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: HAS THE STRIKE STRUCK OUT BASEBALL? COACHES HOPE NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Several L.A. City 4-A baseball coaches remain optimistic that their season will 
be extended even if the teachers strike is not settled until after the start of 
playoffs Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness has not wavered from his 
statement that the season will be canceled if boycotting 4-A coaches do not 
field teams by the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't play Wednesday, there won't be any playoffs," Harkness said 
Tuesday. "If the coaches think otherwise, that's their prerogative. It doesn't 
matter what they think." 
</P>
<P>
South Bay coaches seemed surprised by the deadline, considering the school year 
doesn't end until June 23 and there would be sufficient time to make up games 
if the strike was settled within two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that something?" said San Pedro Coach Jerry Lovarov when informed of 
Harkness' ultimatum. "I guess the only thing we can hope for is that they can 
settle the strike by Friday or early next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we never get to the point where we have to cancel the season. I could 
roll with it, but I'd feel sorry for the kids, especially the seniors. I could 
come back and coach next year, but they couldn't come back and play." 
</P>
<P>
Banning Coach Syl Saavedra believes Harkness is bluffing in an effort to 
pressure 4-A coaches into abandoning the boycott. All 12 of Tuesday's 4-A 
regular-season finales were canceled, including the showdown between Banning 
and San Pedro for the Southern-Pacific Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think everything is negotiable," Saavedra said, adding that the season 
could be extended. "If we don't play at Dodger Stadium, who cares?" 
</P>
<P>
The city finals are scheduled June 1 at Dodger Stadium. If the season was 
extended, the finals might have to be held at another ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Harkness) is trying to tell us something," Saavedra said. "But don't 
tell the kids they can't play. If they're going to punish me, fine." 
</P>
<P>
Saavedra believes the 4-A baseball coaches might meet for a second time to 
decide whether or not to boycott the playoffs. The 4-A coaches voted Monday to 
suspend the season despite a recommendation last week by the L.A. City Coaches 
Assn. that allowed coaches to honor picket lines and direct their teams after 
school. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the 24 City 4-A baseball coaches honored the boycott Tuesday. 
The lone holdout, Westchester Coach Ron Kasparian, was awarded a forfeit over 
Palisades but failed to qualify for the playoffs because the Venice-University 
game was ruled a "no contest" by Harkness. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester needed a victory and a Venice loss to tie Venice for third place in 
the Western League and force a playoff for the league's final 4-A playoff 
berth. Kasparian had hoped the Venice-University cancellation would result in a 
double forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran coach was upset when informed otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we're done," he said Tuesday night. "That's ridiculous. I can't believe 
that. It just eliminates us." 
</P>
<P>
However, don't expect Kasparian to receive sympathy from coaching colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Said Banning's Saavedra: "If I had his team on my schedule, I would say: 'Hey 
buddy, I'm not going to play you.' I couldn't bring myself to play a guy who 
wants to win at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
The next round of the L.A. City 4-A baseball season is Friday when four 
third-place teams are scheduled in two wild-card games to determine the final 
two berths in the 16-team bracket. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena is supposed to play Birmingham of Van Nuys and El Camino Real of 
Woodland Hills is scheduled to play Cleveland of Reseda, although nobody is 
quite sure where those games are to be played. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has said anything to me about it," said Gardena Coach Mike Sakurai, 
whose team finished behind San Pedro and Banning in the Pacific League. "I 
don't know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Gardena-Birmingham game will meet top-seeded Chatsworth in 
the first round of the playoffs. Chatsworth routed Gardena, 29-4, in the 
opening round last season. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was looking forward to a possible rematch, Sakurai said: "No, no, 
no. I've been through enough punishment already." 
</P>
<P>
How high are emotions running in the teachers strike? 
</P>
<P>
Banning teacher and assistant football coach Rocky Garibay was charged with 
assault on a school employee Wednesday morning after he allegedly struck and 
spit at a substitute teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Two swimmers and one diver from peninsula high schools captured individual 
titles at the CIF-Southern Section divisional finals Saturday at Belmont Plaza 
Pool in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Kory of Rolling Hills won two swimming events in the 3-A finals, Sara 
Marsh of Palos Verdes set a 3-A record in springboard diving and Jessica Tong 
of Chadwick turned in one of the most impressive performances by a freshman at 
the 2-A finals.

CSUN'S FIRST STEPS STEADY, IF UNSPECTACULAR; 
</P>
<P>
YOUNG TEAM SHOWED PROMISE ALONG PATH TO DIVISION I IN BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing on a deserted diamond at Cal State Dominguez Hills last Saturday, Bill 
Kernen was aware that he might have witnessed the Cal State Northridge baseball 
team's final game of his inaugural season as coach of the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge had just dropped a 9-6 decision to Dominguez Hills that eliminated 
the need for a makeup game with California Collegiate Athletic Assn. champion 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and put second-place Northridge's playoff hopes in the 
hands of a committee. 
</P>
<P>
Kernen sounded confident that his young team would gain an at-large berth in 
the Western regional. However, he also was realistic. And, unfortunately for 
the Matadors, prophetic. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't win your league then you do leave yourself open for opinion to 
make the choice," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
The selection committee chose San Francisco State, the champion of the weaker 
Northern California Athletic Assn., as the third entry in a three-team Western 
regional field that also will include San Luis Obispo and Cal State Sacramento, 
an independent that was ranked among the Top 10 all season. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the playoff snub, the opinion of those who watched Kernen turn a 
team that was 22-33 in 1988 into the club that finished 30-19-1 this season, is 
that the once-proud Northridge program is back and headed toward a successful 
transition to Division I in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"My main objective is what's going to be successful two years from now," Kernen 
said Tuesday. "That's what I was working on this season and that's what I'm 
working on now. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things I could have done better or differently this season, but if 
you look at the results, I'm satisfied that I gave these guys a chance to be 
successful and win 30 games." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors' success this season was the result of excellent pitching and 
usually reliable defensive play that compensated for a lack of offense and 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Senior catcher Rusty McLain handled a staff led by senior pitchers Robert 
Wheatcroft and Fili Martinez that compiled a 4.13 earned-run average -- cutting 
more than two runs off last season's 6.41 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Wheatcroft, a right-hander who was 3-7 with a 6.85 ERA in 1988, improved to 
11-3 with a 4.11 ERA this season. Martinez, who was 5-3 with a 5.40 ERA in 
1988, improved to 8-4 with a 2.45 ERA and established himself as one of the top 
left-handers in Southern California with impressive wins over USC and Fresno 
State. 
</P>
<P>
However, only two players, freshman Craig Clayton and senior Chae-Ho Chong 
batted better than .300 for the Matadors, who hit .270 as a team. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have power, we didn't have speed and our bat-control skills are 
still developing," Kernen said. "But you can take this to Vegas: There will 
never be another year when Northridge has only two guys hit over .300 and there 
will never be another year when we have a team batting average below .300." 
</P>
<P>
There also will probably never be a year in which the Matadors feature as much 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
From the day he was named to replace Terry Craven last June, Kernen emphasized 
his intention to live and die with a lineup that, at times, featured as many as 
six freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
And after winning 10 of their first 11 games, including their first three in 
conference, the Matadors were living the high life. 
</P>
<P>
"That start was the result of outstanding pitching," Kernen said, "and clutch 
performances." 
</P>
<P>
Both of those traits were missing during a pivotal two-week period at the 
beginning of March, during which Northridge lost five consecutive conference 
games and tied another. 
</P>
<P>
"That week obviously took us out of the league race," Kernen said. "One of the 
things I stressed all year was that you never know when your most important 
at-bat or game is going to be. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look back, it wasn't the Dominguez loss on the last day that beat us. 
It was 12 of them that kept us out." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors won seven of their last 10 games in their drive for a share of the 
conference title but spotted Dominguez Hills what proved to be an 
insurmountable nine-run lead after two innings of a season finale they needed 
to win to stay in the race. 
</P>
<P>
From a team standpoint, Northridge's season was highlighted by its contention 
for the conference title and by wins over USC, Fresno State and Pepperdine, all 
of which will participate in the Division I playoffs that begin next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Individually, Chong batted .308 with 10 home runs and 36 runs batted in and was 
the only CSUN player selected first-team all conference. 
</P>
<P>
However, Clayton and fellow freshmen Greg Shockey, Mike Solar and Denny Vigo 
all had memorable seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, who batted a team-high .314 with six home runs and 32 RBIs, played 
left field, right field, shortstop, second base and also was used as a relief 
pitcher. His consistent play helped him earn second-team, all-conference 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
Shockey did not commit an error in 48 games as the team's center fielder and 
batted .292 in conference (.271 overall) after missing the entire fall because 
of a transcript delay. 
</P>
<P>
Solar batted .289 and hit all three of his home runs during the final week of 
the season. He committed 17 errors at shortstop but improved after recovering 
from an early season finger injury. 
</P>
<P>
Vigo committed a team-high 26 errors at third base and batted just .241, but he 
also had game-winning home runs in the ninth inning against Fresno State and UC 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"The freshmen performed beyond my expectations," Kernen said. "By the time they 
play summer ball and another fall, you're looking at veteran players. I expect 
them to compete with anybody next year." 
</P>
<P>
Kernen also expects the Northridge program to compete with the other top 
programs in the country. Now that his first season is complete, so is the first 
step. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our objectives was to bring the program to a position of leadership in 
the Valley," Kernen said. "We want our facility, program and players to be the 
center of attention. I think we've gone quite a ways toward that."

WONG, TAFT WALTZ TO CITY SECTION GOLF TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Take it from the guy who won the City Section individual golf title Wednesday, 
it didn't take his best effort to walk away with the first-place trophy. In 
fact, it took very little effort at all. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock High's Gerald Wong shredded the field at Griffith Park's Wilson 
Course with a round of 75, then shredded the field in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I played decent, about average," said Wong, whose two-round total of 145 was 
11 shots better than his nearest competitor. "The L. A. City Section is totally 
weak." 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Taft's victory in the team competition was less than 
overpowering but it produced the school's eighth title and second in three 
years. Taft finished at 835 after limping in with a second-round 427, 
outlasting Eagle Rock (408-439 -- 847). 
</P>
<P>
No Taft player broke 84 Wednesday and the 5-A League champions barely held off 
Eagle Rock, an entry from the 3-A League. It was nearly an upset of major 
proportions -- last season, El Camino Real of the 4-A League was the first team 
below the 5-A level to win the team title. 
</P>
<P>
"If Eagle Rock could have dug one more kid out of the woodwork, we'd have been 
in real trouble," Taft Coach Ray O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Taft was in trouble, nonetheless, until Eagle Rock's No. 5 man, Mike Messner, 
finished with a 99 after hitting two balls out of bounds on the 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
With four players from each team in the clubhouse, Taft trailed Eagle Rock by 
13 shots. The Toreadors were bailed out, however, by junior Chad Persons (84) 
and freshman Sheldon Mink (89), and were able to throw out the score of No. 1 
man Jim Venetos, who shot 91. 
</P>
<P>
Wong, one of only three players to break 80 in the second round, had the title 
all but wrapped up after the front nine. After bogeying two of the first three 
holes, Wong pulled away from Cameron Broumand of Palisades and Tony Bordwell of 
El Camino Real with pars on the seventh and eighth holes. 
</P>
<P>
Broumand, who had cut Wong's lead to two shots after six holes, bogeyed seven 
and eight and eventually finished second overall at 73-83 -- 156. Bordwell, a 
junior, bogeyed seven, double-bogeyed eight and finished fourth at 77-83 -- 
160. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically knew it was over after nine holes today," said Wong, who completed 
a City sweep of sorts. Last month, Wong won the L. A. City Junior title with 
rounds of 68 and 71 over the same courses. "I was just trying to play well for 
the team, because it was about all the incentive I had." 
</P>
<P>
Bordwell made a late run at Broumand for second, but triple-bogeyed the 
par-four 17th and shot 43 on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a battle with the flu, freshman Ryan White had the most consistent 
performance for Taft, shooting 77-85 -- 162 to finish fifth. White is one of 
six underclassmen for Taft, which bodes well for the future, if not necessarily 
the present, O'Connor acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"It was gratifying that we could win it with guys this young," O'Connor said. 
"It looks like there's a very good future for Taft golf." 
</P>
<P>
Taft and Eagle Rock advance to the Southern California regionals on June 12 at 
Bakersfield Country Club. Granada Hills finished third (427-438 -- 865), 
followed by University (438-437 -- 875) and defending champion El Camino Real 
(442-472 -- 914). 
</P>
<P>
Darrin Evans of Kennedy had the third-best round of the day at 79 and finished 
in a tie for 11th individually with teammate Mark Ridel at 169. Evans and Ridel 
are among a group of 16 golfers who will battle Monday at Bel Air Country Club 
for one of 10 berths in the Southern California regional.

BONITA VISTA'S THORNTON COMPLETES CONVALESCENCE WITH VICTORY

A stomach virus forced David Thornton to withdraw from a junior golf tournament 
in Tahoe Sunday, and he didn't know up until his tee time Monday if he'd be 
able to play for Bonita Vista High School in the San Diego Section team 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton was feeling fine by Tuesday and even better after Wednesday's final 
round of the section individual tournament at Singing Hills Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton shot a three-under 68 to go with his first-round 69 and won the 
individual title by three strokes over Mike Jun and Brian Cates of Madison. 
Thornton's 36-hole total of 137 on the par-71 Oak Glen course was two strokes 
off the tournament record of 135 set last year by Phil Mickelson of USDHS. 
</P>
<P>
Madison, which won the team title Monday, placed golfers second, third and 
fourth in the individual tournament. Jun won a playoff with a par on the second 
extra hole for second over Cates. Kevin Riley finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The top 10 individuals who are not members of Madison or Poway, the section's 
team qualifiers, advanced to the Southern California Golf Championships 
beginning June 11 in Bakersfield. Members of qualifying teams who finish in the 
top 10 individuals are not counted against the section's allotment; a total of 
15 individuals advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton was playing in his fourth section individual tournament, but this is 
the first time he has made the cut for the Southern California tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It was important (to do well) because I haven't done well here the last three 
years," Thornton said. "When I was a freshman, I shot a 69 (at Singing Hills) 
but I've never shot that well here since." 
</P>
<P>
Thornton, a senior headed for Southern Methodist, matched the 69 Tuesday with 
an eagle, birdie and bogey. Wednesday, he beat it with three birdies. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Dennison of Poway and Cates were a shot back to begin the day. Dennison, an 
alternate who did not get into the tournament until there was a no-show, kept 
pace until he quadruple-bogeyed the 488-yard, par-five seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Cates stayed close and had a chance to cut Thornton's lead to two on the 
par-four 12th but missed a 12-inch putt for a birdie. Thornton then birdied the 
par-three 13th to take a four-stroke lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jun, playing in the second group, had a solid round with a two-under 69 to go 
with his opening-round 71. Cates had 70s on both days. 
</P>
<P>
While everybody else was trying to play catch-up, Thornton was on cruise 
control . . . although he said he didn't feel totally comfortable until the 
17th. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything can happen, you saw that kid lose four strokes to par on one hole," 
Thornton said. "That can happen to anybody." RICK HAZELTINE

<P>
Mike Picotte is the tonic Mira Mesa will need for its best finish at the San 
Diego Section team championship Saturday at Mt. Carmel High. 
</P>
<P>
At the preliminaries at Mt. Carmel, Picotte handily won the 100- and 200-yard 
freestyles to qualify for Saturday's finals. 
</P>
<P>
Picotte is one of the top two swimmers competing in this meet. Picotte and Matt 
Buckley of Helix -- winner of the 200 individual medley and 500 freestyle -- 
are expected to better their times in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike hasn't gone all out, I can tell you that," Mira Mesa Coach Kim Yourchek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Picotte said that on a scale of one to 10, his effort rated about a 
four. 
</P>
<P>
"I swam hard enough to make it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Make it" meant a top-eight finish to advance to the championship finals. The 
next eight advanced to the consolation finals. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa, winner of its first City Conference championship last week, is 
picked to finish behind Palomar champion Poway. 
</P>
<P>
Said Yourchek: "The last time a city school won CIF was in 1977. This year we 
have a chance as a runner-up. It depends on what Poway does." 
</P>
<P>
Poway, Patrick Henry and Mira Mesa were the three teams that qualified the most 
(four) swimmers for the finals. Teams with three qualifiers were Mt. Carmel, 
University City, USDHS and Grossmont. 
</P>
<P>
Picotte and Buckley were the only double winners, but Mike Hay of Patrick Henry 
(200 individual, 500 freestyle) and Tim Trapnell of University City (100 
butterfly, 100 backstroke) placed second in two events each, and Sergio 
Monsalve of Bonita Vista (200 individual medley, 100 breaststroke) and Mitch 
Kohlbecker of Valhalla (200 and 500 freestyles) finished third twice. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminaries continue today at Mt. Carmel with the girls at 2 p.m. KIM Q.

SDSU BASEBALL SITTING IN FAMILIAR POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three hundred sixty-four days have passed, but the Western Athletic Conference 
baseball picture focuses today on the same four teams playing for the 
conference championship in Honolulu's Rainbow Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State, Hawaii, Brigham Young and Wyoming will play again in the 
double-elimination tournament. The only difference from last year is that SDSU 
and BYU have flip-flopped in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago Monday, SDSU defeated Hawaii in the final game of the regular season 
to finish first, then lost to second-place BYU in the tournament championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, SDSU defeated Hawaii in the final game to take second behind BYU. 
The Aztecs will open the tournament against the 25th-ranked Rainbows tonight at 
10 (PDT). 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are similar, too. The winner will receive one of 27 automatic berths 
in next week's 48-team NCAA tournament; the losers take their chances with the 
NCAA playoff selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dietz, SDSU's coach of 18 years, can tell you a thing or two about the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing second in 1988, SDSU was not selected because the committee 
said it played too many 'light' teams in building its 47-18-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
So this year, Dietz revamped the schedule with highly regarded teams such as 
Florida and Fresno State (the only two teams to score 10 or more runs against 
SDSU), and wound up 36-23. If the Aztecs win the WAC or come in second, they 
would have either 39 or 40 victories, a very respectable number in Dietz's 
estimation. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be interesting to see what they would do if we came in second," Dietz 
said. "If we didn't make it, I'd like to see them use that same philosophy that 
they told me last year." 
</P>
<P>
But the business at hand for SDSU is winning the WAC playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
If pitching wins championships, then consider that SDSU led the WAC and ranked 
among the nation's leaders in earned-run average at 3.05. Hawaii was second in 
the conference at 5.11. 
</P>
<P>
Senior reliever Dave Riddle (4-4, three saves) led the WAC with a 1.75 ERA, and 
senior Rob Brown (9-5) led all starters (for the second year in a row) at 3.07. 
Of the nine Aztec pitchers in Hawaii, sophomore starter Erik Plantenberg (6-3) 
has the highest ERA at 3.74. 
</P>
<P>
In all, five of the top eight ERAs in the WAC are SDSU's. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU pitchers also led in strikeouts (441), fewest walks (192) and fewest hits 
allowed (439). Of particular note is having more strikeouts than hits allowed; 
Gary Kondratek, SDSU's pitching coach, says that's almost unheard of in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of that can be attributed to depth," he said. 'We've never been this 
deep. Never. That depth has helped keep everyone fresh." 
</P>
<P>
The problem has been offense. The Aztecs batted less than .300 (.278) for the 
first time in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It concerns me" Dietz said, "but I told the team before the season started if 
we could score five runs a game, we'd win our share of games (SDSU averaged 
5.4). 
</P>
<P>
"The strength of a team is measured in the depth of its pitching staff. We're 
probably the only team in this conference that has enough pitching to pull this 
thing off." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
SDSU (36-23, 17-9) will be the home team against Hawaii (36-24, 18-10). No. 17 
BYU (43-14, 21-7) is the home team against Wyoming (36-19, 17-10) in the first 
game. . . . In WAC play, SDSU took three of four games from Hawaii and Wyoming 
and split with BYU. . . . The WAC champion will probably play at Fresno State 
or Arizona in one of the two NCAA West Regionals. . . . Hawaii officials have 
said all three days of the tournament are sold out.

JACK SMITH: REMEMBER: YA READ IT FIRST RAH CHEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most readers have responded with censure or reservations to my comment on 
"There Is No Zoo in Zoology," by Charles Harrington Elster, an admittedly 
"opinionated" guide to correct pronunciation. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, as I said, I mentioned words that I myself had evidently been 
mispronouncing, according to Elster's dicta, among them aqua, coupon, daiquiri, 
guillotine and piquant. 
</P>
<P>
I have always said AWK-wa, not AK-wa, as recommended by Elster; KYOO-pahn, not 
KOO-pahn; DAK-uh-ree, not DY-kuh-ree; GEE-uh-teen, not GIL-uh-teen; and 
pee-KHANT, not PEE-kint. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Dekle of Sherman Oaks says that if Elster hopes to homogenize the English 
language he won't succeed. "Thank goodness it'll never happen. What a boring 
place it would be." 
</P>
<P>
Elster, of course, realizes that pronunciation varies according to class, 
region and other factors, but he has sought to validate the pronunciations 
agreed on by most dictionaries and other authorities. 
</P>
<P>
That Kennedy said Cuber did not make it right; that Eisenhower said nucular did 
not make it right. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Burnham of Bishop expresses disappointment in me for appearing to agree 
with Elster. "In more interesting and adventurous times," he says, "everyone 
was his own arbiter in matters of spelling and pronunciation. Now, 
unfortunately, we're all at the mercy of professional tastemakers and 
intellectual storm troopers." 
</P>
<P>
I think Burnham's alarm is unfounded. Listen to any broadcast or talk show and 
you must conclude that the language is in anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Groff, professor at San Diego State, reports that his Random House 
Dictionary of the English Language (1983) permits AKH-wa, DAK-uh-ree, 
GEE-u-teen, pee-KHANT, VAL-ay and for-TAY. 
</P>
<P>
One of Elster's sources, by the way, was the Random House, but his choices 
evidently were based on a consensus. Some readers seem to have misunderstood 
Elster on valet. His point was that valet had long since been Anglicized into 
VAL-it, which is correct; but that to pronounce it VAL-it would seem pedantic, 
since VAL-ay is so entrenched. I said I would continue to say VAL-it, since I 
considered VAL-ay an affectation. 
</P>
<P>
D. G. Bradford wonders, if Elster thinks VAL-it is correct, whether we should 
also pronounce bouquet as boo-KWET, sachet as sash-ET, filet as fil-ET, and 
gourmet as gour-MET. Oddly, she notes, we have anglicized banquet. Fil-et is 
also heard. 
</P>
<P>
David P. Lewis of Sherman Oaks scoffs at Elster's AK-wa for aqua. "I have been 
around for 70-plus years, have lived in four major American regions and have 
visited every state in the Union except Alaska, and I can assure him and you 
that the overwhelming majority of Americans say AHK-wuh, and will continue to 
do so." (Me, too.) 
</P>
<P>
Lewis also thinks people will go on saying for-TAY, for forte, because it is 
not ambiguous. "We know when we hear for-TAY that the speaker isn't referring 
to a rampart of some kind." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Block agrees that forte pronounced as one syllable "would be thought of as 
a place to hide from the Indians. Eventually, forte will be accepted as a 
two-syllable word, even by pedants." 
</P>
<P>
Charles M. Cobb of Agoura Hills says Elster may have wit and opinion, but 
little scholarship. "Every linguist knows that language is dynamic and flexible 
and that pronunciation is a function of space and time, not of something called 
'correctness.' A dictionary is not a lawgiver; it is a reporter." 
</P>
<P>
Our language might be more colorful if one of Elster's sources had been "How to 
Talk Pure Ozark," by Dale Freeman, a glossary of the language as spoken in the 
southern highlands. 
</P>
<P>
In this hardy dialect, bag is used as in "He bagged her to marry up with him"; 
banch as in "scrubs sit on the banch"; dork, what it gets when the sun goes 
down; flar, a rose is about the prettiest flar there is; hern, it ain't hern, 
it's hisn; jav, did you have? keeyow, a farm animal; oral, your car needs two 
quarts of oral; rah cheer, he was born rah cheer; retch, as in "If I'd knowed 
it was you I'd have retch out and wove." 
</P>
<P>
Ozark evidently has no words for aqua, valet and piquant.

ON VIEW: GLOBE-TROTTING FOR LONDON'S GLOBE CENTRE

With the announcement of $1.2 million already raised in the Western United 
States, Los Angeles this week launched the American celebration and leadership 
gift appeal for the International Shakespeare Globe Centre in London. The 
campaign is to rebuild the Globe Theatre on its original site in London. And 
the Globe's royal patron, His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, 
was in Our Town and attended a private reception in his honor on Wednesday at 
the JW Marriott in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
It was a stellar crowd: Malcolm Kingston, chairman, Western Region Board for 
the center; Jean Smith, wife of the former U.S. Atty. Gen. William French Smith 
(she represented the Southern California Committee), and the foundation's 
founder and executive vice chairman, Sam Wanamaker, who flew in Monday a bit 
tired after participating in an all-night vigil to preserve the London site of 
the foundations of the Elizabethen Rose Theater, which is near the Globe site. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Armand Hammer and Elizabeth Taylor are honorary American co-chairs. Gordon 
P. Getty is chairman of the International Council. 
</P>
<P>
Friday evening, furthering the cause, the spirit of Shakespeare echoes in an 
intimate black-tie evening for 70 in the elegant gardens of the Hotel Bel-Air. 
The affair begins the Globe Centre's American Celebration Weekend. Honored 
guests will be British Ambassador to the United States Sir Antony Acland and 
Lady Acland. 
</P>
<P>
The evening goes like this: cocktails and the performance beside the hotel's 
swan lake, dinner and diversions on the terrace, dessert and finale on the 
lawn. Then the Aclands and Wanamaker troop to the Chicago's Ritz Carlton on 
Saturday and then the New York's Plaza Hotel on Sunday where Donald and Ivana 
Trump will be honorary co-chairs at a gala honoring Prince Philip. They'll be 
joined by Jose Ferrer, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Edward Asner, Beatrice Straight 
and Christopher Reeve. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this all has to do with money. The big leadership donors will be 
invited to a week of private events in London and the royal opening of the 
Globe on April 23, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
KUDOS TO THACHER: Horses teach responsibility. Mountains teach self reliance. 
Each student of The Thacher School is required to have the complete care of his 
or her own horse for at least the first year of school. Legendary alumni such 
as Thornton Wilder and Howard Hughes adhered. So have heaps of alumni with 
familiar Western surnames -- Livermore, Mudd, Chandler, Bechtel, Hastings, 
Williamson and Boswell. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what has not changed about the school in the Ojai Valley is the 
combination of academic excellence with wilderness camping and the gymkhana 
competition. It's been a successful formula for 100 years. As Headmaster Bill 
Wyman has advocated: "Education with a difference -- education with reliance on 
Western values." 
</P>
<P>
To prove Thacher graduates adore their alma mater, some 1,100 students and 
their families will be on campus for the Thacher Centennial this weekend. 
They'll see a school that's changed from one room nestled at the foot of the 
mountains encircling the lovely Ojai Valley to a sprawling co-educational 
complex of unpretentious beauty. Today Thacher has 227 students from all over 
the world (and 150 horses) . Twenty percent are scholarship students, 10% 
minorities, and the school has a commitment to a program to increase those 
percentages in 1990. Director of Public Information Carla Bard brags a little: 
"Year after year, the tough academic program taught by the 45 outstanding 
Thacher faculty gets these boys and girls into Yale, Harvard, Princeton, 
Stanford and Berkeley." 
</P>
<P>
So, who's partying this weekend? Lots of Williamsons -- Tad, Fred, Chandler. 
Trustee Betty Helms Adams, the first woman trustee, will be there. Robert 
Hastings is going up. George Black Thacher, born 1903, will be welcomed as the 
earliest alumnus. He is the eldest son of the revered founder of the school, 
Sherman Day Thacher. Nostalgia, seminars, pride, merriment, banquets, parades, 
softball, horseshoes, a gymkhana and tall tales. 
</P>
<P>
HOME FIRES: For foreign visitors, invitations to private homes are usually 
prized ones. For the Japan American Conference of Mayors and Presidents of 
Chambers of Commerce 20th Biennial Conference in Los Angeles Tuesday night, the 
candles were flickering at small dinner parties all over the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom and Ethel Bradley entertained at their Getty House residence for 12 
-- Gov. Shunichi and Atsuko Suzuki of Tokyo (he's chairman of the Japanese 
delegation); Mayor Toru and Kaoru Ishii of Sendai City, host of the 1991 
conference; Kotaro Takeda of Nagoya, Los Angeles Sister City; Ray Remy, 
president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and his wife Sandra; and 
Los Angeles Harbor Commissioner Jun Mori and his wife May. Among other hosts, 
John and Liz Argue entertained in La Canada, Bill and Margaret Clossey in Los 
Angeles, Jonel and Lois Hill in Pasadena.

States of Emergency by Andre Brink (Summit: $18.95; 248 pages) 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't think I shall be writing my book after all," says the narrator at 
the end of Andre Brink's "States of Emergency." 
</P>
<P>
This narrator, a troubled South African writer, is for all practical purposes 
Brink himself, author of seven searching novels about the warfare of private 
and public life in his tragic society. This eighth book is less a novel than an 
argument, half personal and half fictional, that novels can't be written in 
such a condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Self-Fulfilling Theme 
</P>
<P>
The argument is the theme of "States of Emergency." It is, in part, a 
self-fulfilling theme. Brink has written a portrait of a writer in disarray. 
The disarray invades the book. 
</P>
<P>
Ostensibly, "States" is told at four different levels. N., the narrator, is 
trying to write his novel, inspired by two events. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime before, he had received the manuscript of a short novel by a woman 
named Jane Ferguson. It told of an affair between a young woman and a 
middle-aged man, which ended when he abandoned her and she committed suicide by 
burning herself to death. N., who greatly admired the work, tried in vain to 
get it published. Publishers were not interested in a private love story from 
South Africa, one that did not deal with the public events there. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Ferguson's father brings N. her diary. She had a love affair with 
DeVilliers, a middle-aged doctor who left her to resume his work in the 
anti-apartheid underground. He was arrested, tortured and died in jail, 
allegedly by suicide. Jane Ferguson burned herself to death. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's novel and her diary comprised two of "State's" mutually reflexive 
layers. A third is the principal narrative in the form of notes for the novel 
that N. proposes to write. Should it get written, it will tell of the affair 
between Philip, a middle-aged professor of literary criticism, and Melissa, his 
young graduate student assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are N.'s own difficulties in writing. Events interrupt him; 
notably, his unsuccessful effort to help Milton, a saintly schemer who 
struggles to keep his black township from being destroyed in the fight between 
young extremists and the South African authorities. More persistent 
interruptions are provided by N.'s struggles with his story, the various 
versions he suggests for it, and his frequent sorties into post-structuralist 
theories that cast doubt on the solidity of fiction itself. 
</P>
<P>
N., his speculations and frustrated digressions growing increasingly feverish, 
makes a mighty stew of politics and literary ideas. The names of Roland Barthe 
and Jacques Derrida are conjured up along with security police colonels and 
African immolation legends. 
</P>
<P>
The classical novels of characters and emotions that matter, the structuralist 
philosophies that take account of them -- all these are associated with the 
rigidities of South African society. The newer literary ideas -- Melissa is a 
deconstructionist, her lover-professor, a structuralist -- are associated 
discovery, resistance and change. 
</P>
<P>
There is a serious, provocative notion in the disruption of N.'s fictional 
efforts by the catastrophes around him. There is at least a playful and 
stimulating provocation in the invasion of the deconstructionist plot -- and -- 
body snatchers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a novel about the difficulties of writing a novel, however interesting 
these difficulties may be, does not make a novel. The other things that Brink 
provides failed to do the job. Jane Ferguson's abortive bit of fiction is only 
a whiff of a story. Her diary account of her affair with DeVilliers is more 
substantial, though at the end, N. indicates that both Ferguson and her novel 
are invented exercises to help him get going on Philip and Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Banal Tale 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Philip-Melissa affair is a fairly banal story of an older man and 
a younger woman, undermined by guilt, nightmares and the tensions of the world 
outside. Neither character is memorable; they are appealing but they inhabit a 
worn-out plight. And the alternative beginnings and endings suggested by N. 
drain them of whatever life and individuality they possess. 
</P>
<P>
If Brink's characters are drained, so is his considerable narrative strength. 
We get involved, in spite of ourselves, in what will happen to the couple; we 
get involved in the atrocities happening outside, and in the story of Milton, 
the only authentically fascinating personage in the book. 
</P>
<P>
But Brink, or N., will not allow us our interest. We are continually jerked 
back and reminded that all these stories are hypothetical and unsound, and that 
finally -- as we have seen -- they will not be told. 
</P>
<P>
It is one thing for contemporary theory to come in afterward and argue that the 
fiction we have read tells us not about real characters but only about how its 
text was created. It is another for this reductivism to be applied in the 
moment of creation. It is literary contraception; nothing emerges alive.

Lois Friss of Granada Hills would like to find a wooden nutcracker bowl with an 
insert that holds the nutcracker and picks; she has the nutcracker and the six 
picks. Can you bowl Friss over with some ideas without being too picky, or is 
this request too tough a nut to crack for our readers?

Jane Auerbach of West Los Angeles is searching for a wall-mounted laundry 
drying rack that extends out to about 21 inches, has eight plastic-coated lines 
and folds flat when not in use. Her old one was about 40 inches long but is no 
longer manufactured. Can you help dry Auerbach's tears before she's up the 
wall, or is this another request that falls flat? 
</P>

Ken Garrison of Palmdale needs shoes for thick instep feet. Can you help 
Garrison get back on his feet with a source or so, or will he never again be in

Ellen Boles of Acme Mattress Factory informs us that they have discontinued 
their pillow-cleaning service, but recommends Orchid Cleaners, 2706 E. 
Broadway, Long Beach. (She also adds, sadly, that they are still sitting on 
their 40x25-foot bed, the largest in the world. Anybody with a huge bedroom 
interested?)

In case Betty Busch of Burbank, who was trying to put her finger on some 
plastic No. 7 knitting needles, needs more, we have quite a bit of help. Lois 
Jenks of Los Angeles says bamboo needles, which are exceptionally light in 
weight, are available at Glendale Yarn &amp; Crafts, 111 W. California Ave., 
Glendale. Nancy O'Neal of Delano writes that French RCN plastic needles may be 
ordered from Patternworks, P.O. Box 1690, Poughkeepsie, N.Y. 12601 (O'Neal says 
this firm is an excellent source for quality knitting items); she also mentions 
Mary Maxim Inc. 2001 Holland Ave., Port Huron, Mich. 48060-5019, and adds that 
Balene needles from Boye might do the trick; they can be had at Craft Mart 
Stores. Finally, four readers said they are willing to part with their 
lightweight knitting needles; a stamped, self-addressed envelope will prick our 
conscience sufficiently for that list.

Linda Hughes of Long Beach, who was after material for prom dresses, need only

Stibrik suggested Joanne's Fabrics, 3766 Pacific Coast Highway, Torrance.

YOUR WHEELS: MISFIRING IN DRIVE TRAIN CAUSES FRICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have been having a misfiring problem on my Honda and now feel 
somewhat deceived by the dealer. The drive train warranty expired, though I 
mentioned the problem to him several times while the warranty was in effect. I 
have heard that Honda recognizes that it has a problem with oil fouling on a 
pre-chamber seal. What is that? Am I now stuck with paying for the problem? -- 
D.L.R. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The pre-chamber seal is an O-ring type of seal on a valve stem. The 
valve stem passes through the cylinder head into an area of the cylinder called 
the pre-chamber, where the fuel and air are mixed. If the seal is bad, oil can 
drain down into the cylinder and cause oil fouling of the spark plug. This is 
not usually a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
Because oil fouling of the plug can have an adverse effect on the emissions 
from the engine, the repair should be covered by the 5-year-or-50,000-mile 
warranty on the emissions system. If your dealer balks at providing the 
service, you should ask to speak to a Honda factory representative. If you can 
document that you reported the problem before the drive train warranty expired, 
I think Honda has an obligation to fix your problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a bunch of new oil in my garage, but many of the cans indicate 
different weights. Is it safe to mix single-weight and multi-weight oil 
together? -- E.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: Although mixing different weights of oil is seldom recommended, the oils are 
essentially compatible with each other. It is a federal requirement for all 
engine oils, regardless of make or viscosity, to be compatible, according to 
Norm Hudecki, a Valvoline motor oil expert. 
</P>
<P>
Some people mistakenly believe that such mixing will cause oil to gel, which is 
not the case, he said. But one problem that you may experience is that by 
mixing a number of different oil weights together you will not have any idea of 
the oil weight in your engine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Update 
</P>
<P>
In a column May 4, Your Wheels recommended a method for combatting mold in 
automobile air conditioners. The process, suggested by an allergist who had 
safely used it in the past, involved mixing vinegar and household bleach and 
placing the solution in a pan in a car. 
</P>
<P>
Several academic and industry experts have since raised objections to the 
procedure, saying it could cause irritation in some individuals. In the worst 
case, the experts said, the vinegar-bleach mixture could produce harmful or 
irritating fumes. 
</P>
<P>
In light of those potential safety concerns, I suggest that individuals not use 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
One possibly helpful procedure to combatting mold is to operate the air 
conditioner fan for a few minutes after the air conditioner is turned off, 
which should help dry off the system. The mold forms on the evaporator, which 
is located under the dashboard and is inaccessible.

"He who hath ears to hear, let him hear": The International Version of the 
Bible will soon be available on compact disc. The 60-disc set will retail for 
about $200 and is expected to be out by September. The set contains 75 hours of 
narration and music and is being produced by LJ Productions in Newport Beach. 
Producer Steve Johnson, who will also narrate, says the discs allow easy access 
to passages. "If you'd like to listen to the fifth chapter of Matthew, you can 
just queue it up." The Bible has previously appeared on record and tape and on 
floppy disc and CD-ROM for home computers . . . not to mention the familiar 
version where you turn the printed pages by hand. ALEENE MacMINN

Geoff Edwards, the affable host of television's "Big Spin," was due back on 
radio Wednesday night to fill in for Tom Snyder on Snyder's ABC call-in show. 
In a telephone interview earlier in the day, Edwards said he has weathered the 
storm that two months ago led to his resigning as a KFI talk show host. Edwards 
objected to the station's promotion of fellow talk show host Tom Leykis' plan 
to destroy Cat Stevens' recordings as a protest against the singer's 
endorsement of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death threat against Salman 
Rushdie. Edwards has received about 500 letters in support of his position, and 
says, "If I had to do it all over again, I'd do exactly the same thing." ALEENE

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: 2 WHO WENT BACK TO BASICS ARE

While other rising saxophone players took their cues from obvious sources -- 
Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, sometimes Coleman Hawkins -- Joe Henderson's 
path kept him closer to musicians who never quite received star status. This 
has been a blessing; his playing is more on the fringe, his influences 
well-hidden and richly blended. 
</P>
<P>
Tenor player Henderson is in town for a two-week reunion of sorts with pianist 
and former band mate George Cables at Elario's. Early in his career, Henderson 
hooked up with trumpeter Kenny Dorham, who has only recently been recognized as 
a significant innovator. Their 1960s recordings explored Latin rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson has said that saxophonist Sonny Rollins was his strongest early 
inspiration, a fact that shows in his ability to choose easily from a variety 
of musical tools -- one minute playing straight, fluid bop lines, the next 
taking a tune to a realm of odd harmonies, honking and screaming. 
</P>
<P>
Both Henderson and Cables have flirted with so-called "fusion" music; Cables 
played electric piano in Henderson's group roughly 20 years ago. Today, though, 
both men have returned to the basics, Henderson preferring his tenor in raw, 
sparse settings, and Cables settling some time ago on acoustic piano as his 
instrument of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's newest album is "The State of the Tenor," a moody, electrifying 
outing at the Village Vanguard in the company of bass player Ron Carter and 
drummer Al Foster, a concise six-song session whose composers range from Horace 
Silver to Thelonious Monk to Charles Mingus to Henderson himself. 
</P>
<P>
One of Henderson's significant career experiences was with trumpeter Woody 
Shaw, who died recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I was with him two years," Henderson said. "It was a very interesting pairing. 
I felt very comfortable on the bandstand with him because he was such a 
tremendously talented musician. I'm a few years older than Woody, and I may 
have had something to do with whatever he was about musically." Some years 
later, Shaw rejoined Henderson in a band that included Cables. 
</P>
<P>
Besides playing, Henderson teaches students in his San Francisco home, finding 
that his proteges often provide the fresh musical outlook he's after. 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, he hopes to assemble a big band to record his own 
compositions. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and Cables, backed by Marshall Hawkins on bass and San Diegan Jim 
Plank on drums, opened a two-week stay at Elario's Wednesday night. This is 
Henderson's second visit to San Diego -- the first was a gig at the Catamaran 
in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego sax man Bill Shreeve leads both a contemporary jazz sextet and an 
all-acoustic, straight-ahead jazz quartet. Unlike some folks, he doesn't 
believe either brand of music is superior. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that there's a lot of closed-mindedness regarding contemporary stuff. 
Obviously, we have some very advanced players -- some of the best players right 
now are playing what is considered 'fusion': Chick Corea, Michael Brecker. In 
my opinion, jazz fusion is just another form of musical expression. I think 
traditional jazz and some of the older forms are great ways to express oneself, 
but fusion is difficult in that it has more highly arranged parts for each 
musician to play, and it requires more rehearsal." 
</P>
<P>
Shreeve studied at San Diego State University and San Diego City College, 
playing in the schools' big bands. Additionally, he studied with local sax 
masters Charles McPherson and Paul Sundfor, not known for their love of light, 
contemporary jazz. Shreeve, who plays soprano, alto, tenor, flute and a Yamaha 
WX-7 Wind Midi Controller, likes the work of young sax players Michael Brecker, 
Eric Marienthal and Gerald Albright. He's written a lot of material for his 
sextet, and hopes to get the band into a studio soon. 
</P>
<P>
Just done with a long run on KIFM's Lites Out Jazz circuit, Shreeve's sextet 
makes a one-night stop at the Hilton's Cargo Bar on May 25. 
</P>
<P>
Shreeve's cohorts on the Lites Out circuit, Flight 7, are enjoying increasing 
national popularity with their new album, "Sky High." 
</P>
<P>
"We had reached the point where we were getting played in 50 states," said Don 
Schoenberger, the group's drummer, "but the way it was put to us, the Wave 
(KSWV at 102.9 FM) is the big syndicated station, and unless we made Chicago 
and New York, it didn't mean a thing. Just within the last couple of weeks, 
they've started playing us." 
</P>
<P>
Different markets have taken a liking to different tunes. Local radio stations 
play "Leroy's Garage" and "Tara's Tune," both instrumentals, while in Chicago, 
"Take a Chance," with vocals by Rose Riedel, is the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
During May, Flight 7 is playing Sunday nights at Humphrey's on Shelter Island 
and Wednesday through Saturday nights at the Rusty Pelican across from 
University Towne Centre. 
</P>
<P>
SHORT RIFFS: At Croce's, 5th Avenue at F Street in the Gaslamp Quarter:

Ave., changing the format to jazz. The club -- which was named in honor of 
Leroy Brown, the sax-playing father of Gil Brown, who owns the club with his 
wife, Karen -- features jazz Thursday through Sunday nights from 6:30 until 10. 
Tonight and Sunday, its the Sugar Trio on organ, sax and drums. Friday and 
Saturday nights, its a group called Zzaj. . . . Hollis Gentry's Acoustic 
Quartet plays Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach tonight through Saturday night. . . 
. Gentry's Neon leaves Sunday for a Monday-night gig in Yuma, Ariz. With their 
new album getting national airplay, including on 12 Wave stations and on Art 
Good's Jazz Trax show in 27 U. S. markets, Neon plans to be on the road two 
weekends a month. Bookings already include San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and 
New York.

A new California Poll has bad news for radio and television networks. About 61% 
of the respondents are unhappy with radio and TV coverage of elections, and 68% 
favor a ban on projecting winners before the polls have closed on the West 
Coast. An even greater majority, 73%, favor a uniform closing time so that 
everyone nationwide finishes voting at the same time. That figure slipped to 
63%, however, if the plan meant that polls in California would close an hour 
earlier, at 7 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. The survey of 1,018 California adults was 
conducted April 13-22. ALEENE MacMINN

<P>
A BREATHLESS VERSION OF BRECHT'S 'BAAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tumultuous production of Bertolt Brecht's "Baal" has been transported to West 
Hollywood by the Project III Ensemble Theatre from New York. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-member SoHo troupe is flying its expressionistic colors at the Callboard 
Theatre. The tumult doesn't always make sense, but it frequently freezes your 
attention. The production careens and slurps through the lustful adventures of 
a wandering poet nicknamed Baal (the fertility god) whose degeneracy swallows 
up those around him and, finally, himself as well. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is Germany around 1911. "Baal" was Brecht's first play, written 
when he was barely 21 (in 1918), and its roguish elements anticipate "The Three 
Penny Opera" and, later still, Brecht's formalized theater of alienation. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Brecht's better-known plays, "Baal" is pure, rampaging hedonism brushed 
with an impish, sprite-like innocence orchestrating its voracious central 
character. 
</P>
<P>
Director Charles Otte's sense of gesture and style, with cast members 
occasionally addressing the audience directly, seems as true to the early, 
experimental Brecht as it's possible to get. This company knows what it is 
doing even when the material taxes your patience. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the title role demands a reckless hairy ape who is a child at heart. 
And Will Kepper's shirtless (at one point totally naked) bulk and life-gorging 
spirit fill the stage with an appetite that is vulgar and astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
Kepper's part-monster, part mirthful satyr is an insatiable drinker and 
fornicator, irresistible to women, having and discarding them like grapes. 
Finally, he's even a murderer, killing his loyal follower and fellow artist 
(well played bv Richard Schiff). 
</P>
<P>
The dreamlike ending materializes with a nice symbolic image conceived by 
director Otte. A little boy whom we've seen sitting under barroom tables now 
stands bathed in light as Kepper's Baal, spent, ruined and, worse, with nobody 
to play with, slips into innocence/death and fades into the glade. All Baal 
wanted was to gulp down the sky and the moon. 
</P>
<P>
Kepper is especially fine at suggesting the man/child who grabbed all the toys 
and was puzzled when they broke apart in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
The play is rarely staged. It didn't show up in this country until 1965. Some 
theatergoers may recall Ron Sossi in the title role at the Odyssey (1981), 
which was also a rough, vibrant affair, but this SoHo ensemble is notable for 
its visual and musical panache. 
</P>
<P>
The show's opening is as deceptively pristine as a church recital. The cast, 
with bell-like tones, is lined up a capella style singing the "Chorale of the 
Great Baal" from Brecht's prologue (including the telltale "Baal eats all the 
grass and smacks his lips"). The 21 scenes that follow are filtered through 
fractured, primitive, expressionist art reflecting Baal's inner pursuit and 
painted by Jan. Gillen. 
</P>
<P>
Gillen's brother, Theodore Gillen, composed the original music. And the 
producer is yet another Gillen, sister Anne Marie. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble work is carefully crafted and three of the women etch this 
Brechtian canvas with lingering color: the softly pale Hilary Rappaport, the 
starkly sinuous blond Christine Sang, and the avaricious, auburn Lucile Ford.

'FOREST OF LITTLE BEAR' A POIGNANT SOCIAL DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Forest of Little Bear" (opening Friday at the Little Tokyo Cinema 1) may focus 
on a little boy and an adorable cub, but thankfully it is not another of those 
saccharine animal pictures so beloved by the Japanese. It's a heart-tugger for 
sure, but it is notably tough-minded and gains immeasurably with its well-drawn 
social context. Director Tohio Goto and writer Ryunosuke Ono have, in fact, 
made a gentle picture about life's harshness. 
</P>
<P>
The time is 1928 and the place is the rugged, mountainous region of 
northeastern Japan. The most skilled hunter in the area, Ginzo Iwata (Takahiro 
Tamura), returns home after a decade in the Sakhalin Islands to find most of 
his fellow peasants have abandoned hunting and become coal miners. Despite the 
dwindling of game, Ginzo sticks to the old ways until he kills a bear, not 
realizing that she has a tiny cub. For this offense to the mountain god, Ginzo 
gives up hunting, concentrates on tenant farming and on helping his adoring 
grandson (Hirofumi Miyata) raise that little cub. Both bear cubs and boys, 
however, grow up, and this is the crux of the matter and of the rigid Ginzo's 
dawning enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
This is the rare film that reveres the life that is lived in harmony with 
nature yet quietly laments, rather than shrilly protests, the inevitability of 
change in a society that is becoming rapidly industrialized. Played with such 
passion yet control by Tamura, Ginzo comes to realize that he is obsolete and 
that under no circumstances must his grandson try to follow in his footsteps. 
For all of the mischievous irresistibility of that cub, "Forest of Little Bear" 
is Times-rated Mature because of its painfully realistic, deeply symbolic 
ending. KEVIN THOMAS

'WOMAN DEMON HUMAN': CHINESE ARTISTIC VISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Writer-director Huang Shuqin's "Woman Demon Human" (opening Friday at the 
Little Tokyo Cinema 2) begins as many films about actresses do: with the 
heroine sitting at her dressing table looking back on her life as she makes up. 
Although classic in form, this exquisite film by one of China's few women film 
makers has so many distinctive details and is so clearly the work of a 
liberated, reflective sensibility that it offers an altogether fresh 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Huang's lovely heroine Qiu Yun (Xu Shouli) is only 30, but her life has already 
been filled with accomplishment and heartbreak. The time is the present, as we 
begin to flash back to Qiu Yun's childhood, but the settings are so primitive 
as to seem in the distant past. For Qiu Yun is the child of traveling opera 
performers who tour rural China in oxcarts and perform in the most makeshift 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Her happy childhood is shattered when her mother runs off with another man. 
From then on Qiu Yin will deal with every one of life's challenges and 
disappointments by throwing herself into her career -- often quite literally, 
for stardom in the Chinese opera requires the skills of both the gymnast and 
the martial artist. Early on she has determined that she will break precedent 
and demand to play the more physically demanding male roles. 
</P>
<P>
The part that brings her fame is that of the ferocious-looking ghost of ancient 
Chinese folklore, Zhong Kui, who zealously tries to marry off his beloved 
sister. Throughout the film, a dreamlike performance of the one-act opera, 
"Zhong Kui Marries Off His Sister," is intercut with Qiu Yun's memories as she 
gradually accepts that this stellar demon (played by opera actress Pei Yanling) 
has in effect married her to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
In "Woman Demon Human" (Times-rated Mature for complex themes) the most 
elaborate and glittery of costumes contrast with both the natural beauty of the 
countryside and the simplicity of the opera company's attire and life style 
offstage. What could have been a soapy old-fashioned "woman's picture" has 
become a reverie on art as a way to salvation. 
</P>
<P>
The second feature is another fine Chinese film, "The Old Well." On May 26: 
"Desperation" and "Hibiscus Town," two more Chinese films. KEVIN THOMAS

'SUITORS': A DARK COMEDY ON IRANIANS IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ghasem Ebrahimian's "The Suitors" (Westside Pavilion) is so thoroughly 
unpredictable that it takes a while to appreciate that its view of the Iranian 
expatriate experience in America is as tragic as it is comic. It is remarkably 
accomplished in its shifts of tone for a first feature and is so distinctive 
that it was the only American film selected out of 50 entries for the Directors 
Fortnight at Cannes last year. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian-born, American-educated, Ebrahimian sets his story in motion with 
terrific panache. He opens with a group of macho-looking Iranian men capturing 
a sheep on a farm in verdant Upstate New York. Cut to Kennedy International, 
where a middle-aged Iranian named Haji (Assurbanipal Babila) and his beautiful, 
chador-clad wife, Mariyam (Pouran Esrafily), become accidentally separated 
almost upon arrival, eventually reunited by the same men who went after that 
sheep. They slaughter the sheep (for a feast) in an apartment bathtub, its 
blood somehow drips into the apartment below, and a paranoid SWAT team leaves 
Mariyam an instant widow. 
</P>
<P>
"The Suitors" does not turn into a protest picture but instead starts living up 
to its title as Haji's friends commence pursuing his stunning young widow, who 
stands to inherit half a million dollars, not to mention a fortune in Persian 
rugs. Far from grief-stricken, Mariyam married Haji, long a U.S. resident, only 
to get to America to continue her eduction. For the first time in her life she 
is experiencing an unexpected taste of freedom, a sensation that neither the 
women, let alone the men, among her husband's friends comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
The film's twists and turns prove to be as breathtaking as Esrafily's dark 
elegance. "The Suitors" (Times-rated Mature for intense adult themes and 
situations) is a sad reminder of the fate of Iran's women, who were in the 
process of becoming liberated when the Ayatollah ordered them to resume the 
veil. KEVIN THOMAS

LAME DUCK QUITS COMPTON COUNCIL TO TRY IN ANOTHER RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

COMPTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Floyd A. James, defeated in his bid for reelection last month, has 
unexpectedly resigned to wage a write-in campaign against another councilman in 
a June 6 runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that may trigger a political free-for-all, James resigned Tuesday 
from his 2nd District council seat to run against incumbent Councilman Robert 
L. Adams in the 3rd District. James' move stunned the city's political leaders 
and drew immediate fire from Adams and Bernice Woods, the Compton School 
District trustee who forced Adams into the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
James' resignation clears the way for the council to appoint Patricia Moore to 
finish his unexpired term. She defeated James in the April 18 election and was 
to have taken the seat on July 1. The council is expected to appoint Moore next 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Adams called James' write-in campaign an act of vindictiveness that will be 
repudiated by the voters. Woods accused James of trying to deceive Compton 
residents by suddenly declaring his residence to be in the 3rd District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Chapter in Feud 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Compton are not so unintelligent that they will fall for this," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The election contest marks the latest chapter in a feud between Adams and James 
that began late last year when Adams' son, Laurence, was fired as the city's 
redevelopment director by City Manager James Goins. Laurence Adams serves as 
his father's political strategist and chief campaign fund-raiser, 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the write-in campaign, James said Robert Adams is not "capable of 
being a fair and impartial representative" because he is consumed with helping 
Laurence Adams regain his job. 
</P>
<P>
James said he rebuffed entreaties from Laurence Adams to try to force the city 
manager to rehire him. Robert Adams and James were part of the council majority 
that consistently supported developer interests and received financial backing 
from the same contributors. 
</P>
<P>
However, Adams apparently began actively working against James' reelection in 
last month's election. The morning after his defeat, James cited Adams' support 
of Moore as the most important factor in his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Tuesday in the City Council chambers where he announced 
his resignation in order to oppose Adams, James said he wants to continue 
several projects he started as a councilman and that he is running against 
Adams because the councilman "has become so emotionally involved due to the 
firing of his son . . . that he is no longer objective in making decisions 
which affect the city." 
</P>
<P>
James decided to resign after City Clerk Charles Davis confronted the 
councilman about moving his voter registration address earlier this month from 
a 2nd District address to 519 Corlett Ave. in the 3rd District. James said he 
owns a house at the Corlett address. 
</P>
<P>
Council members are elected citywide, but must run for a council seat in the 
district in which they are registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he made an inquiry to the county registrar of voters about James' 
registration after hearing reports last week that campaign workers were handing 
out absentee ballots and asking residents to write in James' name. 
</P>
<P>
The registrar confirmed on Monday, Davis said, that James had switched his 
voting address. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Told Him He Could Resign 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he called James and told him the councilman could resign, or that 
Davis would notify the council that James had vacated the seat. A council 
member who moves from one district to another automatically vacates the council 
seat, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference Tuesday morning, James said he did not announce earlier 
that he had moved out of his council district to run against Adams, "because I 
did not want my strategy known to the public." 
</P>
<P>
James dismissed suggestions that he wanted to be a spoiler in this year's 
election, mounting a write-in campaign just to see Adams defeated. James said 
he is in the race to win. 
</P>
<P>
An elected official, who asked not to be named, said James has paid political 
workers on the streets handing out hundreds of absentee ballot requests. "He is 
in to win," said the official. James said he is paying the workers but refused 
to say how much. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said he was confident he would still be the winner in the runoff. "I was 
the front-runner in a field of eight," he said, referring to the April 
election. "I feel I will repeat that performance in a field of three." 
</P>
<P>
Adams got 30.4% of the primary vote, with Woods garnering 19%. Only 19% of the 
city's 40,113 voters went to the polls in the April election. 
</P>
<P>
Woods, who showed up uninvited for James press conference, said she was equally 
confident of victory even with James in the race. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time James was announcing that he would run against Adams, another 
runoff campaign was heating up. Mayoral candidate Chuck (E. Boyd) Esters Jr. 
called Tuesday for a "clean sweep" of city government with the firing of City 
Manager Goins and Police Chief Ivory Webb. 
</P>
<P>
Under Goins, Esters said in a written statement, Compton's government has 
become "rudderless," neighborhoods have deteriorated and redevelopment has been 
mismanaged. Webb's tenure, Esters said, has been "mostly one of public 
relations gimmicks" and hand-holding for the mayor and council. Drug and gang 
activity, Esters said, have not been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declined to Comment 
</P>
<P>
Goins and Webb declined to comment on Esters' statements. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Mayor Walter R. Tucker declined to comment directly on Esters' call 
for the removal of the city manager and the police chief. Reiterating one of 
his campaign themes, the mayor questioned whether Esters' comments were 
credible. 
</P>
<P>
"The man hasn't been in the city for years," Tucker said. Esters, 37, worked on 
the East Coast and in the Midwest before returning to Compton in 1985 and 
setting up his business, VIP Transportation Co.

TEACHERS UNION VOTES FOR NEW HIGH SCHOOL IN MONTEBELLO DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MONTEBELLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that has further split the educational community here, the teachers 
union has overwhelmingly endorsed a Montebello Unified School District plan to 
build a new high school to ease overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony during a Tuesday night study session at district headquarters, 
Montebello Teachers Assn. President David Lebow told the board that a majority 
of union members prefer building a new 2,400-student high school rather than 
adding classroom space to three campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The board is scheduled to decide tonight on the two alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the district should invest $69 million and up to eight 
years to open a fourth comprehensive high school or add 60 classrooms -- for 
less than one-third the cost and time -- to Bell Gardens, Montebello and Schurr 
high schools. Vail Continuation High School would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
For the past several weeks, the board has heard conflicting testimony on the 
two alternatives from parents, students, staff and business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents and students have joined School Supt. John P. Cook and board 
President Eleanor K. Chow in calling for a new school to lower the 
student-to-teacher ratio, which, at 33 students per teacher, is the highest in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
But business leaders, the district's finance director and three of four 
principals have argued that expansion would help bring much-needed renovations 
to the three comprehensive high schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Do Something 
</P>
<P>
Cook said Montebello, Schurr and Bell Gardens high schools are filled, and 
school officials predict that enrollment will continue to increase by about 700 
students a year. "It's clear something needs to be done," Cook said. "It's 
important that they (the board members) do something soon." 
</P>
<P>
The Montebello School District -- the third largest in the county -- serves 
Montebello, Commerce, Bell Gardens and parts of Downey, East Los Angeles, 
Monterey Park, Pico Rivera, Rosemead and South San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Complaining that the 1,500-member teachers union was never consulted about 
either plan, Lebow said union leaders met Tuesday morning and voted 
overwhelmingly to urge construction of a 40-acre student high school, which is 
being proposed in Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"We are creating numbers out of our children," Lebow said, criticizing the 
expansion alternative. "All you have to do is go to Schurr at nutrition time 
and try to walk around on campus." 
</P>
<P>
"Our high schools are at bulging capacity," Lebow continued. "If we are really 
serious about meeting the needs of our children, then we need to do so in a 
smaller plant. It may take eight years to build, but it will last for 50." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Decision 
</P>
<P>
The union endorsement illustrates the difficult decision the board faces when 
it meets tonight. Although the teachers union supports Cook's proposal to build 
the new school, the association's stand pits teachers against their principals 
and other local school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"I have heard from many residents about this," said board member Willard G. 
Yamaguchi, who added that he is unsure how he will vote. "They all tell me that 
they want a new high school. It's a hard choice. But they are the ones we are 
supposed to serve." 
</P>
<P>
Parent-Teacher associations at Bella Vista Elementary School in Monterey Park 
and Potrero Heights Elementary School in South San Gabriel also urged the board 
Tuesday night to approve a new high school. 
</P>
<P>
School officials first proposed a new high school in 1987. Of 22 possible 
sites, officials have identified two 40-acre sites in Commerce. One site, 
across the street from Commerce City Hall, would displace 21 businesses. The 
other site, less than half a mile from Bell Gardens High School at Eastern 
Avenue and Randolph Street, would displace 18 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Board members have said the two sites were the best choices on the list, which 
was prepared by Len Coates, a consultant with the Los Angeles County Department 
of Internal Services. 
</P>
<P>
But they added that the two locations, which were criticized by Commerce 
officials and business leaders, were not "set in concrete." If the board 
decides to build a new school, they will consider the two sites as well as 
continue to search for another possible site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School Site Suggested 
</P>
<P>
Some school officials suggested earlier this month that the board consider 
building a campus on more than 600 acres of undeveloped Chevron Corp. land in 
North Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce City Council on May 2 approved a resolution condemning any effort 
by the school board to take Commerce commercial or industrial property. The 
resolution calls for expansion of Bell Gardens High School, which at 2,900, has 
the highest student population in the district. 
</P>
<P>
School yards and playing fields are crowded with portable classrooms, the 
library and cafeteria were designed for 1,400 students, and many of the 
permanent buildings are in shoddy condition, school officials said. A 
renovation program to upgrade carpets, lockers, doors and windows has been put 
on hold until the board makes its decision. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens Principal Frances A. Riley, in a telephone interview Wednesday, 
said she does not oppose the concept of a new high school, but believes the 
board should concentrate on refurbishing and enlarging the campus before 
proceeding with new construction. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to redesign the entire campus now," she said. "We can't wait any 
longer. We are in a very crisis situation here." She said some of the campus 
buildings, including an abandoned elementary school that was opened for high 
school classes in 1971, should have been leveled long ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
18 Years of Nothing 
</P>
<P>
"We've had 18 years of not having anything done for us," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Others at the meeting who opposed a new school said that taking businesses 
would be unfair to property owners and to the city, which relies on tax 
revenue. The opponents included members of the Commerce Industrial Council and 
a spokesman for the Commerce City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Vusich, a Commerce businessman, said the two Commerce sites are not 
appropriate for a school environment. He pointed out that the site near City 
Hall is bisected by Eastern Avenue and that the site on Randolph Street is too 
close to Bell Gardens High School.

JURY SEES VIDEOTAPE OF FATAL ACCIDENT SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors in the trial of a man charged with murder for allegedly killing three 
people while driving drunk in Glendale this week viewed an emotionally 
wrenching videotape filmed minutes after the fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape, shot by an independent newsman who was at the scene of the fatal 
Christmas season crash, shows one person who died in the collision lying in the 
middle of the street, two others being taken away in an ambulance, gifts strewn 
on the pavement and the defendant, Aram Barsumyan, sitting behind the wheel of 
his mangled car. 
</P>
<P>
Barsumyan, 30, faces three counts of murder and six other felony charges in the 
Dec. 19, 1987, crash on Los Feliz Boulevard. His trial in Pasadena Superior 
Court got under way this week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Head-On Crash 
</P>
<P>
Police say Barsumyan, who was speeding, lost control of his car going over a 
drainage ditch, swerved into the opposing traffic lane and crashed head-on into 
a car carrying a family on a holiday shopping trip. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the crash were Azusa residents Francisco Cruz, 42, his wife, Olga 
Yolanda Cruz, 31, and Olga's sister, Maria Hernandez, 33, of Los Angeles. The 
couple's two children were injured in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape shown to a Pasadena Superior Court jury Tuesday was part of a 
pile of graphic evidence against Barsumyan. On Monday, jurors were shown a 
photograph of the speedometer in Barsumyan's car locked at 80 m.p.h. and 
pictures of the Cruz family's car lying on its side on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reckless Disregard' 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor in the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Barbara Murphy, said in her 
opening statement Monday that she would prove that Barsumyan was driving with 
reckless disregard for human life and that his actions fit the definition of 
malice required for a second-degree murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy told jurors that Barsumyan was convicted in 1982 of driving under the 
influence of alcohol. Judge Jack B. Tso had ruled in a pretrial hearing last 
week that the previous conviction -- for which Barsumyan was sentenced to 36 
months probation -- could be introduced into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew of the hazards of drinking and driving, but he didn't care," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Barsumyan's attorney, Theodore S. Flier, said he will make his opening 
statement after the prosecution has completed its case. 
</P>
<P>
Flier said that Barsumyan will testify in his own defense. On Monday, several 
witnesses testified that before the collision, Barsumyan was weaving through 
traffic and speeding through red and yellow traffic lights. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying for the prosecution, Onsoon An said she saw Barsumyan's car 
traveling at more than 80 m.p.h. two to three miles before the accident. An 
also testified that she saw Barsumyan's blue 1974 Oldsmobile accelerate through 
two yellow lights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says He Ran Red Light 
</P>
<P>
And Stacy Berro, a passenger in a car stopped at a red light a block before the 
accident scene, testified that he saw Barsumyan's car swerve into a 
right-turn-only lane and run the red light. 
</P>
<P>
Berro said he lost sight of the Oldsmobile as it traveled over a rise and came 
upon the accident scene moments later. 
</P>
<P>
Another witness, Thomas P. Clyde, testified that he saw Barsumyan's car hit a 
dip at the intersection of San Fernando Road and Los Feliz Boulevard about 8:25 
p.m., become airborne and hit the 1979 Ford driven by Francisco Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
In lengthy cross-examination of each of the prosecution's witnesses, Flier 
repeatedly asked if witnesses were sure of what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
Barsumyan also is charged with three counts of gross vehicular manslaughter 
while intoxicated, two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol and 
causing bodily injury and two counts of driving with an excessive blood alcohol 
level and causing bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nearly Double the Limit 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of alcohol in his blood was measured after the accident at 
0.19%, police said. California law presumes a motorist to be intoxicated at 
0.10%. 
</P>
<P>
Barsumyan is being held in Los Angeles County Jail on $500,000 bail. If 
convicted on any of the murder charges, he could be sentenced to life in 
prison.

OTTERMAN QUITS TO GET 'OUT OF LOS ANGELES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying he wants "to get out of Los Angeles," Donald H. Otterman, city manager 
of La Canada Flintridge, announced Tuesday that he will resign in June to 
become a city manager in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been with the city for eight years," said Otterman, 42, who has served as 
manager for the last five. "It's time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Whittier and a Glendale resident for 21 years, Otterman said he and his 
wife have talked for some time about moving to Oregon or Northern California to 
raise their 8-year-old twin sons. 
</P>
<P>
Otterman cited "congestion, too many people, too much smog" as his reasons for 
leaving the area. He said he began "looking earnestly" for a new position three 
to four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Otterman will leave his post June 15 to become city manager of Keizer, a 
6-year-old city in a farming community and a rapidly growing suburb outside 
Salem. His salary will be comparable to the $61,200 a year he presently earns, 
Otterman said. 
</P>
<P>
Keizer Mayor Andrew Orcutt said Otterman was selected from among 97 applicants 
as "the top choice" of a five-member candidate selection committee. Orcutt said 
committee members particularly liked Otterman's management style and noted the 
similarities between La Canada Flintridge and Keizer, which is about the same 
in size and population, as well as in political organization and development 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Orcutt said Otterman impressed him as "laid-back and relaxed. It seems as 
though he doesn't get too terribly upset at anything, yet he has a heavy enough 
hand that if problems arise, he can take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
Otterman, who is leaving a staff of 10, will take charge of 35 city employees 
in Keizer, which also has its own police department. 
</P>
<P>
As manager of a city in which two veteran conservative council members were 
ousted last year by more progressive challengers, Otterman said his job has 
become more difficult, but denied that the rivalries are a factor in his 
leaving. "We may disagree, but I respect them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he counts among his greatest accomplishments the acquisition of two 
large open-space areas in Cherry Canyon and the removal of unsightly overhead 
high-tension lines, which are buried along Foothill Boulevard and Verdugo Road. 
</P>
<P>
Issues that have raged during his tenure and still remain unsolved are what to 
do with the proposed Sport Chalet commercial development and formation of a 
redevelopment zone along the Foothill commercial strip. 
</P>
<P>
"I really did like it here," Otterman said, then added in jest, "but I still 
have two more council meetings to go through."

LATINO HIRING PLAN TO WAIT FOR A HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COMPTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council postponed a vote Tuesday on the adoption of an affirmative 
action plan to triple the number of Latinos working in city government over the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Wesley Fenderson and Councilman Maxcy Filer said that a recent U.S. 
Supreme Court ruling makes it necessary to hold a public hearing to document 
the need for an affirmative action plan before one is adopted. If a city has 
not documented the need for affirmative action via the hearing process, they 
said, a plan could be challenged later in court. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 9.7% of the city's work force of 514 is Latino, while black workers 
total 78%. The affirmative action plan was developed by members of the 
Committee on Hispanic Affairs, which is composed of city staff members and 
representatives of Compton's Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for bringing the percentage of Latino workers to 27% over the 
next five years. No date was set for a hearing.

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the 59th Assembly District are being offered free help with their 
homeowner's and renter's assistance claim forms beginning Monday through June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Rivas-Crook, field representative to Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon 
(D-Montebello), will help claimants complete their forms at three locations in 
the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
She will be available Tuesdays at the Peter F. Schabarum Senior Center, 1556 
Central Ave.; Wednesdays at the Montebello Senior Citizens Center, 115 S. 
Taylor Ave., and Thursdays at the Department of Recreation and Community 
Services, 6767 S. Passons Blvd., Pico Rivera. All times will be from 9 a.m. to

</P>
<P>
Pertinent records such as property tax bills, addresses and telephone numbers 
of landlords, and prior claim forms should be brought to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Assistance also will be available July 3 through Aug. 31 by appointment only at 
Calderon's district office, 1712 W. Beverly Blvd., Suite 210. The deadline for

tenants' rent payments. Qualified applicants must have lived in a rented 
residence for all or part of 1988, paid $50 or more per month rent, and meet 
the same low-income, age and disability restrictions.

EAGLE ROCK SET TO DEFEND GIRLS' GYMNASTICS TITLE

Although Eagle Rock High has won four consecutive girls' gymnastics 
championships, it is seeded below Cleveland in the City Section championships 
at Wilson High 7 p.m. tonight. Eagle Rock Coach Jan Freis-Martinez is unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, being seeded second is just fine, thank you. Last season, Eagle Rock 
clinched the title from the same position. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, repeating should be more difficult. Jennifer Mickschl, the 
Eagles' top gymnast, might have a stress fracture in her wrist that, 
Freis-Martinez said, will almost certainly keep her from competing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's heartbreaking," Freis-Martinez said of losing Mickschl. "We were looking 
at three nines and a high eight from her." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Bobbi Dudley should help pick up the slack. Dudley, who finished first 
in the league and seventh in the City in diving, competes at the Class 1 level 
in vault, beam and floor and Class 2 in bars. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the five years, Marshall has fielded a team. The 
Barristers, who will compete, are paced by junior Suzy Karlic.

TOUGH OPENER AHEAD FOR CRESCENTA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crescenta Valley High will open the Southern Section 5-A Division baseball 
playoffs at 3 p.m. on Friday when it travels to top-seeded Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons (13-12), who struggled early in the season, have won seven of their 
past nine games, including a 2-1 league tiebreaker victory over Hoover on 
Saturday to earn the Pacific League's third and final playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood (24-3), which won the Moore League title and is ranked No. 13 in the 
nation by USA Today, is batting .379 as a team and has an earned-run average of 
1.26. In addition, the Lancers won the Redondo Beach/Palos Verdes and Loara 
tournament championships. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Crescenta Valley Coach Tony Zarrillo is optimistic about his team's 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were a series of some kind, I'd say we were in a different situation," 
he said. "But in a one-game situation I'll take my chances against anybody. 
They're the ones that should be on pins and needles. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can pitch well and play good defense, we can be in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Scott Gleason, who was hampered by a shoulder injury early in the 
season, should start. Gleason (6-3) finished 6-0 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
History warns that Gleason had better be tough -- the Falcons' don't have much 
offensive punch. 
</P>
<P>
Hyok Chang has a team-high .369 batting average, but only one other hitter -- 
Victor Ramirez at .333 -- is hitting better than .300. Shane Cowsill is next 
best at .284. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander David Reeser (10-1), who has a 1.26 ERA, is scheduled to start for 
Lakewood. The Lancers are paced on offense by Ricardo Guiterrez (.441, 32 
RBIs), Chris Gomez (.416, 24 RBIs) and Shawn Hardy (.416, 17 RBIs, 21 steals). 
</P>
<P>
In another 5-A game: 
</P>
<P>
St. Francis (12-7-1) at Simi Valley (21-3), Friday, 3 p.m. -- St. Francis is in 
the playoffs for the first time since 1985 -- and the Golden Knights had to win 
10 of their last 13 games to make it. 
</P>
<P>
For its effort, St. Francis will get to face Marmonte League champion Simi 
Valley, the tournament's No. 3-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenge," said Tom Moran, St. Francis' first-year coach. "If we're 
going to re-establish this program, we have to be able to beat the people who 
are highly rated. I'm sure it will be a big upset if we're lucky enough to pull 
it off." 
</P>
<P>
Moran said he would decide on his starting pitcher -- either Mitch Bowen (3-2) 
or Manny Fernandez (4-1) -- today. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Knights are led offensively by catcher Gregg Zaun (.467, eight 
doubles, 19 RBIs), shortstop Mark Loretta (.420, 19 RBIs) and center fielder 
Matt Jones (.367, 16 RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
Zaun has signed to play college baseball at Texas, Loretta with Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley won the Marmonte League title for the fourth consecutive year and 
sixth time in the decade. The Pioneers have been to the playoffs 10 times in 
the past 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Mike Jenkins (8-0, 2.03 ERA) will pitch for Simi Valley, which 
also has five starters batting better than .300. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Hodgins is batting .459 and Terry Hill is hitting .434. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada (12-8) at Santa Clara (13-7), Friday, 3 p.m. -- The Spartans survived 
two rounds of the 2-A Division playoffs last season before falling to eventual 
champion Norte Vista. And La Canada might be more potent at the plate this 
season, but it lacks the pitching depth of last season. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada is batting .315 and has a 3.19 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Whisenant (5-4), a senior left-hander, is scheduled to start. Whisenant, 
an all-Rio Hondo League and Times All-Glendale selection last year, is batting 
.389 and has 16 RBIs. Bill Koury, relegated to a designated-hitter role because 
of a thigh injury, is batting .521. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Giron (.418) leads the team with 20 RBIs and Andy Learner is hitting 
.333. 
</P>
<P>
Although Santa Clara Coach John Loranzana says, "We're just an average team" 
the Saints have a knack for winning, having pulled out three league games in 
extra innings. Santa Clara was second in the Frontier League with an 8-2 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Junior shortstop Kwinn Knight, with an average of .340, is the only Saint 
batting better than .300. Junior catcher Augie Maciel is batting .288 with 16 
RBIs and sophomore center fielder Garth Teron leads the team with 22 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Rod Garza (5-1), who has a 1.32 ERA, will probably start 
for Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Church (16-5) at Ribet Academy (13-4), Friday, 3 p.m. -- The Fighting 
Frogs have no depth. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the duration of the basketball season, baseball Coach Patrick Moyal 
says, the team fielded just nine players. Shortstop Darren Hill recently broke 
his hand, so Moyal brought up Todd Trail from a physical education class. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a player," Moyal said of Trail, who will play right field. "He's just 
a guy we'll put out there. We're definitely makeshift." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Hill is significant to Ribet's bid for a Small School Division 
title -- he was batting .330. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Lee (9-6), an All-Heritage League right-hander, should start for Ribet. 
Lee also leads the team with a .419 batting average. Other offensive threats 
include Maurice Johnson (.369), Tony's brother, Mike Lee (.290), and Robert 
Harting (.280). 
</P>
<P>
Right-handed senior John Boardman (9-3), who has a 1.90 ERA, is scheduled to 
start for Christian Church.

BILL AMENDMENT AIMED AT BLOCKING LONG BEACH FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An amendment inserted into a bill on Monday by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) 
could scuttle efforts to complete the final leg of the Long Beach Freeway 
through South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
By an 18-15 vote, the Senate approved the one-paragraph amendment to prohibit 
the state from spending its funds on any state highway in Los Angeles County 
built through a historically significant site or through parks or recreation 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
It was attached to a bill by Sen Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) to increase 
the state gasoline tax by 10 cents a gallon. If the Kopp measure wins Senate 
approval, it still would require Assembly approval and the signature of Gov. 
George Deukmejian to become law. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he hopes his legislation will prompt the state Department of 
Transportation to consider alternatives, including a light-rail line, increased 
utilization of surface streets or a another freeway route. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've reached a time when expansion of freeways is not the only 
answer, especially if it destroys communities," Torres said in an interview 
Tuesday. He voiced optimism that his prohibition will remain in the bill as it 
goes through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meridian Variation 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is finishing an environmental impact study on a route that would 
follow Meridian Avenue in South Pasadena, although veering around some historic 
homes in the northern part of the city. The route, known as the Meridian 
Variation, would be 6.2 miles long and cost about $425 million to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Torres predicted that his proposal would place the Meridian Variation and the 
so-called Westerly Route, previously rejected by Caltrans as too costly and 
destructive, "in the freezer." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's Senate action is the latest twist in what has turned into a nearly 
30-year search for the "missing link" to complete the freeway. The dispute has 
pitted neighborhood against neighborhood and politician against politician. 
</P>
<P>
The Torres amendment already has rekindled the controversy in the capital, 
where it immediately was assailed by Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poor Precedent 
</P>
<P>
Jim Drago, a Caltrans spokesman, said his agency opposes the Torres amendment 
because the prohibition would set a poor precedent for the rest of the state. 
"It has the potential to stop any major highway project in the state because it 
would be common for a route to go through an area with a historic building or 
resource," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Just two months ago, Torres decided not to introduce legislation that would 
have permitted Caltrans to build part of the freeway in the Arroyo Seco, the 
dry riverbed stretching from Devil's Gate Dam to downtown Los Angeles and 
skirting South Pasadena's western edge. That legislation was going to be the 
centerpiece in the city's attempts to stop Caltrans from completing the freeway 
through the middle of South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, whose district includes South Pasadena, said that at that point it 
became clear to him "that no route was going to be acceptable in terms of the 
destruction it would lead to," prompting him to propose his amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The Torres amendment was opposed on the Senate floor by Sen. Newton R. Russell 
(R-Glendale), who said that his constituents in Pasadena support the proposed 
freeway because it would funnel traffic off their streets. In an interview, 
Russell said he objected to the amendment because its purpose is "to stop the 
freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Terry James, Alhambra public works director, said he has not seen the amendment 
but also objects to it. "We're opposed because we want the Long Beach Freeway 
completed" as a way to remove tremendous amounts of traffic congestion from 
city streets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ralph Ochoa, a Sacramento lobbyist retained by South Pasadena, said his 
clients are delighted by the latest developments in the freeway fight. He said 
Torres' proposal would force Caltrans "to look for another alternative, and 
that's precisely what we want them to do."

make a beautiful diving catch of a sure home run? 
</P>
<P>
Of course not. Nobody could imagine that. Least of all Mike Bonetto, but that's 
precisely what happened two weeks ago in his bid to tie the Occidental record 
for home runs in a season. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy started running over, flailed his glove out and made the catch," said 
Bonetto, a freshman who finished the season with 10 home runs -- one shy of the 
record. "Caltech plays on an open field and they play so deep you can never 
tell." 
</P>
<P>
Even the fenced confines of the Occidental field betrayed Bonetto. 
</P>
<P>
The next day -- again versus Caltech -- he drilled a shot to right. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit it and I just started walking," he said. "I wanted it to go so badly." 
</P>
<P>
The ball was about two feet short and caromed off the fence, turning Bonetto's 
saunter into a sprint to salvage a single. It proved to be Bonetto's last 
at-bat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dying," he said. "I guess it wasn't meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
Out, not down: By virtue of their identical records in Pacific League play, 
Hoover and Crescenta Valley high schools had to play a tiebreaker Saturday to 
determine which team would be awarded the league's third and final berth in the 
Southern Section 5-A Division baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley won, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
That means this season will mark only the third time in Bob Cooper's 12-year 
term as Hoover coach that the Tornadoes did not make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper was philosophical about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, you're going to feel dejected unless you go the whole way," said 
Cooper, who coached Elsinore High to the Southern Section 1-A championship in 
1970. "There's only going to be a few coaches feeling happy as hell and the 
rest of them are going to be dejected." 
</P>
<P>
Dynamic duo: Jung Lee and Eric Chu, Glendale's No. 1 boys' doubles team, 
knocked off the top-seeded and previously unbeaten team from Garden Grove, 
18-17, 10-15, 15-10, in the first round of the Southern Section badminton 
playoffs last Saturday at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in six years, a Glendale boys' team will compete in the 
semifinals, to be held Friday at Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Lee and Chu had an inauspicious start, however. First, they were listed as the 
No. 1 team from Glendora -- a significantly weaker team -- on the draw sheet. 
Next, they fell behind, 12-1, in the first game against Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Coach Pat Rogerson says the performance of Lee and Chu, who were not 
seeded, came as no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a fluke," she said. "They are honestly a championship-quality 
doubles team and the only reason they were not seeded was that we had not 
gotten them into tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
There was no denying the fact that Glendale twins Angela and Christian 
Armendariz deserved the top seeding in the girls' doubles division. The twins, 
the 1989 national 18-and-under doubles champions, are attempting to win an 
unprecedented fourth Southern Section title. 
</P>
<P>
They advanced to the semifinals by defeating teams from El Monte, 15-1, 15-1; 
Long Beach Jordan, 15-1, 15-1; and Buena Park 15-2, 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
"They are truly exceptional athletes," Rogerson said of the twins. "When they 
get into any trouble they are able to pull themselves together and have what it 
takes athletically to come through. They have that champion drive." 
</P>
<P>
Flying high: After throwing a personal-record 208 feet, 5 inches in the 
Southern California junior college prelims two weeks ago, Glendale College's 
Steve Barnett dropped off slightly Saturday and finished fourth at 203-8 in the 
championships at Cerritos College. Barnett did, however, qualify for the state 
finals this weekend at Fresno City College. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Doering of Riverside won the title with a meet-record throw of 219-5. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Myers, also of Glendale, finished second in the women's discus (131-1) 
and javelin (128-10). Teammate Marji Gilles placed third in javelin (127-2). 
Both Myers and Gilles qualified for the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale women's team finished sixth in overall standings with 37 points 
behind El Camino (141), Mt. San Antonio (80), San Diego Mesa (59), Bakersfield 
(45), and Riverside (38). 
</P>
<P>
On track: Sixteen men and women will represent Occidental in the NCAA Division 
III track championships in Naperville, Ill., next week. 
</P>
<P>
Competing in the men's division will be: Jeff Sundquist (100 meters, 200, 4 x 
100 relay); Lionel Shaw (800, 1,500); Chris Tregillis (800); Emmet Hogan 
(5,000); Jeff Bedell (decathlon); Ron Cunningham (100, 4 x 100); Alan Loveless 
(4 x 100); and Ben White (long jump, triple jump and 4 x 100). 
</P>
<P>
Competing in the women's division will be: Glenda Mitchell (400, 400 hurdles 
and heptathlon); Heather Beach (triple jump); Michele Trimble (1,500, 3,000 and 
5,000); Jenny Lawrence (heptathlon); Louise Coulter (shotput and discus); and 
other 4 x 100 relay members Tricia Heine, Shannon Haack and Nancy McKrell.

SAME PLAY, SAME CAST, SAME FIGHT IN BURBANK; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS SAY '89 'GREASE' JUST AS DIRTY AS IN '81 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank school officials still think "Grease" is a little too dirty. 
</P>
<P>
And so they and some former students have resumed a dispute that began eight 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Alumni of John Burroughs High School in Burbank, who are scheduled to perform 
the popular musical "Grease" this weekend and next weekend at the school, have 
been ordered by district administrators to clean up their act. 
</P>
<P>
The cast has been told to eliminate "suggestive dancing, pelvic thrusts" and 
sexual references, and to tone down certain lyrics and phrases. 
</P>
<P>
But in the spirit of the rebellious 1950s youths that the play celebrates, the 
adult cast and crew members have said, "NO WAY, MAN!" and have threatened to 
bow out if the restrictions aren't lifted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We're Adults' 
</P>
<P>
"This show is so tame, there's no call for this," said Danny Elias, 26, the 
show's stage manager. "There are no four-letter words in the show. There's 
nothing dirty about it, and besides, we're adults. We've worked too hard on the 
show for this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Darla Dargenzio, who plays the virginal Sandy, said, "Most of the audiences 
today should be able to handle a little bump and grind. It's all done in 
playful good taste." 
</P>
<P>
Elias said the restrictions were particularly insulting because most of the 
alumni cast performed "Grease" when they were students at the high school in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened then. 
</P>
<P>
After that production played one weekend, district officials ordered that the 
show be cleaned up before performances the following week. The cast and crew 
made the changes -- until the last performance, when they did it their way. 
</P>
<P>
James Perino, deputy superintendent of instruction for the Burbank Unified 
School District, said "Grease" will not go on if the cast fails to tone down 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not trying to detract from the show," Perino said. "It's the 
responsibility of the school district to put something on our stage that we as 
community leaders feel is appropriate for general audiences." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lies on Ground 
</P>
<P>
The administrators objected to a part in the song "Summer Nights" in which a 
teen-age boy lies on the ground and thrusts his pelvis in the air while singing 
about a date he had with a girl. They also objected to another dance number, 
"We Go Together," in which a boy grabs a girl's breasts as she looks at the 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
Perino also objected to joking references to a "gang-bang" -- a 1950s sexual 
term -- as well as one scene in which a girl lies on top of a boy in a park. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone would have to go a great deal to convince me that 'gang-bang' and a 
girl lying on top of a boy is appropriate behavior for a general audience to 
see," Perino said. 
</P>
<P>
The musical comedy, which chronicles the antics of several teen-agers, ranging 
from leather-jacketed toughs to "nice girls," opened in New York in 1972 and 
was one of the longest-running shows in Broadway history. The show helped fan a 
wave of '50s nostalgia during the 1970s, and was made into a hit PG-rated movie 
starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. 
</P>
<P>
The play is being performed by two different casts -- alumni and students -- 
who will put on a joint performance Friday night as a benefit for a fund 
established in memory of the play's co-writer, Warren Casey, who died in 
November of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Anderson, 22, who is supervising the alumni production, said that last 
year he had discussed a reunion show to benefit the ailing Casey with the 
play's other creator, Jim Jacobs. He said Jacobs was excited about the idea and 
gave his blessing. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the reunion would have more meaning if students performed the 
same show, and arranged with the faculty to present a joint production. 
</P>
<P>
The current Burroughs students performed a toned-down version of "Grease" last 
weekend and are scheduled to perform again at a Saturday matinee. The alumni 
cast is next scheduled to perform "Grease" on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Perino said he met with Buchanan and the student cast Tuesday to express 
concerns about the show. Although the show's director, drama instructor Larry 
Naschel, had been told to modify the scenes, students still performed some of 
the forbidden lines and actions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make sure that they understood about the changes," he said. "Some 
of the changes were communicated and some were not. We wanted to remind the 
students that adjustments in body behavior needed to be made, and words and 
phrases changed. I'm not sure they agreed to the changes, but they agreed to 
adhere to them." 
</P>
<P>
Roman Antolie, a senior at Burroughs, said he performed the pelvic thrust 
during the "Summer Nights" number last weekend, even though he had been told 
not to. "It just went with my character," he said. "I felt very secure about 
doing it." 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the students, Perino informed Anderson that the restrictions 
imposed on the student performance would apply to the alumni version too. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who also plays the lead role of tough Danny Zuko, protested. "Either 
you do 'Grease' the way it was written or you don't. 'Grease' is 'Grease' and 
'Hair' is 'Hair,' " he said, referring to another controversial youth musical. 
"This is not 'The Sound of Music.' " 
</P>
<P>
He added that it was unreasonable of school officials to edit the show just a 
few days before the first performance. 
</P>
<P>
But the district may have the last word since the stage is on school property, 
and the play is being underwritten by $9,000 in student-body funds for props, 
sets and costumes, Perino said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is being promoted solely through the schools, and we want to make sure 
there is not something on stage that will offend students or teachers," he 
said.

ATTENDANCE SLIPS AS SCHOOLS SETTLE INTO STRIKE ROUTINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The usual excuse for being late to third-period classes at San Fernando High 
School -- long food lines during the mid-morning snack break -- fooled no one 
Wednesday. With fewer than 15% of the school's 2,100 students left on campus by 
the time the 10 a.m. break rolled around, the usual jockeying for food was over 
in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's ever late anymore," said one student, stretched out on a bench in an 
area that on a non-strike day would have been mobbed with students, all wanting 
for a seat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Howard the Duck' 
</P>
<P>
After the snack break, janitors picked up the few random food wrappers in a 
matter of seconds and went back to tending flower beds. In the cafeteria, 
students watched a videotape of the George Lucas movie "Howard the Duck," a 
fantasy tale about a talking duck from another planet that students joked was 
"biology class." In the school's library -- normally abuzz with studying -- one 
table of students played the popular game Pictionary while others played chess. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better because it's not that crowded, but it's boring because there's no 
teachers here," said Layla Gonzales, 16, a junior playing the board game with 
four friends in the library. 
</P>
<P>
The deserted atmosphere was typical Wednesday at many of the San Fernando 
Valley's high schools on the third day of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District teacher strike. A school district spokesman said districtwide 
attendance dropped from Tuesday to Wednesday by nearly 37,000 students to 
288,000 students out of a pre-strike enrollment of about 590,000. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance reported at Valley high schools had ranged earlier in the week from 
a low of about 29% at San Fernando to a high of 49% at Taft High School in 
Woodland Hills. School-by-school attendance figures for Wednesday were not 
available but officials said the numbers had plunged. In addition, many 
students stayed for only the first two periods of the day, until their presence 
was officially recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the attendance will drop and drop," said Bart Kricorian, the principal 
at San Fernando High. "Students start leaving school as they see that their 
teachers aren't here, even though we have others for them to go to." 
</P>
<P>
Kricorian said there were 750 students in school as of the second period, from 
9 a.m. to 10 a.m., when attendance is officially recorded. But by third period 
he estimated that only 250 remained. 
</P>
<P>
That meant that halls were dark and deserted, echoing with a visitor's 
footsteps, classroom doors were locked and chairs remained upended on tables. 
Most of the few classes that were under way had but a handful of students. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at Chatsworth High School was 925 out of an enrollment of about 
2,900. "We've tried to come up with . . . a school-within-a-school for the 
seniors," said Principal Donna B. Smith. "It doesn't meet all of their needs, 
but it is some kind of program." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, she said, many students were not staying until the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Rosen, an assistant principal at Grant High School in Van Nuys, said some 
classes there had as few as five students. "That's really individualized 
instruction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at Grant dropped to about 800 Wednesday, with 35 regular and 
substitute teachers staffing classrooms, instead of the usual 132 teachers for 
3,200 students. "We've gotten into a routine," said Grant Principal Robert 
Collins. "The school's into a routine and the pickets are into a routine. The 
real action is downtown." 
</P>
<P>
In some classes at Grant, instruction was taking place and students were taking 
notes. A basic math class with seven students was learning about polygons. A 
more advanced math class that also had seven students listened as a ponytailed, 
fatigue-jacketed substitute teacher named Steve lectured on graphing algebraic 
equations. 
</P>
<P>
A chemistry teacher, who asked not to be identified because she had crossed her 
colleagues' picket line, plunged ahead, assigning homework, telling students 
who had missed classes earlier in the week what they had to do to catch up. But 
in some classes students listened to audiotapes, horsed around with a foam 
rubber ball or slept. 
</P>
<P>
"This school is practically closed," said physical education teacher Melva 
Heinsohn, as she walked the picket line in front of Grant and gazed in at a 
school nearly empty of students. "We're so close on all of the issues, it's too 
bad they can't settle it."

CHURCH WINS COUNCIL OK TO BUILD SANCTUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Mandarin Baptist Church of Northridge received Los Angeles City 
Council approval Tuesday to build a $1.2-million sanctuary and auditorium, a 
project that had been opposed by neighbors who fear increased traffic through 
their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce the impact on the neighborhood of predominantly single-family homes, 
the church was required to build a 131-car parking lot, construct a wall around 
the development, install lush landscaping and end all functions by 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Residents had complainted that their neighborhood is already burdened by 
traffic from nearby Cal State Northridge. The council unanimously approved the 
permit to build on the site at 17833 Nordhoff St.

DRIVER ARRESTED AFTER GRANADA HILLS COLLISION KILLS 1, INJURES 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster man, who police said may have been drinking, was arrested on 
suspicion of second-degree murder after a collision in Granada Hills on 
Wednesday that killed a woman and injured three other people. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, a Santa Clarita Valley resident about 35 years old, was pronounced 
dead at the scene of the accident, which occurred about 1:55 p.m. at the 
intersection of Balboa Boulevard and Jolette Avenue, Los Angeles Fire 
Department spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
He said her name could not be released until relatives had been notified. 
</P>
<P>
A 35-year-old man and his 34-year-old wife, who were in the van, were in fair 
condition at Northridge Hospital Medical Center in Northridge, hospital 
spokeswoman Leslie Wither said. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Wayne Hardy, 22, who sustained multiple injuries. He was in 
stable condition at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy was driving south on Balboa in a small pickup truck when he crossed 
traffic lanes and hit the van, which was facing north and waiting to make a 
left turn from Balboa onto Jolette. The van spun and collided with the second 
pickup, killing the driver, said Los Angeles police Detective Richard Ranck. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Hardy was traveling above the 45-m.p.h. speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
Officers detected alcohol on Hardy's breath, and a test was taken to determine 
his blood- alcohol content, Ranck said. The results will not be known for 
several days, he said.

PROSECUTOR SAYS MOTHER ACTED LIKE DRUG DEALER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Topanga Canyon woman charged with hiding cocaine in the backpack of her 
7-year-old daughter, who carried the drug to school, was "not concerned for her 
child, but of getting rid of the evidence," a prosecutor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Christina Torres, 40, acted like a drug dealer and not like a mother when 
she went to the school to retrieve the cocaine, Deputy Dist. Atty. Tracy Watson 
said in her closing argument of the two-week-long trial in Van Nuys Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendant was not concerned for her child, but of getting rid of the 
evidence," Watson told the jury. "Her actions were that of a drug dealer." 
</P>
<P>
Torres, a Colombian citizen, is charged with child endangerment and possession 
of cocaine for sale. If convicted, she could be sentenced to seven years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Children Tasted It 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to Canoga Park Lutheran School on June 13 after Torres' 
daughter and eight other students told their teachers that they had tasted the 
powdery substance out of curiosity. The youngsters were taken to a hospital 
after the substance was found to be cocaine. All were released in good health. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Torres went to the school after lunch to retrieve the cocaine, 
which she said she later flushed down a toilet. But Watson told the jury that 
Torres never told teachers that the substance was cocaine, thereby endangering 
all the children. 
</P>
<P>
Torres was arrested that same afternoon when she came to the school to pick up 
her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant has testified that the cocaine was placed in the child's book bag 
by Denny Meyers, a longtime friend, after she left the backpack in a car she 
loaned to Meyers. 
</P>
<P>
Torres testified that Meyers was in Kansas. Watson has said that even if 
authorities could locate Meyers she could not force him to testify because of 
his "rights against self-incrimination."

1 KILLED, 3 INJURED AS TRUCK OVERTURNS, BURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large truck flipped, burst into flames and rolled into a pickup truck on a 
freeway off-ramp in Thousand Oaks, killing the larger truck's driver and 
injuring three others, the Ventura County Fire Department reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old man was in critical condition at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital 
with third-degree burns over more than 70% of his body after the 6 p.m. 
accident, authorities said. A paramedic who happened to be near the scene saw 
the man running with his clothes afire and put out the flames with a fire 
extinguisher, Ventura County Fire Department dispatcher Liz Pickles said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known if the man was in one of the trucks, another vehicle, or was 
walking in the area of the accident, which took place on the Moorpark Road exit 
from the westbound Ventura Freeway, Pickles said. 
</P>
<P>
A 34-year-old man was taken to Westlake Medical Center with extensive leg and 
head injuries after being trapped in the pickup, which was crushed by the 
larger truck. 
</P>
<P>
An 8-year-old girl who was also in the pickup escaped through a window and was 
treated at the hospital for first-degree burns and minor injuries, Pickles 
said.

L.A. TESTS FIND NO RADIOACTIVE POLLUTION IN CITY WATER WELLS 
</P>

Radioactivity levels in water from city wells in the San Fernando Valley were 
five times below state drinking water standards in recent tests, indicating 
there has been no radioactive pollution of the water supply, Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of contamination at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, run by the 
Rocketdyne division of Rockwell International in eastern Ventura County, 
prompted Mayor Tom Bradley to ask the DWP to investigate possible pollution in 
the northwest San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
With the Rocketdyne lab more than 15 miles from the nearest city water well in 
North Hollywood, it would take "many hundreds of years" for contaminants from 
the lab to reach the wells, said Bruce Kuebler, DWP engineer in charge of water 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
In disclosing the recent test results, DWP spokesman Ed Freudenberg said water 
officials "are obviously concerned that people will think there's a connection 
between a potential problem out in the Santa Susana area and . . . our water 
supply." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley asked the DWP to conduct an investigation of ground water in the 
Chatsworth area in response to news accounts of a U.S. Department of Energy 
report on contamination at the Rocketdyne lab. Water officials said they will 
provide their report to the mayor by May 24. 
</P>
<P>
Kuebler said the DWP is testing all its wells for radioactivity on a quarterly 
basis this year, in compliance with state drinking water regulations. "If any 
changes in the very low natural radioactivity levels occur, we certainly would 
be aware of those changes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 15% of the Los Angeles water supply is drawn from wells in North 
Hollywood and near Griffith Park.

LATINO ACTIVIST TOVAR BACKS BERNARDI IN COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latino activist Irene Tovar endorsed Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi Wednesday for the June 6 runoff election, saying he had proven his 
dedication to the northeast San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect people who show their interest in the community by being involved," 
Tovar said at a news conference outside the Pacoima Community Center. "I don't 
think you can just come out of the clear blue." 
</P>
<P>
She said she did not believe that Lyle Hall, Bernardi's opponent and a city 
fire captain and former firefighters union president, had been involved enough 
in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, in an interview, defended his record in the community, particularly with 
respect to the labor movement and various anti-graffiti and business leader 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always tried to be active and involved in community affairs, because I 
think that is important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tovar was one of six candidates who ran against Bernardi in the April 11 
primary. She came in fourth with 10% of the vote. She said she waited so long 
to announce her endorsement not because of uncertainty about Bernardi, but 
because she had surgery shortly after the primary. 
</P>
<P>
Tovar acknowledged that Bernardi's decision to make this his last term played a 
role in her endorsement. She said she would consider running again in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Many Latino leaders believe a Latino candidate would have a better chance in 
1993 if Bernardi wins now and then steps down, than if Hall wins and runs 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he has made no commitments to endorse anyone when he leaves 
office. "Four years from now is a long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 7th District, as reapportioned in 1986, is more than half Latino. Both 
Bernardi and Hall have wooed Latino supporters during the runoff campaign. 
Several prominent Latinos, including state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), 
have supported Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing a group of 18 Latino leaders who endorsed Bernardi in April, Tovar 
applauded the councilman's efforts to supply more police to the area and his 
work against gangs, drugs, graffiti and the proliferation of liquor stores.

MURDOCH JOINS SPAIN INVESTORS IN TV VENTURE

<P>
Media magnate Rupert Murdoch has teamed up with Spanish investors to launch a 
private television channel that may eventually beam programs to 
Spanish-speaking audiences in the United States and South America. 
</P>
<P>
Univision Canal Uno will be owned 25% by Grupo Zeta, the leading newspaper and 
magazine publisher, and 25% by Murdoch's News International PLC, Zeta Chairman 
Antonio Asensio told reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Asensio said Univision will have initial capital of $120 million and will 
finance an array of films, sports, documentaries and news programs from 
advertising revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"In the future we hope to broadcast to Spanish-speaking audiences in the 
Americas using Murdoch's satellites," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is Murdoch's second joint television venture in as many days. On 
Tuesday, Murdoch's Sky Television satellite network joined with Robert 
Maxwell's Cable TV network to take its four-channel Sky programs into 50,000 
more British homes. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch made a last-minute entry into the Spanish broadcasting fray against 
Italian media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi and French pay television channel 
Canal-Plus. Both have separately joined Spanish investors to bid for three 
private TV franchises. 
</P>
<P>
Five consortiums have bid for the three national television franchises that the 
Spanish government has put on the block. Madrid has until mid-August to choose 
the winners. 
</P>
<P>
Television broadcasting is limited to two nationwide state channels and five 
regional stations, controlled by local governments. 
</P>
<P>
Barcelona-based Grupo Zeta, publishing dailies and sensationalist magazines 
such as best-selling weeklies Interviu and Tiempo, will be Murdoch's main 
Spanish partner. Asensio said Zeta chose Murdoch over Tele-France 1, a leading 
French private television channel that offered to present a joint bid with the 
Spanish group. 
</P>
<P>
Other leading investors include Madrid-based financier Jacques Hachuel, with 
10%, and two leading Spanish banks, Banco Central and Banco Espanol de Credito. 
Under controversial rules drawn up by Madrid, no single investor, Spanish or 
foreign, can own more than 25% of a private channel.

No Results From Gibraltar Financial: The Beverly Hills-based parent of 
Gibraltar Savings said that it is not able to release its financial results for 
the quarter ended March 31 and that it cannot predict when, if ever, it will 
have enough information to allow it to prepare financial statements that fairly 
represent the company's condition. Gibraltar Savings has been placed in 
conservatorship by federal regulators, and Gibraltar Financial said its access 
to information has been severely restricted as a result.

Safeway to Pay Fine: Safeway Stores has agreed to pay Santa Clara and Monterey 
counties a total of $66,500 in civil penalties for selling items that weighed 
less than labels indicated, prosecutors reported. Santa Clara County Deputy 
District Attorney Eugene Baldwin said the huge chain overcharged customers at 
many of its central coast and San Francisco Bay Area markets for meat, bakery 
and delicatessen items over a period of two years.

U.S. OPPOSES AIR RESERVATION SYSTEM MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Transportation said Wednesday that it objects to the proposed 
merger of the computerized reservations systems owned by American Airlines and 
Delta Air Lines unless it is changed to make sure that it does not diminish 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposed transaction now before you has the potential to adversely affect 
competition in the CRS industry and the airline industry," Transportation 
Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said. His comments were contained in a letter to 
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
When the merger plan was announced in February, intense scrutiny by the 
Department of Justice was anticipated. Until the first of this year, the 
Department of Transportation had the responsibility of approving or denying 
mergers in the U.S. airline industry. That responsibility has since shifted to 
Justice, so Skinner's opinion is advisory, not binding. 
</P>
<P>
"While we do not believe that competition in the CRS market is threatened so 
seriously that the transaction should be challenged on that basis, we do 
believe the transaction as currently structured poses a substantial likelihood 
of producing an adverse effect on airline competition," Skinner wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The carriers had hoped to close the deal this month but now say that it cannot 
be completed until sometime this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner said the transaction should be "challenged unless it is modified to 
include at least one additional airline owner." He also said the merged 
reservations system should be managed and marketed independently of the two 
airlines. When the airlines announced the deal, they said the new company would 
have its own management and marketing personnel. 
</P>
<P>
If the merger is approved, it would create a huge system that would handle 
about half of the nation's airline reservations. In the deregulated airline 
industry, a strong computer reservations system is a major ingredient in a 
carrier's success. 
</P>
<P>
The only U.S. carriers that do not own all or part of a reservations system are 
Alaska Airlines, Southwest Airlines, America West Airlines and Pan American 
World Airways. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas-based American's present Sabre system is already the nation's largest, 
with computer locations at about 14,000, or 42%, of the nation's 33,000 travel 
agents. Delta, which is headquartered in Atlanta, is a much smaller participant 
with only about 9% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the two carriers propose that each will own half of the new company. 
Each airline will contribute its reservation system to form the partnership. 
Since the American system is so much larger than Delta's, which is known as 
Datas II, Delta will pay American $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
The two carriers said they would offer half of the new company for sale and 
that Delta and American would ultimately each own 25%. The rest would be sold 
to other domestic and foreign carriers as well as to non-airline companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential Partners Scarce 
</P>
<P>
The airlines said originally that other carriers would be allowed to purchase 
shares of 10% or less in the new system for $20 million per percentage point. 
Perhaps because there have been no buyers, the price for the first 20% sold has 
been cut to $15 million for each percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Plickert, an airline analyst with the Transportation Group, an affiliate 
of the New York investment firm of Paine Webber, said it looks as if other 
potential partners are scarce. "I presume that the secretary is not suggesting 
that American and Delta give away a piece of the system for nothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Delta spokesman, Jim Lundy, said late Wednesday that Skinner's concerns have 
already been addressed. "We are in serious negotiations with several potential 
buyers," Lundy said. "We feel that in a short time we will be able to announce 
the new owners." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Skinner's comments, American said it does not view them as opposition 
to the merger. The carrier said it "is gratified that the Department of 
Transportation has concluded that American's proposed computer reservation 
system partnership with Delta Air Lines will not threaten competition in the 
CRS market and that the joint venture should not be challenged on that basis." 
</P>
<P>
However, it added: "American disagrees with DOT's analysis of the possible 
effect on air transportation. . . . Secretary Skinner's proposed cure for this 
perceived problem is the same one that American and Delta have proposed and are 
actively pursuing."

Air Route Talks Fail: The bid to expand air links between the United States and 
Japan failed after Tokyo halved a proposal that Washington had found inadequate 
five months ago, a U.S. negotiator said. In December, Washington proposed 16 
new services for Japanese carriers and 13 new services for U.S. carriers, while 
Japan countered with 10 new lines for Japanese carriers and six for U.S. 
carriers. The United States had hoped the two countries would reach a 
compromise, the official said. But the new Japanese proposal was for five new 
Japanese services and three new U.S. services.

UNIONS: CHARGE OF BRAINWASHING;

EASTERN UNIONS BRAINWASHING, LORENZO SAYS

Eastern Airlines boss Frank Lorenzo has accused the carrier's striking unions 
of brainwashing members and has asked psychiatrists to study the materials sent 
by strike leaders to the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech last Friday to students at Stanford University's business school, 
Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., said the psychiatrists 
met in Washington to examine the union literature. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air spokesman Art Kent said the company had no immediate comment on 
Lorenzo's remarks. An account of Lorenzo's speech in Palo Alto was released by 
the business school. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people here (in the unions) who have been totally, completely 
brainwashed," said Lorenzo, as quoted by a Stanford news release. 
</P>
<P>
"We have, in fact, a meeting going on today in Washington, D.C., by a bunch of 
psychiatrists and psychoanalysts who are going through the propaganda materials 
that these people are being sent. And this is brainwashing in the style of the 
'40s. 
</P>
<P>
"What is being put into their heads gets them excited about giving up their 
jobs and giving up their careers." 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear from Lorenzo's remarks whether he had hired the psychiatrists 
and, if so, how much he was paying them. It also was unclear how he intended to 
use their analysis of the union materials. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Ashby, a spokesman in New York for the Eastern pilots' union, called 
Lorenzo's remarks "a continuation of his desperation tactics." 
</P>
<P>
"We would suggest that Mr. Lorenzo sit down with these people (the 
psychiatrists) and find out what his own problems are," he said. "We're very 
sane people; we're very serious about what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Since March 4, pilots and flight attendants at Miami-based Eastern have 
supported a strike by the airline's machinists' union. Lorenzo put Eastern into 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection March 9. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters threw eggs in Lorenzo's direction before he entered the auditorium 
to make his one-hour speech and called him "Hitler" and "greedy bastard" when 
he left, the business school's news release said. It also said the 200 or so 
protesters included pilots and machinists.

CANDOR ON ISSUES NOTED AT JAPAN-U.S. CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 20th Japan-American Conference, an event usually marked by deferential talk 
among politicians and businessmen on economic issues, ended Wednesday after 
three days of what participants called "unusually frank" debates on sensitive 
topics ranging from politics and the environment to race and culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen an increase in the candor of the discussions of a serious nature 
at this conference over the last several sessions," Mayor Tom Bradley observed 
in a speech before the closing session. "I, for one, am very pleased about it, 
and very proud that we see this emerging determination by our delegates to 
really come to grips with some of the critical issues that confront us." 
</P>
<P>
The Japan-American Conference of Mayors and Chamber of Commerce Presidents, 
which has been alternately hosted by Japan and the United States every other 
year since 1951, has long been an important forum for addressing issues 
affecting the two countries. But it was not until the mid-1980s, as Japan 
skyrocketed in economic stature and political influence, that delegates from 
the two nations began to frankly air their differences over sensitive economic 
issues such as trade barriers, business practices and domestic budget deficits, 
conference regulars said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, with a record 349 conference delegates on hand and with Gov. George 
Deukmejian becoming the first California governor to attend the event, the 
discussions grew even more candid and wide ranging. Japanese and U.S. leaders 
touched on everything from AIDS and drug abuse to racism and national security. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to come to grips with the critical issues that confront us," beyond 
the issues of trade imbalances, said John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp. "We 
have to talk about the environment . . . we have a common interest in the 
global economy . . . helping the developing world," said Reed, echoing similar 
comments by other Japanese and American speakers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Common Interests 
</P>
<P>
Added Seizaburo Sato, a political science professor at the University of Tokyo: 
"The common interests between the U.S. and Japan are many. . . . For example, 
the (military) security interest . . . countering the threat of the Soviet 
Union." Sato also said the United States and Japan "should do their best to 
solve the issues of AIDS and drugs" by using their scientific and political 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
Although no economic or political policy measures are implemented by delegates, 
the Japan-American conference is considered extremely influential on the 
business, political and economic relations between the two nations, 
particularly at the local and regional level, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
James Day Hodgson, former U.S. ambassador to Japan, summed up the sentiment of 
several participants when he noted that conferences inevitably end on 
"expressions of good will." But what is really needed, he said, "is to start on 
(solving) specifics."

The Sierra Lodge motel, next door to the Grand, rents rooms furnished with 
king-size beds for as little as $32.95 per night. Instead of a marble lobby, 
you'll have to settle for inexpensive mobile home-style paneling and a faux 
brick motif. But your king-size bed may feature a fancy red Naugahyde headboard 
and your walls come complete with framed posters of Yosemite, the Grand Canyon 
and other scenic wonders. 
</P>
<P>
A household of two requiring only one bed will pay $34.95 per night (about 
$1,083 a month before tax) plus a $3 key deposit and a $20 phone deposit (both 
refundable). Your monthly total comes to $1,061.45 before tax -- slightly more 
than for a one-bedroom place next door at the Grand -- and you don't get a 
kitchen. But utilities and color TV are thrown in free, you don't have to show 
that you make more than $3,000 a month and, best of all, you can pay your rent 
with a credit card. PAT DOUGHERTY

'IT'S TIME FOR PIANO LESSONS,' ADULTS TELL THEMSELVES

They will admit, many of them, that their mothers were right: They never should 
have quit taking piano. 
</P>
<P>
So here at the Steinway dealer, they sit before electronic keyboards, hands 
poised, eyes glued to their music books. 
</P>
<P>
At the teacher's signal, the pupils begin to play a short tune with their right 
hands. Out come a few clunker notes and nervous giggles. But instructor Debbie 
Adams reminds her pupils of the class rules: Be proud of your mistakes, and 
forgive yourself immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Whether in a group or in private lessons, whether in their 30s or their 80s, 
more and more adults in the United States are limbering up their fingers. Many 
of them were childhood students of piano, teachers say. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Walker, a 39-year-old businessman in Adams' class, studied piano as a 
youngster, "until I discovered sports and girls." Taking up the instrument 
again "has been something I've wanted to do for a long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For working people, playing the piano may be a relaxing finish to a busy day. 
"People don't want to sit in front of a TV set, especially if they've been in 
front of a computer terminal all day," said Adams. She lists doctors, lawyers, 
a psychologist and a film producer among her adult students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Methods Changing 
</P>
<P>
With the influx of adults, some piano teachers have begun to change their 
teaching styles. More and more, "piano books don't have animal pictures on 
them," said Brenda Dillon, project administrator of the National Piano 
Foundation. Adults have goals different from children, she said. An adult may 
only want to learn a specific song, Christmas carols or hymns for Sunday 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Adults tend to be highly critical of their playing. "Their oral capacities are 
so far ahead of their physical capacities," said Calvin Herst, director of 
education at the Community Music Center in Boston. "And that becomes 
frustrating for them." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's good to start with group lessons, where adults "can see that 
other people have the same problems they do and that they're not dumb, after 
all," Herst said. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that more adults are taking piano lessons can be linked to the growing 
number of retirees. According to the foundation, the average American will 
spend 23% of his or her life in retirement, compared with 7% in 1940. More 
leisure time and more discretionary spending have made piano study "the 
possible dream," said Dillon. The foundation has produced a video with that 
title to alert piano teachers to this growing market. 
</P>
<P>
Rosetta Quimby, 74, began private lessons in her 60s, but then dropped them. 
She has begun enjoying piano again, only this time in a group setting. "You get 
acquainted with some nice people," she said, mentioning a fellow pupil named 
Frank, who is in his 80s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keyboards Help 
</P>
<P>
Quimby said she has a piano at home but also enjoys the electronic pianos in 
class, which feel and sound remarkably like acoustic pianos. 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of electronic keyboards has prompted people to learn piano, 
said Christine Hermanson, director of the Fine Arts Academy in Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"They are deciding to try music because they don't have to make such a large 
investment," Hermanson said. Rather than buying a piano for thousands of 
dollars, one can purchase a basic portable keyboard for a couple of hundred. 
</P>
<P>
But the kind of instrument one ends up playing depends on one's goals, said Tom 
Long, director of music education at Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ Co. An expensive 
home organ with "lots of bells and whistles" is usually considered 
"entertainment" and played just for fun, he said. Portable keyboards are often 
impulse buys, giving one the "instant gratification" of being able to create 
sophisticated, magical sounds. 
</P>
<P>
An acoustic piano, however, "is still perceived as real music," a serious 
instrument, Long said. Fans of classical music, especially, will likely opt for 
a traditional piano. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, on his way out of class at the Steinway store, said he enjoys jazz 
recordings and would like to be able to play jazz on the piano. Having played 
some clarinet, he thinks that piano is easier -- "the keys are right in front 
of you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the piano accessible, but "it's basic to American culture," said 
Dillon, who cites a number of popular movies and television commercials that 
feature piano melodies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promotes Expression 
</P>
<P>
In addition, students have told her that playing the piano brings "peace and 
order" into their lives, she said. "All of us have a need to express how we 
feel, and the piano is one of the most tangible ways to do that." 
</P>
<P>
People interested in piano lessons might contact: 
</P>
<P>
* Community music schools. For locations, write the National Guild of Community 
Music Schools, Box 8018, Englewood, NJ 07631. 
</P>
<P>
* Adult-education centers. Programs may include group classes at night or 
classes for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
* Piano stores. Dealers may conduct group lessons, have studios on their 
premises or recommend teachers. 
</P>
<P>
* Music Teachers National Assn. This professional group offers a free directory 
of certified members. Write 617 Vine St., Suite 1432, Cincinnati, OH 45202. 
</P>
<P>
There are piano-teaching audiotapes, videocassettes and computer software 
programs available. They can be helpful, said Long of Baldwin Piano &amp; 
Organ, but sooner or later you need "a warm body to sit there with you and give 
you some feedback." 
</P>
<P>
To find the right piano teacher, it's best to interview the person before 
signing up, he said. Here are some basic areas for discussion: 
</P>
<P>
* Professional background. What music degrees does the teacher have? Does the 
teacher belong to professional organizations? 
</P>
<P>
* Teaching approach. Has the teacher worked with adults? Adults are not just 
"big kids," Long said, and the teacher's attitude should reflect this. Tell the 
person what you hope to learn, and see if his goals mesh with your own. How 
much practicing does the teacher expect? 
</P>
<P>
* Price. Fees vary widely. Hermanson said many teachers charge $6 to $12 for a 
weekly, 30-minute private lesson. Debbie Adams, who teaches in Boston, charges 
$30 an hour. Group lessons often cost less: The Community Music Center in 
Boston charges $150 for a 16-week semester.

POTTER TESTS SKILL ON DELICATE JAPANESE PIECES

<P>
Ever so carefully, Meriwether McClorey puts pieces of raku pottery into her 
kiln. The Somerset potter plans to fire about 30 pieces on this chilly 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The kiln, a converted water heater, will hold only three pieces. So McClorey 
and her husband will spend more than eight hours repeating the firing process. 
It's a painstaking but fascinating method of making art, and friends come by to 
watch during the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Raku (pronounced rah-KOO) can be traced back to traditional Japanese tea 
ceremonies. More than 1,000 years ago, decorating and firing pottery was a 
social event marked by drinking tea. 
</P>
<P>
McClorey, who has specialized in raku for about four years, says the process 
has been changed in the United States, where potters are apt to do firing much 
more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
To look at the delicate pottery, it is obvious that much skill goes into every 
piece. Yet, to an extent, the outcome of each one is unpredictable. During 
firing, new patterns emerge. They work in concert with the original, intended 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Go ahead and light it," McClorey says to her husband, John. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by a combination of propane gas and air, the kiln will eventually heat 
up to 1,900 degrees Fahrenheit. At that temperature, glazing occurs, giving 
each piece of raku a unique look. 
</P>
<P>
Much work has already gone into this pottery. At her studio in Somerset, 
McClorey shaped the various bowls, plates and vases of clay and did preparatory 
painting and designing. 
</P>
<P>
The firing takes place in a sheltered kiln area outside McClorey's home in 
rural Pulaski County. Before going into the kiln, pieces are preheated on a 
wood stove in the house. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's very gradual," McClorey says, explaining the different steps 
involved. At this stage, the pottery has a pasty appearance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glassy, Colorful Surface 
</P>
<P>
But after the items have spent 20 minutes in the kiln, McClorey peeks through a 
hole in the kiln door. The glaze has started to bubble. Once melted, the glaze 
-- a mixture of clay and silica -- gives the finished product a glassy, 
colorful surface. 
</P>
<P>
After firing, John McClorey uses large tongs to remove the pottery. Each piece 
is then sprayed with a copper sulfate solution and placed inside a garbage 
barrel for smoking for about 35 minutes. This affects both the color and 
texture of the finished product. 
</P>
<P>
The artist seems proudest of things that are the simplest in the firing 
process, such as the old vacuum cleaner that distributes air into the kiln. She 
points to crinkled cardboard on top of the vacuum cleaner. Hard to believe that 
a little piece of paper regulates the air flow. 
</P>
<P>
"It works, though," she says, grinning.

IN QUILTING, WARM GLOW OF HISTORY LENDS JOY TO THE PRESENT RENAISSANCE; 
</P>
<P>
INTEREST IN OLD-FASHIONED ART FORM 'JUST KEEPS GROWING AND GROWING'

<P>
Hundreds of years after the first frontier women gathered scraps of cloth to 
make quilts, this unique art form is experiencing a rebirth that both surprises 
and delights 36-year-old Anita Weinraub. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the old folk song "Seeing Nellie Home" says, there are still many Aunt 
Dinahs holding quilting parties and many sewing Nellies being seen to their 
homes after the quilting bash is over. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very popular. It strikes a sentimental chord in many people," Weinraub 
said. "One hundred years ago, people quilted out of need. Today people want to 
make something beautiful for their homes or to express themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Making those warm quilts that are so welcome on the bed when the nights are 
cold has not changed much over the years, Weinraub said. Although some women 
now use computer programs to design their patterns and to help in color 
coordination, the old-time wood frame is still used to hold and stretch the 
quilt while it is being worked on by one or more women. 
</P>
<P>
Weinraub, who is self-employed in real estate, got hooked on quilting more than 
three years ago. She was fascinated by their beauty, utility and the literally 
thousands of patterns and color combinations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Caught the Fever' 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to make a quilt," she said. "I caught the fever and it stayed 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
Quilting "is becoming recognized as a women's art form and should be 
preserved." 
</P>
<P>
And although the modern American woman is no longer seen in the homemaker role, 
there are many who still gather for old-fashioned quilting parties or quilting 
bees, contributing to the resurgence in quilt making, Weinraub said. 
</P>
<P>
Her interest in making quilts may be equaled or exceeded by a desire to 
preserve this bit of Americana. 
</P>
<P>
"Quilts are artifacts from our past," Weinraub said. "By their very nature of 
construction, material and the oral history provided by their owners, they 
constitute a rich but perishable body of information about the lives of the 
people who made and used them. This should be recorded and documented, and the 
sooner the better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quilt Surveys 
</P>
<P>
Weinraub, a member of the North Georgia Quilt Council, said quilting guilds in 
more than 35 states have completed or started quilt surveys in which these 
treasured items from the past are documented, registered, photographed and 
their histories recorded. Some state quilting guilds have published books with 
photographs and histories of the more interesting quilts. 
</P>
<P>
Weinraub has launched an ambitious effort to do a similar survey in Georgia by 
holding "quilt days" in various parts of the state where quilters bring in 
their family quilts to be documented and photographed. She hopes that once this 
is done, the information will recorded and placed on file in the Georgia 
Archives. 
</P>
<P>
Weinraub says family history did not play a part in her interest in quilting. 
</P>
<P>
She has made nine quilts in her spare time. One, which she quilted to give as a 
wedding present, took nine months. 
</P>
<P>
In early American history, women made quilts by sewing scraps of cloth 
together. Eventually, when cloth became more available, quilters could plan 
patterns and colors. Some quilts made in the 1700s are still in existence and 
are proud family possessions, Weinraub said. 
</P>
<P>
"One or more women could work on a quilt at the same time and quilting parties 
were big social occasions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Quilts consist of three layers -- a top of calico or polyester, a bottom, 
usually muslin, with bedding material in between. The layers are put in a wood 
frame or hoop, where they are stretched tight and quilted together with a 
special quilting thread. 
</P>
<P>
Some women eschew the frames and hoops, using sewing machines to speed up the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the early quilt patterns were taken from something in everyday life," 
Weinraub said. Some well-known patterns depicted a log cabin, flying geese, a 
double wedding ring or a moon coming up over a mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Quilting declined in the early 1920s, Weinraub said, but experienced a big 
resurgence during the Great Depression of the 1930s when women used feed sacks 
to make quilts or reverted back to saving scraps of cloth and piecing them 
together. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent resurgence began about 1976 and "it just keeps growing and 
growing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Every state has a quilting guild, said Weinraub, and there are several national 
organizations. The two largest are the American Quilters Society and the 
National Quilting Assn.

CAL STATE A STEP CLOSER IN ITS BID FOR RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite environmental protests, California State University on Wednesday came a 
step closer toward placing a campus on Taylor Ranch west of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The university's Board of Trustees voted to approve a final environmental 
impact report for the ranch, including a series of measures designed to lessen 
damage to the scenic hillside property. 
</P>
<P>
Although not all the negative impact could be mitigated, the board concluded: 
"The project will have positive humanistic, educational and cultural impact on 
the area, which will override the adverse environmental impact." 
</P>
<P>
The move was immediately criticized by Patagonia, the Ventura-based outdoor 
clothing company, which contends that Cal State's report seriously 
underestimated the negative impact of development on the seaside bluff. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, which commissioned a private study of the report, charged that the 
document is based on only 2,000 students initially attending the two-year 
extension facility, while ignoring the possibility of expansion to a four-year 
school with several thousand more students. 
</P>
<P>
"We think they're dealing in bad faith," said Patagonia spokesman Kevin 
Sweeney, adding that a recent California Supreme Court decision would back up 
the company's case. "We intend to fight this site through whatever means 
available." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Medicine Man 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia also submitted a letter on behalf of a Chumash medicine man, further 
objecting to any development. In the letter, Kote Lotah, an An'tap priest from 
Ventura, said the ranch was "a well-known ceremonial shrine" that "has 
tremendous spiritual and religious significance to our people." 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Trustees, in approving the report, acknowledged that development 
of a 465-acre parcel of the ranch would have an adverse environmental impact on 
traffic, air quality and solid-waste disposal, and could possibly disturb 
ancient Chumash Indian burial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
However, to lessen those impacts, a series of measures were also approved, 
including widening several city streets, encouraging car pools, developing a 
recycling program, conducting a detailed archeological study and using hooded 
street lamps to reduce glare from the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the report indicated that not all of the impacts could be reduced, which 
required the trustees under state law to rule that the benefits to be derived 
from the proposed university created "overriding considerations" that 
outweighed any adverse environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
Should the campus need to grow, Cal State officials said they see no problem in 
conducting another environmental impact report to assess the expanded facility. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, Cal State views its biggest hurdle as acquiring the property, 
which is owned by Santa Barbara residents Ailene B. Claeyssens and her 
daughter, Cynthia Wood, who have refused to sell. 
</P>
<P>
The university is taking steps, including preparation of the environmental 
impact report and an appraisal of the property, that are consistent with 
purchasing the land through eminent domain, a power granted to public agencies 
for acquiring private land for public purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees will ask the state Department of General Services to take the 
necessary steps to acquire the property, officials said. Meanwhile, the 
university will make Claeyssens and Wood an offer on the land.

OXNARD WILL ADD 60,000 RESIDENTS, GROUP PREDICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard will grow by 10 square miles and about 60,000 residents by the year 
2020, according to a report released this week by a citizens group at work on a 
blueprint for Oxnard's future. 
</P>
<P>
The city will stretch to Ormond Beach on the south and as far east as Victoria 
Avenue, nearly half a mile past its existing eastern boundary, the final draft 
of the group's update on the city's General Plan projected. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which culminates nearly two years of work by the 22-member General 
Plan Advisory Committee, also recommends converting three square miles of 
agricultural lands to urban uses and changing the zoning on much of Oxnard's 
undeveloped area from residential to commercial. The amount of land zoned for 
open space, which could be devoted to parks or farming, would be boosted to 
1,099 acres or nearly two square miles. 
</P>
<P>
Negative effects of growth would be held in check by more stringent 
growth-management policies, which would bar development unless the roads and 
schools in the area could support it. The approach also requires developers to 
build in established neighborhoods before breaking ground in less-populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which is expected to be adopted at a May 25 meeting of the committee, 
is aimed at allowing more Oxnard residents to work and shop within the city, 
thus increasing the city's tax base, committee Chairman Ralph Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
"GPAC made a commitment to jobs for Oxnard's residents," he said. "To do that, 
more jobs had to be created." 
</P>
<P>
The committee envisions Oxnard's population growing from about 125,000 today to 
184,197 in 2020. The number of homes that could be built on property zoned for 
residential uses would drop from 11,596, under the city's present General Plan, 
to 6,447. Property zoned for commercial and industrial purposes would climb 
from 3,624 acres to 5,148 acres. 
</P>
<P>
According to the committee document, much of Oxnard's growth would be centered 
at Ormond Beach, where an Orange County developer has proposed a marina-based 
residential and commercial community. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin Co. of Irvine had hoped to develop 2,900 acres of Ormond Beach, but the 
committee has recommended that no more than 900 acres be developed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recommendations 
</P>
<P>
GPAC recommends converting nearly a square mile of agricultural property on the 
northwest end of the city to residential uses, with land set aside for a high 
school, an elementary school and a junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
The property was offered to California State University two years ago by a 
Somis developer as a site for a Ventura County campus. The developer, David 
White, has since offered to donate a site for a high school in exchange for 
development concessions. 
</P>
<P>
"GPAC took this into consideration when we decided to move the urban limits 
line," Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
GPAC's proposal would also open up agricultural land north of La Colonia for 
residential development and three school sites, in keeping with a request by 
trustees of the Oxnard School District, said Richard Maggio, Oxnard's community 
development director. 
</P>
<P>
But the document, which will be considered by the Oxnard Planning Commission 
and the City Council in coming months, drew criticism from several quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bollinger, a GPAC alternate who has long advocated strict limits on 
growth, said the proposed plan's protections can too easily be ignored by city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"If the council were to honor the Growth Management Element, you've got 
something that would work," he said. "But I have serious doubts that the 
council would honor it. The pressures for growth have always been there and 
they're becoming more intense." 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger also questioned the document's population projections, which he said 
failed to take into account population growth due to immigration because it was 
based only on anticipated new housing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Oscar Karrin, another GPAC alternate and an advocate of affordable 
housing, criticized the plan for sidestepping the issue of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can afford to live here as it is," he said. "Businesses are already 
subsidizing housing for their workers." 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report released with committee's recommendations raised 
several other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that growth would deplete aquifers, increasing the risk of 
their contamination by seawater. 
</P>
<P>
The report also predicted a loss of $10 million in agricultural revenue as a 
result of the proposed conversion of three square miles of agricultural land to 
urban uses. But it also noted that the losses could be offset by businesses 
moving in. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the development planned for Ormond Beach would damage much of the 
area's most productive wetlands, the impact report said. While Baldwin plans to 
protect 50 acres of wetlands, only three acres have been designated as highly 
productive by biologists. The development, meanwhile, would impact 110 acres of 
wetlands that have been designated highly productive.

BUDGET CRUNCH THREATENS SPECIAL SCHOOL'S SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Eight years ago, Toni Johnson was told that her 9-year-old daughter was lazy 
and didn't want to learn. But after testing at the ERAS Center, a private, 
nonprofit special education school, her daughter was diagnosed as having 
dyslexia, a brain disorder that impairs the ability to read. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's daughter received educational therapy at the ERAS (Educational 
Resource And Services) Center for the next eight years while attending public 
schools, and next month will graduate from Beverly Hills High School. In the 
fall, she will attend UC Berkeley as part of its learning disabled program. 
</P>
<P>
"ERAS has been a godsend," said Johnson, who asked that her daughter's first 
name not be used to protect her privacy. 
</P>
<P>
But help for students like her daughter, who is on a partial scholarship to pay 
for her therapy, is in danger because of a financial squeeze facing ERAS, which 
operated for seven years in Beverly Hills before a recent move to Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Cull, the center's founder and director, said an increase in insurance 
premiums and the prospect of asbestos-removal work at the center has added 
$320,000 to the center's $2-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
ERAS is one of many private schools in the area that provide specialized 
instruction for students with learning or emotional problems. Many of its 
students are referred by public school districts, which pick up most of the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
What sets ERAS apart, however, is its ambitious effort to seek out additional 
students who need specialized instruction but for various reasons are not 
eligible for it in their school district. By raising funds from corporate and 
individual donations, ERAS is able to offer some full and partial scholarships 
for students whose parents cannot afford the tuition, which can reach $20,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Cull said that if the $320,000 is not raised by the end of the year, the center 
will be forced to limit its services to students whose parents or school 
districts can pay the full cost. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking kids that would have been lost in the system," Cull said. "We 
are trying to meet the needs of low-income families. But we may not be able to 
do that much longer." 
</P>
<P>
Cull said she established the center in 1980 -- by getting a second mortgage on 
her house -- after discovering that there were limited resources for children 
with learning and emotional disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the programs offered at public schools were full or inadequate, said 
Cull, who is also a mother of a child with a learning problem. 
</P>
<P>
The center now offers a day school program for children 4 to 19 years old, 
after-school child care for special education students, a summer camp, 
vocational training, a hot line, and diagnostic testing and counseling. The 
center serves about 350 students a week in its various programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are working to provide a place where anyone with concerns about these 
disabilities can get help regardless of their need or ability to pay," Cull 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The center is in a nondescript warehouse-type building on Jefferson Boulevard 
in an industrial area of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, however, the atmosphere is much more inviting. Hallways are lined with 
photographs and artwork by the children. Elementary school children are usually 
four or five per classroom, junior high students six to eight per classroom and 
high school students eight to 10. The students receive instruction in regular 
academic courses as well as art and music. 
</P>
<P>
Cull said that while some students complete their entire education at ERAS, 
most are at the center for three to five years until they are ready to function 
at regular schools. 
</P>
<P>
One 14-year-old student, Debbie, has been at ERAS since 1986 and is expected to 
attend public school this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was real tough. I wanted to fight everybody," Debbie said. "I 
think I'm ready for regular school, but I know that if I have problems I'll 
come back here. 
</P>
<P>
Another student, Scott, was having problems reading when he came to ERAS nearly 
three years ago. He too is expected to enter a regular school this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be a pediatrician when I grow up and help kids," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexpected Progress 
</P>
<P>
Parents have seen progress in their children that they never expected to see. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who is now assistant development director at ERAS, said the counseling 
helped her daughter's self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"It has just done wonders," Johnson said. "At first she didn't want anyone to 
know that she was getting counseling, but after about three months, she was 
open about it." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Dean, whose 14-year-old son son has been enrolled at ERAS since he was 6, 
said the center has helped him find a talent for writing songs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he would have been able to succeed at public school," she said. 
"At 6 he was not very verbal. Now, he sometimes is too verbal." 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Pelner said her son has "done nothing but grow" during his eight years 
at ERAS, during which he has discovered a talent for sculpting. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he could have managed it without ERAS," she said.

WARNING ISSUED ON DEUKMEJIAN'S PLAN TO CUT BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE CHAWKINS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Budget cuts proposed by Gov. George Deukmejian could curtail public treatment 
of the mentally ill and gut important programs for juvenile offenders, the 
medically indigent and the aging, Ventura County officials warned this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be devastating for our department and for the families we serve," 
said Mental Health Director Randy Feltman, whose department would suffer the 
most severe cuts with a reduction of as much as 38% in its operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
At a press luncheon, Feltman called the governor's proposals "not only tragic, 
but stupid." He contended that the dollars saved by eliminating mental health 
programs will be lost many times over when the untreated mentally ill wind up 
jailed, homeless or institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County stands to lose about $8.3 million if Deukmejian's proposals are 
approved. A $14-million county reserve garnered from cost-cutting measures last 
year will soften the blow, but not for long, said Richard Wittenberg, the 
county's chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably be OK this year," Wittenberg said. "We have a large fund 
balance. But we can't depend on it. We're talking about a systemic problem that 
will hurt us more and more as the years go by." 
</P>
<P>
The problem involves a one-two punch delivered by laws designed to limit state 
spending. For a decade, state spending has been bridled by the so-called Gann 
limit. This year, it became further restricted by Proposition 98, which 
earmarks at least 40% of all state expenditures for public schools and 
community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Social Services Targeted 
</P>
<P>
The two have led the governor to propose far-reaching budget reductions, 
focusing largely on social services. Statewide, mental health funding could be 
cut by as much as 46%, according to Deukmejian's critics. "His blue pencil will 
be as destructive as any assault weapon we've been reading about," Democratic 
Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy has told crowds of mental health workers and patients 
rallying against the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's budget, which has been criticized by some Republican lawmakers, 
faces tough sledding in the Legislature. But, confronted with a lame-duck 
governor who wields the power of the line-item veto and needs no political 
favors for future campaigns, local officials are bracing for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"The loss will be pervasive," said Feltman, who predicted more jail crowding 
and greater numbers of disturbed homeless people wandering through the county's 
downtown areas. He said the county would not likely give his department the 
entire $5 million it might lose. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we were worried about cost-of-living adjustments," he said. "Now 
we're worried about layoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Operations at other county departments would also be threatened by the 
governor's budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Medical Center would face a direct loss of about $1.5 
million, said Phil Wessels, director of the Ventura County Health Care Agency. 
"It's not feasible for the hospital to absorb that kind of loss," he said. "The 
county will be on the hook." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Jeopardized Programs 
</P>
<P>
Programs to reduce truancy and deal with juvenile offenders before they become 
full-fledged criminals are also in jeopardy, as is a program that provides 
household help to the elderly, officials said. Moreover, cuts in state family 
planning programs could cost the county an additional $4.9 million in welfare 
payments for unwanted children, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing political games with the elderly, the frail, the feeble and our 
children," said County Supervisor Susan K. Lacey, "and they're pretty awful 
games." 
</P>
<P>
The outrage over Deukmejian's proposals is the latest chapter in what is now a 
familiar tale, told regularly by officials of almost every California county. 
As the taxing limits of Proposition 13 and related measures put a tight lid on 
counties' ability to raise money, the state and federal governments were 
mandating that they operate increasingly expensive health, corrections and 
environmental programs. 
</P>
<P>
The result, they say, has been a plunge in the counties' abilities to provide 
basic services. Parks have closed, libraries have cut their hours, jails have 
become overcrowded, roads have deteriorated, and hospitals and clinics have 
gone understaffed and even shut down.

CULVER THEATER STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirtieth Street Architects of Newport Beach has been selected by the 
Redevelopment Agency to prepare estimates and plans for the rehabilitation of 
the city-owned Culver Theater. 
</P>
<P>
The theater, which closed in January, had operated as a three-screen movie 
house for 10 years. In November, the City Council decided to convert the 
facility into a single 800-seat auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff is preparing a study to determine the market demand for 
commercial and other non-city uses. The study is also looking at potential 
traffic and parking problems, and whether the theater should be managed by the 
city or a private operator. 
</P>
<P>
The agency bought the theater in May, 1985, and tried to sell it to Filmcorp 
Group Inc. The two sides could not reach an agreement, and negotiations ended 
in June, 1987. The theater had been showing second-run movies until it closed 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
Thirtieth Street recently completed a historic resources study of the city for 
the Redevelopment Agency, and is preparing plans to move the Willat Studio 
"witch's house" back to Culver City. The house, nicknamed because of its 
appearance and used in the early Hollywood days as a movie studio, was moved to 
a site in Beverly Hills several years ago as an alternative to demolishing it.

<P>
NO IMMEDIATE THREAT FOUND FROM ROCKWELL LAB POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN and TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chemical and radioactive pollution at Rockwell International's Santa Susana 
Field Laboratory southeast of Simi Valley appears to be confined to the site 
and poses no immediate threat to nearby residents, according to a preliminary 
report by the U.S. Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
But the report, furnished Tuesday by DOE to Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley), called for more environmental tests since inadequacies in the plant's 
"groundwater monitoring system make it difficult to characterize the nature and 
extent of contamination." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of DOE, which has contracted for nuclear work at the isolated 
research complex, predicted that additional testing and some cleanup work will 
be needed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, DOE officials gave the site a qualified bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has no reason to fear any hazard to human health as a result of the 
contamination" found to date, said Richard H. Nolan, chief spokesman for the 
DOE's operations office in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
However, a DOE critic who worked on the report as a private consultant said 
there has been too little ground water testing at the lab for the public to 
feel reassured. 
</P>
<P>
And Gallegly said he will "push for additional monitoring wells to be dug as 
quickly as possible so we will know for sure if there is any reason to be 
concerned. . . ." He was briefed Tuesday by DOE officials after demanding a 
copy of the report in response to news stories. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me there's no radioactive contamination in any of the water they 
tested," Gallegly said by telephone from his Washington office. "I hope there's 
not fear out there to the point where people are thinking of picking up and 
moving to Northern California -- there's no cause for that." 
</P>
<P>
The lab, operated by Rockwell's Rocketdyne division in a rugged area of the 
Simi Hills, for several years has been on the state Superfund cleanup list 
because of high levels of trichloroethylene, or TCE, a chemical solvent, in 
ground water under the complex. Rocketdyne has been pumping and treating ground 
water in one part of the property where TCE has been found at levels of up to 
11,000 parts per billion, 2,200 times the drinking water standard. 
</P>
<P>
The DOE report acknowledges, apparently for the first time, that some 
radioactive contamination also exists in soil and structures from nuclear 
operations and spills. 
</P>
<P>
But agency officials Tuesday characterized this contamination as moderate, 
saying radiation levels a short distance from the hottest spots do not exceed 
natural background levels. 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne officials said they have tested 16 wells and springs, off the site 
but nearby, over the last four years without detecting chemical or radioactive 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
And DOE officials, contradicting published news reports, said radioactive 
pollution has never been found in ground water, either under or off the site. 
</P>
<P>
But James Werner, the former consultant who worked on the report and now is an 
environmental scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental group, said it "isn't surprising" that no radioactive elements 
have been found in ground water "since they haven't looked for them to any 
extent." 
</P>
<P>
Werner said, for example, that ground water has seeped in and out of a 
contaminated building -- but that the nearest test well is uphill from the 
building, or in the opposite direction of the ground water flow. 
</P>
<P>
Werner said that when he surveyed the lab in May, 1988, Rockwell "had not even 
gone through the process of identifying" areas of potential contamination in 
parts of the site devoted to DOE work. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all data for the report were generated by Rockwell itself, but DOE 
officials said this did not pose a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The independent survey team found that the data was credible enough that it 
didn't feel the need to do independent sampling," Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from Congress, DOE more than three years ago began surveying 35 
labs and production sites where weapons or energy development was done for DOE 
or its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to Congress due in December, DOE officials will rank the sites, 
establishing which will be first to get funds for more tests and cleanup. The 
Santa Susana lab will probably appear near "the bottom of the list," said DOE 
spokesman Wolfgang Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
DOE officials said that in one area of the plant, known as the sodium burn pit, 
soil tests revealed levels of radioactive cesium as high as 700 picocuries per 
gram of soil -- about 10 to 30 times higher than normal background radiation 
for the area. 
</P>
<P>
In a sewage leach field where radioactive water was spilled in the 1970s, the 
highest radiation level found was 4,900 picocuries per gram of soil, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Opened in 1947, the Santa Susana lab had the first nuclear reactor in the 
United States to produce power for supply to a commercial power grid. The 
small, experimental sodium-cooled reactor went on line in 1957, producing power 
for Southern California Edison Co. 
</P>
<P>
The plant was crippled by a serious accident in July, 1959, when 13 of its 43 
uranium fuel rods ruptured or suffered partial meltdown. The plant was repaired 
and operated until 1967. But the accident remained virtually unknown to the 
public until 1979, when it was finally described in news reports. 
</P>
<P>
A 1983 Rockwell report to DOE described the removal and cleanup of the sodium 
reactor without discussing the 1959 accident. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the cleanup work, which took from 1974 until 1983, 
involved removal of 136,411 cubic feet of radioactively contaminated buildings, 
soil and rock, which were hauled to nuclear waste dumps at Beatty, Nev., and 
Hanford, Wash. The cost of the cleanup was $16.6 million, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Studies later showed that the area was "decontaminated to levels that allow 
unrestricted use," the report said, suggesting that remaining radioactivity was 
caused by later work at the lab.

'BLATANT DISCRIMINATION' AGAINST FISHERMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your May 11 article about Channel Islands Harbor certainly sums up 10 years of 
blatant discrimination against commercial fishermen. It also clearly shows a 
flagrant dismissal and disregard for the California Coastal Commission permit 
of 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The statement that the commercial dock and related facilities haven't been 
completed because of "unforeseen problems" is ludicrous and insulting to the 
intelligence of the public. 
</P>
<P>
The strict language used in the eligibility requirements to define commercial 
fishermen for access to the commercial marina is a sham. These requirements 
serve only one purpose -- to keep commercial fishermen out. 
</P>
<P>
Even more shocking is the obvious chicanery of certain county officials who 
have condoned this type of inexcusable delay. This has been a serious hindrance 
to commercial fisherman, a financial detriment to them and other businesses 
that would benefit from the enhancement of the fishing business in our area. 
</P>
<P>
When county taxpayers get a hefty increase to cover the cost of the harbor 
dredging because the county officials lost the federal funding due to their 
predilection for recreational boating facilities, maybe then they will take 
notice of the travesty that has taken place against the commercial fishermen of 
Channel Islands Harbor.

The city was perfect as a backdrop for a TV pilot set in a small Oklahoma town 
-- except for the majestic King palms lining Central Avenue, producers of "The 
Outsiders" told Fillmore officials recently. 
</P>
<P>
Location consultant C. Robert Holloway spent two days considering ways to make 
the distinctive trees disappear. He rejected disguising them in ersatz oak 
bark, as he has on other locations, and moved his shoot to Santa Paula -- where 
palms are confined, for the most part, to Palm Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'There Was No Way' 
</P>
<P>
"We were heartbroken," said Holloway, a veteran location-finder for 87 films. 
"We talked about parking trucks in front of the trees, or shooting around them. 
There was no way." 
</P>
<P>
Other movie companies requiring a small town with a Midwestern feel have also 
been drawn to Fillmore, only to be stymied by its quintessentially Californian 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
"If you know Southern California, you go other places besides Fillmore," said 
Lou Goldstein, head of locations for Columbia Pictures' television division. 
"There are other small towns nearby. If we had to go East every time we had an 
Eastern location, we'd be East all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Although the California Film Commission, which promotes filming in California, 
shrugs off palms as a big problem, some production crews have taken big steps 
to avoid them. 
</P>
<P>
When ABC used Bellflower for scenes in "The Jessica McClure Story," Holloway's 
firm had to obtain residents' permission to harvest oranges and lemons, 
rendering the trees in the background "ND" -- the industry term for 
nondescript, said Michael Parks, location manager. 
</P>
<P>
Palms in Los Angeles' MacArthur Park have been wrapped with fake oak bark and 
hung with branches to create the ambience of New York's Central Park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And palms reared their anything-but-nondescript fronds again during the filming 
of "Baby M" in Glendale, where an Armenian church was transformed into a Bergen 
County, N.J., courthouse. For one day of filming, two palms were removed, 
replaced with "ND" trees, and replanted at the end of the shoot, Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
But the palms of Fillmore were too numerous to disguise. "If those trees 
weren't there, we could turn Fillmore into a back lot," Holloway said. 
"Fillmore would do the film industry a tremendous favor by letting them buy up 
those palms and replace them with something less Southern Californian." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Fillmore's residents are inclined to cooperate. City Clerk Noreen 
Withers said the trees are "a major hot issue, right up there with politics and 
abortion." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Roger Campbell said he doubted that movie companies would spend 
enough in Fillmore to help business or jeopardize the palms. 'If the movie 
companies would give a million to the city, I'd say go ahead and cut the palms 
down," he said. "But that's a non-negotiable price -- and there's no guarantee 
we wouldn't replant them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Like Palms' 
</P>
<P>
Gary Creagle, the former Fillmore mayor who runs the "Up In Arms" gun shop on 
Central Avenue, was less enthusiastic about the trees. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the palms," he said. "They drop those little pods, and little old 
ladies slip and fall, and I have to help them up. The mess we can clean up; 
lawsuits take longer. I'd like to see those palms gone." 
</P>
<P>
That statement might cheer Holloway, who laments: "I wish the town would come 
to its senses and plant some elm trees, or some oaks. As location-finders, palm 
trees are our nemesis."

D.A.'S INQUIRY HAS MINIMAL IMPACT; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE CRITICISM, WRIGHT APPEARS IN STRONG POSITION FOR REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the Ventura County district attorney's well-publicized criticism of 
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright's actions involving traffic tickets that she and 
her daughter received, the Simi Valley Republican appears to remain a 
formidable candidate for reelection in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Thursday whether she still planned to seek a sixth two-year term, Wright 
replied, "Of course, why not?" as she left the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
Renowned as a determined political street fighter, Wright appears to be headed 
for her first serious primary challenge since she won the seat in 1980. 
Political professionals say she remains favored, despite any damage inflicted 
by Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's 97-page investigatory report. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a safe Republican seat," said one prominent political consultant who 
asked not to be identified. "It's extraordinarily difficult to defeat a 
Republican in a primary. Most people don't like to contribute financially 
against an incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
It will be particularly time-consuming and costly for a challenger to become 
known in Wright's heavily Republican 37th District, which extends from Lompoc 
in Santa Barbara County through Simi Valley in Ventura County and to the Santa 
Clarita and Antelope valleys in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible handicap for challengers is Proposition 73, the campaign 
reform act that limits contributions in state and local races to $1,000 from 
individuals and $2,500 from political action committees each fiscal year. 
Incumbents start with a broader base of special interest contributors who can 
give them $2,500 annually, and they have already been raising money during the 
present fiscal year, which ends June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bradbury's probe has given opponents considerable ammunition. The 
district attorney culminated a 10-week investigation by asserting that Wright 
had "demonstrated a clear pattern of attempting to obtain special treatment for 
herself and her daughter with the police, the courts and the Department of 
Motor Vehicles" over a 10-year period but had committed "no clear-cut criminal 
violation." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Wright, 24, who lives with her mother, has received 28 traffic 
convictions since 1981. After Bradbury opened his inquiry in March, Victoria 
Wright's license was revoked and she spent 20 days in the Ventura County Work 
Furlough Program for violating probation with a traffic offense. 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Wright, 59, responded this week by charging that Bradbury was 
politically motivated and had misused public funds because his inquiry failed 
to charge her with breaking any laws. She called the report shameful, but has 
declined to discuss its accuracy or impact. She did not return a phone call 
Friday seeking comment on these matters. 
</P>
<P>
Both of Wright's potential Republican primary opponents said they were 
encouraged by Bradbury's findings even though the district attorney did not 
seek an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Larkin, a Republican activist and businessman from Simi Valley who has 
declared his candidacy, said: "It just reaffirms my resolve to run for the 
office" and make ethics the cornerstone of his campaign. He vows to focus on 
Wright's relationship with Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patronage Charged 
</P>
<P>
"It starts with Willie Brown and the Legislature," said Larkin, 52. "He brought 
patronage and the profit motive to California politics and with Cathie 
associating herself so closely with him, I think it's rubbed off." 
</P>
<P>
Wright's relationship with Brown has sparked controversy among Republicans in 
the Assembly. She refused to join her GOP colleagues, abstaining when they 
voted for another Democrat to replace Brown as speaker in December. A 
subsequent Republican bid to punish her by removing her from the Assembly Rules 
Committee failed when Brown and the Democrats refused to go along. The Speaker, 
in turn, awarded Wright unusually choice committee assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also recommended an attorney to Wright to represent her daughter when she 
faced a possible jail term for driving without a license last year. Then, 
according to Bradbury's report, Brown called Ventura County Municipal Judge 
Herbert Curtis III on March 28, 1988, from Washington, identified himself as a 
close friend of Cathie Wright's and told Curtis that Victoria Wright did not 
deserve to go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
Brown blasted Bradbury as irresponsible for failing to take legal action but 
then using the inquiry "as a tool for the purposes of condemning other people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Expected 
</P>
<P>
Hunt Braly, 34, the longtime administrative assistant to state Sen. Ed Davis 
(R-Valencia), said that as a result of Bradbury's report, "I am closer today to 
running than ever before but have made no final decision." He said he expects 
to do so within a month. 
</P>
<P>
A contest between Wright and Braly "is going to be nasty," said a Davis 
supporter, who predicted that Braly will run. "It's not going to be a pretty 
sight." 
</P>
<P>
Braly, an attorney who lives outside the district in Woodland Hills but is 
buying a condominium in Valencia, said his campaign would have three major 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 issue is the Willie Brown connection. You can't play bosom pals in 
Sacramento and then come down to the district and say how bad he is. That's 
hypocritical," Braly said. 
</P>
<P>
"Point No. 2 is the ethics of the whole driving situation. Just because someone 
isn't indicted does not mean they are cleared. There's no question there's 
impropriety and there seems to be no sense with Cathie she did anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The third point, he said, "is whether Cathie has been a true leader for the 
district on transportation, school facility issues and park/open-space issues." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would support Braly if he runs, Davis said this week: "Should 
I back Hunt, it would be perfectly logical in looking back at her threatening 
to run against me. I will give her all the consideration she gave me." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a year, Wright openly considered challenging Davis in his 1988 
primary, much to his consternation, before she decided not to run. 
</P>

AQUINO WILL NOT APPEAR ON VENTURA THEATRE FIGHT CARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL OLSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LBA Associates has announced its upcoming professional fight card for the 
Ventura Theatre on Wednesday at 7 p.m., but missing from the lineup is former 
super welterweight champion Lupe Aquino of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation that Aquino, who is awaiting trial on 
vehicular-manslaughter charges, would appear on this month's card, but LBA 
president Paul Konapelsky said that his matchmaker, Buddy Bereal, has not 
talked to anyone in the Aquino camp. 
</P>
<P>
"Lupe Aquino is a hot item to the residents of Ventura, but politics aside, we 
just want to put on the best all-around program," Konapelsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy has arisen over whether Aquino had been suspended by the California 
State Athletic Commission. However, both Konapelsky and Aquino's attorney, 
Robert Caron, said that the fighter has not been suspended, that he simply did 
not renew his California license. 
</P>
<P>
Said Konapelsky: "Even if he was licensed, for the kind of money, five or six 
thousand dollars, it would be better for us to use that money to draw a 
heavyweight bout and let the politics of Lupe Aquino take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
There will be five bouts on Wednesday's, including the main event between 
former WBC lightweight champion Lonnie Smith of Las Vegas and Ken Comer of Los 
Angeles. The junior welterweight bout is scheduled for 10 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Other bouts include: Danny Garcia of Oxnard vs. Jose Loreiana of Bakersfield in 
an eight-round junior welterweight fight; Raul Gonzales vs. Art Lizeraga, six 
rounds, junior welterweight; Victor Flores vs. Juvenal Molina, six rounds, 
featherweight; and Tony Rivera taking on Joe DeMarco in a four-round junior 
lightweight opening bout. 
</P>
<P>
Once again missing from the card is Camarillo's Robbie Ruiz, who has still not 
been able to find his first professional opponent.

EX-PEPPERDINE COACH THINKING OF COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Gorrie, who retired as Pepperdine's baseball coach last May, will be 
inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Assn. Hall of Fame at the group's 
national convention in San Francisco next January. 
</P>
<P>
But he is not quite ready to be put on a shelf. He said that he is a candidate 
to succeed Stan Morrison as the athletic director at UC Santa Barbara, his alma 
mater, where he was the head baseball coach for 19 years. Morrison was recently 
named head basketball coach at San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
Gorrie, who coached for 10 years at Pepperdine after leaving UC Santa Barbara, 
said he may also return to coaching some day. 
</P>
<P>
Gorrie said he retired because he "needed time off to sort things out." 
</P>
<P>
"After 29 years you cease to see the forest for the trees; you get bogged down 
in details. When one season melts into another year after year, I think you 
sometimes cease to have improvement or growth." 
</P>
<P>
He said that his year off from coaching has been "a very valuable period. I've 
learned a lot of things. I've talked to other coaches about how to do things, 
and I discovered I was doing some things very well and other things not well 
enough. I also discovered some things about myself. So it's been good -- and 
very refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
Gorrie, 58, who still teaches physical education at Pepperdine and looks as 
trim as anyone in his classes, said he is still "physically able to coach." 
</P>
<P>
And he hasn't really been far away from baseball. Far from it. 
</P>
<P>
He has been teaching hitting and pitching at a baseball school in Agoura, 
advising coaches Gary Adams of UCLA and John Herbold of Cal State Los Angeles 
and speaking at clinics. 
</P>
<P>
He "might go back to coaching some place, sometime." But not at Pepperdine and 
maybe not as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"When you give up your position, that's it," he said. "Pepperdine has a very 
fine young coach (Andy Lopez, former coach at Cal State Dominguez Hills) and a 
good program." 
</P>
<P>
He said that his return to coaching would probably be "at the college level. It 
depends on the opportunity, but I'd make somebody a good assistant. I know what 
he (would be) going through." 
</P>
<P>
Gorrie has gone through plenty. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Olney, Tex., he moved to Pasadena as a youngster and played baseball at 
Pasadena High with Bob Lillis and Dick Williams, who became major league 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
He attended Pasadena City College and later UC Santa Barbara where he was a 
star outfielder and top running back. A member of the UC Santa Barbara Athletic 
Hall of Fame, he posted a slugging percentage of .688 in the 1953 season, still 
a school record. 
</P>
<P>
After college he spent three years as a Navy officer. 
</P>
<P>
He began playing minor league ball in 1958 for the San Francisco Giants 
organization. He was released by the Giants and caught on with the Athletics, 
then in Kansas City. He played three seasons at Seminole, Okla.; Crowley, La.; 
Columbia, S.C., and Rochester, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was offered a contract to play with Portland in the Pacific Coast 
League but decided that he was too old to reach the majors. And when UC Santa 
Barbara offered him the job of head coach, he accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"You always would like to know whether you could have done it (played in the 
major leagues), but there were a limited number of jobs at the top and progress 
was slow." 
</P>
<P>
He said he hurt his chances of going to the majors by playing for UC Santa 
Barbara until he graduated and then spending three years in the Navy. "I cut my 
own throat." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he was more than satisfied with college coaching. " You may not make as 
much money as selling real estate or stocks and bonds, but it's been a helluva 
good life." 
</P>
<P>
Being a college baseball coach proved to be a helluva good life for him. At UC 
Santa Barbara, his teams had a record of 355-397, and the Gauchos won a Pacific 
Coast Athletic Assn. championship in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The good life got better at Pepperdine where his Waves were 409-202 in 10 
seasons and earned six berths in National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
tournaments. His 1979 team went furthest, advancing to the College World Series 
and winning three of four games before being eliminated by Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball sometimes thinks of itself as a changeless sport, but it has changed 
-- and not always for the better. Gorrie has seen the introduction of the 
designated hitter, synthetic playing surfaces and aluminum bats, and he hopes 
someone will do something to change aluminum bats so that they are less a 
danger to pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of seasons ago one of his pitchers, Tony Lewis, was seriously injured 
when hit in the face by a line drive off an aluminum bat. Balls hit with 
aluminum bats have more velocity and force than those hit with wooden bats. 
</P>
<P>
Gorrie said Lewis suffered multiple fractures of his cheekbone. Although Lewis 
recovered and played minor league ball last year, Gorrie said the pitcher "was 
not very far from death" after being struck. 
</P>
<P>
Gorrie said aluminum bats, used mostly at amateur levels of baseball, are "an 
economic fact of life." Wooden bats crack easily; aluminum bats last almost 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
"But I hope (the aluminum type) will be adapted, purely from the standpoint of 
the safety of pitchers." He said metal bats can generate such force that "it's 
like a doggone shooting gallery sometimes. We don't want to get anybody killed 
out there. 
</P>
<P>
"If an aluminum bat were more like a wooden bat in weight, you couldn't 
manipulate it as easily and generate all that speed. Players would have to 
learn to become better hitters, and pitchers would have half a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Gorrie thinks that college baseball has changed. "I'm not sure the best teams 
are any better than the ones of years ago, but I know there are more and more 
good teams." 
</P>
<P>
Players are generally better, he said. "They have more of an opportunity to be 
better; they are playing more. 
</P>
<P>
"They have more access to good coaching, and there is so much more sharing of 
information. They have the opportunity to be stronger because of weight 
training. They can see themselves (in action) with the advent of videotape. 
They have every reason to be better." 
</P>
<P>
Gorrie thinks that the one thing that hasn't changed in baseball is the 
attitudes of players. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't notice any difference at all. Some players know it all; some are very 
receptive -- and that's the way it's always been. I know society has changed to 
a degree, but I don't think human nature has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I find the players as enjoyable to work with as they were 29 years ago."

UCLA MEN'S TENNIS TEAM WILL SHOOT FOR THEIR 16TH NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA men's tennis team will be shooting for its 16th national championship 
and Coach Glenn Bassett will be seeking his eighth title when the team begins 
play Saturday in the NCAA championships at the University of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Bruins, who won the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division 
title with a 9-1 record and finished the season at 25-3, will play the winner 
of Friday's match between Utah and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
In other Saturday matches involving Pac-10 teams, top-seeded Stanford will play 
the winner of the Miami of Florida-Mississippi match, fourth-seeded UC Berkeley 
will face the winner of the Oklahoma State-Tennessee match, and USC will go 
against Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is led by Brian Garrow, ranked fourth in the nation in singles and the 
only player in the 1980s to reach the NCAA singles and doubles finals in the 
same year. Last year, Garrow and Pat Galbraith won the doubles title, and 
Garrow lost the singles championship to Pepperdine's Robbie Weiss. The Bruins 
also have Buff Farrow, who is ranked 11th in singles and who lost to Garrow in 
last year's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, which finished the year with a 13-13 record, was not selected for 
NCAA team competition. But Wave senior Grant Saacks will play in the individual 
singles competition that begins Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine and USC baseball teams, ranked among the nation's top 20 by 
Collegiate Baseball and Baseball America and both headed for the NCAA 
tournament, will make up a pair of games this week that were postponed by rain 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves, West Coast Athletic Conference champions and 40-16-1 overall, will 
play host to the Trojans (40-22) at 1 p.m. today at Eddy D. Field Stadium. The 
teams will meet again at 7 p.m. Friday at USC's Dedeaux Field. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine lost twice last week to Stanford, 1-0 and 2-1, despite strong 
pitching from Britt Craven and Wayne Helm. 
</P>
<P>
Pairings and seedings for the NCAA tournament will be announced Monday. Eight 
regionals will be played May 25-29, and the College World Series will be played 
June 2-10 at Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine senior center fielder Rick Hirtensteiner, named WCAC Player of the 
Year, was selected to the District 8 Academic All-American team sponsored by 
GTE and chosen by the College Sports Information Directors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Wave team awards were presented to junior outfielder Richard Barnwell, most 
improved; senior second baseman Matt Howard, best on defense; junior pitcher 
Kipp Landis, most inspirational; senior first baseman Scott Shockey, unsung 
hero; junior Britt Craven, best pitcher, and Hirtensteiner, most valuable. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA men's and women's track teams will compete in the Pac-10 championships 
on Saturday and Sunday at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Eight Santa Monica College athletes will compete in the state junior college 
track and field championships Saturday at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Corsairs and their events are Joyce Morgovenz at 800 meters, high jumpers Rene 
Dabney and Tanya Valentino, the 1,600-meter relay team of David Ross, Adelbert 
Baylis, Sidney Morris and Aaron Echols, the 4-by-100 relay team of Echols, 
Baylis, Morris and Derrick Davis, and Davis at 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine women tennis players Ginger Helgeson, Janna Kovacevich and Noelle 
Porter were named All-Americans after the Waves advanced to the quarterfinals 
of the NCAA team tournament last week. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th-seeded Waves won their opener against No. 7 Miami of Florida but were 
eliminated by No. 2 Florida, 5-4, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Helgeson and Kovacevich were All-Americans last year, but this year was the 
first time that three Pepperdine players received that honor in one season. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica College tennis players Jane Kwon and Karen Imber were named to the 
All-Western State Conference team in singles by a vote of conference coaches. 
Kwon played No. 2 singles for the Corsairs, and Imber, undefeated in dual 
matches, played at No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Imber and partner Michele Flamer were named to the conference second team in 
doubles, and selected on the second team in singles were Caroline Naggar and 
Nancy Kolod. Adrienne von Teuber, SMC's top singles player, received honorable 
mention.

Art Venegas comes across as an easygoing man, the type who would take that 
extra half step not to squash an insect. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean there isn't a competitive side to the UCLA assistant 
track and field coach in charge of weight events.

<P>
"Track's a little bit like gladiators going at it. It's a symbolic fight to the 
finish, and someone's going to come out lying on their shield," Venegas said. 
</P>
<P>
But then the nice guy adds: "Sometimes we feel like the other guys are leaving 
on their shields, but sometimes we just walk out knowing we've done the job 
right. . . . The ultimate for me would be for us to win the next 10 NCAA titles 
by one point each. That would show we respect the other teams." 
</P>
<P>
Venegas, in his eighth season at UCLA, is one of the reasons that Bruin 
opponents more often then not get the symbolic thumbs down. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins are two-time defending national and conference champions and have a 
dual meet winning streak of 43 (with one tie) dating to the end of 1984, which 
ties the school record set in 1972-76. This season the Bruins are 5-0-1 in dual 
meets, tying Louisiana State a month ago at Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The role of Venegas and his throwers has become more important this year for 
the Bruins, who for the last two seasons have been dominated by sprinters 
because of the loss of key team members. Kevin Young, who finished fourth in 
the Seoul Olympics in the intermediate hurdles, has graduated, and Danny 
Everett, who won two medals in Seoul in the 400 meters and 1,600-meter relay, 
has left to pursue commercial endorsements. Henry Thomas, who finished third in 
the 200 meters at the NCAA championships, is redshirting. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the throwers, whose accomplishments the last two years have been 
overshadowed by the sprinters, to pick up the slack and gain recognition. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of the throwers was most obvious two weeks ago when the Bruins 
defeated USC for the 11th consecutive year, by the misleading score of 93-68. 
On the track, UCLA was outscored 56-35 by Trojan sprinters, but Venegas' 
throwers dominated the field events, outscoring USC 58-12. 
</P>
<P>
"The attention the sprinters have gotten has been well deserved," Venegas said. 
"They've been winning national events and Olympic events. . . . There is a 
throwing community, and within that community our people are well-known and 
respected. Sometimes publicity is more important for high school athletes 
because college guys are more mature." 
</P>
<P>
Going back to last year's national meet, Venegas' throwers have been carrying 
more than their own weight. 
</P>
<P>
At the national championships last year, Bruin throwers accounted for 25 of the 
team's 82 points, led by Pete Thompson's and David Wilson's second-place 
finishes in the discus and hammer. Brian Blutreich, a highly recruited junior 
out of Mission Viejo, took third in the discus. 
</P>
<P>
This season Wilson, Blutreich and Eric Bergreen have qualified for the 
nationals in the shot put and Dave Bultman, a freshman from Simi Valley, has 
qualified for the Pac-10 shot. Blutreich, Thompson and Wilson have qualified 
for the nationals in the discus and Wilson and junior transfer John Knight from 
Agoura have qualified in the hammer. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins would be even deeper in weight events were it not for the departure 
of Kami Keshmiri, the Track and Field News Prep Athlete of the Year in 1987 who 
holds the national prep discus record. After injuring his knee, Keshmiri 
redshirted for the Bruins last year and has since left school. 
</P>
<P>
"We've scored in nationals every year since 1983," Venegas said. "Last year we 
had the highest point total in the nation. It's not like all of a sudden we 
have the people to do well. Perhaps sprinters is an area where we've had more 
people in the past, but this year is a temporary thing. The weight team is 
older this year, and more mature. They've been with me for a while. They're 
cool under fire." 
</P>
<P>
Venegas, 37, of Northridge was born in Tepic, Mexico, and moved to Los Angeles 
when he was 11. After graduating from St. Genevieve High in Panorama City, he 
was a four-year letterman in the hammer at Cal State Northridge and was a 
Division II All-American in 1974. He coached at Cal State Northridge in 1974-79 
and was an assistant at Cal State Long Beach for two years before then-Coach 
Jim Bush brought him to Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
With the success of some of his athletes, notably John Brenner, who holds the 
American record in the shot and discus, Venegas has become one of the experts 
on throwing. Last November he delivered a speech on the shot put to the 11th 
World Congress of the International Track and Field Coaches Assn. in Barcelona, 
Spain. In 1987 he was the featured speaker at the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation European Coaching Congress. He has also worked with the 
British and Spanish national teams. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've seen, he seems to be technically one of the best coaches," 
Blutreich said. "He catches little things no one else sees. He always has 
something to say and he's always open for new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Said Thompson: "He's always looking for an opportunity to make a point to 
improve his throwers both psychologically and technically. If I'm watching 
another thrower with him, he'll say something to make sure I'm learning 
something from that thrower, either something positive that he's doing right or 
something negative that he's doing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Venegas also coaches UCLA women throwers and his successes there have included 
1986 NCAA discus champion Toni Lutjens and 1988 All-American Kris Larson in the 
discuss. This year sophomore Tracie Millet qualified for Nationals with a 
javelin throw of 172-11, the best throw in eight years by a Bruin. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the men are more intense in practice than the women but that the 
women come around more during the meets," Venegas said. 
</P>
<P>
"My primary philosophy is that the No. 1 thing is that this is a learning 
experience. I'm here to learn too. It's a little bit like being in a classroom 
where they have to perform in an orderly fashion. It's different because the 
kids are here to compete. They're here because they want to do that."

The global trade in conventional weapons amounted to nearly $34 billion last 
year, down $5.5 billion from 1987's record level, the Stockholm International 
Peace Research Institute said. The institute, the world authority on the 
international arms trade, said in its 1989 yearbook that it recorded sales in 
1988 of $33.97 billion, down from the record 1987 figure of $39.5 billion. It 
also showed a long-term decline in Third World arms imports, from 68% of all 
sales in 1984 to 61% last year. "The overall size of the global arms trade 
market has remained stable in the 1980s but has stabilized at a high level," 
the report said.

The Energy Department has been forced to delay the scheduled September opening 
of a radioactive waste dump in New Mexico, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins 
told Congress. Watkins told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the 
Environmental Protection Agency had fallen far behind schedule in providing a 
legally required verification that toxic wastes at the repository would not 
migrate off the site. "We physically cannot get through this process until 
November," Watkins said, adding that, under normal procedures, it would take 
until next February before the EPA could hold public hearings on the waste 
migration issue. He gave no new target date for opening the $800-million 
underground repository near Carlsbad, N.M.

The Justice Department has deported the first Nicaraguan refugees from South 
Texas since it began detaining Central American asylum-seekers in February, 
officials said. Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said the 
deportations do not signal a change in policy and were delayed because "there 
were some bottlenecks." Although dozens of Salvadorans, Guatemalans and 
Hondurans have been deported since the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
began detaining Central American asylum-seekers on Feb. 20, no Nicaraguans had 
been deported until Monday. INS spokesman Duke Austin said 10 Nicaraguans were 
deported Monday and 16 on Tuesday, with deportation orders pending on more than 
100 others.

Maoist Shining Path rebels killed four people and exploded bombs across Peru to 
mark the ninth anniversary of the Maoist movement's first armed raid, police 
said. The killings brought to at least 31 the number of people slain in Shining 
Path attacks in the past three days. In recent weeks, the rebels have increased 
attacks on university and secondary school professors who have resisted 
guerrilla indoctrination in classrooms. Shining Path, or Sendero Luminoso, 
usually marks its anniversary with power blackouts and attacks on police posts. 
Its goal is to oust the government and forge a worker-peasant state along the 
lines of China under Mao Tse-tung.

Police in Rio de Janeiro arrested five men and recovered millions of dollars 
worth of art stolen earlier this month, including works by Salvador Dali and 
Henri Matisse, a Brazilian police officer said. Alvaro Luis Souza, who 
commanded a raid leading to the arrests, said that police, responding to a 
phone tip, staked out an apartment in Rio's Botafogo neighborhood and 
apprehended a man as he was leaving. The stolen goods were discovered, 
undamaged, inside the apartment. Souza said four other men were arrested hours 
later. Police still are searching for three more men they believe were involved 
in the May 3 robbery of the Chacara do Ceu Museum, Souza added. Police 
recovered all the stolen art except two Chinese ceramic sculptures from the 7th 
Century and a collection of silverware.

Lebanese Christians and Muslims staged a nationwide one-day strike in a unique 
show of unity to mourn the spiritual leader of the country's Sunni Muslims, who 
was assassinated in a car bombing. "Lebanon today mourns its knight, the martyr 
of national unity, Sheik Hassan Khaled," said the Voice of Lebanon Radio, 
mouthpiece of the Christian Falangist Party. Banks, government offices, shops, 
restaurants, movie theaters and other businesses closed in all areas, including 
Israel's self-proclaimed "security zone" in the south, police said. Khaled, 68, 
known as the Grand Mufti, was killed Tuesday along with 21 other people when a 
bomb went off as his car drove by in Muslim West Beirut. There has been no 
claim of responsibility.

A Senate panel approved a uniform poll-closing time of 10 p.m. EST for 
presidential elections in an effort to end network projections of results 
before all voters have cast their ballots. "I believe early projections before 
the polls close threaten the right of some voters to go to the polls and feel 
their votes count," said Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash.) after the 9-2 vote by the 
Senate Rules and Administration Committee. The poll-closing bill was approved 
as part of a package of unrelated measures, including a blueprint for having 
eight regional presidential primaries around the country with the Federal 
Election Commission determining the order of the events by lot.

THANKS TO PROGRAM, HOMELESS FAMILIES SLEEP BETTER AT NIGHT

The homeless couple couldn't believe what they were hearing. 
</P>
<P>
On May 3, Donald Mack, 35, and his fiancee, 36-year-old Linda McGhee, weary 
from months of living on the streets and in shelters, had just been told that 
they would be given two months' free rent, free job-placement counseling, free 
private schooling for their children and free child care for their unborn 
child. Free. 
</P>
<P>
They were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours before, Donald and Linda had been waiting patiently in a food line 
set up every Wednesday night by church workers at 11th Avenue and K Street 
downtown. Unshed tears shimmered in Linda's eyes as she gratefully received her 
plate. But, after hearing the amazing news from one of the workers, the tears 
streamed down her face. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who were married that night, became the first of 10 families chosen 
to participate in "Home Again," an innovative, nationwide program whose goal is 
to rid the country of homeless families, said Cecelia Thomas, co-coordinator of 
the San Diego program. 
</P>
<P>
As the Macks began to move into their new apartment Wednesday, Linda reflected 
in disbelief on their good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it. We had so many bad times that I came to a point where I 
said, 'There's no end to this.' I had nowhere to go or no one to turn to. I 
just started praying, 'Lord, there's got to be a better way.' I asked Him to 
send someone, and when they told me (about the program), 'I just said, Lord, 
you heard my prayers.' " 
</P>
<P>
After months of living in and out of shelters and spending occasional nights 
"on the curb," Donald Mack is relieved to have a permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing (on the street) but chaos," he said. "There's a few good 
people who have had bad times in life that's put them down there, but it's sad 
to see some of them." 
</P>
<P>
"Home Again" for the San Diego area is being operated through St. Stephen's 
Church of God in Christ in Southeast San Diego. The church has received a 
$10,000 grant from the U. S. Ministries division of World Vision, a Monrovia, 
Calif.-based international Christian agency that began the program March 1. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Ministries has designated 21 coordination sites for "Home Again" in 16 
cities to help about 120 families, said Jana Webb, the national coordinator. 
The participating churches are from San Diego, Long Beach, Pasadena, Glendale, 
Oakland, Fresno, Boston, Jackson, Miss.; Memphis, Tenn., Philadelphia, Chicago, 
Wheaton, Ill., Denver, Omaha, Detroit and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to contract with (churches) on a long-term basis to seriously 
impact homeless families in these cities," Webb said. "We want to eliminate 
homeless families totally. . . . Every three months we will begin another phase 
until we saturate the areas that have desperate homeless needs." 
</P>
<P>
St. Stephen's is also working in cooperation with 22 other San Diego churches 
to adopt the 10 homeless families, Thomas said. Depending on the size of the 
church, each will be responsible for adopting one family or sharing the 
responsibility with another church. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for families that are on the streets, where there is a desire 
to be reintroduced to a productive life style," said Bishop George D. McKinney, 
pastor of St. Stephen's. "Some homeless do not want to leave the streets. We 
are looking for the motivation and the strengths we can build on. 
</P>
<P>
"The church is saying we're going not only to identify a family and place them 
in an apartment building, but we will offer child care, day school, 
psychological and pastoral counseling and job placement," McKinney said. "We'll 
use the network we have to concentrate on getting the families from the streets 
back into the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Mack said he will begin work Monday at the Pacific Marine Sheet Metal 
Corp., installing and repairing ventilation systems aboard the amphibious 
assault ship Okinawa. Linda Mack, who said she has had problems finding a job 
since she suffered injuries from a car accident two years ago, said she may 
have to go on disability. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the couple, the new apartment means stability and the rebuilding of 
their families. Both have children from previous relationships that they hope 
to retain custody of once they have become settled, and Donald Mack is 
confident that they will soon be a complete family. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's been falling right into place," he said.

CENSUS BUREAU WILL STRIVE TO ENSURE THAT COUNTY'S INDIANS GET FAIR COUNT IN 
1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may not be readily apparent, but San Diego County has one of the largest 
Indian populations in the nation, living on 18 reservations and in its cities. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, officials from the federal Bureau of the Census expect to make a 
special effort to make a more accurate head count of tribal members 
concentrated here when the census is done next year. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Cleghorn-Vann, a community awareness specialist with the federal bureau, 
said analysis of the 1980 census indicated that certain ethnic groups were 
"under-counted" by as much as 6% a decade ago. It is Cleghorn-Vann's job to see 
that doesn't happen again for the Indian population in 13 California counties, 
including San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Her offensive began early this year, more than a year before the census 
questionnaires will be dropped into the mail on March 21, l990. A meeting of 
Indian leaders and representatives of organizations serving urban Indian groups 
drew a group of 30 and started the ball rolling to apply peer pressure on 
Indian families to stand up and be counted. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, she will return to conduct a training session for tribal delegates 
from each of the reservations on how to accomplish the task of having everyone 
living on the reservations counted. Although the census is again being 
conducted by mail, as it was in 1980, tribal rolls will aid in checking to see 
that all receive the questionnaires. Follow-ups by the trained tribal helpers 
will assure that all questionnaires are returned. 
</P>
<P>
"The big problem is in the urban areas," she said. "The task will be most 
difficult." There Indians and other of the under-counted groups blend in and 
are hard to ferret out for follow-up visits from census enumerators. 
</P>
<P>
She is enlisting the aid of organizations serving Indians: churches, athletic 
associations, social services departments, community-based groups of all kinds 
to pass the word that Indians must step forward and be counted if they expect 
to obtain the political power and government aid they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census is the basis for reshaping federal, state and local political 
districts and the basis for distributing $37 billion in federal aid, she 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Decker, bookkeeper for the Pauma band of Mission Indians, believes that 
the participation of tribal members in the census will help ensure a full count 
and a fair share for Indians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distrust of Government 
</P>
<P>
"Native Americans tend to distrust the government, especially the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs," she explained. Indians must realize that the tribes will not 
"get the things we need" if their numbers are diluted. 
</P>
<P>
In the last census, 83% of the nation's households returned their census 
questionnaires without prompting, Dan Conway, San Diego spokesman for the 
census bureau, said. Follow-ups by trained census workers brought the return 
rate up to 98.5%, but that still left at least 3 million Americans uncounted. 
</P>
<P>
"This time we are trying for the ripple effect, to get the word out to every 
group and to have each participate in the process," Cleghorn-Vann said. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledges that she probably does not have the hardest task in the 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials dealing with other minority groups, such as blacks, among whom 
an estimated 20% of young males went uncounted last time, newly arrived 
Indo-Chinese still struggling with the language barrier, illiterates, Latinos 
with many illegal immigrants among them and street people with no permanent 
addresses will have more problems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Rejected 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau had planned to use a sophisticated sampling system to 
recapture the uncounted Americans in 1990, but the Reagan Administration 
rejected the plan, and it became snarled in litigation by states and cities. 
</P>
<P>
California, which has the largest percentage of minority populations most 
likely to be "under-counted" in a census, has filed suit in an attempt to have 
the new estimating technique reinstated in time for the 1990 count. In 
contrast, other states are challenging the counting of illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Cleghorn-Vann said that the old-fashioned door-to-door method of conducting the 
U. S. census might resolve some of the problems faced by the mail census, but 
added that the cost is too great to be justified. 
</P>
<P>
"A questionnaire costs 22 cents to send out. A census enumerator probably costs 
about $25 a household," she said. "We must count on the follow-up visits to 
make up the difference."

SPRING MAKES FOR GREENER CITY SCHOOLS BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A well-publicized winter warning three months ago that San Diego city schools 
might have to cut $16.2 million in programs because of state funding problems 
has largely evaporated with the coming of spring. 
</P>
<P>
The latest estimates from the nation's eighth-largest school district show only 
a $4-million budget deficit for 1989-90. That figure could drop even more, 
depending on how Gov. George Deukmejian and state legislators negotiate 
allocations of $1.1 billion in unanticipated revenues announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego city schools Supt. Tom Payzant, who issued the warning of severe 
shortfalls Feb. 15, said Wednesday that the financial picture has improved 
considerably and will allow the district to avoid major cuts in instructional 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Wary About the Future 
</P>
<P>
But Payzant remained wary of predicting an even rosier scenario for next year, 
pointing out that there are both complex statutes regarding state spending 
limits and educational funding, and past difficulties between the governor and 
legislators in reaching agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The district still forecasts a budget for next fiscal year of about $517 
million, an increase of $28.4 million over this year's $489.2 budget. Almost 
all the increase is targeted for contract salary increases, inflationary costs 
in existing programs and costs associated with projects to accommodate an 
increase in the number of district students, such as the opening of two new 
schools next year. 
</P>
<P>
But the revenue picture has changed considerably, with estimates now totaling 
$513.3 million, contrasted with the $499.5 million forecast in February, an 
increase of $13.8 million. That leaves the district an estimated $4 million 
short at this still-early stage. The final budget is not adopted until 
September. 
</P>
<P>
District budget chief Henry Hurley said Wednesday that the revenue increases 
come from several areas, including: 
</P>
<P>
* Lottery money. The district now expects $170 per student from the California 
lottery, for a total of $19 million, the highest figures since the legalized 
gambling began four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
* State payments on past programs. Because the state now has more revenue, the 
district expects it to pay longstanding claims for educational programs it 
required but did not fund in whole, totaling $5 million for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
* Interest rates. The district will receive an extra $2 million from higher 
interest on deposits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Depends on Discussions 
</P>
<P>
The district could receive even more money depending on the outcome of 
discussions in Sacramento, Payzant said. If, in the worst case, there is no 
more money, $4 million in cuts would then be required, perhaps coming from 
maintenance, equipment, teaching materials and other areas not directly related 
to instruction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 98, approved in November to guarantee steady support of 
public education, schools are guaranteed about 40% of state general revenues, 
plus a large percentage of money that cannot otherwise be spent by the 
Legislature because it puts the state over the Gann constitutional limit 
approved in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant said that any more revenues under the Gann limit that the San Diego 
district receives will go to teachers. "That is the way we have structured our 
salary contracts," Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
The district last year reached a precedent-setting three-year contract with its 
teachers. In return for the flexibility to carry out school reforms, district 
trustees promised that salaries will increase annually at least the minimum 
provided for in cost-of-living adjustments by the governor and Legislature -- 
at present 3.2% -- but can rise higher if more funds are available. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego could plan new programs or expand existing curriculum offerings if it 
receives unrestricted Proposition 98 money in excess of the Gann limit, Payzant 
said. But, until now, Deukmejian has said that such funds should be used only 
for specific mandated programs such as drug education and class-size reduction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compromise Hoped For 
</P>
<P>
Schools districts throughout California have argued that they should be under 
no restrictions on how to spend any Gann excess funds, because they might 
consider dropout prevention or counseling programs or new textbooks as more 
important priorities. 
</P>
<P>
The passage of Proposition 98, by reserving money for schools, has also 
resulted in potentially severe funding shortfalls for health and social service 
programs. Deukmejian and key legislators said Wednesday that they hope 
negotiations will bring about a compromise on splitting extra revenues between 
education and other services, including transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant said Wednesday that a compromise is reasonable "but not a total 
rollback . . . not at the total expense of education after all the work we have 
done to make sure that education is adequately supported." 
</P>
<P>
In any compromise, Payzant said, he will argue for fewer restrictions on 
Proposition 98 money given to schools.

'VISUAL BLIGHT' IN SOLANA BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
3-YEAR-OLD CITY WORRIED ABOUT REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Solana Beach, concerned that it is not aging gracefully, has 
committed $60,800 to plan a face lift in the form of downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, acting as the city's 2-month-old redevelopment agency, 
approved the expenditure at a Monday meeting. Contracts were awarded Monday to 
RSG Consulting of San Diego, which will put together a redevelopment plan, and 
Cotton Beland Associates of Encinitas, which will prepare a state-mandated 
environmental impact report. The reports are expected to be completed in nine 
months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
The area pinpointed for the redevelopment study is the corridor along Highway 
101 -- now an eclectic potpourri of structures housing everything from families 
to law offices, surf shops and health food restaurants. Eden Gardens, a 
run-down residential area to the south of town between Highway 101 and 
Interstate 5, is not now under consideration for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Most Potential 
</P>
<P>
The Highway 101 strip is "not necessarily being singled out because that's the 
part that is most exposed to visitors passing through," said City Manager 
Michael Huse. "It's just the area that holds the most potential, and the one 
that is of the most immediate concern because of development projects that are 
taking place there now." 
</P>
<P>
To establish a redevelopment district, the state requires that "blight" exist 
in the area. Although downtown Solana Beach may not be exactly economically 
disadvantaged, Huse said there is growing community sentiment that "visual 
blight" does exist in the nearly 3-year-old city. 
</P>
<P>
An abandoned service station that has been used as both a bicycle repair shop 
and a produce stand in recent years is one example of a property that might be 
considered "under-utilized," Huse said. Other areas that could use some shoring 
up include an abandoned trailer park and some boarded-up buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are other businesses that, more than likely over the course of time, 
will be recycled to a different use, just because, as the value of the property 
escalates, those people in there now will not be able to pay their rents," Huse 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Workshops 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment effort was helped along by two public workshops in January, 
which drew considerable feedback from the community. Although no design or 
theme specifics have been decided upon, most felt it was important to establish 
some guidelines to preserve the quaint beach-town feel of the area, Huse said. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency is hoping that private property owners in the 
redevelopment area will willingly cooperate by "revitalizing" their own 
properties to suit the design plan, Huse said. Loans or grants may be made 
available to property owners through the redevelopment plan, to refurbish their 
buildings or at least add some cosmetic touches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city will concentrate on public improvements such as parking lots, parks, 
landscaping and sewer-line upgradings, Huse said. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the redevelopment agency would prefer not to use powers of 
eminent domain to condemn property, he said.

MANHATTAN BEACH OKS PLAN FOR SENIORS HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four private investors have cleared a major hurdle in their plan to construct 
Manhattan Beach's first senior citizen housing on the site of a former athletic 
club. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members Tuesday unanimously approved the zoning change needed to 
build 48 one-bedroom apartments on a one-acre site on Sepulveda Boulevard 
across from Manhattan Village Mall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an historic occasion," said Millie Anderson, president of the Manhattan 
Beach Senior Housing Foundation. "It's so exciting to think we're actually 
going to get something built." 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Anderson and Councilman Bob Holmes, a supporter of the project, 
said the plan does not go far enough in meeting the needs of the city's growing 
number of seniors. A city-sponsored survey in 1987 found that there was an 
immediate demand for at least 159 senior housing units. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two said the apartments slated to be built will not serve those 
elderly people who must subsist on a small pension or a Social Security check. 
The project's investors have said that although they expect to subsidize rents 
to some extent, the housing will be geared toward seniors with significant 
financial resources. Rents are expected to range between $600 and $700. 
</P>
<P>
However, Holmes said the project should help alleviate the opposition some 
residents have expressed to subsidized senior housing being built in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The project will be built entirely with private money. 
</P>
<P>
"I think once people see some nice seniors' housing in place, so much of the 
unnecessary fear is going to go away," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, various proposals to build senior housing have either been 
abandoned or placed on hold. The high price of property, as well as community 
resistance to subsidized housing, have been major stumbling blocks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Separate Zoning Classification 
</P>
<P>
To facilitate construction, the council last year passed an ordinance that 
places senior housing in a separate zoning classification. Under that 
classification, the housing can be built with lower minimum-square-footage 
requirements and fewer parking spaces than other apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Any property zoned for senior housing would have to be rezoned before it could 
be used for another use, including apartments available to all age groups. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's council meeting, a handful of residents voiced concerns over the 
project's impact on the neighborhood. Several said they feared that the 
apartments could increase the area's traffic and parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
Adele Green, who owns two homes near the planned project, also questioned 
whether city regulations were tight enough to prevent people other than seniors 
from living in the apartments. City law requires that the head of each 
household be at least 62 but would not prevent younger people from living 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"What is to keep younger people from living in the project?" Green asked 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
Council members countered that because the units will be small, it is unlikely 
that they will attract families. Plans call for each apartment to have slightly 
more than 500 square feet of living space. 
</P>
<P>
The project site includes the former Manhattan Athletic Club for Men. It is 
bounded by Valley Drive, Manhattan Beach Parkway, Sepulveda Boulevard and the 
intersection of Elm Avenue and Valley Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Once the vacant athletic club is razed, plans call for the construction of four 
two-story buildings. William Riddle, one of the investors, said construction 
could start within nine months and be completed a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Riddle, the other investors include Jason Lane, Ivano Stamegna and 
Donna Ross.

REDONDO RETAINS MODERATE COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
PARTON LEADS 'CLEAN SWEEP' OF CONTROLLED-GROWTH CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a runoff election that retains a moderate-growth alignment on the City 
Council, Redondo Beach voters have selected 28-year-old W. Brad Parton as the 
city's new mayor, reelected Councilwoman Kay Horrell to a second term in 
District 2 and brought in newcomer Terry Ward to represent District 4. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome was a "clean sweep . . . (that) put the people in place that we 
need to accomplish a series of things," said District 5 Councilman Ron Cawdry, 
a member of the majority in power over the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
Cawdry, who was not up for reelection, said he campaigned hard for the three 
winners. He introduced them to an exuberant crowd at Horrell's victory 
celebration at Pancho and Wong's restaurant late Tuesday night after the votes 
were tabulated. 
</P>
<P>
The series of things to be accomplished, he said later, include completing a 
revised General Plan, developing more park space and rebuilding King Harbor and 
the Redondo Pier, which were devastated by floods and a fire last year. 
</P>
<P>
The minority on the new council, after the runoff winners are sworn in Tuesday, 
will be Councilwoman Barbara Doerr, who won the District 1 seat in the March 
general election after serving eight years as mayor, and Councilman Stevan 
Colin, who was elected to the District 3 post in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
There was a runoff because no candidates for the three posts at stake Tuesday 
received a majority of votes in the March balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Parton, who owns a retirement investment firm, received 3,669 votes, or 55.7% 
of the total cast, while his runoff opponent, architect Frank Bostrom, got 
2,914, or 44.3% 
</P>
<P>
In the District 2 race, real estate agent Horrell won with 891 votes, or 52.4%, 
compared to 811, or 47.6%, for Michael F. Ford, a real estate appraiser. Ward, 
a data communications consultant, took the District 4 seat with 528 votes, or 
52.2%, while school board member Valerie Dombrowski received 483, or 47.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Dombrowski narrowly missed victory in the general election, falling only four 
votes short of the 50%-plus-one majority needed to be declared the winner. 
</P>
<P>
She said her chances in the runoff were hurt by personal attacks on her family 
from Ward's supporters and by Ward's success in registering about 150 new 
voters who supported his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not bitter," Dombrowski said. "I'm not shattered." 
</P>
<P>
At her victory party, Horrell faulted the losing faction for being "so negative 
and down on everything. . . . I think they scared some voters by their meat-ax 
approach" to the city's concerns about overdevelopment and traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
In response to those concerns, Horrell said, the present council has 
"practically downzoned the entire city" over the past four years. She said she 
believes the new council "will continue to take a moderate approach that allows 
for quality, controlled growth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stricter Limits 
</P>
<P>
The opposition faction, which advocated stricter limits on growth, blamed the 
outcome Tuesday on what Bostrom called "dirty political tactics" and on heavy 
campaign spending by the winners. 
</P>
<P>
Parton, Horrell and Ward spent a total of about $60,000, compared to about 
$15,000 by the three opposing candidates, Bostrom, Ford and Dombrowski. 
</P>
<P>
Mayoral candidate Bostrom, who watched at City Hall as his opponent seized a 
commanding lead in votes at the outset and maintained it to the end, blamed his 
defeat on a last-minute mailer sent out by Parton over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind," Bostrom said, characterizing Parton's mailer 
as a "hit piece" that used "character-assassination" tactics. He provided 
copies of flyers that suggested Bostrom had a "hidden agenda" for development 
in Redondo Beach and that questioned statements in Bostrom's resume about his 
accomplishments as an architect and volunteer community worker. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer asserted that Bostrom was one of three candidates "backed by the 
political machine." 
</P>
<P>
Parton, who raised the specter of a political machine frequently during the 
runoff campaign, said in an interview last week that he was referring to a 
"tight, little group that attacks me in a variety of ways but doesn't get down 
to the issues." He declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cardinal Error' 
</P>
<P>
Bostrom said he had a response mailer prepared but decided not to send it out 
because the cost would have pushed him over a self-imposed limit of $10,000 on 
campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably made a cardinal error, politically," he said. "But I said, '$10,000 
is my limit and I'm not going to spend another nickel.' " 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Parton, who depicted himself as an independent in the 
campaign, would buckle under pressure from developers during his tenure as 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
At a boisterous victory celebration at his home, Parton was busy making 
telephone calls to supporters, including his parents in San Jose and a close 
friend in New York. He defended his mailers as "all fact" and attributed his 
victory to hard work, which he said focused on walking much of the city 
door-to-door. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also liked his independent stance, he said. "I was not part of any 
slate," he said. "I was out there running on my own." 
</P>
<P>
On the campaign spending issue, Parton said he needed to spend more money than 
Bostrom because his opponent had been backed by politically well-known figures, 
such as Doerr and Dombrowski. 
</P>
<P>
Parton also discounted Bostrom's prediction that he would be influenced by 
developers. "I've got my ethics and my integrity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ward, who will replace outgoing Councilman Archie Snow in District 4, seemed a 
bit flabbergasted by his victory over Dombrowski, a longtime community activist 
and school trustee for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I came from behind (after the March election)," said Ward, a political novice. 
"But we managed to build momentum . . . the more I walked and talked, the 
better I fit in with how (voters) felt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Development Views 
</P>
<P>
He said the voters he met generally agreed with his views on development. "I've 
said from the beginning that I want controlled, quality growth," he said. "But 
I don't think we can stop growth entirely, because if you stop growth, you 
die." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night also was sweet for Snow, who lost his bid for the mayor's post in 
March and then went on to campaign for Ward. "I kind of like the way things 
turned out," he said above the clamor at Horrell's party. 
</P>
<P>
Snow was viewed by some as the council majority's leader during his eight years 
in office, in part because of his frequent verbal clashes with former Mayor 
Doerr. The City Charter barred both from running for third terms in their 
respective posts. 
</P>
<P>
Colin, who has been Doerr's only ally during his first year on the council, 
struck a conciliatory note Wednesday at the conclusion of the often-rancorous 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to working with Brad, and I think he will be a good mayor," he 
said. "I don't know a lot about Terry (Ward) yet, but I think he'll be fair. . 
. . Basically, we all want to do what's best for Redondo Beach."

CENTINELA WILL KEEP EMERGENCY ROOM OPEN TO OBSTETRIC PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Centinela Hospital Medical Center has agreed to continue treating emergency 
obstetric patients after May 26, although it will refuse to accept other 
patients brought in by paramedics after that date, hospital and county 
officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the Inglewood hospital and the county supersedes 
Centinela's earlier decision to withdraw completely from the emergency care 
system and apparently lays to rest fears that it would create a domino effect, 
prompting other hospitals to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
After Centinela announced in March it would soon stop taking paramedic 
patients, Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne announced it had filed 
for state permission to close its doors to paramedic patients. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital said it feared an increase in obstetric patients that it could not 
properly treat. Centinela is the only hospital in its immediate area with an 
obstetrics unit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a potential disaster just waiting to happen," Carl Williams, director 
of hospital services for the county's Department of Health Services, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I am really tickled on behalf of the community," Williams added. "I am pleased 
we have been able to come to an agreement on this." 
</P>
<P>
A Kennedy spokeswoman said the hospital had not yet formally withdrawn its 
application to stop taking paramedic patients. However, the hospital will "look 
favorably" toward doing so, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The one-year agreement, which is expected to be approved by the county Board of 
Supervisors next week, calls for the county to give Centinela access to a 
Medi-Cal eligibility worker. The worker will help the hospital file the 
sometimes burdensome and time-consuming paper work necessary to prove to state 
officials that a patient qualifies for Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the county will pay Centinela the amount the county would typically 
receive for a Medi-Cal patient, should a patient fail to qualify for the state 
assistance. That amounts to about $800 a day. In addition, the county will also 
pay Centinela a flat $5,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
As for physicians, the county will pay them what they would typically receive 
for caring for a Medi-Cal patient, and then bill the state, according to Eric 
Tuckman, Centinela's general counsel. At present, doctors receive $450 from 
Medi-Cal for a normal delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, doctors will also be covered by the county's own insurance 
against malpractice suits. Centinela has maintained that many obstetric 
patients brought to the hospital by rescue ambulance are high-risk patients who 
pose a greater liability threat to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Centinela, which cited ballooning debts in obtaining state permission to close 
its emergency room doors to paramedic patients, had originally planned to stop 
taking the patients on April 26. However, it delayed its decision after a trio 
of public interest law groups threatened to sue unless the hospital attempted 
to negotiate with the county to find a way to treat obstetric patients. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the agreement, Centinela officials said the facility will still lose 
money treating the 30 or so obstetric patients that are typically brought to 
the hospital each month by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Centinela President Russell Stromberg said he was glad 
negotiations proved fruitful. "We are pleased we have been able to work it 
out," he said. "It avoids a current crisis."

CARSON SEEKS WAYS TO CLEAN UP, DEVELOP 157-ACRE DUMP SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Carson Redevelopment Agency unanimously agreed Tuesday to seek proposals to 
clean up and develop a 157-acre hazardous waste dump near the intersection of 
the San Diego and Harbor freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Although Carson does not own the Cal Compact dump site, the city believes 
development proposals could speed resolution of a protracted battle in federal 
Bankruptcy Court about one of the largest undeveloped parcels in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The city's request suggests that the property between Main Street and Avalon 
Boulevard near the freeway crossroads of the South Bay can best be used for 
commercial, high-tech or light-manufacturing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Carson is seeking a developer with financial resources and expertise in 
handling properties contaminated with hazardous waste. The proposals are due by 
July 16. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, plans for the development of the land have included a mobile 
home park proposed by one-time fireworks magnate W. Patrick Moriarty, a 
high-rise hotel and office complex suggested by Newport Beach developer Jorge 
J. Yavar, and a football stadium for the Raiders sought by Carson officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal, Environmental Problems 
</P>
<P>
But nothing can be built until a thicket of legal and environmental problems 
surrounding the grass and weed-covered dump site are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the land contains an estimated 1.2 million barrels of 
liquid hazardous waste, legally dumped at the landfill in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone involved with the site believes there are hazardous materials at the 
site," said Jim Marxen, spokesman for the Toxic Substances Control Division of 
the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides and solvents have been found in the soil, 
and petrochemicals, paints, dyes, resins and salts are believed to have been 
dumped there, Marxen said. Methane gas also has been detected, and ground water 
under the landfill is believed to be polluted, Marxen said. 
</P>
<P>
The dump site was used extensively by oil companies to dispose of oil drilling 
mud, waste paint, tank bottom sludge, solvents and waste oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study and Cleanup 
</P>
<P>
Current plans call for a two-year study beginning this summer to determine the 
extent and type of wastes present, Marxen said. That work will be paid for by 
two companies that had used the site to legally dispose of wastes. It is 
unclear who would pay for the cleanup, which would take an additional two 
years. The cleanup -- one of the largest ever in Southern California -- is not 
expected to be completed until September, 1993, at the earliest, a prospect 
that does not please Carson officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to get the four years underway," City Atty. Glenn R. Watson 
said. Preliminary drilling and testing to determine the extent of the pollution 
problem is expected to cost up to $2 million, Watson said. The price tag for 
cleaning up the property could range from $15 million to $40 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said the city wants to expedite development of the blighted land at the 
gateway to Carson. If necessary, he said, the city might use its eminent domain 
power to acquire the land. "The property ought to be developed," he said. "It 
has been tied up in Bankruptcy Court for three years." 
</P>
<P>
The land is owned by a partnership, World Industrial Center Ltd., which is 
controlled by Robert A. Ferrante, an Orange County businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante is the former owner of Consolidated Savings Bank of Irvine, which was 
seized by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. in May, 1986. The 
S&amp;L had outstanding loans secured by the Carson property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Banking Agency 
</P>
<P>
Carol Schatz, the FSLIC's western region deputy director, said the federal 
agency welcomes "the city of Carson's effort to solicit a qualified developer." 
</P>
<P>
Schatz said the agency looks forward to negotiations that will lead to a 
reorganization plan in Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
After taking over Ferrante's failed savings and loan, the FSLIC contended in a 
lawsuit that Consolidated Savings Bank lent millions of dollars to Pyrotronics 
Inc., the Anaheim-based fireworks company once headed by Moriarty. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Moriarty headed a partnership, Casa Del Amo Estates, that 
leased the Carson dump site. Casa Del Amo tried unsuccessfully to develop the 
land as a mobile home park, but state health officials blocked the project 
because of concern about hazardous waste problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moriarty's Conviction 
</P>
<P>
Moriarty pleaded guilty to mail fraud charges in 1985 relating to kickbacks 
paid to an official of the California Canadian Bank and city officials in 
Commerce and was sentenced to federal prison. After serving 29 months of a 
five-year term, he was released last November. 
</P>
<P>
The release came in an agreement with federal prosecutors, who dropped mail 
fraud convictions relating to the bribery of Commerce officials to obtain a 
poker license for the California Commerce Club. Moriarty agreed not to appeal 
the convictions in the bank case. The agreement followed a U.S. Supreme Court 
decision that narrowed use of mail fraud statutes in political corruption 
cases, making it virtually certain that Moriarty's convictions would be 
reversed. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the state ordered 14 companies it said are responsible for dumping 
hazardous wastes at the landfill to begin studies to identify the extent of the 
pollution problem. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the companies, BKK, Corp. and Chansler Ogden, a transport company, 
have responded to the state's order, Marxen said. "The other 12 are out of 
compliance." 
</P>
<P>
The companies that have not responded include Chevron, Arco, Unocal, Shell, 
Conoco, Mobil, Texaco, Buttram Oil Co., Long Beach Oil Development Co., 
Allied-Signal Inc., Deutsch Co., and Del Amo Gardens Inc., Marxen said.

INGLEWOOD RELISHING ALL-AMERICA CITY STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Civic pride is on the upsurge in Inglewood this week, after city officials 
brought the prestigious All-America City Award home to the self-proclaimed 
"City of Champions." Inglewood won the award, given annually by the National 
Civic League, after a grueling two-day competition in Chicago, emerging as one 
of 10 winning cities from a field that originally included 109 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
At Inglewood City Hall, hopes are high that the award will go a long way toward 
polishing the city's image. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they will use the honor to publicize Inglewood as a 
middle-class, multi-ethnic city where residents and officials have successfully 
joined together to reduce crime rates and beat back drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The city will advertise the award by adding the "All-America" designation to 
everything from official city stationery to street signs and the prominent 
"Welcome to Inglewood" sign that greets visitors at the city's Manchester 
Boulevard entrance, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll definitely know you're in an All-America city," said Mayor Edward 
Vincent. "We're going to have it on our driveways, our storefronts -- we're 
going to have it everywhere that we're an All-America city." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Undeserved Reputation 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood was the only city in California to receive the honor. 
</P>
<P>
In their written application for the award, city officials said Inglewood has 
traditionally battled against an undeservedly bad reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"The community suffers from an inferiority complex not of their own making," 
the application read. "Partly because of the relatively high crime rate, but 
mostly because of a Southern California perception that it is higher than it 
really is, some people are embarrassed or reluctant to admit they live in 
Inglewood or work there." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, crime rates are declining in Inglewood, city officials said. For 
example, there were 499 narcotics arrests from May to July of 1987, but by the 
same period in 1988 that figure had declined by about 30%, to 346 arrests, 
after the city implemented a "reverse sting" undercover police program to catch 
drug buyers, said Assistant City Manager Norman Cravens. 
</P>
<P>
The Inglewood Police Department, city officials and private companies then 
collaborated on an advertising campaign to publicize the program, Cravens said. 
So far, the Inglewood Police Department has made more than 300 buyer arrests in 
19 reverse sting operations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Denver-based organization that sponsors the award praised 
Inglewood for that program and others developed by city officials, residents 
and the Police Department within the last year to combat drug dealing and gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Crime Unit 
</P>
<P>
"We look for communities that have a strong capacity for problem-solving," said 
Tamara Davis, the league's program coordinator. "Inglewood has definitely shown 
that they do." 
</P>
<P>
The league cited Inglewood's formation of a 20-officer unit to fight street 
crime -- approved by 78% of the voters in a proposition last November. The 
proposition allowed officials to increase taxes to fund the $1.4-million 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The league also extolled Inglewood's anti-drug efforts, including its Drug 
Abuse Resistance Education program (DARE) to prevent drug abuse among 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Inglewood was a finalist in the competition but didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
This year, city officials boned up on public-speaking techniques to improve 
their presentation before the jury and also highlighted new programs that were 
not in place a year ago, Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
The mood was jubilant at Tuesday's City Council meeting, where a certificate 
and plaque from the National Civic League were on display. Officials played 
videotapes of their presentation before the 11-member National Civic League 
jury in Chicago and recessed briefly to celebrate the award with cake and 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked hard, but we've got to work harder to stay on top," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile Court Judge Roosevelt Dorn, who was among eight officials and 
residents representing the city at the competition, said Inglewood "gets a 
black eye for (crimes) that aren't even committed in Inglewood." 
</P>
<P>
With the award in hand, however, residents and officials are hopeful of a more 
clean-cut image for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be just a tremendous boost to the morale of many of the 
citizens in the community," Dorn said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A card game between two men who were reportedly known to be good friends ended 
with the death of one after the other shot him several times with a revolver, 
police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Henry Jones, 69, of Logan Heights, was pronounced dead at the scene in 
the 7800 block of Bloomfield Road in Southeast San Diego about 6 p.m. Police 
arrested the man who lived at the house, Roland Grooms, 25, on suspicion of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Grooms was being held without bail in the San Diego County Jail Wednesday night 
and was scheduled to be arraigned at 10 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found the body of Jones, who had been shot several times in the upper 
body, outside the house. Grooms called police to report the shooting shortly 
after it occurred, according to Sgt. Frank Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that the two, who had been good friends until the 
incident, were playing cards in the house when they began arguing, Martinez 
said. Jones pulled out a 2- to 3-inch pocket knife and cut Grooms, Martinez 
said. Then Grooms reportedly ran outside to Jones' car, where he knew there was 
a handgun in the glove compartment. 
</P>
<P>
When Jones approached Grooms with the knife again, Grooms pointed the handgun 
he found in the glove compartment at Jones and fired several fatal shots, said 
Martinez, who was unsure whether the card game had involved money.

INCEST VICTIM SAYS MORE AT ISSUE THAN JUDGMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old woman who won a $750,000 judgment in a suit against her father 
says the jury's recognition of her as a victim of sexual abuse was more 
important than the money. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I had been wronged meant a lot to me," Jennifer Hawley said 
Tuesday during a news conference at the San Diego office of her attorney, James 
Scott. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a San Diego Superior Court jury awarded the judgment to Hawley after 
finding that her adoptive father, Ronald, caused emotional distress through 
molestations. 
</P>
<P>
The abuses occurred when Hawley was 13 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The jury's decision followed a four-day trial and a half day of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Hawley said she brought the suit in the hope her father 
would seek and receive counseling and to try to prevent similar cases from 
happening to other children. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that, from the beginning, the motivation was not the 
ultimate collection (of a reward)," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley said her younger sister and older brother never were molested by her 
father, although she said she was victimized repeatedly between Christmas, 
1981, and Mother's Day, 1982, while the family lived in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
She said she told her mother about her father's actions the day after Mother's 
Day, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges were filed against Ronald Hawley, reportedly because he was 
the sole wage earner in the family, and the mother feared disastrous financial 
consequences for the family should her husband go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
The couple divorced after the molestations, although the family continues to 
receive financial support from Ronald Hawley, who works as a civil servant. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Hawley filed the suit after she turned 18.

SOCIETY: ONLY IN LA JOLLA: CAR-WASH CREW IN BLACK TIE FOR SAKE OF RETARDED

<P>
The thoroughly genteel, correct, proper, well-bred and Emily Post-like response 
to the opportunities presented by the second annual Black Tie Car Wash &amp; 
Cafe, to be given June 17 as a benefit for the San Diego County Mental Health 
Hospital, would be to drive one's vehicle through a commercial car wash before 
taking it to La Jolla to be scrubbed by a band of formally dressed civic 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
It would be vastly more polite, without question, to present an immaculate auto 
to the sponges wielded by such volunteers as former Police Chief Bill Kolender 
and UC San Diego Chancellor Dick Atkinson than to bring in a vehicle covered 
with the baked-on grime of a monthlong journey through Baja California. 
Sponsors of the event remain confident that individuals who once received 
parking tickets or were placed on academic probation will not take advantage of 
the situation by driving up in automobiles that most recently were taken 
off-roading through mud bogs and cow pastures. 
</P>
<P>
Kolender shares chairmanship duties with Nancy Hester, who founded the event 
last year and also is known as the founder of La Jolla's annual Off-the-Wall 
Street Dance, the enduring summer frolic always given on the last Sunday of 
August as a benefit for the UCSD School of Medicine. Campy, tongue-in-cheek 
touches are the norm at both events, and, at the Black Tie Car Wash, they will 
include entertainment by one-man-band Ira Cobb; brunch and lunch prepared under 
the supervision of food mavens George Munger and John Baylin, and a bar 
(non-alcoholic beverages only; the group discourages drinking and driving) 
presided over by society bartender Ed Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A large group of notables has signed on to wash cars in the parking lot behind 
the San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank office on Girard Avenue, including 
sports broadcaster Charlie Jones, retired Marine Corps Gen. Louis Metzger, 
banker Bob Adelizzi, John Murphy, Kate Adams and Janet Gallison. The car wash 
and cafe will be held between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., and tickets are priced at 
$15. For further information, contact Nancy Hester. 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO -- Sponsors of Saturday's "Come Sail With Us" benefit for the Assn. 
for Retarded Citizens-San Diego expected sweet results from the gala dinner and 
auction, given in the Marina Ballroom at the San Diego Marriott for 275 guests. 
</P>
<P>
The net proceeds will be divided among the eight countywide ARC programs. One 
that will share in the bounty is Archer's Confectionary, a Carlsbad candy 
kitchen 
</P>
<P>
that employs the mentally retarded and hopes to acquire two new candy machines 
that will allow it to significantly expand its operations and payroll. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be able to increase employment at Archer's when we get these machines," 
said Richard Farmer, executive director of ARC-SD. " 'Come Sail With Us' will 
help us to put more of the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled to 
work. The more employment we are able to offer the handicapped, the less of a 
burden they are on society." 
</P>
<P>
The event took its theme from one of its main live auction offerings, a 17-foot 
power runabout; in a cheerful echo of this major item, the silent auction 
included an inflatable dinghy for those bidders who feel most comfortable when 
they are nearest the shore. Among other items up for bid were a kind of reverse 
ploy on Arizonans entitled "Zonies Beware," in which a pair of San Diego 
tourists will be shipped off to Phoenix for the weekend, and a luncheon aboard 
the historic Cyrus K. Holliday private railroad car. 
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman Char Nordell emphasized that funds raised by ticket sales and the 
auctions will go directly to benefit ARC clients. 
</P>
<P>
"The proceeds will be used for capital equipment that will benefit client 
development, and not for any other purposes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Honorary chairmen Jaci and John Einhorn led a guest list that included Carol 
and Jim Davis, state Sen. Wadie Deddeh (D-Chula Vista), Nancy Garland, Jane and 
Willis Fletcher, Susan and Ed Fuller, Dean Nordell, Ann and Steve Hall, Leslie 
Autry, Judy Fivecoat, Richard Shea and Bonnie Mackey. 
</P>
<P>
A "Frisbee dance," even when performed by free-style Frisbee champions Stacy 
Anderson and Rick Castiglia, might not set quite the desired tone at the 
run-of-the-mill fashion luncheon, but it was a natural for "Sports Stars in 
Style," given May 1 by the Hall of Champions Auxiliary in the Mission Ballroom 
at the Town &amp; Country Hotel for more than 525 guests. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson and Castiglia set the tone for the dozens of participating athletes 
(the roster included six members of the San Diego Sockers and Chargers 
quarterback Mark Vlasic), who often can be reticent in public, but decided to 
camp things up a bit as they swept down the runway in fashions from The 
Highlander and Lillie Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Virginia Monday organized the fund-raiser for the Balboa Park sports 
museum's summer youth program. 
</P>
<P>
"The children are going to be so happy because of what this show will make 
possible for them," she said. The event netted $30,000, and museum President 
Ron Fowler said 5,000 youngsters are expected to participate in the summer 
program of entertainment and water and sports safety film presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the on-stage cavortings of Stars &amp; Stripes navigator Peter Isler, 
football Hall of Fame honoree Ron Mix and champion surfer Jim (Mouse) Robb, the 
day offered silent and live auctions that included a goodly number of 
sports-related offerings. The most hotly contested item -- travel arrangements 
and a pair of tickets to the September semifinals of the U.S. Tennis Open in 
New York -- sold for $2,700. 
</P>
<P>
Harriett Fowler co-chaired a committee that included Kay Rippee, Lynn Silva, 
Linda Saxon, Diane Pastore, Linda Horrell, Barbara Rieger, Sara Jackson, 
Jennifer Heft, Barbara Franovich, Lynn Luckey-Thompson, Barbara Malone, Fran 
Golden, Rosemary Logan, Pat Lijewski and Betty Hubbard.

City officials demonstrated last week that they are willing to put their money 
-- more than $13 million, in fact -- behind a pledge to save the slopes north 
of the city from suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unanimously approved a letter of intent last week to buy 1,345 
acres of rustic hillside land from a group of owners, the largest of which is 
Pomona College. After taking title, Claremont will annex the property, which 
constitutes almost half of the unincorporated area within the city's sphere of 
influence and includes the historic Padua Hills Theater. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Glenn Southard said the city plans to recoup the purchase cost -- 
between $13 million and $18 million, depending on when escrow closes during the 
next three years -- by selling off about 145 acres in the lower foothills to 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permanent Open Space 
</P>
<P>
The remainder, "an area larger than Central Park in New York City," will be 
designated as permanent open space. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase is the culmination of a decade-long effort by Claremont leaders to 
extend city control over development into the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pretty big step for us," Southard said. "I don't think we're the 
first town to preserve the hillsides . . . (but) I think for a town the size of 
Claremont, this is a very bold purchase." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Gibbens, Pomona College's vice president for development, said the limited 
partnership that owns the property had not originally intended to sell the land 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't necessarily the transaction we sought," Gibbens said. "Some of the 
directors were uncomfortable about the risk involved in the project for the 
city. But the city is a very determined buyer and there's no doubt that we're 
pleased about the prospect that the hillsides will be protected." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hostile Takeover' 
</P>
<P>
However, the purchase does not please some residents of neighboring 
unincorporated areas. To them, the planned purchase raises the threat of a 
"hostile takeover" of their neighborhoods. They contend it is a ploy by the 
city to pave the way for annexation, which they claim is opposed by 70% of 
foothill residents. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have made no secret of their desire to annex the unincorporated 
foothills. In recent months, Councilwomen Judy Wright and Diann Ring have met 
with residents, seeking to convince them of the advantages of being in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has not been able to capture the hearts and minds of the people in 
the county areas, so they have bought up all the land surrounding them," said 
George Keeler, co-founder of Hillside Environment and Land Protection (HELP), a 
group of about 100 foothill homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Keeler said residents' anti-annexation sentiment is rooted in their desire to 
preserve their bucolic life style and avoid the "persnickety regulations" 
imposed by city government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costly Move 
</P>
<P>
They also worry that joining Claremont would be a costly move, specifically 
because the city would hook their homes up to its sewer system and bill them 
for the cost through assessment districts. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that we don't have a hostile takeover that, if you're 
annexed, it's because you want to be," said Janet Myhre, another founding 
member of HELP. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city's annexation of the 1,345 acres it is purchasing would not 
necessarily make it easier to annex adjoining areas, according to Michi 
Takahashi, an administrative assistant with the county Local Agency Formation 
Commission (LAFCO), which must approve all annexations. 
</P>
<P>
In areas with more than 12 homeowners, annexation cannot take place if 50% or 
more of the registered voters file written protests. If 25% or more protest, 
annexation must be approved by residents at the polls, Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
Southard said he believes Claremont's plans to designate such a large parcel as 
open space should help prove the city's sincerity to residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope they'll take this as a sign that we're serious about hillside 
preservation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keeler said that, as far as his group is concerned, the jury's still out on the 
city's stated efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Problem of Trust' 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if the city holds to its word, there will be hillside 
preservation," he said. "But there's a problem of trust between the county 
residents and the city." 
</P>
<P>
County residents worry about the density of development the city will permit on 
the land it plans to sell off. Myhre said she is concerned the city might allow 
as many as six homes per acre in the areas slated for development. These 
development "clusters" would be near existing rural neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we aren't annexed and the cluster building goes on, it will change the 
quality of life," said Myhre, who lives in Padua Hills. "We live on a quiet 
street. It won't be a quiet street anymore. They're sacrificing our 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
Southard said the city has not determined the density to be permitted in the 
145 acres designated for development, but said it probably will be less than 
two units per acre. As for the remaining land, Southard said restrictions will 
be placed on the deed, requiring the property to be maintained as open space. 
Keeler said his group is concerned that the deed restrictions might contain 
loopholes that could be challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
Keeler and Myhre also questioned whether the city might not be able to recoup 
the cost of the purchase and speculated that officials might have to allow 
developers higher densities to get an adequate price for the land. 
</P>
<P>
Southard said such a prospect is "possible, but not probable." Gibbens said the 
city paid market price for the buildable portion of the land. The remainder, 
which was not prized by developers because of environmental restrictions on 
construction, was essentially a gift to the city, he said.

'OPENING SHOT' COMES AS COUNCIL CLOSES DEBATE ON SCULPTURE PLAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The editor of a nationally circulated newsletter for collectors of Olympic pins 
had issued a call-to-arms. 
</P>
<P>
"No one messes with the Olympic spirit, not even the mayor of 'An Olympic City 
with a Heart,' " Nelson wrote in the May issue of his newsletter published in 
Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson urged his readers to write "a short, polite note" to Mayor Barry L. 
Hatch about the clash over whether a sculpture dedicated to the 1984 Olympic 
Summer Games outside City Hall should be replaced with a statue honoring George 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But before Nelson's readers could react, the debate seemed over. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unanimously decided last week not to replace the Olympic 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Nelson boasted in an interview: "The pin collectors of America should 
be claiming victory." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20,000 Readers 
</P>
<P>
"I'm mad as I can be about the mayor's position on the Olympic sculpture. I 
don't think they should move it," Nelson wrote in the newsletter he sends to 
20,000 readers who collect, buy and swap commemorative pins dedicated to the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch had proposed relocating the Olympic sculpture and putting in its place a 
statue of Washington adorned with plaques of the U.S. Constitution. The City 
Council in March narrowly approved a proposal to spend $50,000 in city funds 
for the statue, though no decision was made on its location. Last week the 
council rescinded its vote, deciding to create a committee that would seek 
private funding and find a site for the Washington statue. 
</P>
<P>
Because Monterey Park was host to the 1984 field hockey championships, the 
community bills itself as "An Olympic City With a Heart." The statue was 
dedicated as an Olympic torch runner passed City Hall en route to the Games' 
opening ceremonies in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been publishing my newsletter for four years, and I never thought I'd 
have a battle with City Hall," wrote Nelson, a retired marketing professor in 
Tucson who says he is the principal retail distributor of Olympic pins in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this opening shot is heard all the way to the headquarters of the 
International Olympic Committee in Switzerland," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch and other city officials say they have not heard from pin collectors or 
readers of Nelson's newsletter. City officials said they received a facsimile 
of Nelson's newsletter at City Hall. But the mayor said: "Nobody mentioned the 
newsletter to me." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch said the only criticism he recalled was a letter from someone "either in 
Santa Monica or Woodland Hills." 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly I received lots of calls of support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch said he received a book on George Washington from William B. Allen, the 
Claremont graduate school professor who is chairman of the U.S. Commission on 
Civil Rights. Allen, editor of the book, which is a collection of letters and 
addresses by Washington, autographed the book for Hatch by signing it: "For 
Barry Hatch, one who serves in the spirit of Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch says he doesn't know why people were so upset with his wanting to move 
the Olympic statue, which he calls "stupid-looking." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprised by Concern 
</P>
<P>
"Funny how they'd be more concerned about the Olympic statue, than they would 
about Washington," he said. "I'm not putting down the Olympics. I'm just saying 
the Olympics takes second place to the Constitution and George Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said upset pin collectors have begun to write to him. He said he did not 
know the number of letters he had received, but he cited one from a woman in 
Montebello, who had written: "Good luck in your fight with the mayor of 
Monterey Park. I live just over the hill in Montebello. The citizens of 
Monterey Park are not too thrilled with the mayor's idea." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson says his goal in alerting his readers was to make sure the Olympic 
monument stayed put. "I didn't want to generate any hate mail," he said. "And 
nobody should get high blood-pressure about this."

HEARING ON HIGHER FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will hold a public hearing Monday on a proposal by the city 
manager, who has suggested extensive revamping and increases in fees for such 
services as dog licenses, library fines and building permits. 
</P>
<P>
If all the fee increases are approved, City Manager Mark Lewis said, the city 
could increase its revenues by $600,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
The increases, Lewis said, would help cover the city's operating expenses. The 
city, Lewis said, has been using some of its reserve funds to meet its budget. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, Lewis said, fees have not been increased in six or seven years. 
Lewis wants to institute an annual review of fees. "I don't think the city has 
ever done a consolidated review of fee schedules," he said. "Most cities I'm 
familiar with do this on an annual basis." 
</P>
<P>
Under Lewis' proposal, the city also would charge drunk drivers as much as $779 
for the costs of responding to accidents they cause. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will be held during the council meeting, which begins at 7 p.m. at 
City Hall.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: TEMPLE CITY;

<P>
L.A. SAYS SUIT IS INVALID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for Los Angeles and Los Angeles County are claiming a lawsuit, which 
challenges the constitutionality of tax distribution methods, is invalid 
because it asks that county tax officials be ordered to design a new way to 
allocate tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Were this to happen, each county could devise its own, independent 
apportionment system," David Muir, senior deputy county counsel, said in a 
demurrer filed with Riverside Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City, Rancho Cucamonga, Compton, Carson and El Segundo are petitioners 
in the suit, which charges that the current system unfairly penalizes cities 
that levied low or no property taxes before Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, Redlands and the counties of Los Angeles and San Bernardino are 
named as respondents. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, originally filed in San Bernardino Superior Court on April 7, is 
scheduled to be heard in Riverside on May 26, because Redlands was granted a 
change of venue to a neutral area. 
</P>
<P>
The proposition, passed in 1978, limited property taxes to 1% of a parcel's 
assessed value. State legislation passed to implement it requires that property 
tax revenue be distributed according to property tax rates before the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
"County officials are only doing what the Legislature has directed them to do," 
Muir said in the document. "Petitioners should be suing the state, if anyone." 
</P>
<P>
The county and Los Angeles also want the case to be combined with lawsuits 
challenging the same statutes in San Diego and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
In those pending cases, San Diego County is suing the state and Rancho Mirage 
is suing Riverside County.

TALKS ON SENIOR CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting as the Redevelopment Agency, the City Council last week voted 3 to 0 to 
pursue negotiations with a developer who plans to build a senior citizen 
housing complex and retail center near Main and 5th streets. 
</P>
<P>
C. W. Development Inc. of San Gabriel was chosen over three other firms after 
more than two hours of discussion. In deciding to sign an exclusive negotiating 
agreement with C. W. Development, the council rejected similar proposals from 
three other developers. One of the developers had also proposed building a 
157-unit hotel on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel project, proposed by Main Street Partners of San Gabriel, had been 
rejected previously by the council when Councilwoman Barbara Messina, 
describing it as too massive for the site, voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
Since council members Talmage Burke and Mary Louise Bunker must abstain because 
of potential conflicts of interests, three affirmative votes are necessary to 
approve a project at the site. Councilmen Michael Blanco and Boyd Condie 
favored the hotel project, but Messina remained opposed, questioning the 
hotel's economic viability.

PARKING LOTS EXEMPTED FROM PASADENA GROWTH LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors has resolved one of the legal issues arising 
from the voter-approved growth management initiative by deciding that growth 
limits do not apply to parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
The decision means developers can exclude the square footage devoted to 
enclosed parking when they apply for building allocations under the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approved in March 
</P>
<P>
The measure, approved by voters in March, sets a ceiling of 250,000 square feet 
a year of commercial construction, although it exempts a number of projects, 
including those that are under 25,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The board this week also decided that projects that were on file with the city 
before the March election will not be judged against each other for quality but 
will receive building allocations by meeting a set of standards. If there are 
more projects than building allocations available, priority will be determined 
by how far the projects had progressed through the city's review process before 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative, the city can approve 250 multifamily units and 250,000 
square feet of non-residential construction a year, and also can borrow from 
the allocations for next year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to creating this interim process for projects already planned, the 
city is developing criteria to rate new projects in the future. The city will 
conduct a public workshop from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday on the third flood of 
the Pasadena Conference Center, 300 E. Green St., to gather suggestions for 
implementing the initiative.

FIRM IS HONORED FOR RESTORING HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A general contracting firm in Cerritos has been awarded the 1989 restoration 
merit award in the California Preservation Foundation's design awards 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
J. C. Hammond Construction Co. was recognized for craftsmanship and "excellent 
attention to detail" for its work on the historical Stowell house in Pasadena. 
A jury of architects, landscape architects, preservation officials and an 
editor chose the Cerritos firm. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond crews worked for two years on the Stowell house, a 94-year-old heritage 
home purchased for a dollar and spared from the wrecking ball in 1987 when it 
was moved from the path of a condominium development. 
</P>
<P>
Authentic Victorian light fixtures and original hardware and period-style 
decoration now adorn the home. 
</P>
<P>
The company received the 1986 Long Beach Beautification Award for relocation 
and restoration of a 3,800-square-foot Queen Anne Victorian, cited as that 
year's finest improvement project.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members have tentatively agreed to pay themselves a salary for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
The $300 per month each member would receive is recommended by state guidelines 
for cities with a population comparable to Temple City's 32,000. The ordinance 
also would allow council members to receive reimbursement for work-related 
expenses. A final vote is scheduled for June 6. 
</P>
<P>
Council members in the city incorporated in 1960 have never been paid. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Durham, assistant to the city manager, said he knows of no other cities 
other than La Canada-Flintridge and San Marino where council members receive no 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Kenneth Gillanders said he introduced the ordinance after realizing 
that members are ineligible for benefits, such as low-cost health insurance 
plans and pension plans, that are available to paid city employees. Once 
council members receive a salary, they will be eligible for such benefits.

KOREA'S 'HENYO' DIVERS; 
</P>
<P>
MASTERS OF THE SEA -- BUT 2ND CLASS ON LAND

SHINYANG, South Korea 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day before bearing her third child, Kim Chun Hwa made a small concession to 
maternity. She took a break from her grueling routine of diving in the frigid 
waters for sea urchin, octopus and abalone. 
</P>
<P>
She was back in her wet suit two weeks later, though, leaving her infant 
daughter at home to join other village women harvesting the fertile seabeds 
with primitive tools and lung power. 
</P>
<P>
That was 13 years ago, not long after the heyday of the henyo, literally the 
"women of the sea." Kim, now 51, is one of a dwindling number of rugged women 
who still dive for a living from the coastal villages of South Korea's Cheju 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mermaids or Amazons 
</P>
<P>
They are likened to mermaids, or Amazons. They are romanticized by feminists, 
fussed over by anthropologists and exploited by the government as tourist bait. 
But few of the henyo -- pronounced "hen-yaw" -- have any illusions about the 
backbreaking, ear-popping, women-only vocation that has been handed down 
through the generations on idyllic Cheju Island. 
</P>
<P>
It is a difficult life, and Kim does not wish it on her daughters, even if the 
alternative is to forgo the relative economic independence she has enjoyed and 
submit themselves fully to South Korea's mainstream culture of male domination. 
She would not mind if diving women disappeared altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have no regrets," Kim said over a dinner of sea urchin soup and spicy 
stewed octopus, part of the day's catch. "We all feel the same way. Why should 
we be sorry to see something go away that causes so much hardship? If I didn't 
need the money, I'd quit today." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a close look at the lives of the Cheju divers reveals a 
not-so-liberated state of affairs, illustrating how daunting a task it can be 
for a woman to assert herself in South Korea's conservative, Confucian society. 
</P>
<P>
Although the henyo are usually the primary breadwinners in their families, they 
are obliged to contribute 10% to 20% of their income to support patrilineal 
ancestor rituals, presided over by the comparatively indolent men of the 
village. 
</P>
<P>
The women have little control over what is left, deferring to husbands, sons 
and other male relatives on major financial decisions, and sometimes retaining 
only a limited part of the assets they accumulate. The divers may enjoy far 
more autonomy than their counterparts on the mainland, but they have little 
chance to flaunt it. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her prowess at sea, Kim's very identity on land is derived from her 
oldest son, Deok Il, 22, whom she raised alone after her marriage broke up and 
whom she put through technical college. In keeping with traditional mores, she 
is known in the village as "Deok Il's mother." The son is the legal head of her 
household. 
</P>
<P>
A myth of gender-bending dates back to the earliest foreign accounts of Cheju, 
a volcanic island 50 miles off the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula used by 
Yi Dynasty authorities as a penal colony. 
</P>
<P>
William Franklin Sands, a U.S. consular official stationed in Seoul at the turn 
of the century, noted in his book, "Undiplomatic Memories," that Cheju -- known 
to him as Quelpart -- was marked as "the Isle of Women" on old Chinese and 
Japanese maps. He described the women's diving skills in admiring terms and 
left a somewhat ludicrous record of their social dominance. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, in this lost corner of the world, was an inferior being; the woman was 
everything," Sands wrote. "It was more like a matriarchy, a real Amazon 
community, for the women were always ready to assert their power and uphold it 
by force." 
</P>
<P>
The idea still persists that Cheju has a kind of reverse-role subculture, a 
matriarchy that belies the male chauvinism of Korean society. So Yong Park, a 
Korean-American anthropology student who came to Shinyang to do field work in 
1987, said she had planned to study how the village was making a transition 
from a matriarchal to a patriarchal society. She was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, there wasn't anything like a matriarchy here at all," Park 
said. "I found that out on the first day."

Park learned that the men were running things, even the fishing cooperative 
that sold the women's catch, and took a 10% cut. Maybe a few of them watched 
the children while their wives went diving, but in general the men of Shinyang 
tended to be "pompous and self-important," Park said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a highly Confucian society with a pocket of women's culture off to the 
side," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Park became enthralled by the earthy sisterhood of the divers. For a year 
she listened to their songs and monitored their banter as they gathered in the 
shelter of stone fences to change into black rubber wet suits in the morning 
and clean their catch in the evening. She noted their complaints about rough 
seas, cold water, bad husbands, aching bodies. Vulgar jokes were second only to 
talk of kosaeng: suffering, the hard life. 
</P>
<P>
"The henyo lead two separate lives," said Han Lim Hoa, a novelist in Cheju City 
who grew up in a neighboring village and has written several books on the 
divers. "When they are diving, they have their own social order based on 
camaraderie among women. But when they go home, they re-enter the world of men. 
There's no carry-over from one to the other." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent afternoon, Kim, or Deok Il's mother, and a group of a dozen other 
divers had just spent about five hours in the water and were busy crushing 
purple sea urchins with blunt knives and scooping the orange meat into plastic 
containers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why men eschew diving, the women had a variety of answers. The men are a 
little lazy. They are less tolerant of the cold water. It never occurred to 
them to dive. They aren't as tough as women. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to dive because they're afraid they'll shrivel up," said one 
henyo, eliciting cackles of laughter from the women squatting on the rocky 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fair catch that day. Deok Il's mother figured she hauled in $36 worth 
of sea urchin and shellfish, which is about average. She makes $600 to $700 
diving 20 days a month, considerably more than the wages of many factory 
workers in South Korea and nearly twice what her eldest daughter makes as a 
nurse's aide in Seoul. But she is concerned about the size of the urchins, 
which are getting smaller, a sign that they are being depleted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried," said Deok Il's mother, who started diving at age 13. "But if I 
don't catch them now, I won't make any money at all." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the overall catch is declining for Cheju's divers, from about 25,000 
tons in 1985 to 21,000 tons last year, according to a report by Yonhap News 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
With prime seabeds being depleted, women are swimming farther out from shore 
with their Styrofoam buoys, and diving deeper for the elusive abalone and other 
game. Dives of about 20 feet used to suffice; now women are going as deep as 40 
or 50 feet, staying under for several minutes at a time. 
</P>
<P>
The henyo are also getting older, making it an increasingly hazardous line of 
work. The Yonhap report suggested that serious accidents, some of them fatal, 
have been increasing dramatically in recent years. The women say more and more 
divers have become addicted to painkillers trying to cope with the debilitating 
effects of water pressure on their ears and sinuses. Many, like Deok Il's 
mother, are going deaf. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we really do something for the divers, they are endangered," said Cho 
Hae Joang, an anthropologist at Yonsei University who has studied the henyo. 
</P>
<P>
Because their daughters no longer join the trade, their numbers are declining 
rapidly. The divers' ranks peaked at about 24,000 around 1970, but now 
officials count only 6,313, and 40% of them are over 50. Shinyang, a village 
with a population of about 1,250, has 80 divers. The youngest is in her early 
30s, the oldest is over 70. ("Grandmother" divers stay near the surface 
gathering seaweed.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Men Fight Back 
</P>
<P>
The men of Shinyang, meanwhile, are trying to buck a reputation for idleness. 
But old attitudes die hard. 
</P>
<P>
One man told Park he thought women were better suited for intensive farm labor, 
which is expected even of the divers, because "their knees are specially 
designed for squatting." Another male villager suggested that women are natural 
divers because they are endowed with more body fat to ward off hypothermia in 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
But Kim Yong Wook, 40, head of Shinyang's village youth association, who runs a 
small variety store and grows hot-house pineapples, said that Cheju men are 
becoming industrious these days. They might even try their hand at diving, he 
said, if more modern, scientific techniques could be applied, such as scuba 
gear, which is currently outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been treated unfairly," he said. "I think the anthropologists have 
looked at things from a very superficial point of view. It's not that men were 
lazy, they simply had nothing to do in the past. It was like unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
With their conspicuous economic status, the diving women of Cheju have become 
particularly attuned to handling the fragile masculine ego. Expertise in this 
area was clearly demonstrated when a male reporter recently donned a wet suit 
and joined Deok Il's mother and her group in the water, where the women 
hyperventilated with the eerie whistling sounds that are characteristic of the 
henyo. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to keep pace with the superbly conditioned athletes, the visitor flailed 
pathetically at the reef trying to hook sea urchins without destroying them -- 
and ran out of breath every time. Before he knew it, though, Deok Il's mother 
had secreted a dozen urchins in his game net, offering him a chance to save 
face. 
</P>
<P>
Another diver staged an abalone catch for the inept man, prompting him to pry 
the mollusk loose with a blade she had inserted, then rise to the surface with 
the prize in hand as she orchestrated cheers by the other women. For a 
fleeting, blind moment, he was flush with a sense of accomplishment.

WRIGHT, FRIEND TARGETS OF IRS CRIMINAL PROBE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service has launched a "very broad" criminal investigation 
into the financial affairs of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) and his friend 
and former business partner, Texas developer George A. Mallick Jr., The Times 
learned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Special agents from the Dallas regional office, with support and coordination 
from IRS headquarters in Washington, are reviewing a wide range of transactions 
that produced hundreds of thousands of dollars in income for the two men in 
recent years, according to federal sources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Deepen Problems 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is in a preliminary stage. However, coupled with an ongoing 
inquiry into Wright's activities by the House Ethics Committee, scrutiny of his 
affairs by special agents of the IRS criminal investigative division could add 
significantly to his problems. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Hargrave, an IRS spokeswoman for the Dallas region, said she could not 
confirm or deny the existence of the investigation. However, other federal 
sources said the IRS has begun an inquiry that is "very broad" and embraces "a 
whole range of transactions." 
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the IRS criminal division is different from an audit or 
investigation by the agency's civil division and potentially is far more 
serious. If a civil audit results in a finding of taxes being owed, back taxes, 
penalties and interest may be paid without threat of a prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal division's agents, however, are assigned to seek evidence of 
willful tax evasion, not accidental errors on a tax return. If the IRS finds 
what it considers evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it refers its findings to 
the Justice Department for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal division -- whose agents are considered the best-trained financial 
investigators in government -- is known for its thoroughness, with some 
investigations taking as long as 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wright and Mallick said Wednesday that they know nothing about an IRS 
investigation. Mark Johnson, Wright's spokesman, added: "We are not concerned 
about it because we know of no tax issues involved in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Although details of the IRS investigation could not be learned, agents are said 
to be using a staff report by Richard J. Phelan, special counsel to the ethics 
panel, as a "road map" for their own inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The report issued last month examines oil and gas ventures undertaken by 
Mallightco -- the joint investment company formed by Mallick, Wright and their 
wives -- as well as a series of profitable securities transactions in the stock 
of such little-known energy firms as Delhi International Oil and Supron Energy. 
Mallightco reaped combined profits of $110,000 on Delhi Oil and Supron alone. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1980, the report said, Mallightco also "was used as a conduit for 
cash flowing from the Mallicks to the Wrights." 
</P>
<P>
From one oil-drilling venture last year, known as Sabine Lake, Wright netted a 
quick profit of more than $300,000, which allowed him to pay off debts from his 
$100,000 investment in a nursing home enterprise that had failed. 
</P>
<P>
The Wrights received more than $100,000 from Mallick in the form of 
reduced-interest loans, free housing in Ft. Worth and the free use of a luxury 
automobile, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The car, a Cadillac used by Wright's wife over a six-year period, could pose a 
tax issue for the Speaker because IRS regulations say that the personal use of 
a company car is a fringe benefit that must be reported as income. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, Wright's spokesman, said that the Cadillac was intended to be a loan 
and, therefore, was "a liability and not income" to the Wrights. Johnson said 
the car was purchased by the Speaker's blind trust last February for $10,011 -- 
its value in 1983 when it was first provided, plus 7% interest since that date. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no IRS issue," Johnson told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan has rejected the Speaker's explanation that the car was a loan, saying 
that it was never reflected on the company's books and that the Wrights never 
made a payment on it. Phelan argued in his report that the 1989 purchase of the 
Cadillac by the Wrights' blind trust was an attempt to cover up the gift of the 
car from Mallightco. 
</P>
<P>
Although Betty Wright has said that the 1979 sedan she used came with her job 
for Mallightco, House investigators said that there was no evidence that she 
did a substantial amount of work for the company in the Washington area, where 
the car was kept. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she continued to use the car from 1985 through the early months of 
this year, although her employment with Mallightco ended in December, 1984. 
However, Mallightco took regular deductions for business expenses -- a total of 
$10,895 -- to pay for insurance, registration, tires, battery and repairs for 
the Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
The trustee of Wright's blind trust, Thomas A. Law, said the money Mallightco 
paid for car expenses was repaid by Wright last February by deducting it from a 
$120,000 note that the company gave him when it bought back his shares in the 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
William C. Oldaker, Wright's attorney, justified the use of the car after 1984 
by saying that the Speaker's wife remained a vice president and director of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
The car was not mentioned in the financial disclosure reports filed by the 
Speaker for the years in question. 
</P>
<P>
Accountants said the fact that Mrs. Wright kept the car at her home seven days 
a week usually would be considered a strong indication that she drove it for 
personal purposes as well as business. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the IRS is seeking to determine whether all income accruing 
to Mallick, Wright and the company was reflected accurately on federal tax 
returns and whether all business losses claimed were justifiable. 
</P>

MASSIVE BEIJING PROTEST DEMANDS LEADERS QUIT; 
</P>
<P>
GORBACHEV SEES EVEN MORE REASON FOR DEEP SOCIALIST REFORMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, surveying the massive protests during 
his historic visit to China this week, said Wednesday that he is now more 
convinced than ever of socialism's need for fundamental political and economic 
reforms, however painful the changes might be. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations, which on Wednesday drew hundreds of thousands of students 
and workers to Tian An Men Square in central Beijing to demand greater 
democracy, are evidence of a major transition occurring in Chinese politics, 
Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
"Renewal is a painful process," he said, referring to changes both here and in 
the Soviet Union, "but this reaffirms that it is a profound change, not 
cosmetic repairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Turnaround' for Socialism 
</P>
<P>
"Some people regard this as 'the crisis of socialism.' I believe actually that 
it reflects a very serious turnaround in world socialism. This process is under 
way in varying degrees in the Soviet Union, China and other socialist 
countries, and its main thrust is revealing the potential of socialism through 
democratization. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The protests, which began a month ago, grew dramatically in size with 
Gorbachev's visit to Beijing this week -- almost as if his presence in the 
Chinese capital as one of the leading reformers of socialism had inspired the 
2,000 students who began a hunger strike last Saturday demanding a full 
dialogue with the government on political reform. 
</P>
<P>
But the demonstrations, continuing day and night and paralyzing much of central 
Beijing, have largely eclipsed Gorbachev's visit to China, although the trip 
normalized Sino-Soviet relations after 30 years of hostility. 
</P>
<P>
So great were the crowds Wednesday that the Soviet leader was unable to tour 
the Forbidden City or to hold a planned press conference or attend a special 
performance of the Beijing opera that had been scheduled in the Great Hall of 
the People. And when he traveled out to the Great Wall, his car was mobbed by 
well-wishers whenever it slowed in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dynamic Rhythm' in China 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen the dynamic rhythm of China's public life," Gorbachev remarked 
wryly, shrugging off the schedule changes, which were more an embarrassment to 
his hosts than himself, as "a political need." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Gorbachev is to visit the industrial center of Shanghai, China's largest 
city, and then return to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to avoid direct comment on the protests, he expressed sympathy with the 
mounting demand for an open dialogue on political reform and also with the need 
for "responsible and disciplined" change. 
</P>
<P>
"A political dialogue is under way, a difficult dialogue between the leaders 
and the people," he told reporters after his press conference had been 
transferred to the heavily guarded state guest house where he stayed in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"We should wish them success in finding solutions to their problems, solutions 
that will make it possible for the Chinese people to proceed along the path of 
reforms." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter From Students 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Chinese television, Gorbachev acknowledged a letter from 
6,000 student protesters, describing it as "a very warm letter, full of 
feelings of support for perestroika" -- his program of restructuring Soviet 
society. The comment was widely regarded as certain to boost the demonstrators 
and their cause. 
</P>
<P>
In a spirited defense of perestroika and glasnost, or political openness, 
Gorbachev provided further arguments for the students. 
</P>
<P>
"In a one-party system, we need democracy and glasnost to identify, to take 
into account and to harmonize various interests," he said. "There are limits, 
and whatever is inconsistent or damaging to our overall choice for socialism is 
resisted. 
</P>
<P>
"But since we believe the potential of socialism is limitless, glasnost and 
democracy should also be limitless, but they must go together with 
responsibility, discipline and education." 
</P>
<P>
A political commentator in the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda argued 
that the protesting students were losing the support of the people because 
their protest was increasingly disrupting everyday life here. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that similar events in the Soviet Union -- which has been rocked 
by anti-government demonstrations, nationalist protests and a growing debate 
over virtually all government policies over the past year and a half -- had 
convinced him that greater democracy, more glasnost and faster-paced 
perestroika are the correct approach to the country's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I am certain that we are on the right road," he said. "And this is not only my 
conviction. The (parliamentary) elections confirmed that this was the 
conviction of the people as well. The election was really a referendum on what 
they think of perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
The reforms under way in most socialist countries, he said, "cannot proceed 
easily or simply and may very well be painful, but we need them because they 
breathe new life into socialism. If anyone thinks, however, that this is 
leading us to discard socialism on the ash heap of history, they will be 
disappointed again." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he discussed the Soviet Union's reforms, particularly its bold 
moves on the political front, with Chinese government and party officials, 
including Deng Xiaoping, the senior Chinese leader, and had listened to their 
explanations of similar Chinese moves. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leadership made political reform its priority, he noted, after 
finding that its initial efforts at changing the country's economic structure 
were frustrated -- as reforms have repeatedly been for the past 30 years there 
-- by the "administrative command" system that gives control over the whole to 
the bureaucracy and deprives the system of vitality. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, as a result, appears to have made considerably more progress 
in political reform -- and its consumers are complaining bitterly about the 
failure of perestroika to improve supplies of food and consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
But China started with economic reform, moving over the past decade toward what 
Beijing now describes as "market socialism." The Chinese leadership, convinced 
of the paramount need for "stability and unity," has moved very cautiously on 
political reform. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev reiterated the Soviet pledge not to interfere in China's domestic 
politics and not to demand adherence to a party line set in Moscow for 
Communist parties in Europe and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes China Reforms Succeed 
</P>
<P>
"I would not take upon myself the responsibility or the role to pass judgment, 
and I would not seek to assess what is going on in this country," he said of 
the crisis here. "I believe this is for the Chinese to do, and for the Chinese 
Communist Party. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in seeing their reforms succeed with as few losses and as 
little pain as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet and Chinese Communist parties have begun discussions, he added, on a 
program of extensive exchanges so that they can draw upon each other's 
experience in political and economic reforms. 
</P>

WINDFALL RAISES HOPES OF ENDING L.A. TEACHER STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's surprise disclosure Wednesday of a $1.9-billion 
budgetary windfall for schools raised hopes for an end to the teachers' strike 
that has paralyzed the massive Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Day 3 of the teachers' strike -- begun amid reports of "Molotov cocktails" at 
one school, the arrest of a striking teacher at another school and drastically 
plummeting attendance -- ended on an upbeat note following Deukmejian's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very good news," said Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los 
Angeles. "If they (district officials) don't want to settle with us now, they 
just want to break the union." 
</P>
<P>
And, school board members seemed encouraged when they emerged from a five-hour 
closed-door session. 
</P>
<P>
"There clearly is more money," school board member Julie Korenstein said. "The 
information we are receiving from Sacramento is very positive and very 
encouraging." Fellow board member Warren Furatani described a "whole different 
feeling" among the board members who had previously been discouraged by the 
slow, tense negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the upbeat mood, Korenstein said it is doubtful that the strike could 
be settled before Friday. School officials are uncertain how much of the extra 
funding can be reserved for salary increases, because the state Legislature may 
earmark a portion of the funds to finance reductions in class size and the 
maintenance and upkeep of aging school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified officials who initially expected only $34 million from the 
state during the next fiscal year are now expecting a share that could be four 
times larger. 
</P>
<P>
That revelation thrust negotiations into a new context, however, with leaders 
of the teachers' union promptly increasing their salary demands. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the union will now push hard for a 26% hike in a three-year pact, 
compared to earlier demands of 24% over three years and, before that, 21% over 
two years. District officials have most recently offered a 21.5% hike stretched 
over three years. 
</P>
<P>
The district did not immediately respond to the union's latest demand. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's announcement came as the education process rapidly deteriorated 
in Los Angeles and amid rising tensions on the picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 students skipped school Wednesday to stay home, visit beaches 
or cruise shopping malls. A roughly equal number of students attended class, 
encountering a crisis that some say has transformed the nation's second-largest 
district into an overgrown day-care center, with a curriculum dominated by 
educational games and videos. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said morning attendance reports showed that 287,000 students 
showed up for class Wednesday -- less than half of the district's 594,000 
students. That figure compares to 325,000 on Tuesday and 430,000 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
There was a slight increase, meanwhile, in the number of teachers who reported 
for work, district officials said. About 8,200 teachers reported to classrooms 
Wednesday, 550 more than the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said that about 23,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers, 
counselors, nurses and librarians have honored the picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fact-Finding' Report 
</P>
<P>
In another development Wednesday, a state "fact-finding" report, which said Los 
Angeles teachers are already among the highest paid in the nation, appeared to 
provide leverage for the district. The school district's current salary offer 
is "very fair and reasonable," the fact-finding panel said. 
</P>
<P>
UTLA negotiator John D. Britz, in a dissenting report, called Geraldine M. 
Randall, fact-finding chairwoman, "so biased as to qualify for the position of 
chief negotiator for the district." Randall wrote the report after hearing 
arguments from district and UTLA negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
In the fact-finding report, the panel said: "UTLA presented no data to the 
fact-finding panel which would change the conclusion which is inescapable . . . 
under all of the usual and customary comparisons, the salary offered by (the 
school district) is very fair and reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
The fact-finding process, which is required under state law, is the last step 
before a strike can be legally called. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the three-member panel -- made up of a chairman and a negotiator 
from each side -- is to break negotiation deadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which covers 14 negotiation issues, also recommended against the 
agency fee provision sought by the UTLA, which would require all 32,000 
district employees represented by the union to pay annual fees. 
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that both sides submit to arbitration the district order 
last year to withhold pay of teachers refusing to turn in grades and perform 
playground supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The union, which originally planned to strike on May 30, moved up the walkout 
to May 15 after district Supt. Leonard Britton threatened to withhold paychecks 
if teachers did not turn in grades by the 15th. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Deukmejian's announcement, Johnson and school district officials 
said the state budget report could prove a turning point in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"Salary clearly is an area that is taking longer to smooth over," Korenstein 
said in an interview before Deukmejian's announcement. "I certainly would like 
to see the strike not go further than Friday. On both sides there is a desire 
to find a compromise. My hope is that we will settle by the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a pay hike, teachers are seeking relief from unpaid duties such 
as playground patrol, and a majority voice on school decision-making 
committees. The school district wants teachers, parents and administrators to 
have equal say on the committees. 
</P>
<P>
The union represents about 22,000 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians. 
Striking teachers account for almost two-thirds of the district's work force of 
32,000. 
</P>
<P>
At Hollenbeck Junior High, extra police were assigned Wednesday after three 
"Molotov cocktail" firebombs were thrown at the school overnight, causing no 
injuries and only superficial damage. 
</P>
<P>
At Banning High School, driver's education teacher and football coach Rocky 
Garibay, 35, was arrested while walking the picket line and charged with 
assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
A district spokesman said the arrest stemmed from a confrontation Tuesday in 
which Garibay allegedly struck a substitute teacher with his picket sign. 
Garibay, who was acting as the captain of the picket line, also reportedly spat 
on the substitute and pounded on his vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Banning High School Principal Augustine Herrera sent the substitute home 
Wednesday morning "for his own personal protection." 
</P>
<P>
Tensions at Banning, located in mainly blue-collar Wilmington, were especially 
high. Some 2,600 students are enrolled at the school and the daily absence rate 
is about 400. Wednesday morning 322 students went to school, but about a third 
of them left before the end of classes, according to Herrera. Normally the 
school has 137 teachers. On Wednesday, it had 10 regular teachers plus 10 
substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Union Families 
</P>
<P>
The school has been hit hard by the strike, the principal said, because Carson 
is a strong union town. Herrera said some parents are calling him and 
expressing reservations about having their children cross picket lines because 
they are union families. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a strong blue-collar union community. Many of the people who work on 
this campus live in this community, including our teachers. Some of our 
teachers do longshoremen's work in the evening or in the summer," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Ghorbani, a 17-year-old senior said, "We went to school for a couple of 
hours and we just left after nutrition. We support the teachers. I think it is 
right what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the largest demonstration occured at Manual Arts High School. An 
estimated 2,000 striking teachers who rallied Wednesday morning at Exposition 
Park later descended on Manual Arts, virtually encircling the school and 
chanting so loudly that students gathered at upper floor windows to survey the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Less typical were teachers such as Kevin G. Dailey, who was among the handful 
of regular teachers who crossed the picket line to man a classroom at Audubon 
Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
"In this community we need to provide for our students," said Dailey, who is 
black, referring to the predominantly black area community. "In other 
communities, they have things the students can go to to fill the time. Our 
students need us. . . . I need to be here. I don't want to strike my kids." 
</P>
<P>
Dailey said he has not encountered resentment from his peers, 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts Principal Marvin S. Starer said only 550 students showed up at 
school Wednesday morning. The school's official enrollment is 2,300 but, even 
on typical days, about 800 students are absent, Starer said. Of 132 teachers on 
the staff, 110 were striking, he said.

THE LOS ANGELES TEACHERS' STRIKE;

ONE TEACHER DRAWS THE LINE, THE OTHER CROSSES IT

Even though striking teacher Andi Leibsohn knew her best friend and mentor at 
Le Conte Junior High School had decided to stay in her classroom through the 
strike, it still hurt Wednesday morning when she saw her friend drive past the 
picket lines outside the school and walk into the building. 
</P>
<P>
"Sellout!" one of the handful of picket-carrying strikers yelled as Adelina 
Alegria drove past them. Leibsohn, 26, could only turn away. "I couldn't deal 
with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Leibsohn and Alegria share a strong dedication to the newly arrived immigrant 
children who form a large segment of their school's enrollment. But they find 
themselves on opposite sides of the fence when it comes to a teachers' strike. 
Although a strike can be trying, the two women say they remain close friends. 
Others working through the strike who have friends, parents and even spouses on 
the picket lines, many of them at other schools, say the same. The strike will 
not affect their relationships either. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Andi and I understand why each of us is doing what we are doing," said 
Alegria, 34. "And I know she feels really bad for me. I feel the same for her." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of her usual morning jogs through the surrounding Hollywood streets 
with Alegria, Leibsohn has spent her mornings this week standing outside her 
school with several dozen of her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate it," said Leibsohn, an expressive and vivacious woman who wears her 
hair in a ponytail and bangs. "I don't want to be out here. I'm very angry and 
depressed. I'm constantly snapping at everybody. I want to be in there with my 
kids. . . . I feel like I'm deserting them . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
She was so torn by her loyalties to her students and to the issues at stake 
that even as late as last Friday, Leibsohn had still not decided whether or not 
to strike. In the end, she said, "when I studied the history and the facts . . 
. I decided something was very wrong. . . . I believe the kids deserve better 
and this is the only way they (district administrators) will hear us." 
</P>
<P>
While Leibsohn walked the picket line Wednesday, Alegria was one of about 17 
teachers to cross it. She spent most of the morning in the school's auditorium, 
struggling to organize classes for the students, most of them Spanish-, Korean- 
and Armenian-speaking, who had come to school. The children had to be counted, 
divided and assigned classes for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, she found herself gently coaxing the restless youngsters to remain 
in their seats. Frequently, she yelled across the sea of squirming youngsters 
for silence, an order that would then be interpreted by teachers' assistants 
into other languages. 
</P>
<P>
A forceful, admittedly opinionated, even "pushy," woman, Alegria said she had 
little trouble deciding to work through the strike even though her father, a 
strong union supporter, tried to talk her out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Mexico, Alegria said she is proud of the progress she has made in seven 
years of teaching immigrant children. At her own initiative, she has attended 
dozens of bilingual education conferences, workshops and courses. For the last 
three years, she has served as a district-appointed mentor to younger teachers 
such as Leibsohn. 
</P>
<P>
"I know my priorities," Alegria said, explaining that teaching is at the top of 
the list. "I'm not saying that teachers on the picket line don't care about 
teaching, because many of them do. But I feel very strongly that I belong with 
my ESL (English as a second language) kids." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Alegria said, she does not agree with the teachers union's 
emphasis on salaries. More importantly, she said, the union has not been as 
supportive of bilingual education as she believes that it should be. 
</P>
<P>
While she said she had felt "very uncomfortable" crossing the picket line, she 
said that is not reason enough to join the strikers. 
</P>
<P>
While Alegria, Leibsohn and others believe that strong friendships will survive 
the strike, they are fearful that it may divide teachers who are not as close. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there are people out there who are never going to forgive me, never," 
Alegria said. 
</P>
<P>
While Leibsohn said she respects her friend's reasons for not joining the 
strike, she does not feel the same about others who have remained at their 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
"Lina and I have talked. I know why she is inside and she knows why I am 
outside. I think we understand each other," Leibsohn said. As for the others, 
she said is not as forgiving. "Maybe because I haven't talked to them, but I 
don't understand why some of those other teachers are in there," Leibsohn said.

LUJAN DISCLAIMS ROLE IN NARROWING TANKER SEA LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interior Secretary Manuel J. Lujan Jr. said Wednesday that he was unaware that 
his department had asked the Coast Guard to trim tanker-traffic safety lanes 
off the California coast to accommodate more offshore drilling platforms, but 
he promised to look into the situation. 
</P>
<P>
His promise, however, was not enough to appease environmentalists and Rep. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), who vigorously opposes the 60% smaller sea lanes 
because they would, Boxer asserted, "set up the perfect circumstances for a 
devastating crash." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy centers on the formal designation of sea lanes off a 180-mile 
stretch of California coast from Santa Barbara to Ano Nuevo State Reserve near 
San Francisco. The Coast Guard in 1982 proposed making the northbound and 
southbound lanes a total of five miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
But the Coast Guard last month said wide lanes are "not acceptable to (the 
Mineral Management Service, an agency of the Interior Department) because a 
large number of offshore tracts would be totally excluded from oil exploration 
and development." Instead, the Coast Guard has proposed one-mile-wide lanes 
separated by a two-mile-wide median in which oil platforms would be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Boxer and environmental groups, including the Oceanic Society, denounced the 
narrower, mile-wide lanes on Wednesday, noting that the Exxon Valdez had 
strayed 1 1/2 miles outside normal shipping lanes in Alaska before it caused 
the worst tanker disaster in the nation's history in March. 
</P>
<P>
"We know there have been 93 such crashes of vessels and oil rigs between 1970 
and 1982, so this is a ridiculous proposal," Boxer said. "Once again (the 
Mineral Management Service) is pressing its pro-drilling views on (other) 
federal agencies and sacrificing the safety of our coastal environment for oil 
company profits." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bad Policy' 
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster," said Steven Hopcraft of the Oceanic 
Society, "it is incredible that we would alter safety procedures and policy 
priorities for the convenience of the oil industry. It is bad policy, bad 
science and bad government." 
</P>
<P>
Hopcraft delivered his criticism of the Interior Department as Lujan addressed 
local employees of the National Park Service. Lujan was in the Bay Area to 
inspect the Presidio of San Francisco, a historic military installation that 
will be abandoned by the Army as a cost-saving measure and turned over to the 
National Park Service for inclusion in the Golden Gate National Recreation 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan, who has been accused of being ignorant on issues facing his department, 
plans to visit Yosemite National Park today and the Mojave Desert on Friday. He 
came to California to give a commencement address Saturday at St. Mary's 
College in Moraga, which he attended as a freshman.

PANAMA OPPOSITION STRIKE FALLS SHORT

PANAMA CITY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A general strike, billed as a crucial step in a design to convince the world of 
Panamanians' determination to rid their country of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, 
fizzled out Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite claims by strike organizers that business "was 80% below normal," 
traffic was near normal, most stores, banks and businesses were open and 
citizens largely ignored a call to appear on the streets at noon to show their 
displeasure with Noriega and their support for the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of fast-food restaurants, nearly all businesses were 
operating, and in the downtown section where much of the working-class and 
lower-middle-class shops, sidewalks were clogged with people buying goods. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens didn't appear at midday but neither did the leaders of the opposition, 
who were not seen in public Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Press Conferences 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Endara, the presidential candidate for the Democratic Alliance for 
Civic Opposition in the May 7 election, in which he was considered the winner, 
held meetings all day with aides and press conferences with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
To many diplomats and some in the anti-regime movement, the tepid protest put 
an abrupt end to the opposition momentum that developed against strongman 
Noriega after his security forces physically attacked Endara and other 
Democratic Alliance leaders during a street demonstration a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The strike was called to coincide with a Washington meeting of the Organization 
of American States to consider resolutions condemning Noriega in the face of 
his apparent effort to steal the May 7 presidential elections. The 
government-controlled electoral commission has nullified the election, saying 
it was tainted by violence and by foreign influence. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Democratic Alliance, which organized the 24-hour strike, 
took pains to rationalize the lack of public response. 
</P>
<P>
After pointing out that the government had threatened essential-services 
businesses if they closed and that paramilitary groups had made ominous 
statements about suppressing public disorders, Endara said the day nevertheless 
was a "total success" because economic life was not normal Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
One current theory among the opposition holds that the greatest threat to 
Noriega lies within elements of the Panamanian Defense Forces who would refuse 
to put down protests if it meant shooting Panamanians. 
</P>
<P>
"There is ample evidence that the PDF won't do it," an influential banker said. 
</P>
<P>
Another businessman said: "The only way to create pressure (on the army) is to 
confront it and make it decide if it will shoot Panamanians. . . . We're going 
to lose some lives, of course, but I think the people are willing to do it" if 
the opposition leaders show the way. 
</P>
<P>
But according to a diplomat who supports the opposition, "Noriega is laughing 
all the way to the bank" over the Wednesday strike. 
</P>
<P>
"The opposition has not learned how to screw up the PDF (by confronting the 
military)," he said. "They haven't learned anything from the past." This was a 
reference to the 17-day general strike last year that paralyzed the country's 
economy but failed to force Noriega to step down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noriega Not Leaving 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, meanwhile, indicated in an interview with a French television network 
that he has no intention of leaving. 
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. government's efforts to oust him are motivated by a desire to 
violate the terms of two 1977 treaties that turned over control of the Panama 
Canal to Panama. This "is a fight of Panama against an imperial power" that 
does not want to give up "territory that God did not give it," Noriega said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that "we absolutely condemn violence from wherever it comes" and 
expressed regret over the attack on Endara and the other opposition leaders. He 
said the injuries were caused by people not under government control.

HAMADI GETS LIFE FOR TWA HIJACKING, MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services

<DATELINE>
<P>
FRANKFURT, West Germany 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A court on Wednesday convicted Mohammed Ali Hamadi of air piracy and murder in 
the killing of a U.S. sailor in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner and 
sentenced him to the maximum term allowable under West German law -- life 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
The parents of slain Navy diver Robert Dean Stethem, Patricia and Richard 
Stethem of Port Tobacco, Md., sat silently facing Hamadi as Chief Judge Heiner 
Mueckenberger delivered the verdict and sentence. Later, the Stethems indicated 
that a "more severe" punishment should have been imposed. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany has no death penalty, and Peter Korneck, one of the prosecutors, 
said Hamadi will be eligible for a parole review in 15 years. Hamadi's lawyers 
said they plan to appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Before reading the verdict, the judge recalled Hamadi's troubled life in Beirut 
as the defendant, his beard neatly trimmed, sat with his eyes downcast behind 
two walls of bullet-proof glass in the courtroom at Frankfurt's Preungesheim 
maximum-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
"The accused is found guilty of collective murder in connection with air 
piracy, hostage-taking and causing serious bodily harm as well as the illegal 
import of explosives in one case while using forged documents," the judge 
ruled. "He is sentenced to life-long imprisonment as a total sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors last week requested a life sentence for Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite 
Muslim who confessed that he and a still-at-large accomplice hijacked TWA 
Flight 847 with 153 people aboard en route from Athens to Rome on June 14, 
1985. But Hamadi denied he had killed Stethem. One American aboard, Peter Hill, 
testified that Hamadi, holding a 9-millimeter Beretta pistol, told him in 
English, "This is the gun" that killed Stethem. 
</P>
<P>
Mueckenberger said the court was unable to decide who actually shot Stethem. 
"But the defendant knowingly and willingly participated in Stethem's killing 
and actively took part in its preparation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hijackers had demanded freedom for 700 Shiite Muslim prisoners held by 
Israel. The 17-day ordeal ended after Israel agreed to the phased release of 
the prisoners who were captured in fighting in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, Stethem's father said: "We praise the court's efforts and 
hope this conviction will stand as an example and encouragement to other 
countries to decisively deal with terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
"Our family maintains Mohammed Ali Hamadi deserves punishment more severe than 
allowable under German law," he said, adding that any commutation of Hamadi's 
sentence would be a "pure mockery of justice." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Hamadi's 
sentence "satisfies the demand for justice." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding speculation that Hamadi's sentence might be commuted in a trade for 
hostages in Lebanon, Fitzwater said, "We expect Hamadi will serve the full 
sentence in accord with German law." 
</P>
<P>
In the TWA hijacking, Hamadi apparently was acting on behalf of Hezbollah, the 
shadowy fundamentalist terror group that backs Iran's leader, the Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Mueckenberger said "the court assumes" Hamadi would rejoin Hezbollah "if 
he was set free today." Mueckenberger added that it could be assumed "the 
accused will consider the sentence an injustice, but the will of God." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said the "hijackers had used the utmost brutality" on the TWA 
passengers, and he praised Stethem as "a model U.S. serviceman -- tall, strong, 
good looking and soldier-like in his deportment. 
</P>
<P>
"He was less ready than other passengers to yield to the hijackers." 
</P>
<P>
Testimony revealed that Stethem, 23, was severely beaten, then "executed" and 
his body thrown on the tarmac in Beirut when authorities refused the hijackers' 
demands for fuel for the jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
Hamadi quietly listened as Mueckenberger told him, through a translator, that 
he had a right to appeal. He left the courtroom with his eyes downcast. 
</P>
<P>
American observers closely watched the 63 days of proceedings, which began in 
July, 1988, after West Germany rejected a U.S. request to extradite Hamadi for 
fear of reprisals against two West German businessmen held in Lebanon at the 
time. Bonn's refusal in 1987 to grant extradition caused a rift with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

POLISH CATHOLIC CHURCH WINS LEGAL STATUS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Parliament enacted a landmark law on Wednesday legalizing the Roman Catholic 
Church for the first time under Communist rule and restoring the property and 
privileges stripped from it in the years since the end of World War II in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which came after years of negotiations between the church and the 
leadership of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, represents the first full normalization 
of church-state relations in a Communist state and opens the way for Warsaw to 
become the first Communist government to establish diplomatic relations with 
the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski was among the 306 members of the Sejm, or Parliament, who voted in 
favor of the law. Two voted against and 12 abstained. 
</P>
<P>
Under the comprehensive act, the church regained the right to buy and sell 
property, operate its own businesses, publish newspapers and establish and 
operate schools, hospitals and even radio and television stations without 
government interference. Religious orders and lay organizations will no longer 
be subject to government regulation, and controls on the construction of new 
churches were abolished. 
</P>
<P>
The government also agreed to return hospitals and other property seized from 
the church in the 1950s, or to pay compensation in cases in which the church 
does not wish to take back the property. Officials estimated the compensation 
will amount to "several billion zlotys," a sum in the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Government and church officials described the legislation as marking the end of 
a long and bitter conflict between the Communist Party and the powerful church, 
which claims the following of 90% of Poland's 38 million people. The church 
thus becomes the second major independent entity in a Communist state that 
recently re-legalized Solidarity, the East Bloc's first independent labor 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"The essential conditions have been created for ending the division into 
believers and non-believers still present in public life, with all its 
consequences," said party Politburo member Kazimierz Barcikowski. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Process of Political Negotiation 
</P>
<P>
Two other new laws passed by Parliament along with the church measure assure 
freedom of worship to all faiths and grant social security benefits to Poland's 
62,000-member clergy. Legal experts said the law on worship should end years of 
state discrimination against Jehovah's Witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of the package marked the culmination of a process of political 
negotiation between the church and party that began in 1981 and served as a key 
influence in the eventual decision by Jaruzelski to restore the political and 
trade union pluralism he abolished then under martial law. 
</P>
<P>
Courted strongly in the mid-1980s by a party leadership that hoped to stabilize 
the country with its help, the Catholic hierarchy stoutly held out for 
pluralism, in large part at the urging of Polish-born Pope John Paul II. When 
the Pope emphatically defended the Solidarity trade union during a 1987 tour of 
the country, incipient official hopes of a separate settlement with the Warsaw 
episcopate under Cardinal Jozef Glemp were extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
After two waves of strikes swept Poland last year, senior church officials were 
instrumental in setting up the first meetings between Solidarity founder Lech 
Walesa and Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak -- and eventually the "round 
table" talks that began early this year. 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough at the round table allowed the party and church to agree to a 
settlement. The legalization of the church in Poland, a step long sought by the 
episcopate, is to be matched by the extension of diplomatic recognition to the 
Communist government by the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican and government officials have been negotiating a protocol for 
relations. Church officials said the formal establishment of diplomatic ties 
should occur later this year.

RECRUIT SCANDAL JOLTS JAPAN OPPOSITION

Japan's opposition Clean Government Party emerged Wednesday as the latest 
casualty in a bribery case that has thrown the government into confusion, with 
its chairman becoming the third political party leader to say he will resign 
because of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Junya Yano, chairman of the Buddhist-affiliated Komeito, or Clean Government 
Party, declared his intention to resign hours after prosecutors questioned 
Katsuya Ikeda, a Komeito member of Parliament, on suspicion of peddling 
influence to Recruit Co., the employment services firm at the center of the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office also interrogated Takeo Fujinami, 
a member of Parliament belonging to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, 
prompting speculation that the criminal investigation is about to climax with 
the indictment of the two politicians. So far, 14 businessmen and bureaucrats 
have been arrested on charges of bribery and securities violations in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The developments Wednesday removed some of the pressure on the Liberal 
Democrats, who have borne the brunt of public condemnation for unethical 
fund-raising practices that have been laid bare by the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita announced April 25 that he would soon resign as 
prime minister and as head of the ruling party to take responsibility for his 
ties to Recruit stock transactions and political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly the entire leadership of the ruling party has been tainted by the 
scandal, leaving power brokers without a suitable successor and casting doubt 
on whether Takeshita will immediately carry out his promise to resign once the 
new budget goes into law at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Saburo Tsukamoto, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, resigned in 
February because of his ties to Recruit. Yano's Komeito is the second-largest 
opposition group, after the Japan Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Implicated in Similar Case 
</P>
<P>
Yano himself is not accused of involvement in the Recruit affair, but he has 
been implicated in a similar though unrelated case of questionable trading in 
shares of an electronics firm, Meidenko Co. He did not mention that case in 
announcing his resignation but said he was taking responsibility for the 
actions of Komeito lawmaker Ikeda and of a party member in the upper house who 
was arrested in yet another bribery scandal last year. 
</P>
<P>
Yano said he was quitting "to pave the way for Komeito to make a fresh start." 
</P>
<P>
Ikeda announced Tuesday that he would resign his seat in the lower house for 
"causing trouble" to his party but denied allegations that he had provided 
favors to Recruit in exchange for stock profits and political donations. 
</P>
<P>
Former chief Cabinet secretary Fujinami, the second politician reportedly 
facing indictment for selling influence to Recruit, has said he will resign 
from the ruling party, but it was not clear Wednesday whether he too would give 
up his seat in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, prosecutors would not formally interrogate suspects without first 
arresting them, but Japan's constitution forbids the arrest of members of 
Parliament while the body is in session, as it is currently. Wednesday's action 
by investigators was described by the Japanese media as the precursor to 
certain indictment of the two men without physical detention. 
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said this week that he is willing to 
testify in Parliament about his role in the Recruit scandal. Officials of his 
party said he will not testify until the investigation is completed. The 
Justice Ministry said that will be soon.

Premier Yu Kuo-hua announced his resignation Wednesday in a move that analysts 
said was a victory for Taiwan's young reformers against the ruling Nationalist 
Party's most powerful conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Yu, 75, said on state television that he offered his resignation to President 
Lee Teng-hui, but there was no official word on whether it was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Yu said he resigned to ensure party unity, to allow a younger generation to 
take over and because he is confident that Lee, who took office last year after 
the death of former President Chiang Ching-kuo, had consolidated his power and 
that Taiwan politics are stable. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Lee will probably accept the resignation of the premier, who has 
been under intense pressure to step down from young legislators in the party 
who fear he will be a liability in elections to Parliament in December. 
</P>
<P>
"Legislators who want to run for office are afraid that Yu will be a 
disadvantage," said Lu Ya-li, a professor of politics at National Taiwan 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Yu took office in 1984 after serving as central bank governor. He has been 
under constant public criticism for his cautious approach to economic and 
political reform. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers have reported that Yu had reservations about President Lee's foreign 
policy initiatives, which resulted this month in Taiwan officials going to 
Beijing for the first time to attend a meeting of the Asian Development Bank.

REVOLT IN GUATEMALA, WHILE EASILY QUELLED, POINTS TO WIDER GRIEVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

GUATEMALA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A failed coup attempt by senior military officers last week appears to have 
been triggered by a new outbreak of guerrilla warfare and the emergence of 
civilian President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo's controversial protege as a leading 
candidate to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
But while the revolt was thwarted without a shot by loyalist commanders and 
denounced by nearly every civilian group, the grievances voiced by the plotters 
are shared beyond their small circle and spell a lingering threat to 
Guatemala's incipient democracy, according to political sources and foreign 
diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
Since a similar coup attempt a year ago, these people say, Cerezo has yielded 
much of his power to the military hierarchy that saved him. The latest revolt, 
in their view, has strengthened those commanders committed to civilian rule 
while increasing the president's dependence on them. 
</P>
<P>
The army high command moved swiftly this week to stifle internal dissent, 
indicting 24 active and retired officers in a military court on rebellion and 
sedition charges for the May 9 uprising. But the crackdown may carry a price 
for Cerezo, Guatemalans close to the president believe. 
</P>
<P>
"These coup attempts are like heart attacks," said Juan Jose Rodil, a reformer 
dismissed from Cerezo's Cabinet after last year's coup attempt. "They kill part 
of the system and affect the health of the whole body. To survive, the patient 
has to accept certain restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
Guatemala, rent by Central America's most enduring conflict between the 
extremes of left and right, has never sustained a modern democratic government. 
Human rights groups estimate that up to 100,000 people died in political 
violence under a string of military dictators in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
After decimating a force of several thousand leftist guerrillas, the armed 
forces switched to a strategy of isolating the insurgency through rural 
development and civilian rule. Cerezo, a Christian Democrat, began a five-year 
term in January, 1986, after winning 68% of the popular vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Expectations 
</P>
<P>
But Guatemalans' high expectations of him have not been fulfilled. Despite 
modest economic growth and greater margins of civic freedom, the 46-year-old 
president is viewed today as unable to close a widening gap between rich and 
poor or to stop official corruption and lingering human rights abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop of popular disillusion, some military officers contend 
that the new counterinsurgency strategy is failing and would be further 
undermined by the election of Alfonso Cabrera, Cerezo's hand-picked 
presidential candidate, whom they view as a symbol of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
A manifesto drafted for the May 9 revolt charged that public funds were being 
diverted into a campaign "to install a party dictatorship for the benefit of a 
political clique of unscrupulous Christian Democrats" and into front 
organizations of a resurgent guerrilla army. 
</P>
<P>
It accused Gen. Hector A. Gramajo, the defense minister and most powerful 
military figure, of "support and complicity" in this process. 
</P>
<P>
Troops loyal to Gramajo and the president used tanks to corner soldiers 
involved in the four-hour rebellion before the proclamation could be broadcast 
or published. 
</P>
<P>
The uprising was undertaken before dawn with 300 soldiers from the air base at 
Guatemala City's airport and one of three army barracks in the capital. Wearing 
sky-blue kerchiefs to identify themselves, they seized the telephone company, 
police headquarters and the national radio network as well as Gramajo's wife 
and three children. 
</P>
<P>
But the rebels miscalculated. Apparently unaware of technology that averted a 
total shutdown of the telephone system, they failed to prevent the high command 
from enlisting other units against them. By 9 a.m. it was over. 
</P>
<P>
Cerezo identified the chief plotter as Col. Cesar Ramon Quinteros, an 
Israeli-trained officer who lost to Gramajo in maneuvering for the army's top 
post and was shifted from a troop command to head the largely symbolic Central 
American Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
Among the others indicted were three other colonels on the council, commanders 
of the two rebel units, a former police chief and four officers who were 
cashiered for the May 11, 1988, coup attempt but later freed under an amnesty. 
Three of those charged have eluded arrest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relaxed, Confident 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Cerezo said the military leadership was "much more annoyed" by 
this year's revolt, which he described as better organized, and ready to 
prosecute to the limit. He appeared relaxed and confident of finishing his 
term. 
</P>
<P>
"The reaction of the people and the political parties and, in general, the 
attitude of the army allow me to think that we have taken a step toward the 
consolidation of democracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Independent analysts are not so certain. Cerezo was able to dispel much of the 
tension lingering after last year's revolt, they say, with such policy changes 
as breaking off peace talks with the guerrillas, re-equipping the army, making 
economic concessions to business executives and canceling moves to upgrade ties 
with Communist nations. The new spasm of discontent seems directed more at the 
army leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more dangerous for Cerezo now," a Western diplomat said. "He doesn't have 
as much to play with except (getting rid of) Gramajo, the man he needs most." 
</P>
<P>
One catalyst for the revolt, according to lawyers for the plotters, was an 
April 25 guerrilla ambush that killed the second in command of the 
Huehuetenango army base in western Guatemala. The victim's brother-in-law, an 
air force colonel, took part in the coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The ambush followed stepped-up guerrilla attacks on army road crews in the 
mountainous interior, the loss of an air force plane that was apparently shot 
down and the bombing of a police station in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Days before last week's coup attempt, one of the cashiered plotters of the 1988 
revolt was quoted in Guatemala City newspapers as saying that "tension in the 
army is even higher now" because the commanders will not fight back 
aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Luis Arturo Isaacs, the army spokesman, denied that the guerrillas, whose 
armed strength he estimated at 800, are a renewed threat. But he acknowledged 
that the army's strategy of focusing on their civilian support base instead of 
direct pursuit "is hard for many officers to comprehend." 
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Gramajo is 20 years ahead of the institution on how to make the army work 
in a democratic framework," a military specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
Coup rumors began sweeping through a tense capital last month as Cerezo was 
buffeted by unusually strong criticism from Guatemala's Roman Catholic bishops 
and lashed out bitterly against rightist-controlled newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The final trigger for the coup attempt appears to have been the dismissal two 
weeks ago of Navy Capt. Romeo Guevara Reyes as national police chief and his 
replacement by a civilian Christian Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Guevara took part in the uprising. His spokesman, Carlos Chen, said Guevara had 
been pushed aside to give the ruling party a freer hand to put off-duty police 
officers to work in Cabrera's campaign for the party presidential primary on 
June 18. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts see the coup attempt as less a threat to Cerezo, who is now 
viewed as a lame duck, than to his longtime friend and protege. As secretary 
general of the party, Cabrera helped Cerezo win the nomination in 1985, then 
served as foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
The president supports Cabrera's candidacy, overlooking his friend's bouts of 
public drunkenness and mysterious wealth. Newspapers have suggested that 
Cabrera is involved in narcotics trafficking -- talk that Cerezo calls 
unfounded and ideologically motivated.

CONGRESS PASSES $4.55 WAGE FLOOR BILL IN FACE OF VETO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate gave final approval Wednesday to a bill raising the federal minimum 
wage to $4.55 an hour -- setting the stage for a certain veto by President Bush 
and a major confrontation with the White House over how far Democrats can push 
on social issues. 
</P>
<P>
Bush reiterated Wednesday that he will veto the legislation, arguing in a 
speech before a retailers' conference that it would force employers to cut back 
on the number of new entry-level jobs they create and that it would ultimately 
exacerbate inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"If the majority in the Congress rejects my offer of a reasonable compromise," 
he said, "a veto is going to be inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has proposed an increase to no more than $4.25 an hour, to take effect in 
1992 rather than in 1991, as the bill passed Wednesday provides. 
</P>
<P>
The President reasserted Wednesday that he would not accept any increase that 
exceeds his own proposal -- a point underscored by White House Chief of Staff 
John H. Sununu. He had told the same group earlier that "$4.25 is fine" but 
"$4.26 is vetoland -- now and forever." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic strategists conceded that Bush appeared to have the upper hand in 
the standoff. The 63-37 vote in the Senate fell short of the two-thirds 
majority that Democrats would need to override a veto. The measure was passed 
May 11 by the House on a 247-172 vote, also short of a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Democrats would seek to scale back the size of the 
increase after Bush vetoes the new legislation or simply allow the measure to 
languish and use the veto as a political issue to paint the Administration as 
uncaring about the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats already have compromised somewhat by agreeing to create a new 
subminimum wage that would enable employers to pay new workers with fewer than 
60 days' experience 85% of the minimum in an effort to stave off any job cuts 
from the increase in labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who led the Democratic effort on the Senate 
floor, challenged as "a sham" Bush's assertions that he had attempted to 
compromise with Congress. " 'Let them eat cake' is the message (to the poor) 
from the White House," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's hard-line stance is only partly on economic grounds. White House 
strategists said the President must draw the line now on the minimum wage issue 
or Democrats will be emboldened to challenge him with more-expensive proposals 
on other social issues, such as child care. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts contend that, with unemployment now so low -- and labor scarce -- 
the measure would have little real economic impact. Only a few million workers 
of the 99 million now in the work force actually earn the federal minimum wage, 
which is $3.35 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the eight years since the last increase in the federal minimum 
wage, many states -- including California -- have enacted state minimums that 
are higher than the federal minimum. California's minimum wage, for example, is 
$4.25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a veto by Bush later this month would put the Democrats in 
something of a quandary. Mainstream Democrats, led by Kennedy and Rep. Augustus 
F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), have made the minimum wage issue a major agenda 
item this year. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's hard-line position on the issue stands in sharp contrast to the more 
conciliatory approach he has taken in other areas, such as foreign affairs and 
reduction of the budget deficit, where he has sought to hammer out bipartisan 
accords. 
</P>
<P>
It also marks a major break with the Ronald Reagan Administration, which had 
consistently opposed any increase in the minimum wage. Bush announced the shift 
during the 1988 presidential campaign but tempered it with a demand that 
Congress enact a subminimum training wage.

In his speech to the retailers' group Wednesday, the President sought to 
portray the Democratic-sponsored legislation as likely to hurt low-income 
workers by depriving them of jobs. He disagreed with Democratic assertions that 
the difference between his stance and theirs is "three thin dimes." 
</P>
<P>
"My difference with the majority in Congress is not about 30 cents an hour on 
the minimum wage legislation; it's about hundreds of thousands of people . . . 
who won't have a job to go to if the minimum wage legislation before the 
Congress now becomes law," Bush told the group. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sign the legislation pending in Congress and go back to the tired agenda 
of government intervention that so often hurts the very people it attempts to 
help, or we can step forward to keep America on the path to a competitive 
future," he said.

A tornado ravaged a small town near Austin, and rescuers plucked residents from 
homes, cars and trees in the flood-stricken Dallas area as Texas bore the brunt 
of severe storms that soaked the Southwest and Northeast on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rivers and creeks overflowed in New Jersey after two days of record rain, 
chasing dozens of people from their homes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
At least three deaths in Texas were attributed to the weather. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-dawn tornado cut a swath 7 miles long and a mile wide through Jarrell, 
killing one person and injuring at least 24. Fifteen homes and an apartment 
complex were destroyed in the town of 1,000 people 40 miles from Austin. 
</P>
<P>
A 42-year-old woman died of a broken neck when the tornado hit her mobile home. 
Hospitals in Georgetown and Temple reported that 24 people sought treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters in the Dallas area, which received nearly 6 inches of rain in less 
than 24 hours, sent hundreds of residents to shelters. Policemen, firefighters 
and others rescued scores of people from homes, cars and, in one case, a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedale Police Chief David Geeslin said two women were stranded in a tree for 
eight hours after their car was washed off the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
Another rescue attempt ended in tragedy as firefighters, secured with ropes 
strung to telephone poles, spent 2 1/2 hours trying to reach a woman whose car 
was swept off a bridge into a Dallas creek. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who had been waiting on top of the car, "got back into the car and, 
at that time, the car fell into the creek. It floated for a few minutes and 
went down," firefighter Dennis Ground said. Her body was found a half mile 
away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rescued From Truck 
</P>
<P>
In suburban Grand Prairie, the body of an elderly man was recovered from a 
truck in a creek, police Lt. James Gatlin said. 
</P>
<P>
A Kennedale city councilman used his boat to rescue a man who had gone to check 
his cattle and became trapped by rising waters, Geeslin said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 150 people were evacuated from the Five Mile Creek area, 50 from Grand 
Prairie and 125 to 150 from Kennedale, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters 4 feet deep poured through Alvarado, just south of Ft. Worth, 
forcing evacuations, the National Weather Service reported. A tornado tossed a 
car off the road and overturned six 18-wheel trucks on Interstate 35 near 
Jarrell, and several small planes were flipped over and hangars were damaged at 
the airport in Cleburne. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Texas, a tornado battered an elementary school in Round Rock, 
injuring one person. Police said about seven houses were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Flood warnings were issued in northern New Jersey, where dozens of people were 
forced from their homes because of rising water on the Passaic River. 
</P>
<P>
Newark got .71 inches of rain Wednesday and 2.11 inches on Tuesday, breaking 
records that had stood for up to 49 years. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore-Washington International Airport endured its 13th straight day of 
rain, the longest such stretch in 40 years of record-keeping there. The old 
record for May was nine days, set in 1979.

WHISKEY FIRM WINS BIRTH DEFECTS CASE; 
</P>
<P>
JIM BEAM NOT REQUIRED TO WARN OF PREGNANCY RISKS, JURY FINDS

A federal jury on Wednesday cleared Jim Beam Brands Co. of negligence for not 
stating on its whiskey labels that alcohol consumption by pregnant women could 
cause birth defects in their children. 
</P>
<P>
Harold and Candance Thorp of Seattle were seeking about $4 million in damages 
for lifetime assistance for their son, Michael, 4, whose retardation, physical 
deformities and other problems were blamed on fetal alcohol syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Thorp, 39, testified that she was an alcoholic who drank as much as half a 
fifth of Jim Beam a day, but she and her husband insisted that she would have 
stopped drinking had the bottle labels carried a warning for pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
Beam "had an obligation to get this message out," the Thorps' attorney, Barry 
Epstein, has said. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, witnesses for Beam said that Candance Thorp had been warned 
repeatedly by relatives and friends about the dangers of drinking alcohol when 
pregnant and that she and other alcoholics would not have heeded a label 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
Beam contended also that the boy's problems were caused by heredity and 
neglect, not by alcohol abuse by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Stafford, chief attorney for the Jim Beam company, said after the 
verdict that he was "obviously pleased," but he refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Epstein said that the verdict was not a total loss and that the decision would 
not hinder similar suits in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that this litigation has created an awareness in the public that, if 
it saves one child, it will all be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope, as a result of this case . . . that (news of) the dangers of alcohol 
will be spread far and wide," Epstein said. He said he did not know whether the 
verdict would be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors interviewed after the verdict said that the six-member panel's decision 
was unanimous and required no argument during 3 1/2 days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised they were suing Jim Beam," said Staci Gilbreth, 22, of 
Bothell, an accountant who had her first baby in December. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have sued everyone," said Geraldine Jackson, 32, of Renton, who 
works in real estate. She referred to testimony that Thorp had been seen 
drinking beer in bars a number of times during her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys have said the case was the first against a liquor company for birth 
defects linked to alcohol. Two similar cases are pending in Washington state 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
About 1% of the infants born in the United States each year, or 35,000 babies, 
are born with fetal alcohol syndrome. Symptoms include slow growth, central 
nervous system impairment, hyperactivity, mental retardation and distorted 
facial characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Carolyn Dimmick, who presided over the trial, instructed 
jurors that the law requires a product to bear a warning and instructions of 
the latent and unknown risks associated with its use if those risks can result 
in harm to potential users. 
</P>
<P>
However, she told jurors, a company is exempt from such warnings if it can 
prove that the risks involved are general knowledge in the community. 
</P>
<P>
In November, federal law will require all alcoholic beverage containers to 
carry warnings about birth defects and other health hazards related to 
drinking.

Oil was poured Wednesday into a dry fountain in front of the Exxon building in 
Manhattan, and a caller claiming responsibility said it was in retaliation for 
the company's giant oil spill in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
A caller identifying himself only as an Alaskan told the Associated Press that 
he and a fellow Alaskan had dumped 50 gallons of oil in the Exxon fountain, 
which has been under repair. 
</P>
<P>
The caller said the pair put the oil in the fountain so Exxon executives "might 
feel a little closer to the story" of the oil that spilled March 24 from the 
tanker Exxon Valdez and "to protest that it's taking a long time to clean up." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very small amount, and we're cleaning it up," said Vince Silvestri, 
spokesman for the Rockefeller Center office complex. He said it appeared to be 
motor oil.

UC IRVINE PLAN, INCLUDING RESEARCH PARK, IS UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine officials Wednesday unveiled a 15-year blueprint for growth that 
includes development of a long-awaited research park and an urban community 
with retail and housing development that would still preserve nearly a third of 
the campus' 1,510 acres for woodlands and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
The research park, which is expected to be a magnet for biomedical firms and 
other high-technology companies that would work cooperatively with the public 
university, is the most innovative and potentially controversial element of the 
plan for the 25-year-old school. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Jack W. Peltason has referred to the planned research park as the 
path of the future for research-oriented universities such as UC Irvine. 
Located in the heart of Orange County's growing high-tech corridor, some have 
predicted the university park could spur development on the scale of Stanford's 
Silicon Valley or the Research Triangle near Duke University in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's Long Range Development Plan, which will be the subject of public hearings 
in Irvine and Newport Beach and will be presented to University of California 
Regents in September, scales back more aggressive growth plans of 1963 and 
1970, when it was anticipated that students eventually would number nearly 
30,000, instead of the 14,500 now. Projections now are for 26,500 graduate and 
undergraduate students at UCI by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
Because Orange County and the surrounding communities of Irvine and Newport 
Beach would have anticipated greater university expansion based on the previous 
plans, no significant community opposition is expected, said Ray Catalano, 
assistant executive vice chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
"No plan has no enemies," Catalano said. "But we believe our neighbors will be 
pleased with this plan." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said he sees great potential for community benefit 
from UC Irvine's projected growth and the planned research park. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume it is going to be an extraordinarily sophisticated level of research, 
and we all understand that there is a synergism created by research at the 
university on the one hand, and its application in the private sector," Agran 
said. "It can be a real benefit to the community and I'm hopeful that the plan 
meets our concerns with regard to traffic generation and other environmental 
effects." 
</P>
<P>
The new development plan, in the works since 1985, was completed after pacts 
were reached last summer with the city of Irvine to limit university-generated 
traffic, and the Irvine Co. to remove a 25-year-old deed restriction that would 
allow construction of 2 million square feet of commercial buildings on UC 
Irvine land. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the plan is something university officials and community 
officials have only dreamed about until now: a full-fledged biomedical and 
high-tech research park. 
</P>
<P>
Two parcels totaling 235 acres have been set aside for private research 
buildings, to be built by research firms and then leased back to them. Based on 
the model of UC Irvine's first such venture, the Nelson Research &amp; 
Development Co. center built in 1983, the park would offer lease income, space 
and materials for research by students and professors and an enhanced potential 
to win multimillion-dollar research grants. 
</P>
<P>
Catalano said Wednesday that high-tech and medical research firms already 
located in Orange County will do more to drive a Silicon Valley here than UC 
Irvine's relatively small research parcels. Still, the campus is likely to be a 
magnet for biomedical research firms that want to tap into university 
brainpower, he said.

The segregated beach where mixed-race parliamentary leader Allan Hendrickse 
swam in defiance of apartheid two years ago has been opened to all races, an 
official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Provincial governor Gene Louw announced his decision to desegregate the beach 
in Port Elizabeth three days after President Pieter W. Botha named him 
successor to Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis. 
</P>
<P>
Louw last year overruled a decision by the Port Elizabeth City Council to open 
its beaches to all races. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickse triggered a prolonged row with Botha on New Year's Day, 1987, when 
he led a group of "colored" (mixed-race) lawmakers in a defiant swim from 
King's Beach in a protest against apartheid and the segregation of public 
facilities.

BRONCOS' LORI THOMPSON EMERGES AS TEAM'S LEADING PITCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout most of her collegiate career, pitcher Lori Thompson of the Cal Poly 
Pomona women's softball team has hardly been a center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
Before this season, the 23-year-old senior's playing time had been mostly 
limited to mop-up duty as a reliever and an occasional starter. 
</P>
<P>
But with many of the starters lost to graduation, Thompson became a full-time 
starter this season and did not squander the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
She has been the team's leading pitcher with a 19-7 record and an 0.64 
earned-run average. Thompson has been even more impressive late in the season, 
not allowing an earned run in her last 54 innings. 
</P>
<P>
While her emergence as a standout for the Broncos may be surprising to some 
people, Thompson says it is a result of growing more accustomed to her new 
role. 
</P>
<P>
"I think toward the end of the season I've felt more relaxed and confident," 
she said. "I think it's because I've gotten the opportunity to pitch a lot this 
year. You can develop a consistency, whereas in the past I didn't get to pitch 
that much." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said being more relaxed and confident has meant everything to her 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been the main factor, because in the past I was a little more tentative 
in knowing that I wouldn't get a chance to pitch a lot." 
</P>
<P>
She said it is a much different feeling than when she arrived in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was a pitching star at Canyon High School in Anaheim and at San Diego 
State. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, she was an All-CIF Southern Section and All-Orange County 
selection as a senior and made the All-Century League first team for two 
straight years. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior she was recruited by a handful of Division I programs and selected 
San Diego State because it was the only school in California that offered her a 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
In her freshman year with the Aztecs, Thompson posted a 15-9 record and 0.64 
ERA and was selected the team's outstanding freshman for 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But she wasn't thrilled with the idea of finishing her career at San Diego 
State, which has never been regarded as a Division I power. So she decided to 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to play in a top-quality softball program," she said. "Our high 
school team was always one of the top. So being used to winning, I wasn't 
satisfied with being under .500 and not making the playoffs. I wanted to go 
somewhere where I could make the playoffs and have good coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, which was closer to home and has reached the Division I playoffs eight 
straight years, fit the description. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew a couple of players on the Pomona team from summer ball. So seeing how 
they played made me pretty excited about coming here." 
</P>
<P>
After sitting out the next season as a redshirt under NCAA transfer rules, 
Thompson saw limited duty in her first two seasons with the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here Rhonda Wheatley was in her senior year and I didn't expect to 
pitch that much, and last year we had two other pitchers who expected to pitch 
a lot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, Thompson posted a 4-2 record and 1.13 ERA with nine saves in 80 
2/3 innings while the All-American Wheatley handled the bulk of the pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"I pitched mostly in relief at the beginning of the year," she said. "I started 
a few games, but once we got into the season Rhonda pitched most of the games." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, pitching 86 innings, she had a 9-3 record and 0.81 ERA with seven 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
She said the infrequent playing time was not easy to accept at first. "It was 
difficult to adjust to not pitching all the time," she said. "It took a lot to 
get used to, but I think in the long run it was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
With the departure of the team's top starter from last season, Kris Rokosz, 
Thompson knew she would pitch more in her final year with the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I would get to pitch a lot. We lost a lot of people from last year so I 
came into the season ready to pitch a lot." 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-2, Thompson is one of the shortest players on the team. She said her 
size may have been a reason why the top Division I programs didn't recruit her 
from high school. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the only time I've ever been told, 'Oh, you're too small,' " she 
said. "But it's never bothered me." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson says her size doesn't create a disadvantage as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that makes much difference as long as you're strong in the 
mechanical aspects," she said. "I have always wondered what it would be like if 
I was 5-8, though." 
</P>
<P>
She said her best pitches are the rise ball and curve ball, although she also 
throws a knuckle ball. She said that "since they moved the mound back to 43 
feet, it's affected my speed. So it's made me made me more concerned about my 
location and my pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson is happy with the skills she has developed as a pitcher. With her 
college career winding down, her only regret is that she will not have much 
longer to pitch for the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me since this is the first year that I've gotten a chance to 
pitch a lot," she said. "I have mixed emotions about this being my senior year. 
One side is ready to go on to other things, but the other side wants to pitch a 
little more." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said she will probably concentrate on her studies as an exercise 
science major. She is hoping for a career in physical therapy and sports 
rehabilitation -- a subject she became acutely aware of when she was in her 
redshirt year. 
</P>
<P>
"I injured my back near the end of my freshman year and that's when I got 
interested in physical therapy and rehabilitation of injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson doesn't want to think about that at the moment, though. Her thoughts 
are focused on the NCAA regionals where the eighth-ranked Broncos (40-21) will 
square off against fourth-ranked Cal State Fullerton (47-13) in a best-of-three 
series Friday and Saturday in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The winner advances to the Division I World Series the following week at 
Sunnyvale. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson pitched in only one game in the World Series last season when the 
Broncos finished third in the nation. She said this year's team is different. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we were a power team and this team has to play well together to 
win," she said. "But we feel we have the potential to beat Cal State Fullerton. 
We can go to the World Series again if we play well together."

CRA PRODS THEATRE CENTER TO SHOW GREATER FISCAL STABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Expressing uneasiness with the "cash management" of the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center on Spring Street, the Community Redevelopment Agency has urged the 
theater's board to demonstrate "fiscal responsibility and maturity" if it 
expects to receive further public funding. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency, currently under fire from some City Council members 
for how it spends its money, said it is willing to give the struggling LATC an 
additional $350,000 beyond what was previously promised, provided the board 
steps up its fund-raising campaign and meets several other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The theater, located in a 1916 building once used as a bank, has pledged to 
raise $1.3 million during the current fiscal year -- $550,000 less than what 
the CRA is asking for. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, the CRA has allocated $18 million in funding and $7 
million in loans to the theater, a spokesman said. The four-stage facility, 
which opened in September, 1985, now draws a weekly audience of 4,400, 
according to Bill Bushnell, artistic producing director. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding to subsidize the theater, a showcase for local talent and 
avant-garde interpretations of the classics, the CRA hoped it would help spur 
redevelopment of a blighted downtown area. But the neighborhood improvements 
have been slow in coming, and the agency has drawn criticism for singling out 
the costly undertaking at the expense of other social and cultural needs. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter Tuesday to Ronald C. Peterson, a downtown attorney and member of 
the theater's board, CRA Chairman James M. Wood said that before the agency 
could seek further LATC funding from the City Council "we will need a higher 
level of comfort of your willingness to meet conditions that assure us of 
fiscal responsibility and maturity. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Wood noted that two years ago, the CRA approved a $4.9-million budget for LATC 
facilities over the following five years. With three years to go, he wrote, 
only $951,948 remains. 
</P>
<P>
"They have not met the terms of that five-year agreement," CRA Administrator 
John Tuite said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, while acknowledging that the theater in the past did not always meet 
its fund-raising goals, said he was surprised by Wood's letter, since $1.3 
million was raised last year from such sources as Arco and the Times Mirror 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lived Within Our Means' 
</P>
<P>
"During the last year we're quite proud of having lived within our means, in 
terms of expenses being covered by income," Peterson said. "If they're talking 
about old history, I'd like to hear what they have to say." 
</P>
<P>
Calling LATC a "marvelous pioneering effort," Tuite said Wood's letter was not 
intended as a threat. "We're convinced that a major cultural center on Spring 
Street can survive and thrive," he said. "There's no question about our 
commitment. . . . It's a critical and crucial part of the revitalization of 
Spring Street." 
</P>
<P>
But he said the agency has always intended that the theater become 
self-sufficient. As one of the conditions, the CRA said the theater would have 
to deposit all its subscription proceeds in an escrow account, drawing from it 
only as plays are actually produced. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said that his theater, like most others, "to some extent uses 
subscription money to put on plays."

SUPERIOR COURT TAKES CASE TO SEASIDE HOTEL; 
</P>
<P>
MOVE IS DESIGNED TO CLEAR CIVIL BACKLOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Argue a case in a hotel room? Why not? "I'll try a case in a playground? -- as 
long as I've got a judge and jury, it's OK with me," attorney James R. Gillen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It has not yet come to that; juries are not about to take their seats on jungle 
gyms. 
</P>
<P>
But in a first-of-its-kind effort to clear a choking backlog of civil cases in 
Los Angeles County, a jury is now hearing a lawsuit in Room 905 of the Bay View 
Plaza Holiday Inn at the ocean end of Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Gillen is representing the injured party, an unemployed Army veteran who was 
either -- depending on which witnesses you believe -- clobbered by a falling 
traffic signal or merely grazed by a street sign attached to the signal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remaining Defendant 
</P>
<P>
After the manufacturer, supplier and installer all settled out of court, the 
City of Santa Monica was left as the sole defendant, facing damages that have 
yet to be determined if it is found to be at fault. 
</P>
<P>
The case is not unusual, but this is not the usual courtroom scene. Robed in 
the majesty of his office, Judge Leonard Wolf presided in the hotel conference 
room from an ordinary table perched on a platform and draped in blue cloth. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee brought by room service workers was available in an adjoining room. 
Lawyers carried their exhibits around the cramped room as jurors fidgeted on 
pink, hard-backed chairs, their eyes tempted by a view of waves, palm trees and 
wispy clouds over the distant headland of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement has its advantages. Gillen said he once rented a room for 
himself in the hotel and took a nap and a shower during a lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
The downstairs lobby provides yet more contrasts to an ordinary courthouse. 
Lawyers, litigants and loafers are nowhere to be seen, their places taken by 
hotel guests lingering over drinks or basking by the pool. A discreet note by 
the elevator advises that "Santa Monica Superior Court" is one of the day's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I invited the jurors to bring their bathing suits, but they haven't taken 
advantage of it yet," said Wolf, who retired this year but has returned to the 
bench three times since then because of the heavy demand for judges. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics are daunting. Only four of the Santa Monica court's 15 judges 
routinely hear civil cases, but the number of cases ready for trial has 
averaged more than 500 this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even Longer List 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, there are 50 civil court judges at the Superior Court in 
downtown Los Angeles, where there is a waiting list of 1,000 to 1,200 cases. 
</P>
<P>
"So you can see that although we are a small courthouse compared to the Central 
District, our workload is extremely heavy," said Lynn Seabury, chief 
administrator for the Santa Monica Court. 
</P>
<P>
Formally known as the West District of the Los Angeles Superior Court, the 
Santa Monica court covers an area that stretches from Malibu to Marina del Rey 
and east to La Cienega Boulevard, an area that produces a large number of 
lawsuits because of the concentration of legal talent in Century City, Beverly 
Hills and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
With most civil lawsuits in Los Angeles County facing a delay of up to five 
years before they can be tried, administrators and judges have been looking for 
other ways to manage the flood of litigation, Seabury said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do whatever we can to keep a case from going to court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volunteer Attorneys 
</P>
<P>
Under one program, 85 out of 345 cases scheduled to go to trial in Santa Monica 
in the next 10 months have been settled with the help of volunteer attorneys 
who act as referees, saving 488.5 days of court time, Seabury said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those efforts, trials have also had to be held on a stage at Santa 
Monica High School and in the City Council chambers at Santa Monica City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until last week that the Holiday Inn trial, which began in the 
courthouse, was moved to the hotel, where Room 905 costs the county about $100 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
Money has been available for renting conference rooms in hotels since 1988, but 
the Santa Monica case was the first in which both sides agreed to it. 
</P>
<P>
"We just started putting them in the hotels out here because counsel wanted a 
Santa Monica jury and wanted to stay in Santa Monica, so they were willing to 
go anywhere, even to a hotel," Seabury said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Diego Led Way 
</P>
<P>
While this was a first in Los Angeles County, San Diego Superior Court has been 
holding trials in four rooms at the Hotel San Diego since March, said Ken 
Martone, acting executive officer of that court. 
</P>
<P>
The Holiday Inn facility in Santa Monica is "makeshift, but it worked out 
well," said Wolf, a 23-year veteran of the bench who headed the Santa Monica 
court as presiding judge before his retirement. "I'm the guinea pig," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While some of the jurors complained about their hard seats, others said they 
could see better and hear more of what was going on than they could in a 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
All parties, especially the attorneys, found the room a bit cramped and lacking 
some of the dignity of a formal courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the dramatic aspect," said Norman N. Hirata, an attorney for the 
City of Santa Monica who has mixed feelings about holding the trial in Room 
905. 
</P>
<P>
Quiet conferences at the bench are out of the question, so judge, attorneys and 
court reporter either have to move into an adjoining room, or send the jurors 
in and out. 
</P>
<P>
Hirata said his colleague, Debra Sue Kanoff, enjoys the hotel more than he 
does. 
</P>
<P>
"Debbie likes the more relaxed flavor. She likes to look at the guests with 
their bags and wonder where the people are coming from and where they're 
going," he said.

ALCOHOL, DRUG USE CITED IN ROSS FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE and BOB BAKER, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fired sheriff's investigator Rickey Ross, freed from jail earlier this week 
when murder charges against him were dropped, was terminated because of several 
violations -- including the use of alcohol and drugs and misappropriation of 
narcotics evidence, according to a letter released Wednesday by the county 
Civil Service Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations, contained in a four-page April 27 letter to Ross from Sheriff 
Sherman Block, represent the first public explanation of why the deputy was 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was released in response to reporters' questions to the Sheriff's 
Department about whether Ross would be rehired in the light of Monday's 
decision by the district attorney's office to dismiss three first-degree murder 
counts against him. Ross had been held in County Jail since his arrest Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
"By your actions, you have brought discredit and embarrassment to yourself and 
the department," Block wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Appealed 
</P>
<P>
Ross, 40, an 18-year veteran of the department, appealed Block's decision last 
week. The commission is to decide Wednesday whether to hold a hearing on the 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
None of Block's allegations were linked to the accusation made by the sheriff 
and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates in February that Ross had slain 
three South-Central area prostitutes with his service handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his Rialto residence Wednesday evening, Ross said, "On the advice of 
my attorney, I have no comment" on Block's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Jay Jaffee, said he, too, could not comment because he had not 
analyzed the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The Ross case, in the words of a ranking LAPD official, served to "tarnish" the 
image of the department, because it was the LAPD's crime lab which -- 
apparently mistakenly -- linked Ross to the three slayings after forensic tests 
on his 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outside Evaluation 
</P>
<P>
The official said Tuesday he would propose to Gates that outside experts, such 
as those from the FBI, be brought in to find out whether the lab's operations 
are flawed. Gates was not available to meet with staff on Wednesday, said the 
source, who asked for anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The Ross case developed the morning of Feb. 23, when the off-duty deputy was 
stopped in South-Central Los Angeles by police officers on what was described 
as a routine traffic check. He was seated next to a prostitute and he drove 
erratically away from the curb as officers approached the car, police said at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his arrest, Gates said there was evidence that Ross and the 
woman had been smoking crack cocaine. No drugs, however, were found in the 
deputy's system. 
</P>
<P>
Block and Gates subsequently told a news conference announcing Ross' arrest 
that he was a suspect in the murders of three prostitutes, based on the LAPD's 
ballistics tests of a handgun found in the trunk of the deputy's county-owned 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Block, in his letter to Ross, alleged that the woman with Ross told 
investigators "she was a prostitute who exchanged sexual favors for drugs. She 
said that you provided a small piece of cocaine and at the time the officers 
approached your vehicle, you and she were smoking cocaine together. She said 
you were using a Pepsi can as a pipe, and she was about to perform an act of 
oral copulation upon you." Additionally, Block said that after the alleged 
incident with the prostitute, "an audit was conducted" of narcotics evidence 
Ross handled during his recent assignment as part of a federal drug task force 
at Los Angeles International Airport. It revealed, Block said, "that you had 
failed to follow proper Sheriff's Department procedure in handling narcotics 
evidence under your control." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handling of Evidence 
</P>
<P>
For example, Block alleged, Ross had indicated in a ledger he "had sent 
narcotics evidence to the state for disposal. However, the transmittal document 
for that transaction as well as the narcotics evidence has not been located." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the LAPD's testing of Ross' handgun was similar to an 
error in another high-profile case three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
When murder suspect James Hawkins Jr. was arrested in 1986, police found two 
guns they believed might have been used by Hawkins to kill two alleged drug 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Police firearms examiners had already determined that both men were killed by 
bullets fired by the same gun. After examining bullets test-fired from one of 
the recovered guns, they concluded that that gun was the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
However an independent examination sought by defense lawyers found the gun was 
not a conclusive match. Harvey Giss, a deputy district attorney in the county 
prosecutor's special trials section, said he did not learn about the flaw in 
the LAPD lab until confronted with it by the defense attorney during opening 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Examination 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, Giss said, he sought a second independent examination of the gun, 
which confirmed that no conclusive matching of the weapon to the fatal bullets 
was possible. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Ross case, prosecutors were able to introduce other evidence which 
resulted in the conviction of Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay said Wednesday that after the district 
attorney's office "communicated our concerns," the LAPD began requiring all 
ballistics examiners' findings to be confirmed by a second examiner. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ross case, a second examiner confirmed the errant finding by the lead 
examiner, Detective Jimmy L. Trahin.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHARGES AGAINST 3 IN BABY DEATH DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A South Bay Municipal Court judge on Wednesday dismissed criminal child 
endangerment charges against a husband, wife and teen-age daughter who 
allegedly operated a Lomita day-care home where a 16-month-old girl strangled 
to death last year. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas P. Allen Jr. ruled there was insufficient evidence to try Robert 
and Linda Zieger and their daughter, Laura, in connection with the death of 
Michele Heasley. 
</P>
<P>
Allen did order, however, that Linda Zieger, 47, and Laura Zieger, 19, stand 
trial June 19 on a lesser charge that they did not have a state license to 
operate a day-care business at their home. 
</P>
<P>
The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum six-month jail sentence, compared to a 
six-year prison for felony child endangerment charges. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said he was "deeply, deeply bothered" by the case, but felt the district 
attorney's office had not proved gross negligence, the standard required for a 
felony conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Michele died last November after being found unconscious in a crib where she 
had been left napping.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEEN CHARGED WITH SETTING CHILD AFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teen-ager was charged with attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon 
Wednesday in connection with the burning of a 6-year-old playmate in Cudahy 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred as five boys were playing in a lot behind the Atlantis 
Motel. Police said motel residents reported that the 14-year-old suspect and 
6-year-old Phil Kowal Jr. were fighting, and that the older boy dumped gasoline 
over Kowal and set him on fire. 
</P>
<P>
One of the playmates, Raul Silav, 10, said the incident, which left Kowal with 
first- and second-degree burns on his face, neck and left arm, happened while 
the boys were running in and out of puddles of ignited gas. 
</P>
<P>
Kowal was in serious but stable condition at County-USC Medical Center, 
hospital officials said. The 14-year-old suspect, being held in the Los 
Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey, was scheduled to be arraigned today in 
Juvenile Court.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CENTINELA TO EXTEND EMERGENCY SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Centinela Hospital Medical Center has agreed to continue treating emergency 
obstetric patients after May 26, although it will refuse to accept other 
patients brought in by paramedics after that date, officials announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the Inglewood hospital and the county supersedes 
Centinela's earlier decision to withdraw completely from the emergency care 
system and apparently ends fears that it would create a domino effect, 
prompting other hospitals to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
After Centinela announced in March it would soon stop taking paramedic 
patients, Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne announced it had filed 
for state permission to close its doors to paramedic patients. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital said it feared an increase in obstetric patients that it could not 
properly treat. Centinela is the only hospital in its immediate area with an 
obstetrics unit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a potential disaster just waiting to happen," Carl Williams, of the 
county's Department of Health Services, said Wednesday. "I am pleased we have 
been able to come to an agreement on this."

SCHOOLS IN L.A. AREA TRAIL IN CAP TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asserting that "when California educators set goals, they deliver," State Supt. 
of Public Instruction Bill Honig said that many of the state's elementary and 
middle schools have met "accountability targets" set by the state for 
performance on the California Assessment Program (CAP) test. However, schools 
in the Los Angeles area did not perform as well on the whole as those in the 
rest of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm obviously disappointed," Honig said of Los Angeles area schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Two-thirds of the schools in our state are doing what we asked them to do," 
Honig said. He explained that the state set performance and progress goals in 
1983-84 and in 1985-86. The figures released by the state this week -- a kind 
of report card for the public schools -- indicate that the majority have met or 
surpassed those targets. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are based on average CAP scores for third, sixth and eighth grades, 
and show whether schools with these grades met state performance and progress 
targets on the tests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statewide Results 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, Honig said, 56.5% of schools with third grades met the state 
targets. Only 36% met no targets. Sixty-four percent of schools with sixth 
grades met the goals, as did 69% of the schools with eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said he was especially pleased that "all types of schools have shown that 
they can do the job: rich and poor, inner-city, rural and suburban, those with 
middle-class English-speaking students and those with new Americans for whom 
English is a second language." 
</P>
<P>
But schools in Los Angeles County did not fare as well. About 45% of those with 
third grades met the state's 1983-84 targets, while 25% met no targets and 
scored poorly when compared with similar schools. Just over 48% of the county 
schools with sixth grades were top performers. Local schools with eighth grades 
came closer to meeting statewide norms, with over 65% as top performers. 
</P>
<P>
"Other comparable areas are making considerable progress," Honig said. "Los 
Angeles seems to be stuck in the starting blocks. Other areas are leaving it 
behind." Honig pointed out that Los Angeles Unified School District can ill 
afford a strike or other major disruption of the schools in light of its 
mediocre performance. "Los Angeles can't afford to be on hold for a year," he 
said. "It's the largest district in the state, and we have got to find a way to 
get it going again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Unified Trails 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified's scores trailed those of county schools taken as a whole. 
About 38% of the district's schools with third grades, 41% of those with sixth 
grades and 59% of those with eighth grades met the 1983-84 targets. 
</P>
<P>
Other county districts varied widely in performance and progress. For example, 
all schools in the Beverly Hills Unified School District met the state's 
targets. And, all of the schools with sixth grades in the Compton Unified 
School District performed poorly, while its schools with eighth grades did 
almost as well as schools statewide.

DETROIT'S CAMPBELL TO MEET WITH VACHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colin Campbell, a prime candidate to become the next coach of the Kings, 
confirmed from his home in Windsor, Canada, Wednesday that he would meet in Los 
Angeles today with Rogie Vachon, the Kings' general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, an assistant coach with the Detroit Red Wings, said that he felt 
ready to make the move to head coach. And he acknowledged that his longtime 
friendship with Wayne Gretzky probably doesn't hurt his chances of getting the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell is not the only candidate being brought in for interviews, and the 
Kings are still planning to take their time in the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't indicated to me exactly when they plan to make a decision," 
Campbell said. "The only thing I've heard is that they want to have a coach 
before the draft." 
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that when Vachon asked Detroit General Manager Jimmy 
Devellano for permission to talk with Campbell, Devellano indicated that the 
Red Wings would want a draft pick as compensation if the Kings were to hire 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy has given me his blessing in this," Campbell said. "I think it's the 
unwritten rule in this league that if you have the chance to better your 
position, they'll let you go. . . . I think they only get snooty if you do it 
within your own division." 
</P>
<P>
Although Campbell has never been a head coach, he has been given a wide range 
of responsibility under a respected head coach, Jacques Demers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides coming to Los Angeles with the blessings of both Devellano and Demers, 
Campbell said he was also coming with warnings from them. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to look at what was being offered very carefully and be sure it 
was what I wanted," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles job wasn't much of a plum a few years ago, but all that has 
changed with the addition of Gretzky and others. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. is a very nice situation now," Campbell said, echoing the comments made 
recently by Calgary assistant Doug Risebrough, another possible candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"They have some great scorers and they have a great goaltender. If you don't 
have a great goaltender, you can't always just go out and get him. They made a 
good deal there (to get Kelly Hrudey). And they have some toughness. They also 
have some weaknesses, but they could be worked out."

SCOTT OSTLER: SOME QUESTIONABLE THINGS ARE GOING ON IN THE SPORTING WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tough questions . . . 
</P>
<P>
Can I have a show of hands of those who, like me, will be satisfied with 
whatever information is revealed in Bart Giamatti's conclusion on the Pete Rose 
case, and who don't particularly care if they ever see the 225-page secret 
report that Margo Adams' ghostwriter was trying to peddle to the media? 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of what's-her-name, how come we haven't heard much from her since her 
latest arrest on shoplifting charges? 
</P>
<P>
Can we be sure the mysteriously-obtained Rose report wasn't somehow shoplifted? 
</P>
<P>
Is it true that if the Pete Rose report is edited to exclude testimony of 
convicted felons with axes to grind, the report will consist of a 
three-paragraph testimony from a waitress at a Denny's coffee shop in Plant 
City who claims Rose flipped her, double or nothing, for the price of a glazed 
doughnut? 
</P>
<P>
If Carl Lewis' goal this track season is to go under 9.90 in the 100 and beyond 
29-0 in the long jump, as he says it is, wouldn't he have a lot better shot if 
he trimmed some of the altitude and sharp edges off his hair style? Can you 
imagine what Lewis would do wearing the Michael Jordan look? 
</P>
<P>
If someone told you a National Basketball Assn. team actually botched a simple 
announcement about an alleged interview with a prospective coach, what team 
would you guess? I'd probably guess the Clippers, but that would be a cheap 
shot, wouldn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that Jim Valvano, even if he decided to interview for the Clipper 
coaching vacancy, would be the wrong man for this post, since his teams have 
low graduation rates, whereas the Clippers historically graduate a high 
percentage of their top players into winning NBA programs? 
</P>
<P>
Was Robbie Ftorek trying to endear himself to Bruce McNall when Ftorek asked 
McNall to give up his rinkside "hot box" seats, claiming that the owner's close 
proximity to the bench was a distraction? 
</P>
<P>
What would you do if you had just realized your life's dream by buying the 
local hockey team and the new coach exiled you back to the old owner's box 
waaaaay up in the Great Western rafters? 
</P>
<P>
Unless the Angels snap out of this rocket ride they're on, how will we ever 
know whether or not Doug Rader's miraculous personality transformation from 
jerk to prince is for real? 
</P>
<P>
While Margo Adams' ghostwriter is digging around for important manuscripts, can 
he fetch us a copy of Dexter Manley's Oklahoma State academic transcripts? 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins' defensive end is 30 years old and says he has just learned to 
read and spell, so what does that say about Oklahoma State as a grove of 
academia? Has this particular grove been napalmed? Or does Manley's confession 
demonstrate that at OSU, compassion rules, that the school is willing to cut 
some slack for scholastic late bloomers? 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Wilson was banned for life from playing in the NFL, because of his drug 
involvement, but wouldn't a 20-year ban have been sufficient? 
</P>
<P>
Have the Raiders moved yet? When they do, will they tell us? 
</P>
<P>
Has anyone else in history ever beat a legal rap by using bad airline 
fettuccine Alfredo as an alibi, or has Lawrence Taylor broken new ground? Since 
the New Jersey jury bought Taylor's story that he was not intoxicated, but ill, 
when he was arrested for drunk driving, does that mean that Taylor will be 
ordered to attend meetings of AA -- Alfredoholics Anonymous? 
</P>
<P>
Can't a certain downtown luncheon group of professionals and businessmen find 
anything better to do with their noon hour than come up with an NBA all-lefty 
team? 
</P>
<P>
Is it true they elected a frontcourt of Dave Cowens, Willis Reed and Bill 
Russell, with guards Nate (Tiny) Archibald and Gail (Stumpy) Goodrich? Don't 
they realize that the center should be Wilt Chamberlain, since with his right 
hand tied behind his back, Wilt could outplay Bill Russell? 
</P>
<P>
When Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) says he will introduce legislation to 
prevent college football and basketball players from leaving school before 
their class graduates, does it mean the senator has been eating too much 
airline Italian food? 
</P>
<P>
Do you think there's any chance the senator has football or basketball season 
tickets at Louisiana State and shows up at games wearing the school colors? Do 
you think he's ever heard of the Constitution? Who votes these yo-yos into 
office, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Since Terry Catledge of the Washington Bullets was arrested for drunk driving 
and speeding, going 94 m.p.h. in a small town in Tennessee, will somebody 
arrange an auto race between Catledge and Jose Canseco, so we can find out once 
and for all if Canseco is faster than a speeding Bullet?

SUPERSONICS SIGN MCDANIEL FOR FIVE YEARS

The Seattle SuperSonics, who lost unrestricted free agent Tom Chambers to the 
Phoenix Suns last year, announced Wednesday they have re-signed restricted free 
agent Xavier McDaniel to a five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, center Alton Lister of the SuperSonics was a restricted free 
agent and got a multimillion dollar offer from the Suns. Seattle matched the 
Suns' offer sheet. 
</P>
<P>
SuperSonic President Bob Whitsitt said McDaniel's signing was essential to the 
team's future because "he's one of the players we've said we want to build this 
team around. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a commitment to him and to his teammates. We're just going to keep 
going toward our goal and that's to win a championship." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel, a 6-foot-7 forward from Columbia, S.C., and Wichita State, had said 
he knew he would sign again with Seattle. He said he did not think about going 
out and getting an offer sheet. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things go through your mind during the course of a year," he said. 
"But we pretty much had everything agreed on and it was just a matter of time 
until we got everything done. By All-Star break, I knew I would be a Seattle 
SuperSonic. I should (be) set for life." 
</P>
<P>
McDanielaveraged 18.7 points in the playoffs this year and 20.5 points during 
the regular season.

PROS ARE URGED TO ADOPT HARSH DRUG PENALTIES; 
</P>
<P>
BENNETT WANTS NATIONAL RULES THAT WOULD BAN ANY ATHLETE CAUGHT TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Outlining an unyielding approach to narcotics policy, the official in charge of 
the Bush Administration's war on drugs Wednesday urged professional sports to 
adopt uniform regulations that would put an end to the careers of any athletes 
found twice to have used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Bennett, director of the White House office of drug control policy, 
said that such severe penalties would complement a similarly harsh policy for 
teen-agers, whom he said should be expelled from school if caught for the 
second time using or possessing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"If that is the standard for 16-year-olds, shouldn't it at least be the 
standard for professionals?" Bennett asked after a meeting here with 
commissioners and players' officials from professional football, baseball and 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the session said that the sports officials responded without 
enthusiasm to Bennett's suggestion. But in what the White House official called 
a "frank and candid exchange," they agreed to discuss the issue further at a 
meeting later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, more stringent than any now in place in the sporting world, 
represents the latest in a series of Bennett initiatives calling for a national 
refusal to tolerate even casual drug use. Among the penalties Bennett has 
proposed for minor drug offenders are weekend imprisonment in jails or "boot 
camps" and the confiscation of automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
"How do I justify a policy like this for kids when I don't have one like it for 
adults?" Bennett said in an interview later. He said that he had "pressed the 
issue" repeatedly during the session, which marked the first time that 
officials of the three major sports had gathered to discuss the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Professional sports play a very important part in American life, a very 
important part in American imagination," Bennett said. "Since they are so 
important, they ought to be a focal point of our effort." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to rules banning drug use by players, Bennett indicated that he 
might call for mandatory drug testing of professional athletes. He said, 
however, that he had not discussed that idea with the sports officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although the officials said that they favor stiffer penalties for drug use, 
most voiced qualms about the severity of Bennett's approach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always behind harsher penalties but we're also behind the need for 
rehabilitation," said Gene Upshaw, executive director of the National Football 
League Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Said Baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti: "One can quarrel about discipline but 
what we found out today was that (Bennett) and we have very similar views 
without having identical views either philosophically or practically." 
</P>
<P>
Only professional basketball now requires the expulsion of players who use 
drugs and that punishment is enforced only after the third offense. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Grantham, executive director of the National Basketball Assn. Players 
Assn., indicated that his group would be likely to oppose any effort to remove 
the "third strike" from the league's policy. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett has no direct authority to impose rules on professional sports, just as 
he has no authority to order schools to expel drug-using students. But his 
recommendations conceivably could be implemented in Administration-backed 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commissioners and players' representatives praised Bennett's 
approach to the drug problem in sports, most said that their remaining 
differences with him could not easily be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many people around that table agreed with his approach," said 
Upshaw. "But I don't know that that's going to stop him from writing the policy 
that he is going to write."

Ben Johnson's physician has arrived in Canada and is ready to testify before a 
federal inquiry -- possibly next week, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Astaphan and lawyer David Sookram met for several hours with counsel 
representing the federal commission investigating the scandal surrounding 
Johnson's positive drug test at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry is currently in recess and is scheduled to resume next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan has remained at his home on St. Kitts since Johnson failed a drug test 
and was stripped of the 100-meter world record and Olympic gold medal last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony indicates that Astaphan, under investigation by the Ontario College 
of Physicians and Surgeons, holds the key to more than just the mystery of why 
Johnson failed his urine test after his race. 
</P>
<P>
He is also believed to have intimate knowledge of widespread drug use among the 
world's top athletes. He has said he is still treating many of them at his 
clinic on St. Kitts.

UCI UNVEILS 15-YEAR PLAN FOR RESEARCH PARK, HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine officials unveiled a 15-year blueprint for growth Wednesday that 
includes development of a long-awaited research park and an urban community 
with retail and housing development that still would preserve nearly a third of 
the campus' 1,510 acres for woods and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
The research park, which is expected to be a magnet for biomedical firms and 
other high-technology companies that would work cooperatively with the public 
university, is the most innovative and potentially controversial element of the 
plan for the still-growing 25-year-old university. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason has referred to the planned research park as 
the path of the future for research-oriented universities such as UCI. Situated 
in the heart of Orange County's growing high-tech corridor, some have predicted 
the university park could spur development on the scale of Stanford's Silicon 
Valley or the Research Triangle near Duke University in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Orange County technology firms, which have increasingly been 
interested in access to the university, said such a research park would 
increase the stature of UCI and Orange County businesses as centers for 
scientific advancement. 
</P>
<P>
"This can create an immediate knowledge transfer," Gregory Ross, a senior 
partner in the Orange County office of the accounting firm Arthur Young &amp; 
Co, said of the planned research park. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of building in the Irvine Spectrum several miles away, a company can 
now be in walking distance of university researchers, labs and advanced-level 
students," said Ross, who has tracked the progress of Orange County's 
technology industry for 8 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The university can take its theories and patents and translate them into 
viable products," Ross said. He said the university will be able to obtain lab 
space and equipment in exchange for land it cannot use. 
</P>
<P>
The planned construction of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor, 
which is to skirt the southwest perimeter of the campus, will make the proposed 
biomedical research park highly accessible and, it is anticipated, even more 
attractive to prospective firms. The corridor will have an interchange at Bison 
Road, which leads directly to the health sciences complex and proposed research 
park, and is expected to become the primary entrance to the UCI campus. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's Long Range Development Plan, which will be the subject of public hearings 
in Irvine and Newport Beach and will be presented to the UC Board of Regents in 
September, scales back more aggressive growth plans of 1963 and 1970, when it 
was anticipated that students would number nearly 30,000 by 1990, instead of 
the current 14,500. Present projections are for 26,500 graduate and 
undergraduate students at UCI by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
Because Orange County and the surrounding communities of Irvine and Newport 
Beach would have anticipated greater university expansion based on the previous 
plans, no significant community opposition is anticipated, said Ray Catalano, 
assistant executive vice chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
"No plan has no enemies," said Catalano, a former Irvine councilman who 
maintains close ties to city government, "but we believe our neighbors will be 
pleased with this plan." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said he sees great potential for community benefit 
from UCI's projected growth and the planned research park. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume it is going to be an extraordinarily sophisticated level of research, 
and we all understand that there is a synergism created by research at the 
university on the one hand, and its application in the private sector," Agran 
said. "It can be a real benefit to the community, and I'm hopeful that the plan 
meets our concerns with regard to traffic generation and other environmental 
effects." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Speros, an Irvine slow-growth advocate, said he and other residents are 
not opposed to the plan because "it puts most of the traffic on the MacArthur 
Boulevard (southern) side of the campus, away from current residential areas." 
</P>
<P>
Speros, who noted that UCI still will have a lower population than UCLA and 
will be spread out over more acreage, added, "I think most of us realize that 
UCI is an asset to the whole state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Delino, executive assistant to Newport Beach City Manager Robert L. Wynn, 
said he had not seen the campus growth plan and is "not in a position to 
comment on it." Other city officials were not immediately available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
While university officials intend to hold public hearings on the proposed 
long-range development plan, the cities have no veto powers. One hearing is 
planned for the city of Irvine, although no date has been set. A second hearing 
may be conducted in Newport Beach. The development plan will be available for 
public inspection starting Friday at the university library and at libraries in 
Irvine and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The new development plan, in the works since 1985, was completed after pacts 
were reached last summer with the city of Irvine to limit university-generated 
traffic, and with the Irvine Co. to remove a 25-year-old deed restriction that 
would allow construction of 2 million square feet of commercial buildings on 
UCI land. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also includes the first concrete steps toward something university 
and community officials have only dreamed about until now: a full-fledged 
biomedical and high-tech research park. 
</P>
<P>
Two parcels totaling 235 acres have been set aside for private research 
buildings, to be built by research firms and then leased back to the firms. 
Based on the model of UCI's first such venture, the Nelson Research &amp; 
Development Co. center built in 1983, the park would offer lease income, space 
and materials for research by UCI students and professors, and an enhanced 
potential to win multimillion-dollar research grants. 
</P>
<P>
Catalano said Wednesday that high-tech and medical research firms already in 
Orange County will do more to foster Silicon Valley-style growth here than 
UCI's relatively small research parcels. Still, UCI is likely to be a magnet 
for biomedical research firms that want to tap into university brainpower, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
UCI has tried for several years to increase its role in the high-tech 
community. Earlier this year, in its most ambitious attempt to attract private 
business interests, university officials met with executives from local 
biomedical firms and presented more than a dozen technologies being developed 
by UCI researchers that could benefit from corporate involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Some executives have said the absence of a research park has kept the 
university from being as involved as it would like. 
</P>
<P>
Robert P. Kelley Jr., president of the Southern California Technology 
Executives Network, said that UC San Diego has taken the lead in the UC system 
in its involvement with the business community, but UCI has the potential to 
catch up. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Diego, businesses think of UC San Diego as an immediate resource. In 
Orange County, that has been emerging lately," Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
And with the availability of land on and near campus for such expansion, Kelley 
said, UCI has the potential to take the lead among universities in the UC 
system in its involvement with technology firms. 
</P>
<P>
But some caution that there are drawbacks to corporate involvement with a 
university, which operates more slowly than a rapidly developing firm. And 
Kelley said some in the university might oppose the partnership approach, out 
of fear that corporate development could compromise academic independence. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to find a lot of cheering and shouts of joy in some parts of 
the campus," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the long-range plan calls for more faculty and student housing on 
campus, as well as a so-called "Main Street" complex of retail shops and 
offices along Pereira Drive. 
</P>
<P>
With UC Irvine's population projected to nearly double by 2005, traffic 
generated by the university is a concern of county and local officials alike. 
</P>
<P>
"We know there are some pretty ambitious expansion plans that UCI has," said 
Ernie Schneider, director of the county's Environmental Management Agency. "Our 
concern would be how that would impact the region's circulation system. Traffic 
is terrible there (around the university) and UCI is a very big draw." 
</P>
<P>
UCI officials have already signed a memorandum of understanding with the city 
of Irvine that future growth would not generate more than 146,000 average daily 
trips, up from the current 40,000 average daily trips to and from the 
university. And while that is far below earlier growth estimates of 240,000 
average daily trips generated by the university, it is enough to have a 
significant impact on traffic in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"In and of itself, that is enough to handle three lanes (of traffic) on a 
freeway," Schneider said of the 146,000 figure. 
</P>
<P>
Times Staff writers Jeffrey A. Perlman and John Charles Tighe also contributed 
to this story.

<P>
UCI POPULATION 
</P>
<P>
The newest UCI long-range development plan calls for more modest growth than 
the 1970 plan (27,500 students by 1990). However, UCI anticipates more than a 
fivefold increase in staff for its Health Sciences Complex by 2005.

NORTHROP PLANT IN ANAHEIM MAY BE SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop Corp. plans to cut its work force by 2,500 to 3,000 people by the end 
of the year and is likely to sell its Anaheim operation, which employs about 
1,800 people, the chairman of the aerospace firm said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"When any of our properties is not useful, we will sell it. Certainly, Anaheim 
is one of those," Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones told shareholders at the 
company's annual meeting in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Northrop spokesmen tried to temper Jones' comments by 
stating that no final decision had been made about the the Orange County 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
But company spokesman Tony Cantafio confirmed the existence of an internal 
report detailing a plan of liquidation for the Anaheim operation, including 
layoff and transfer figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Looking at Alternatives' 
</P>
<P>
"We have a transition plan and a consolidation plan," Cantafio said. "We're 
looking at all of the alternatives." He declined to discuss contents of the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The company would not comment on the extent of job losses that would accompany 
a sale of the Anaheim property, but it confirmed that any such layoffs would be 
included in the 2,500 to 3,000 planned job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop's work force reduction reflects an effort to trim overhead expenses 
throughout the company and to reduce jobs in the massive B-2 stealth bomber 
program. 
</P>
<P>
At least some of the Northrop workers will be laid off, though the company 
hopes it can cut a majority of the jobs by normal attrition, Jones said. A 
majority of the job cuts will occur in Southern California, where about 77% of 
Northrop's 44,000 workers are based. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts speculated that as many as several hundred people could be laid off at 
the Anaheim facility. But the bulk of the layoffs are expected to come in the 
company's B-2 bomber program, which is concentrated in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
John Simon, an aerospace analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities, said the layoffs 
are more "bad news" for the troubled firm. "Why do you lay off people unless 
you have too many people?" he asked. "Things are going mostly wrong at 
Northrop." 
</P>
<P>
The company is facing a difficult time in many of its major military programs, 
ranging from technical problems that have forced delays to funding cutbacks 
that have slowed down production lines. Northrop expects its 1989 sales to 
remain little changed from last year's $5.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop has already cut back 2,300 jobs on the B-2 bomber at its Pico Rivera 
and Palmdale plants in the past 2 years, resulting from completion of 
development activities and a failure to obtain funding increases for 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop declined to specify where the new job cuts would occur by plant 
location, but Cantafio said after the meeting that "a large number" of the job 
cutbacks would occur on the B-2 program. 
</P>
<P>
Those layoffs were expected as development activities are completed, but recent 
federal budget cuts have robbed the program of funding increases that would 
have resulted in significant job growth. In addition, some of the B-2 layoffs 
will be tied to a cost reduction effort that Jones said is aiming to trim $3 
billion from the cost of the B-2 program. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Northrop announced it was trimming its operations in Anaheim by 
transferring 400 engineers and their support staff to a sister facility in 
Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Employees in Anaheim design and manufacture infrared and optical sensors used 
by pilots and anti-aircraft missile crews to shoot down their targets. They 
also manufacture equipment to test missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The company's Hawthorne operation, which employs 2,600 people, is best known 
for producing part of the U.S. Air Force's MX missile guidance system. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim and Hawthorne operations make up Northrop's electronic systems 
division, which has suffered in recent years from production delays and 
declining revenue as several key programs have neared completion. From 1986 to 
1988, the division's revenue fell 13% to $1.1 billion, while its operating 
profit plunged 61% to $39 million. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, analysts said the missile test equipment group in Anaheim and 
the MX missile project in Hawthorne have experienced significant revenue 
declines. Furthermore, production in Anaheim of a sensor product called a 
television camera set may stall because its primary application is the F-14 
Tomcat fleet-defense fighter, which may soon be phased out of production. 
</P>
<P>
"If you combine the declining revenues for test equipment and the (MX missile) 
unit, the consolidation of the facilities in Hawthorne and Anaheim makes a lot 
of sense," said Lawrence M. Harris, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards Inc. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate brokers said Northrop's Anaheim facility, consisting of five 
buildings on 53 acres, is an attractive property. "They could get at least $27 
million for the land alone," said Bob Niles, a sales agent with Daum Commercial 
Industrial Real Estate in La Mirada. He said the buildings could bring $50 
million to $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
Niles said likely buyers would include other defense contractors and large 
computer companies. "There are lots of possibilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-year-old industrial electrician at the Anaheim facility said workers there 
have heard that Northrop might sell the plant. "Everybody realizes the land is 
more profitable than what the company is doing with it right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Facility Bigger 
</P>
<P>
The employee, who requested anonymity, said he expects to be transferred to 
Hawthorne, but he has started to look for another job because he doesn't want 
to leave Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop's Hawthorne facility, situated on 218 acres, is considerably bigger 
than its Anaheim complex. "It probably wouldn't be difficult at all for the 
Hawthorne facility to absorb the staff and work done in Anaheim," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
The Northrop job terminations are another signal that federal defense spending 
reductions and a drive to improve efficiency by contractors is inflicting a 
heavy economic toll, especially in the concentrated Southern California 
aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every major prime contractor is laying off workers from at least some 
of their divisions in the Los Angeles area, including General Dynamics, Hughes 
Aircraft, Litton Industries, Lockheed and TRW, among others. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's shareholder meeting, Jones did not specifically mention 
Northrop's recent indictment on federal criminal charges, stemming from alleged 
falsification of testing on guidance parts for cruise missiles. He did say, "We 
intend to defend the company and our employees against unwarranted and 
frequently exaggerated charges." 
</P>
<P>
Jones delivered a 25-page speech, his final address to shareholders before he 
steps down after 30 years as chief executive at the end of this year.

SANTA ANA SUBSIDY CALLED CRUCIAL TO ARENA'S SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of a Philadelphia-based company hired to form a partnership to 
build a 20,000-seat sports arena in Santa Ana said Wednesday that the facility 
could probably not be built without the city's participation. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to squeeze the trigger, the city of Santa Ana would have to grant a 
public subsidy," said Antonio G. Tavares, president of the Spectacor Management 
Group, which oversees about 20 arenas, stadiums and halls around the country. 
"The city of Santa Ana is aware of that." 
</P>
<P>
Tavares' comments clashed, at least in tone, with those made Tuesday by Santa 
Ana officials, who -- while not ruling out the possibility of city involvement 
in the arena -- stressed the private nature of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a private-sector initiative," Mayor Daniel H. Young said Tuesday 
night. "We'll be happy to cooperate with them." 
</P>
<P>
Young said the extent of possible city involvement in the project is 
"absolutely unknown at this point" but added that the situation is far 
different from that of 4 years ago, when Santa Ana offered to help pay for a 
stadium on city-owned land with a $40-million industrial development bond. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not initiating this," Young said, referring to city officials. Santa Fe 
Pacific Realty Corp., which owns the potential arena site, "is putting it 
together," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Resident opposition defeated earlier proposals to build arenas in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Tavares on Wednesday also revealed the name of the developer that Spectacor 
hopes to bring into the arena's venture-capital group: King/Guanci Development 
Co., which has offices in Newport Beach and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The partners of that company are former Massachusetts Gov. Ed King, who spends 
most of his time in Boston, and Tony Guanci, a former rock band manager who 
runs the company's Newport office. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Gov. King from my days running the Worcester Centrum" facility in 
Massachusetts, Tavares said. 
</P>
<P>
Guanci was once manager of the rock band Boston, so his contacts in 
entertainment would be valuable to an arena management group, Tavares said. 
</P>
<P>
The development company is building a 425,000-square-foot distribution center 
for Montgomery-Ward in Chino, city officials there confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Dealings With Firm 
</P>
<P>
King/Guanci has also had business dealings with Santa Fe Pacific, which owns 
the 17-acre parcel at Edinger Avenue and Lyon Street proposed for the arena. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done several real estate deals with them," said Bruce Ibbetson, Santa Fe 
Pacific's manager for the arena project. "Their contacts range nationally. . . 
. One of them is an association with Spectacor." 
</P>
<P>
Ibbetson said he does not know where talks stand between Spectacor and 
King/Guanci. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what their involvement is," Ibbetson said, adding that Spectacor, 
and not Santa Fe Pacific, is putting together the arena partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Neither King nor Guanci, who were said to be meeting in Brea with Santa Fe 
Pacific officials, could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Ibbetson disagreed with Tavares' assessment that the arena would require a 
public subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's presumptuous to say the city has to be involved," he said. "There are a 
number of other scenarios." 
</P>
<P>
Tavares, however, said that, with no guarantee that a professional sports 
franchise would move in, Santa Ana, "just like any city in America," would have 
to commit some amount of public money to the project. 
</P>
<P>
And while Orange County's upscale demographics make it a prime market for a 
professional sports team, the likelihood of one agreeing to come to Santa Ana 
before an arena is built is small, Tavares said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very speculative," he said. "I'm not going to be like everyone else and 
say that I've had discussions with teams. . . . Everyone is willing to talk to 
you. We're no closer to having it built than Anaheim is." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana City Manager David N. Ream said Wednesday that the city would be 
happy to look at any proposal arena developers put forth but that as yet city 
officials have not been asked to subsidize the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We view it as a private development," Ream said. "We think the need for a 
public subsidy should certainly be far less than if they were looking to 
acquire a new site. We'll entertain any thoughts that they have for advancing 
the project. . . . But until we have a specific proposal, it's difficult to 
react to." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Urged to Consider Role 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Councilmen John Acosta and Miguel A. Pulido agreed with Ream that the 
city should at least consider an arena proposal that includes public 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the city would be involved," Pulido said. "The million-dollar question 
is, how much? That's part of what we have to look into." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana officials were quick to point out, however, that the arena land is 
already privately owned, so the city would not have to buy the parcel for the 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for a similar arena in Anaheim call for such a land deal. Anaheim 
officials hope that the County Board of Supervisors will agree to sell a 
7.6-acre site along the Santa Ana River for about $8 million, but the land is 
still listed as a possible county jail site. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote June 6 on Anaheim's offer to buy 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
Tavares said he hopes to have the elements for a Santa Ana arena in place 
within 2 months. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had discussions with the city and everyone else," he said. "We need to 
come to a firm deal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Concerned 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, officials with McDonnell Douglas Corp., which operates its 
computer division on 53 acres next to the proposed Santa Ana arena tract, 
expressed its reservations about the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely concerned," said Bob Young, president of McDonnell Douglas 
Realty, which owns the parcel. "The first I found out about it was reading in 
the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Young said his company is not necessarily opposed to the arena, but he wants to 
make sure it would not interfere with the computer center's operations, which 
sometimes run 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, McDonnell Douglas was itself considering building an arena on the 
site, Young said, but found that the only way to make it profitable was if the 
city shared in the investment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to see Santa Ana do it, as a municipality," he said. "If Anaheim or 
Santa Ana provides a public subsidy, that's smart as hell. They're going to 
recover that several times over."

KEEPING THE TRASH AT BAY; 
</P>
<P>
WATER-CLEANING VESSEL IS UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture a crew of workers cleaning the streets of an entire city -- with push 
brooms. That, Bill Hamilton said, is practically how Newport Beach has been 
cleaning its popular bay, the largest pleasure-boat harbor on the West Coast. 
In and along the 32 miles of waterway, one guy in a dinghy fishes out 600 cubic 
yards of trash each year with a pool skimmer. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of looking out his waterfront Cannery Restaurant with such 
flotsam as beer cans and cigarette butts drifting by the dining tables, 
Hamilton got to thinking about this strange dichotomy: wealthy, resort town 
with several yacht clubs and a 9,000-slip harbor. And one guy with a pool net? 
It made no sense. 
</P>
<P>
An engineer by trade and an inventor at heart, Hamilton finally took pencil to 
paper last fall and sketched out a prototype for the Water Rake, a 19-foot-long 
catamaran that is as simple as it is promising. 
</P>
<P>
At a breakfast gathering Wednesday at the Balboa Bay Club, the restaurateur 
unveiled the white, pontooned garbage sweeper at a dockside demonstration to 
hosannas from about 75 boaters, the mayor and harbor officials. On June 3, the 
city's annual Clean Harbor Day, an event dreamed up years ago by Hamilton at 
which hundreds of volunteers collect garbage from the bay, Hamilton will loan 
the Water Rake to Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping, like Bill is hoping, that it will be a real efficient way to 
clean the bay," said Tony Mellum, Newport Beach's tideland administrator. 
"Right now we have a fellow in a skiff with a pool scoop, and if (the Water 
Rake) is effective, it will change the way we clean harbors." 
</P>
<P>
It is rather mundane looking, this 1,600-pound SS Trash, driven by two outboard 
engines for better maneuvering in tight spots, hauling a large bin aft for the 
rubbish. Floating garbage is "raked" from a foot beneath the surface by a 
multi-strand conveyor belt at the front of the boat. The conveyor belt, which 
has plastic-coated metal strands, then carries the junk to the hoppers at the 
back end. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton designed it, and partner Art Gronsky built it in his cavernous old 
boatyard next door to the Cannery. 
</P>
<P>
The two key engineering tricks that make the Water Rake "a breakthrough," 
Hamilton said, are the conveyor belt -- so smooth it picks up everything from a 
cigarette butt to a 10-foot-long timber -- and the power behind it: a quiet 
Johnson motor whose propeller has been replaced by a safer, cleaner and more 
controllable hydraulic device. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to design something that was quiet, simple and yet rugged and 
effective," Hamilton said, "and I think the essence of engineering is 
simplicity. You don't want to put a lot of gadgets on there and make it 
complicated." 
</P>
<P>
A married father and grandfather who made his fortune manufacturing metal 
industrial equipment at plants in Chicago, Los Angeles and Orange County, 
Hamilton made one false start in his quest to design a bay sweeper a few months 
back. He spent 2 months converting his own catamaran in a "quick and dirty" job 
that cost him $2,000 but taught him important lessons. He had the right idea, 
but the sweeper had to be quieter so boaters didn't gripe about all the noise. 
</P>
<P>
In return for giving the $20,000 Water Rake to Newport Beach, Hamilton receives 
free testing rights to work out whatever bugs may exist for the next year. The 
city worker who now rides around in the dinghy will get to motor around in the 
Rake. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to lose his job, he's just going to do it 10 times more 
efficiently," Hamilton said of the harbor cleaners from the marine department 
who take turns at the task. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said Newport Beach is "really back in the dark ages for harbor 
cleanup. But it's not just here. It's true of most harbors." 
</P>
<P>
That is why the 64-year-old Hamilton, who allegedly retired when he bought the 
Cannery and Malarky's Irish Pub several years ago, is excited about the 
prospect of marketing the water sweepers. The price would be around $35,000 
each, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Greater Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce, which 
sponsored the Wednesday morning breakfast, said the Water Rake's white, blank 
sides could be sold as advertising space to pay the cost of the boat's 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Marina del Rey is said to be interested in the Water Rake, and the 
partners have a patent pending on the harbor sweeper. Hamilton and Gronsky also 
are working to convert the rake into a device that also would clean up 
small-scale oil spills, opening another market for the invention. 
</P>
<P>
"I can pick up an injured bird with this thing from an oil spill without a 
scratch," said Hamilton, beaming with pride at the thought. "I think I could 
pick up a body with it, though I don't know that I should try."

STEPSON OF LAGUNA CHIEF HELD ON DRUG SALES CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stepson of Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil J. Purcell has been arrested on 
charges of selling marijuana to a city undercover officer and later trying to 
flee from arresting officers, police officials confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cary Holt, 26, remained in custody Wednesday in Orange County Jail, with bail 
set at $11,790. 
</P>
<P>
An undercover Laguna Beach police officer investigating reports of narcotics 
trafficking around the city's Main Beach area bought "4 to 5" grams of 
marijuana from Holt, Sgt. Ray Lardie said. About a week later, on May 5, when 
police were ready to begin making arrests, the undercover officer and a 
uniformed officer saw Holt at Main Beach and tried to arrest him, Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
Holt ran, and the officers chased him for about 4 blocks, Lardie said. They 
found him hiding in a store in downtown Laguna Beach, Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
Holt was uncooperative during his booking at Laguna Beach police headquarters 
and refused to say where he lived, Lardie said. Police said Holt lives in 
Laguna but not with his mother and stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
The arresting officers did not know that Holt was the police chief's stepson 
until the watch commander on duty that day recognized the name and notified 
Deputy Police Chief Jim Spreine. Spreine said he then contacted Purcell, who 
told him to not show his stepson any special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Purcell) never once lost sight of his responsibility to this department 
and at no time were we told to show his son favoritism," Spreine said. 
</P>
<P>
Spreine said the chief was upset by the arrest, however. 
</P>
<P>
"The police chief, more than anything, is embarrassed," Spreine said. 
</P>
<P>
Holt is charged with sale of marijuana and resisting arrest. He also had two 
outstanding warrants, one for burglary and the other for driving with a 
suspended license, Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
Purcell's instructions that his stepson receive no special treatment was 
admired by his staff, Spreine said. 
</P>
<P>
"The chief is very adamant that no one gets special treatment in Laguna," 
Spreine said. The chief probably has "the highest integrity" of anyone "I've 
ever worked with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Purcell, 49, has been with the Laguna Beach Police Department for 20 years, 8 
of those as chief. He earned national recognition as a rookie officer in 1968 
when he arrested LSD guru Timothy Leary for possession of marijuana, LSD and 
hashish. Leary was convicted in 1970 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He 
ultimately served 44 months.

AUDIT QUESTIONS LAGUNA BUS LINE'S VALUE; 
</P>
<P>
CITY OFFICIALS VOW TO FIGHT ANY ATTEMPT TO ELIMINATE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An independent audit has questioned the worth of Laguna Beach's bus service, 
but city officials on Wednesday vowed to battle any attempt to eliminate the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Dan Kenney said: "I can unequivocally say the city would fight 
any move to do away with our transit system. We're not going to roll over and 
play dead on this." 
</P>
<P>
The audit of Laguna Beach's bus service was made for the Orange County 
Transportation Commission, which controls state and federal funds going to 
local transportation systems. About two-thirds of the budget for the Laguna 
Beach Municipal Transit Lines comes through the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Laguna Beach is providing a very costly service for the benefit of a few 
riders," the audit says. "The OCTC and the Laguna Beach City Council should 
consider whether it is appropriate to continue the service." 
</P>
<P>
Operating costs have increased about 10% during the past 3 years, according to 
the audit, while the number of passengers has decreased about 5% and fare 
revenue has declined by about 4%. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of costs paid by fares decreased from 19.8% to 17.17%, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank on Wednesday said the coastal 
community is not about to give up its transit system, the only city-owned bus 
service in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in business before the (Transportation) Commission was created, and 
we'll be in business long after the . . . commission has gone," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Christner, an analyst with the commission, said that Laguna Beach has 
60 days to file its response to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners will formally receive the audit at a meeting on Monday, but 
Christner said they won't vote on any of its recommendations for at least 2 
months. 
</P>
<P>
However, the commission is scheduled to act on proposed 5-year spending plans 
for local transit operations, including Laguna's. Christner said the 
commissioners may discuss some of the audit's findings as they go over Laguna's 
proposed spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
The audit, carried out by the Arthur Young &amp; Co. office in Costa Mesa, 
questioned the low amount of money the Laguna Beach system gets from passenger 
fares. The "Mainline service," which accounts for about 70% of the routes, only 
brings in abut 27% of the system's revenue, the audit says. 
</P>
<P>
In criticizing the revenue, the audit noted: "While operating costs have 
continued to increase, adult fares have not been raised in several years and 
seniors and handicapped passengers ride free." 
</P>
<P>
Kenney, a former mayor of Laguna Beach, said Wednesday that the audit fails to 
focus on the value of Laguna Beach's buses to its residents. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing about the audit is what it does not say: the impact 
on local residents if we did not have our transit system," Kenney said. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach's 19-year-old municipal transit system is particularly geared to 
the city's unusual topography, including hills and coastal inlets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic, already a severe problem in the community, would worsen without the 
buses, Kenney said.

FIRE OFFICIALS MOVE TO DOUSE FLIMFLAM PHONE SOLICITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim Fire Department officials are burning up over a rash of phony telephone 
solicitors trying to pass themselves off as members of a group calling itself 
the Anaheim Fire Department Burn Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials have received about seven complaints in the last week from angry 
residents who say they have been harassed by callers trying to solicit 
donations for the apparently fictitious group. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever these people are, they definitely do not have any affiliation with the 
Fire Department," Anaheim Fire Chief Jeff Bowman said. "They don't leave names, 
they don't leave phone numbers, they just pick up the check in person and don't 
even give receipts." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said residents told him that when they either refused to give donations 
or gave only small amounts, the solicitors became verbally abusive and often 
cursed at them. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said these phony calls have happened before, but officials have never 
been able to catch those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of people getting ripped off, and I'm tired of these people using 
our name for it," he said. "The Anaheim Fire Department and the Anaheim Fire 
Assn. do not participate in this type of operation." 
</P>
<P>
Residents receiving these phone calls should report them to Detective Dewayne 
Briggs of the Anaheim police fraud detail, (714) 999-1957.

CYCLE THEFT SUSPECT CAUGHT AFTER CHASE THROUGH FULLERTON, ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Anaheim man suspected of stealing a motorcycle was arrested Wednesday after 
leading Fullerton and Anaheim police on a rush-hour chase through the two 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Duncan, 27, was pursued by officers in cars, motorcycles and a 
helicopter, Fullerton Police Lt. Jeff Roop said. At one point Duncan collided 
with a motorcycle officer, who was not injured, Roop said. 
</P>
<P>
Roop said the chase began shortly before 5 p.m. when a Fullerton police officer 
attempted to stop the motorcyclist near Valencia Drive and State College 
Boulevard for a traffic violation. When the suspect tried to get away, the 
officer radioed for assistance and learned that the motorcycle had been 
reported stolen from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The cyclist sped to the Orange Freeway and headed south. The Anaheim Police 
Department's helicopter, Angel, assisted during the 15-minute pursuit, Roop 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was captured in Anaheim as he left the freeway at Katella Avenue. 
"A couple of units were waiting there and blocked the off-ramp," Roop said. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan was arrested on suspicion of vehicle theft, possession of stolen 
property, evading arrest, reckless driving and hit and run, Roop said.

PRIME COMPUTER DOWN $2 AMID FRESH SPECULATION 
</P>

<P>
Prime Computer's stock slipped $2 a share in active trading Wednesday amid 
speculation that MAI Basic Four of Tustin may have backed off its attempt to 
take over the computer company. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street traders told the Dow Jones News Service that some traders 
considered MAI's statement equivocal when it said earlier this week that it was 
"evaluating all aspects" of the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
MAI said Wednesday that it was still pursuing a takeover and would not 
speculate on why Prime stock is dropping. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Prime could not be reached Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prime stock fell to $15.75 a share on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday as 
1.6 million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
The latest flap in this long-running takeover battle started on Monday, when a 
federal judge in Massachusetts lifted an injunction that had blocked MAI's 
offer of $20 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The same day, Prime dared MAI to buy it, saying it doubted MAI could raise the 
$1.3 billion needed. Prime, a Natick, Mass., maker of minicomputers, said it 
would drop its "poison pill" defense if MAI could raise that amount. 
</P>
<P>
MAI then said it was "evaluating all aspects" of its offer in light of Prime's 
statement that it was projecting lower sales and operating income for this year 
and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Prime stock, which had been trading through much of the takeover battle at 
prices just below $20, started skidding this week when traders interpreted 
MAI's response to Prime's dare as lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
The traders told Dow Jones there was speculation that MAI, which makes 
computers too, might withdraw its offer or lower the price.

KIDS OUT OF CONTROL; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN TEEN-AGERS RUN WILD, QUESTIONS ARISE ON PARENTAL, SOCIETAL ROLES IN FAMILY 
LIFE

Jane Martin watched a handful of the 600 kids under her control trooping past 
the brick walls and high fences at the San Fernando Valley Juvenile Hall in 
Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
As supervisor of that small link in the labyrinthine system of cops, courts, 
camps, schools, foster homes and treatment programs that contend each day with 
the thousands of kids who have run into trouble, she has paid particular 
attention to the news of late. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong that so many of the kids society produced now have come back to 
haunt us? Where along the line did we lose control? 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at our culture," she said. "How did our priorities change?" 
</P>
<P>
Figure that out, she said, and you might begin to figure out the youthful 
violence that has suddenly captured the country's attention. 
</P>
<P>
In New York's Central Park this month, a dozen or so 14-, 15- and 16 year-olds, 
went "wilding," attacking strollers at random and brutally beating and raping a 
jogger. When the police asked why, one teen-ager allegedly said, "For fun." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prophecy in Film 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend in Los Angeles' Griffith Park, two boys, 15 and 11, allegedly shot 
a 79-year-old man with with BB guns. They reportedly told the police they did 
it as a joke. That same weekend, gang kids shot up half a dozen other Angelenos 
with real bullets, adding two more people to the 2,700 murders they've 
committed this decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I've thought about 'Clockwork Orange' more than a couple of times lately," 
said Michelle Lewis, juvenile placement director for the Los Angeles County 
Probation Department, referring to the futuristic film in which amoral youths 
roam the streets inflicting pain for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the Central Park attack, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said that New 
Yorkers are now confronted with "the terrible possibility that we have, by our 
failures, produced young people who have learned to disdain simple principles 
of right conduct, principles so basic to our good order, that we never 
contemplated their being rejected." 
</P>
<P>
Ask around in the hodgepodge of groups trying to get a grip on what's happening 
with young people in this country. They say America is like a big dysfunctional 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Most concede that a percentage of young thugs ought to be locked away where 
they can't do more harm. But they also say that society can no longer afford to 
sneer at the cliche -- that young creeps may owe their criminal behavior to "a 
troubled childhood." 
</P>
<P>
Lisbeth B. Schorr, whose 1988 book, "Within Our Reach," has become required 
reading by many policy makers, sees the chasm quickly narrowing between 
conservatives who blame juvenile delinquency on a parent's failure to teach 
values, and liberals who see the problem stemming from ingrained social 
injustice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change the Values 
</P>
<P>
Most experts now agree that values must be changed through education, health 
care and other social programs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The fusion of viewpoints comes in part "because everyone is really scared," she 
said. It is also fueled by business leaders' realization that unless something 
changes, they may soon be faced with a major shortage of educated, trustworthy 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Criminal Statistics reports that felony arrests of 
juveniles in California have tended to drop since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
But most people who work with problem kids say there are more relevant 
statistics. According to the child advocacy group Children Now, more kids than 
ever are growing up in poverty in California -- 1 in 5; 1 out of 3 kids never 
gets a high-school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
"In California, we have hit all-time highs and lead the nation per capita for 
kids in foster care and kids in juvenile custody," said Richard Barth, an 
associate professor in the UC Berkeley School of Social Welfare and a 
contributor to the "Conditions of Children in California" report issued this 
year by an organization called Policy Analysis for California Education. 
</P>
<P>
"How are we doing?" asked Lewis of the probation department. "We're sticking 
our finger in the dike." 
</P>
<P>
Lyn Kobosa-Munro, a social worker at Hathaway Children's Services, a privately 
run social services agency, agreed. "The world's complicated. Pressures on 
parents are increasing." 
</P>
<P>
And while those pressures are building most dangerously in homes where a single 
parent struggles to put meals on the table, the yuppie mom and dad hard pressed 
to make the BMW payments are not exempt. 
</P>
<P>
Parenting takes more energy than most tasks, but when parents come home drained 
from a day of coping with modern life, there's not much energy left for child 
rearing, Kobosa-Munro said. 
</P>
<P>
And parents who are overwhelmed lack the energy to respond with what 
Kobosa-Munro calls an appropriate "you did WHAT?" response. Instead, they 
respond by "shrugging their shoulders," until, suddenly, they decide that their 
child is out of control. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid isn't out of control," she said. "It's just that (the parents) are not 
doing the controlling." 
</P>
<P>
Often, parents whose kids are out of control were out of control themselves 
when they were young, Kobosa-Munro said. They figure they outgrew their 
problems and their kids will, too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adventures of the Beav 
</P>
<P>
But being out of control has changed radically since the days when Wally and 
the Beav were getting in and out of jams. 
</P>
<P>
In most parts of the country, society no longer nurtures its kids on the road 
to adulthood. Kids are no longer escorted from the classroom by a caring 
teacher, kept under surveillance by concerned neighbors, paternally cuffed by a 
friendly minister or rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
"The informal safety net -- strong neighborhood, strong church, strong schools 
-- has been slashed," Barth said. At the same time, new pressures are pushing 
kids away from traditional values and out of parental control. 
</P>
<P>
"Here in the Bay Area, kids around the sixth-grade are being recruited to be 
spotters for 10th-graders who are dealing drugs," Barth said. "No one told me I 
could make money as a spotter when I was in sixth-grade." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, families that could have withstood a few adolescent crises in the 
past, "suddenly aren't functioning so well," Barth said. "They have a much 
greater challenge than they did before." 
</P>
<P>
And once a kid's fortunes start to slip, many people simply can't afford to 
spend the time it takes to straighten out the mess. For many, taking the time 
off work to shepherd a kid through his troubles, to seek counseling and to 
confer with his teachers can be a gamble that risks the employment that keeps 
the kid fed. 
</P>
<P>
"And the schools probably wouldn't have social workers or staff that could 
develop or implement a plan anyway," Barth said. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious problem, said Judy Nelson, executive director of the Children's 
Bureau of Los Angeles, is that "there are no funds in this country. We just pay 
after the fact." 
</P>
<P>
Heather B. Weiss, who runs the Family Research Project at Harvard, agreed. 
"Trying to get funding for prevention when the world is falling apart around 
you is very tricky," she said. "There is a lot of vested interest in the way 
things are." 
</P>
<P>
While crucial, the complex public bureaucracies and private institutions that 
incarcerate and try to treat problem kids tend not to see beyond "crisis 
intervention and crisis treatment," she said. "But at some point you have to 
stand back and say, 'The systems we're working with now aren't working. That's 
what I think people are now agreeing . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Society has come up with some solutions. More and more experts concur that if 
society intervenes in the early years of a child's life and helps the parents 
develop child-rearing skills, the chances of what Lisbeth Schorr calls "rotten 
outcomes," decreases dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, the release in 1987 of the Washington D.C.-based Committee on 
Economic Development report "Children In Need; Investment Strategies for the 
Educationally Disadvantaged," gave a range of policy makers a good shake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Society Must Intervene 
</P>
<P>
The report, sponsored by a number of Fortune 500 companies, concluded that 
society "has to intervene at various stages along the developmental spectrum, 
from prenatal care all the way to adolescence," said Sandra Hamburg), a 
spokeswoman for the council. "We've taught people to be disaffected from the 
society in which we all have a stake," she said, adding that now it's time "not 
only to teach people how to work, but how to understand society and govern it." 
</P>
<P>
The program will cost a lot. But, putting it in terms the sponsoring companies 
would understand, the study, Hamburg said, "identified some particularly 
effective investments for these kids, the kinds that really yield good results 
in financial terms and human terms." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining those investments is a major goal of Children Now, said Wendy 
Lazarus, vice president for policy at that Los Angeles based child-advocacy 
group. 
</P>
<P>
It costs a total of $3,000 to provide in-home support services for a family, 
she said. "That's about what it costs per month for a child removed from a 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Forsythe was a prosecutor before becoming director of the Edna Clarke 
McConnell Foundation in New York, one of the growing number of private 
foundations sinking money into solving the problem of delinquent kids. He goes 
out of his way to say he is no mollycoddler. 
</P>
<P>
But he also knows that most of the murderers passing through the juvenile 
justice system didn't go bad the day they hit junior high. "Parenting is a 
learned skill," he said. "Control starts early. If you lose it early, there's 
no reasserting it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Break Up the Home 
</P>
<P>
Research shows society has more luck helping bad families become functional 
than it does with helping rotten kids become good ones. 
</P>
<P>
"The knee-jerk reaction (when a child gets out of control) is to break up the 
home," Forsythe said. "Got a problem kid? Send him somewhere. But that usually 
makes the kid worse. At a minimum, you destroy the laboratory in which the 
child and parents can learn to solve the problem. They can't learn to deal with 
the rebellious teen-ager if the son or daughter isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
Forsythe's foundation, like others nationwide, is now spending money on "family 
preservation" programs with names such as Homebuilders, in which therapists are 
sent into "high-risk" homes, where they devote as much as 20 hours a week to 
family therapy and educating parents and kids on everything from getting the 
water turned back on to dealing with anger. 
</P>
<P>
Three counties in Northern California now are engaged in a similar, two-year 
pilot program that diverts money from traditional programs to 
family-preservation projects, which try to keep kids with their families 
through 24-hour in-home crisis intervention, family therapy and parent 
training. 
</P>
<P>
None of which will do much good, experts say, unless society begins to support 
the sort of behavior that parental education teaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We teach children through all of the messages we send," said Hamburg, of the 
Committee for Economic Development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cultural Loss 
</P>
<P>
Judging from what business leaders reported seeing in the emerging work force, 
many kids have somehow learned that in this culture "we don't value teamwork, 
don't value compassion," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Society also doesn't instill self-worth and pride in doing a job well, Hamburg 
said: "You can't send teachers to the blackboard to teach values. They come 
from the way we behave." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, at Juvenile Hall, observed: "Adolescence is an incredibly difficult 
time." And when a kid runs into the normal physical and emotional stresses of 
adolescence unprotected by a shield of values, his reaction may prove 
particularly ugly. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Martin finds herself confronted with more and more teen-agers who never had 
structure in their lives, who were never told that some things are right and 
some things are wrong and who never were told "something as corny as the 
principle, 'Do unto others,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Outside her office, some of those kids, their faces scrubbed, their 
institutional clothing neatly pressed, lined up and walked in loose formation 
through the landscaped courtyard. For some of them, it may be the first and 
last time they are under control.

EMPHASIS IS ON 'ABLE' AT L.A. EXPO FOR THE DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
If you're disabled and have been searching for a particular product or service 
-- or if you're looking for something for a relative or friend -- the best 
place to look in Los Angeles this weekend is undoubtedly Abilities Expo '89 at 
the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 exhibitors will demonstrate such high-tech items as a computer 
that helps a speechless person talk by responding to eye contact, a 
state-of-the-art wheelchair that can climb stairs or a device that can turn a 
regular wheelchair into a hand-operated cycle for exercise or racing or 
touring. 
</P>
<P>
Now the largest such show in the United States, the exposition was started five 
years ago by Dick Wooten of RCW Productions in Encinitas. Wooten, who 
contracted polio as a child and has been in a wheelchair for 37 years, said he 
started the show in Los Angeles because there was no centralized place where 
one could go to see the latest products for the disabled. He calls the event 
one that "emphasizes abilities, not disabilities," hence the positive name for 
his annual project. 
</P>
<P>
This year's exposition, to be held Friday, Saturday and Sunday, will include 
thousands of specialized products for people with motion, hearing, speech or 
vision impairments, plus art exhibits, sports demonstrations and workshops for 
the disabled, for senior citizens and for health care and rehabilitation 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
In the sports category, Mike Dempsey, three-time Paralympic Gold Medalist in 
Wheelchair Table Tennis, will give daily table tennis demonstrations, and 
wheelchair tennis champion Mary Jones will be at the show. 
</P>
<P>
(Admission to Abilities Expo '89 is $3 for adults; free for children under 12. 
Hours are 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday and Saturday; 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.) 
</P>
<P>
Since introducing Expo, Wooten said he has received hundreds of requests from 
all over the country to duplicate the show. So for the first time, he and his 
wife, Pat, will take the Expo to St. Louis June 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope in 1991 to move to the East Coast with a third show," Wooten said last 
week at the Convention Center, as he demonstrated his new Dodge minivan 
conversion, which automatically lowers the entire van to the ground for easier 
access for a wheelchair-bound traveler. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on changes over the years in products to assist the disabled, Wooten 
recalled that when he first became disabled as a youngster, technology wasn't 
far enough advanced to make a folding wheelchair that could be loaded into a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the technology is amazing," Wooten said. "At the show, people will see 
kitchen and bathroom cabinets and cupboards that can raise and lower to 
accommodate a person in a wheelchair, bathroom fixtures that raise and lower, 
workstations for disabled, a wheelchair that is run by voice commands, one that 
goes up and down steps, an Eyegaze computer that can type 120 characters a 
minute -- that's two letters every second." 
</P>
<P>
The Eyegaze Computer System, which Wooten noted will be officially introduced 
on the West Coast at the show, consists of a standard IBM-compatible computer 
with a keyboard of symbols on the computer screen. An infra-red camera reads 
the eye-movement of the operator across the keyboard. What the eye sees is 
formed into sentences and either printed out on a printer attachment or 
converted to speech by a voice synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
Eyegaze is expensive, however, as are most high-tech products that aid the 
disabled. The system costs from $48,000 to $70,000 depending on equipment 
required by the individual. 
</P>
<P>
"Products for the disabled are pretty expensive, unfortunately so," Wooten 
said. "I wish there was something I could do to lower prices. The only thing we 
do have is that some companies offer show specials, with discounts on items if 
they're ordered at the show." 
</P>
<P>
Companies that exhibit at the show range from multimillion dollar firms to 
small mom-and-pop operations, often started by disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
Abilities Expo also will feature displays of several van conversions with hand 
controls for driving and automatic lowering capabilities and, Wooten said, a 
local RV company will demonstrate the conversion of a motor home for disabled 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be showing a coach with many options," said Cheryl Almuina of Burbank's 
National RV Inc. According to Almuina, the motor home conversion features "a 
wheelchair lift, a rear-bed modification -- it's an electric bed that raises 
and lowers -- a roll-in shower, hand controls for driving, widened aisle-ways, 
a lower stove, sink and cabinets." 
</P>
<P>
Many products at the exposition would be of interest to seniors with physical 
limitations, the Wootens said, although they have had difficulty in getting the 
word out to older consumers. 
</P>
<P>
One product for older people who may need assistance in walking is the Freedom 
Walker built in Los Angeles. With four wheels and a basket, it can serve as a 
shopping cart or convert into a chair if the person wishes to rest on the way 
home from the market. It also folds up for easy storage. 
</P>
<P>
For the disabled interested in sports, there will be a variety of products that 
can help them participate in exercise or competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Cycl-One attachment can convert an ordinary wheelchair into a hand-cycle 
for fun and exercise in riding. There are several models, some with extra gears 
for touring or racing. 
</P>
<P>
There are ski products: Kan Ski, for disabled water skiers, and Shadow 
Mono-Ski, for snow skiing, both chairlike, single-ski devices. Another product 
can aid a disabled person in scuba diving. And there is a specially-built 
sailboat for a person in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
There also are many special exercise devices, including a rowing machine called 
Rowcycle, and a wide selection of athletic wheelchairs to be used for tennis, 
volleyball, basketball or racing. 
</P>
<P>
"About four or five years ago the health care industry changed its philosophy 
toward the disabled," said Wooten. "Before that the consumers were just sort of 
out there. The manufacturers only wanted to reach the dealers. They ignored the 
end user. Now the trend is to show us the products and help us to finally be 
able to make living better."

LOS ANGELES JEWS GAIN CLOUT AS POWER SHIFTS TO THE WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rabbi Harvey J. Fields was sitting in his large, book-lined office at the 
Wilshire Boulevard Temple last week when he got a telephone call from New York. 
</P>
<P>
A powerful Eastern organization that speaks for the Jewish community on many 
social and political issues wanted him to evaluate a proposed policy on 
American Jews and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"Three minutes later I had the fax of the policy on my desk," he said. "I 
talked with people on my committee here, and 20 minutes later I responded to 
New York." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Role for Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
As the American Jewish Historical Society gathered in Century City today for 
its five-day annual conference and prepared for a discussion of the future of 
Los Angeles Jews, observers said that the phone call to Fields symbolized the 
new importance of Los Angeles Jewry. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, Jewish power has been in Eastern hands," said Steven 
Windmueller, executive director of the community relations committee of the 
Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles. "I think that it will 
increasingly be the case that not only individual but institutional leadership 
from Los Angeles will show the way." 
</P>
<P>
The historical society, which has met annually for 96 years, is meeting here 
this year for the first time with the theme "Under Western Skies: The 
California Jewish Adventure." In addition to the region's growing leadership 
role, participants and other experts also made the following predictions: 
</P>
<P>
* Despite rifts with other minorities over issues such as affirmative action, 
Jews will continue fighting for civil rights by joining with other groups, 
particularly the county's rapidly growing community of more than 2 million 
Latinos. "If we are not integrated with them in terms of causes and issues, we 
are going to be in danger. Jews realize this," said Gene Levine, a UCLA 
sociologist specializing in the study of ethnic and racial groups. 
</P>
<P>
* Jews will face social problems such as alcoholism, drug abuse and domestic 
violence. "Fifteen years ago we seemed immune to the social ills of American 
families," said Arnold R. Saltzman, executive director of the Jewish Family 
Service of the Jewish Federation Council. "Today we meet businessmen who say 20 
years ago my business went down the tubes because I had a problem and I didn't 
face it. I could not go to the Jewish community because they thought alcoholism 
wasn't a problem. I had to go to Alcoholics Anonymous in a church." 
</P>
<P>
* Synagogues and other Jewish institutions must reach what researcher Steven 
Huberman calls the "Jell-O Jews. They are sweet and good, but (their commitment 
is) mushy," said Huberman, executive director for community services at the 
federation. "They probably belong to a synagogue but don't participate. They 
probably contribute to the United Jewish Fund but don't participate. . . . We 
have to reach these people before we lose them." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that this week's conference, expected to draw 200 from all over the 
country, was held far away from the traditional epicenter of national Jewish 
leadership shows that the power is moving west, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is, the membership isn't (concentrated in New York) any longer. It's 
shifting. New York used to be the site of all the national meetings, but now we 
have to locate in places convenient for Los Angeles, San Francisco or San 
Diego," said Mark Talisman, director of the Washington, D.C., office of the 
Council of Jewish Federations. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' Jewish population has reached 600,000 and recently passed Chicago 
to make it the world's second largest Jewish community, behind New York. In 
addition, Angelenos now hold major positions in national Jewish organizations 
and are being consulted on national and international Jewish issues as never 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Los Angeles Jews) are players in every respect, and their programs are 
sought after by communities throughout the country," Talisman said. "That's how 
the influence developed." 
</P>
<P>
Advances in communications also have helped West Coast Jewish leaders increase 
their influence on national issues. 
</P>
<P>
A satellite receiver dish installed two years ago at the Federation 
headquarters allows links with New York or Washington meetings. Local leaders 
in a conference room see the out-of-town discussions on a television screen and 
address issues through a telephone hook up. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, your only option was to get on a plane and schlep across country 
(all night for a meeting the next day) or to choose not to go. Unless you 
elected to give up a day's work (and fly during the day)," said Wayne 
Feinstein, executive vice president of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Windmueller said that not only do national organizations communicate better 
with Los Angeles but that there has been "an explosion of organizations -- more 
than 20 -- setting up shop and hiring staff here" in the last five to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
They include the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a major lobbyist for 
Israel; the Golda Meir Foundation, which raises money for Israeli projects and 
Agudath Israel, a political arm of the Orthodox community. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an accident that all three major Jewish academic institutions have 
campuses in Los Angeles," Fields said. "There is only one other place that has 
happened -- New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Every major national Jewish organization has an office here. If you wish, you 
can attend a dinner for a Jewish organization every night of the week." 
</P>
<P>
New York leaders also recognize the change. 
</P>
<P>
"Its opinions are more sought and more listened to than they were 15 or 20 
years ago," said Carmi Schwartz, executive vice president of the Council of 
Jewish Federations in New York. "I see Los Angeles in a very strong leadership 
role here and globally." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say Los Angeles' peculiar history also affects the community's role on 
the cutting edge of Jewish ideas and programs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the least traditional Jewish community in the country," said 
Bruce A. Phillips, associate professor of Jewish Communal Studies at Hebrew 
Union College. 
</P>
<P>
"It has grown up quicker and it's a new community. People here are not all from 
the same Jewish neighborhood. Maybe they're from Detroit or Philadelphia or 
Brooklyn. As a result, they are more likely to follow individual proclivities 
than to feel pressure from other Jews to conform."

U.S.-SOVIET YOUTH THEATER COOPERATIVE VENTURE IN WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chance meeting in Munich last year between two young stage directors has 
prompted an unusual U.S.-Soviet youth theater exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The Mark Taper Forum's Improvisational Theatre Project has been invited to 
bring its critically acclaimed production of "One Thousand Cranes," a play 
about a child's fears of nuclear war, to the Soviet city of Rostov-on-Don (near 
the Black Sea) as part of an international children's theater festival in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, ITP and the Theatre for Young Spectators in Rostov-on-Don have 
begun tentative plans for a new, joint production. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Chigishev, director of the Theatre for Young Spectators, was impressed 
by "One Thousand Cranes" when he saw it performed at the 1988 international 
children's theater festival in Munich. It was then that he and ITP's artistic 
director Peter Brosius began discussing a cooperative effort between their two 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
That idea is now a few steps closer to reality. Sponsored in the United States 
by the International Theatre Institute in New York and given local support by 
the Taper, Chigishev recently made a 10-day visit to Los Angeles, where he and 
Brosius held preliminary planning sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Chigishev returned to the Soviet Union this week, with Brosius, who will 
conduct informal workshops with Chigishev and his actors. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview at the Taper offices, Chigishev had said through an interpreter 
that although he speaks little English and Brosius no Russian, "we speak the 
same language as if we grew up in the same street. Our countries are very 
different, but the language of the theater is the same." 
</P>
<P>
Chigishev, 36, is highly regarded in the Soviet Union for his imaginative stage 
work for young people. He directs a four-theater complex, with a permanent 
company of 35 actors, in a continuous repertoire of musicals, puppet theater, 
modern and classic dramas. 
</P>
<P>
This would not be the first Soviet-American youth theater exchange. Moscow's 
Central Children's Theatre and the Children's Theatre Company in Minneapolis 
are currently cooperating on two productions. The Taper project differs in that 
it would feature actors from both companies in one play. 
</P>
<P>
Brosius and Chigishev hope to begin rehearsals on the new work in October. 
(U.S. Artists at International Festivals has provided $10,000 toward the 
$75,000 October trip.)

SLAVES TO ART TO STAGE SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Alternative Repertory Theatre, which has lost so much of its audience that 
it is on the verge of disbanding, apparently hasn't lost its sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old troupe in Santa Ana has organized a support guild of about 30 
volunteers called Slaves to ART in its effort to raise $7,000 by mid-June, the 
amount that the troupe's founders have said is needed to survive a 
financialcrisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The response has been wonderful," ART spokeswoman Amy Larson said Wednesday. 
"All kinds of people have been calling to ask what they can do to help." 
</P>
<P>
Larson said the troupe has set a fund-raiser for June 10 at the theater, 1636 
S. Grand Ave. near Edinger Avenue. "It will be a parking-lot sale," she said. 
"Basically we're interested in having people donate items to sell. And, of 
course, we need people to come and buy them." 
</P>
<P>
The sale will be held from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Slaves to ART volunteers will conduct "a telemarketing campaign" 
tonight and Friday to remind the 1,723 playgoers on the theater's mailing list 
of the current production, "Slow Dance on the Killing Ground" by William 
Hanley. 
</P>
<P>
"We're grateful for all the calls offering help," says Larson, "but we've still 
got to get people in the doors to see the show." JAN HERMAN

INSTANT MOVIE RENTAL ON TV GETS TRYOUT IN NEWPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider: No more driving to your video store on Friday or Saturday afternoon, 
only to find that all the copies of the latest releases are already rented; no 
more return trips to take back the tapes that are available. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Orange County, thousands of cable television subscribers 
will soon be able to rent popular movies on the spur-of-the-moment, with just a 
flick of two buttons on their remote control unit. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly for an entertainment service whose major advertised selling 
point is "instant gratification," Comcast Cablevision has chosen tony Newport 
Beach as the test market for its "impulse pay-per-view" system. Comcast, which 
began installation in April, claims 85,000 subscribers in Orange County, 
including Seal Beach, Santa Ana, Fullerton, Placentia and Buena Park. "We hope 
to expand (impulse pay-per-view) to Fullerton and Placentia later this year, 
based upon viewer response," said Dave Barford, vice president of Comcast's 
Orange County operation. 
</P>
<P>
Ranging in price from $1.99 to $3.99 for one-time viewing, the movies will be 
available within weeks of their arrival at video stores but several months 
before they are shown on premium movie channels such as HBO. Subscribers 
purchasing the movies, shown on two of Comcast's channels, will be able to tape 
them for additional home use, Barford said, because the signals are not 
currently being scrambled or coded to prevent taping. 
</P>
<P>
Several other cable systems in the county offer pay-per-view movies and special 
events, such as the upcoming Sugar Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns title fight, but 
they require the subscriber to call the cable company to place an order. 
Industry research cited by Comcast has determined that subscribers on the 
impulse system are between two and five times as likely to order a movie than 
those on systems requiring a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
The slogan of Cable Video Store, the Philadelphia-based company that has 
pioneered impulse pay-per-view, is "Push a button. Rent a movie." This month's 
offerings include "Crocodile Dundee II," "Crossing Delancy," "Gorillas in the 
Mist," "Cocktail" and "Stealing Home." 
</P>
<P>
"We're a video store," said Ken Nimmer, Cable Video Store's vice president for 
programming, at a Newport Beach press conference Tuesday called to announce the 
new service. "Only we're on cable." 
</P>
<P>
Nimmer explained that the impulse system requires pressing two buttons to rent 
a movie to avoid an accidental purchase. An optional feature of the system is a 
security code to prevent unauthorized use. The system's technology was 
developed by the Jerrold Division of General Instrument Corp., Cable Video 
Store's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Cable Video Store, Comcast is offering two other national 
pay-per-view services -- Viewer's Choice and Rendezvous -- on a second channel. 
Rendezvous, an adult service that this month offers such films as 
"Twenty-something" and "Talk Dirty to Me," takes over the second channel from 
11 p.m. to 5 a.m. A third channel on the Comcast system previews movies 
available on the other two. 
</P>
<P>
Of Comcast's 16,000 subscribers in Newport Beach, the 9,000 who currently 
purchase only the basic package will be charged $2 a month if they want impulse 
pay-per-view capability. The remaining 7,000 who already buy at least one 
"premium" service will pay nothing for the hookup. Comcast officials said they 
expect to complete installing the technology throughout the Newport Beach 
system within 6 months. 
</P>
<P>
Similar impulse pay-per-view systems featuring the Cable Video Store and the 
Playboy Channel are operating in the San Fernando Valley and San Diego, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Western Cable Show in Anaheim last December, one of the hottest panel 
discussions at the annual industry gathering was entitled "Pay-Per-View and 
Home Video: Can They Live in Peace?" Panel members also questioned whether 
pay-per-view would cannibalize the market for movie services like HBO, with 
viewers renting only the movies they want to see, rather than buying monthly 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of pay-per-view, such as Hal Krisbergh, a vice president of General 
Instrument, a Philadelphia-based electronic component and equipment 
manufacturer, insist that pay-per-view "does not cannibalize existing pay 
channels. For example," Krisbergh wrote in an industry magazine, "once a 
subscriber realizes that he can get 40 or more films a month on a premium 
channel for the same price as two or three pay-per-view films, the perceived 
value of the pay service is strongly enhanced." 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping a lot of people will upgrade to the pay channels," said Comcast's 
Barford. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Adams, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates of Carmel, said Tuesday that 
he thinks that video rental stores will probably give up more of a market share 
to impulse pay-per-view than would the movie-package channels. A critical 
factor, he said, is how soon after films arrive in video stores will they 
become available through pay-per-view, since convenience and availability are 
pay-per-view's primary selling points.

NBC TO GIVE NEWS MAGAZINE A TRIAL RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NBC, the only network without a prime-time news series, may have "Yesterday, 
Today, Tomorrow" as a January contender, a top NBC executive said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Three editions of the program will get a test run in late summer as part of 10 
hours of prime-time news programs that the network will air over an eight-week 
period, starting Aug. 2, NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other programs are two two-part specials: one on racism in America, 
to be anchored by "Today" show host Bryant Gumbel, the other on guns and drugs, 
to be anchored by "NBC Nightly News" anchor Tom Brokaw. 
</P>
<P>
Those specials will air on consecutive Tuesday and Wednesday nights, with the 
other programs, including the three "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow" chapters, 
airing at 10 p.m. on Wednesdays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the new NBC magazine is successful in that time period, Tartikoff said, 
"we'll consider it for January." 
</P>
<P>
NBC previously has said that the project will be co-anchored by Mary Alice 
Williams, who earlier this year left CNN, and Maria Shriver, who recently 
signed a new four-year contract with the network. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff, speaking in a brief interview Wednesday after outlining NBC's fall 
schedule at a breakfast here for more than 1,000 advertising agency executives, 
emphasized that the magazine series never was a contender for this fall, 
despite some reports to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to have 'Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow' on the air beginning in June," 
he said. "But the earliest they (NBC News) could get it ready was in late July. 
</P>
<P>
"It never was intended to automatically be on the fall schedule. We always said 
we would have it as a summer series, and (would) provide money to bring it on 
the air without a lot of competition and try to nurture it." 
</P>
<P>
On another matter, Tartikoff denied charges by two stars of the drama series 
"Nightingales" that NBC canceled the show Monday because of pressure from 
advertisers and advocacy groups who had criticized it. 
</P>
<P>
Even though "Nightingales" frequently had won its Wednesday night time slot, 
Tartikoff described its ratings as "marginal" and said that NBC had decided 
another midseason replacement, "Quantum Leap," had a better chance of 
blossoming into "the kind of show that we've been looking for: a triple-crown 
winner that the advertisers love, that the critics adore and that the audience 
will eventually come to the dance for." 
</P>
<P>
As for "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow," the pilot is now being prepared in 
Burbank, but whether the show would continue to be based there should it get 
the go-ahead as a series has not been decided, an NBC News spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
If the show does make NBC's mid-season schedule, it would be the network's 
first prime-time news series since the quickly axed "1986" that Connie Chung 
and Roger Mudd co-anchored. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has three prime-time news series on the air, and all are expected to return 
next fall -- "60 Minutes," "48 Hours" and the revamped "West 57th." The latter 
will have as its sole anchor Connie Chung, who recently returned to CBS from 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
ABC News has one magazine show in "20/20" and plans to add another with an 
as-yet untitled weekly series that will be co-anchored by Sam Donaldson and 
Diane Sawyer. Their new series taped a test show on Wednesday and is under 
consideration for a Thursday night time slot, possibly starting Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that the NBC project with Williams and Shriver might 
get a third anchor, possibly Keith Morrison, the co-anchor of the 6 p.m. 
newscast of NBC-owned KNBC-TV Channel 4 in Burbank. Sid Feders, the executive 
producer of "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow," declined to be interviewed about the 
project.

In a real estate developer's dream tract, the largest plot of land belongs to 
the U.S. Marines. 
</P>
<P>
Near the northeastern corner of an area defined by the Santa Ana, San Diego and 
Costa Mesa freeways and Culver Drive in Irvine, the U.S. Marine Corps 
Helicopter Air Station in Tustin occupies 1,558 acres of prime 
commercial/industrial acreage. It borders the rich concentration of private 
industries in Irvine Business Complex, which boasts 47 Fortune 500 companies 
and nearly 600 corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a granite-and-glass high-tech business community where "old" 
buildings are those built 15 years ago, the World War II military base shows 
its age. Its 1,088-foot-long hangars were constructed in 1941 to house 
submarine-hunting blimps for the U.S. Navy. The largest unsupported wooden 
structures in the world, the hangars earned the base a national landmark 
designation in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the air station's 140 helicopters are used for troop training and to 
transport troops and cargo in the Western Pacific. With 4,030 military and 
civilian employees, the Tustin station is the county's second largest employer 
(after Hughes Aircraft Co.) and pumps half a billion dollars into the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
More than 4,600 people live on the base -- currently the only residents in the 
air station-Irvine Business Complex neighborhood. That's changing, however, as 
the Marines plan more housing units on the base and the city of Irvine departs 
from master-plan tenets that historically proscribed mixing housing and 
high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
At Jamboree Road and Kelvin Avenue, the Charter Apartments, first residential 
development in the business complex, is nearing completion. And more homes are 
on the drawing boards as the developers and the city of Irvine explore ways to 
integrate working and living areas. 
</P>
<P>
Land between the marine base and the San Diego Freeway was formerly inexpensive 
industrial space, but much of it now is used for executive office parks, 
research and development and some retail. While industrial and R&amp;D space is 
expected to remain stable, projections indicate office space will more than 
double by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
High-rise office space and large mixed-use projects such as Koll Center Irvine 
now dominate development along the San Diego Freeway. And restaurants, hotels, 
upscale athletic clubs, theaters and shops abound in the emerging urban 
village.

To honor all branches of the U.S. military service, Armed Forces Day has been 
celebrated the third Saturday in May since 1950. This year, local military 
bases' plans are very low key: 
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Reserve Center, Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Army's 40th Infantry Division march annually in the Torrance 
Armed Forces Day parade. No public observances are planned for the post itself. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps Air Station, El Toro, and Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station, 
Tustin 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Marines will not have public observances of the celebration. The 
El Toro air show April 29-30 and the Tustin open house earlier in the month 
were held in lieu of Armed Forces Day celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Naval Weapons Station, Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
The Seal Beach Station will share color guard honors with the Navy's Long Beach 
base in the annual Armed Forces Day parade in Torrance. As it did last year, 
the Navy will mount a photo display at Del Amo Fashion Center May 18-22. The 
exhibit features the Seal Beach site and its annexes in Corona, Fallbrook and 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton 
</P>
<P>
The First Marine Division band and between 100 and 150 troops will march in the 
Torrance Armed Forces Day parade. Military equipment including armored trucks 
and a howitzer also will be paraded. Maj. Gen. John Monahan, commanding officer 
of the First Marine Division, will be in the reviewing stand.

JOSEPH N. BELL: DOG MAY HAVE NO MANNERS, BUT DIPLOMA SAYS OTHERWISE

Last week, our wharf rat with the soulful eyes who goes by the 
un-dachshund-like name of Coco received in the mail a certificate officially 
acknowledging her graduation from Dog Obedience Training. It was a miscarriage 
of educational justice on a level with heavyweight champion Mike Tyson being 
awarded a degree in philosophy or the University of Oklahoma graduating a 
member of its football team. 
</P>
<P>
I never went to school with Coco -- I have to draw the line somewhere -- but 
even from the admittedly biased accounts of the 11-year-old kid in our 
household and his mother, who did go, Coco didn't exactly cover herself with 
glory. And she blew the final exam badly. 
</P>
<P>
All I know is what I see at home. Coco has, to my knowledge, never yet come 
when she was called. My wife insists that this behavior must be learned, and 
Coco is still too young for such expectations. My childhood recollection of a 
half-dozen dogs -- none of whom ever came within a country mile of obedience 
school -- is that they just naturally came when I called. Coco does, 
admittedly, walk better on a leash -- which is to say we no longer drag her 
along the street. She plows along, nose in the gutter, a minor triumph of 
training. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, I see absolutely no positive results of Coco's formal education. She 
still sleeps in my wife's flower pots in spite of repeated punishment when she 
is caught there. She still chews up anything she can get her mouth on, 
including paper, which she seems to find especially palatable. Last week, I 
finished one of these columns and put it on the kitchen counter. Apparently it 
blew off because the next time I came into the house, I found Coco eating it. 
She had gone through two of the three pages, masticating it into small pieces 
which took me an hour to gather and reassemble with Scotch tape. She apparently 
swallowed one whole paragraph on Page 2, and I suppose the one positive point 
to be made is that my prose didn't give her indigestion. 
</P>
<P>
If she has any long-term concept of the word no, she's given no evidence. 
She'll stop whatever mayhem she is committing momentarily, probably because of 
the force with which the word is delivered. Then she'll go instantly back to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
When I suggested these shortcomings to the 11-year-old kid after he proudly 
opened her "Obedience Training Certificate," he pointed out in her defense that 
she got a score of 196. Sure enough, there it was, right on the certificate. 
"Coco has completed the Puppy Novice course in dog obedience training with a 
score of 196." One-hundred ninety-six out of what? The 11-year-old kid insisted 
that it must be out of 200, but I suspect that it must be out of 1,000. Or 
perhaps 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, Coco's identity has now been established by the 196 she proudly 
carries into a life of manuscript chewing and flower-pot sitting. She almost 
seems to sense that. "Don't holler at me," she says with the soulful eyes. 
"After all, I'm a 196." 
</P>
<P>
I always try to find something positive from every event in my life, and I've 
been mulling over Coco's 196 to that end. And it occurred to me that throughout 
our formative years, we are graded on everything. Grades become an open sesame 
to all sorts of good things for kids, legal tender in an adult marketplace. A 
buck for an A at home. A special lunch with the teacher. Approbation and 
affirmation for good grades -- and, conversely, irritation and sometimes even 
rejection for bad ones. Acceptance at a good college. Scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Kids take to all this in many different ways, depending on their individual 
security systems. Some kids play the game to the hilt, doing whatever they have 
to do to get the grades, a little contemptuous of the system. Some kids wrap up 
their identity in grades and are devastated if they don't perform perfectly. 
Some kids stick their thumbs in the eye of the system -- and turn out to be 
geniuses in one field or another. And most kids struggle to overachieve, 
building as much credit as they can. 
</P>
<P>
Then we are suddenly dumped into a system where we aren't graded anymore. Where 
all sorts of things school didn't prepare us for -- like office politics or 
personality clashes or competitors who choose to cheat and get away with it or 
wildly different levels of priorities and ambition -- sometimes become more 
important than skill or dedication. In such a situation, the only consistent 
and clearly defined measure of success becomes money. Thus, the accumulation of 
money becomes our adult grade card, and we are increasingly fascinated with the 
Lee Iacoccas and Frank Lorenzos and multimillion-dollar athletes and movie 
stars in our midst. At that level, the amount of money becomes meaningless -- 
except as a grade card -- and we in the media help it along with the "Ten 
Highest Salaries in American Business" or "Honor Roll of Baseball's 
Million-Dollar Players." 
</P>
<P>
But to those of us who either have no stomach, desire nor resources to play 
this game, Coco's obedience training score offers an alternative. We can just 
give ourselves 196s -- and get on with our lives.

DISCOVERY: HARDLY A PLACE TO TIE ONE ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to Orange County Life.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Politics aside, Richard M. Nixon was known as one of the most fastidious 
presidents to hold the office, developing a notoriety for wearing a necktie at 
all times, even during walks on the beach below his San Clemente retreat. 
</P>
<P>
But even a dress code that hidebound couldn't stand up to the house rule at the 
Trabuco Oaks Steak House. In 1978, under the eyes of the Secret Service, the 
steakhouse's founder and original owner, Eleanor Sherod, attacked Nixon's tie 
with a pair of scissors, snipping it neatly in two. She then did the same for 
Nixon's friend Bebe Rebozo, who had accompanied the former President to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The remains of the two ties repose today in a display case near the front door 
of the restaurant, a warning to those who think they can get a seat with a 
cravat of any kind around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds have tried and failed, and what is left of their ties hangs from the 
rafters of the place in mute witness to the restaurant's relentless 
informality. Besides, if you're going to tuck into a juicy, 32-ounce steak, you 
might not want some $40 designer creation of muted paisley silk dangling into 
the A-1 Sauce. 
</P>
<P>
That 2-pound Cowboy Steak is the star of the menu at the Trabuco Oaks Steak 
House. The restaurant's current owner, Steve Nordeck, said 20 to 25 of them a 
week get slapped on the grill at $29.95 a throw. 
</P>
<P>
"And about half of the people who order them eat them by themselves," he said. 
"The other half share them." 
</P>
<P>
Large appetites have been coming to the remote restaurant for more than 20 
years. In 1967, Sherod and her husband took over a small snack stand just off 
Live Oak Canyon Road in Trabuco Canyon and began to add onto it while selling 
takeout burgers. By 1975, it had grown to resemble a large garden shack, and 
the beef was being sold by cut, rather than strictly by grind. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Nordeck and his wife, Dori, bought the place from Sherod and 
resolved not to tamper with success. 
</P>
<P>
Nordeck, a developer who was raised in Manhattan Beach and was that city's 
mayor before he retired from politics in the early 1980s, said he "used to come 
out to Coto de Caza in the early '70s, and my favorite place to eat always was 
the Trabuco Oaks Steak House. It was rural and different, and it always had 
excellent food." 
</P>
<P>
He became friends with Sherod over the years, so when Sherod decided to retire, 
she agreed to sell the business to Nordeck, who now lives in Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Cowboy Steak, the new regime sells more modest cuts, starting with 
the Little Wrangler, at 8 ounces. Side dishes continue to be simple: potatoes, 
salad, garlic bread and barbecued beans. Such dishes as mesquite-grilled 
halibut and deep-fried chicken are on the menu for people daunted by the size 
of the steaks. 
</P>
<P>
"We get Far Eastern business people who come in here and look at the Cowboy 
Steak and think they've gone to heaven," Nordeck said. "Home in Japan, they 
tell us that they can't get something like that for three times the price." 
</P>
<P>
Nordeck still wields the scissors, although he said he'll be willing to give 
anyone a break who shows up with a full Windsor at his throat. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll always tell people the policy of the house if they show up wearing a tie 
that they don't want to donate to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll give them a chance to take it off. They all take it with good humor." 
</P>

FIRST FAMILY TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
By all accounts I was a precocious child, a characteristic my father 
encouraged. He saw all of his children as a challenge, and he relished the 
battle of wits we would wage. In that respect, Dad was certainly not a 
traditional father. As early as I can remember, he treated me as an individual, 
someone able to make my own decisions; of course, he would guide me along 
masterfully until my decisions were pretty much in line with his own. 
</P>
<P>
Mother (Jane Wyman) also encouraged me to be independent. One of her favorite 
expressions was: "If I get hit by a Mack truck tomorrow, you'll have to take 
care of yourself." At 4, I had the dubious distinction of being the only kid on 
the block who knew what a Mack truck was. 
</P>
<P>
With two rising stars in our little family, our lives naturally revolved around 
the movies my parents were making. Both Mother and Dad were highly dedicated to 
their craft, but there were clear differences in their approaches to work. Dad, 
for example, was playing mostly personality parts, so he was able to put a lot 
more of himself into his roles than he needed to absorb from them. Mother was 
another story. She would immerse herself fully in whatever role it was she was 
playing. In fact, she lived through every role to such an extent that it was 
hard to recognize her when she came home. My recollections of her during this 
time are of many different people. 
</P>
<P>
The hours were also tough for both of them. It seems one of them was almost 
always working on the weekend or too tired out from the busy week preceding it. 
I think we (Michael and I) both measured the attention we received from our 
parents, mostly because there wasn't all that much of it to go around. Oh, we 
were well taken care of, don't misunderstand me, but as an adult I now realize 
that there's a distinct difference between the care provided by a parent and 
the care provided by a paid caretaker. We weren't neglected by any means, and 
we knew even that the reason our parents weren't around was because they were 
busy, not because they were ignoring us. It was simply one of the prices all of 
us had to pay for their success. 
</P>
<P>
So all of this meant I spent a lot of time with a woman named "Nanny" Banner . 
. . who was hired by my parents to help take care of me. It was Nanny who 
decided the time had come to see my mother on the screen. I had never seen any 
of my parents' movies, and so Nanny packed me up one afternoon in 1945 to catch 
the streetcar to Hollywood, stepping off at a movie theater featuring Mother's 
current film, which if memory and family legend serve was "The Doughgirls," 
with Ann Sheridan, Eve Arden and Jack Carson. 
</P>
<P>
According to Nanny, I had difficulty following the story line and not talking 
back to the screen, but I was able to follow what was going on closely enough 
so that when Jack Carson's character grabbed my mother's character in a tussle 
of sorts, I ran down the center aisle and shrieked, "You can't do that to my 
mommy!" I turned every head in the place, and Nanny and I were shushed back 
into our seats. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, I think it must have been a strange way for a little girl to grow 
up, having to comprehend seeing her parents on screen, adopting new 
personalities and forming relationships at considerable remove from the 
realities of her own day-to-day life. I'll never forget the time Alexis Smith, 
Dad's beautiful co-star in "Stallion Road," visited our house. She and Dad were 
having some publicity photos taken when I arrived home from school. I walked up 
to my father and he started to introduce me, but something told me there wasn't 
supposed to be another woman besides my mother in our house -- particularly one 
so glamorous -- posing for pictures like these, interacting so warmly with my 
father. When she offered her hand, I refused to shake it and after a mild 
temper tantrum was finally sent to my room by my very embarrassed father. 
</P>
<P>
Well, as you probably already know, most matches made in press agents' heaven 
don't exactly have legs, to borrow an industry term. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman separated in the summer of 1948. I was 7 years 
old. Michael was 3. The news of their impending divorce took me completely by 
surprise. I never heard any rumblings leading up to it, and very little was 
ever discussed with me afterward. One day they were together, the next they 
weren't; that's the way I saw it. All I could think was that things would never 
be the same again. I was right. 
</P>
<P>
Dad had the unhappy task of breaking the news to me. He took me out to dinner 
that night, and it was just the two of us. On the drive over, my father and I 
had another of our important car conversations. When I think of that moment, I 
am still a little girl . . . I am still the same little girl who wanted to 
scream, who wanted to curl right up and disappear, who wanted to cry out, 
"Why?" or, "What about me?" or "What about what I want?" I have those same 
questions still. 
</P>
<P>
You see, in my family, certain things happen on the surface, and they get 
discussed on that surface level, but we never quite get below the surface. 
Mother is like that most of all, and I suppose I, too, am guilty of something 
of the same thing, at least to a degree. Dad became that way, I think out of 
respect for Mother's privacy, and to some extent he remains guarded about 
certain things to this very day. 
</P>
<P>
With an adult's perspective, I can now see telltale signs that things were 
going sour for my parents. I think World War II, of all things, did a great 
deal of the souring. For 4 years during the war, Dad put his career on hold and 
worked making Army training films -- earning about $280 a month. Mother kept on 
with her career at full pace, and I have to think that the family dynamic was 
irrevocably changed as she became more and more the breadwinner. She seemed to 
start making more than her share of family decisions. 
</P>
<P>
When I was about 10, Dad started dating a small, slender actress with dark hair 
and wide hazel eyes, named Nancy Davis. You could tell the two of them were 
crazy about each other. They weren't lovey-dovey or anything like that, at 
least not in front of us kids, but they had a natural, easy way of being with 
each other that suggested they belonged together. Almost immediately, Nancy 
became a fixture in the front seat of our famous car rides. Wherever we went, 
the drives were filled with laughter and singing and good times. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly -- to me anyway -- I didn't feel the jealousy I'd expected to feel 
when I'd thought about Dad becoming involved with another woman. Nancy and I 
got on right away. 
</P>
<P>
Once I was able to deal with my parents getting divorced, I was able to 
separate Mother and Dad in my head; at that point, whatever happened in 
Mother's sphere and whatever happened in Dad's sphere were easy to 
compartmentalize. I could try to deal with each development separately, and any 
one development didn't necessarily have anything to do with any other. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, I was delighted to have a baby sister. The only time I ever really 
felt competitive toward Patti was when I was about 14 years old. I was visiting 
Dad and Nancy. Patti must have been about 3. I remember she came running over 
to Dad and plopped down in his lap and he said: "Hey, Shorty, how are you?" 
Well, I died a thousand deaths, because, of course, that was the name he used 
to call me. I was stung by the way she seemed to have stepped into the place in 
Dad's life that had once belonged to me. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, when I was living on my own in Washington and Michael had moved 
back in with Dad and Nancy, I came to California for a short visit. I think it 
was 1960, and Patti was about 7 or 8. When Michael moved in, the folks had just 
gotten around to explaining to Patti that he was her brother, which pleased her 
quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
And I said: "And do you know what that makes you and me?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," Patti said, "what?" 
</P>
<P>
"That makes you and me sisters." 
</P>
<P>
Patti burst into tears and she ran from the room crying. I felt deflated. Dad 
was quite embarrassed when he explained to me later that afternoon, "Well, we 
just haven't gotten that far yet." And there was a reason they hadn't got that 
far yet: I wasn't there. They hadn't had to go that far. They had just gotten 
to Michael and only after it was decided he would move in with them. It seems 
Patti was introduced to us siblings on a need-to-know basis, and until that 
time there had been no need for her to know any such thing about me. 
</P>
<P>
How could this little girl figure out where I fit into her scheme of things if 
I was hardly around to make my presence felt? I may have carried her picture 
around at school, but she didn't know that. After all, she had only seen me two 
or three times in the previous 2 years. But still, as I listened to Dad's 
explanation, while I understood it on one level, I started to feel out of place 
all over again.

STUDENTS IN COUNTY FARE WELL ON STATE TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elementary and junior high schools in San Diego County have met or exceeded 
state performance targets for measuring educational improvements in greater 
numbers than public schools statewide, California schools Supt. Bill Honig said 
in data released today. 
</P>
<P>
The performance targets are based on reading and math standardized test scores 
for grades three, six and eight under the California Assessment Program, the 
major annual measure of the state's educational pulse. 
</P>
<P>
At grade three, 70% of all San Diego County schools -- and 74% of San Diego 
city schools -- ranked in the top category of Honig's measurements, contrasted 
with 56.5% of all California schools. 
</P>
<P>
At grade six, 73% of all county schools and 81% of city schools were at the 
top, contrasted with 63.7% of California schools. And, at grade eight, 75.6% of 
county schools, 76% of city schools and 69% of schools statewide were in the 
top category. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judged by Improvements Made 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Education set goals for all schools to meet in each of 
the three grades, using a complex series of criteria. In essence, schools were 
ranked according to how much improvement they have shown on CAP tests between a 
1983-84 base year -- when the push for school reform began -- and 1987-88, the 
latest year for which scores are available. 
</P>
<P>
Schools could meet the targets in two ways: 
</P>
<P>
* Those with traditionally high CAP scores could compare their four-year test 
results to those of schools with students having similar socioeconomic 
backgrounds. This is the so-called relative ranking developed by Honig, where 
schools are ranked with other schools having similar composite indexes 
consisting of the educational levels of parents, the English fluency of 
students, the rate of student turnover during a school year and the number of 
families receiving government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
If the school ranked in the top quarter of its comparison group, then it placed 
in the top performance category. 
</P>
<P>
* Those with traditionally poor test scores could earn the top rank by showing 
greater growth in their CAP scores than the average statewide growth targets 
set by joint committees from Honig's department, individual state school 
districts and universities. Those committees set a growth of 12 points in the 
average of a school's CAP reading and math scores between 1983-84 and 1987-88. 
If a school met or exceeded that growth, it made the highest ranking. 
</P>
<P>
A school meeting only a two-year score increase of 6 points was placed in 
category 2. Those schools meeting neither the growth nor relative ranking based 
on high scores were placed in the bottom two categories, 3A or 3B. 
</P>
<P>
Some schools met both standards for achieving in the top category. 
</P>
<P>
"The philosophy is that all schools should either be performing at a high level 
or making rapid growth," Honig said in prepared remarks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Met Standards Despite Obstacles 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Hamilton Elementary in East San Diego has the area's highest 
turnover in students, a large English-as-a-second-language population and 
crowding. Its CAP scores have been among the district's lowest in recent years. 
Yet Hamilton showed an 18-point gain in its CAP results, and its average score 
of 261 placed the school in the top 20% of similar schools with high numbers of 
welfare students and mobility. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Jerabek Elementary in Scripps Ranch is San Diego city's top school 
in socioeconomic rank and in academic performance. But it placed in the highest 
category both by showing a 38-point gain and, with an average score of 363, 
standing in the top 12% of schools with upper middle-class indexes. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, schools want both high average scores and high relative rankings. But 
educators believe overall that districts and schools with relative scores in 
the top quarter of comparison groups deserve gold stars because such results 
mean they are performing better than schools in similar communities elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Some educators caution that school performance should not be based on 
standardized tests alone because such tests emphasize rote learning. But they 
also defend CAP as less egregious because it is designed by teachers and 
because it has been revamped to emphasize more problem-solving and 
comprehension skills. 
</P>
<P>
Under CAP, results are not reported for individual students, since each student 
takes only a small portion of a total CAP test and may answer more questions in 
one skill area than another. But across an entire school or district, enough 
students take a sufficient number of all parts of a test to allow an accurate 
assessment. 
</P>

HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
The information on high- and low-performing schools is based on average math 
and reading scores on the 1987-88 California Assessment Program test taken by 
third- and sixth-graders, and the average of scores in five CAP subject areas 
taken by eighth-graders in the state. The listings below show how individual 
schools performed on the CAP tests compared to schools of similar background 
(based on such indicators as parents' education and income level, the number of 
families receiving welfare assistance and the number of 
limited-English-speaking students). 
</P>
<P>
The first column shows the grade level for the school. 
</P>
<P>
Next is the performance index. The highest ranking is 1. For third and sixth 
grades, this means the grade met a statewide target set for that grade in 
1983-84. For eighth grade, the target was set in 1985-86. A 2 applies only to 
third and sixth grades and means they met a more modest growth target set in 
1985-86. A 3A means no targets were met and the CAP score average was in the 
middle 50% of comparable schools. A 3B means no targets were met and the score 
was in the bottom 25%. 
</P>
<P>
The next column shows the difference between the 1983-84 CAP score and the 
1987-88 score. 
</P>
<P>
Column 4 shows average 1987-88 combined CAP reading and math score for each 
grade level. CAP scores are scaled from about 100 to 400. 
</P>
<P>
Column 5 shows the grade's percentile ranking among grades levels at similar 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Schools in this section generally are in the central Los Angeles area, Glendale 
and parts of La Canada Flintridge. Additional scores are in appropriate 
suburban sections.

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies fatally shot an unidentified, apparently 
suicidal man who ignored repeated orders to stop charging at one of them with a 
rake early today in Lancaster, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The man had cut his wrists with the three-pronged garden tool before he charged 
a deputy with it and was shot several times in the head and chest about 1:30 
a.m. in the parking lot of Antelope Valley Medical Center, Sheriff's Lt. Dan 
Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred after a two-hour chase, Burt said. The man had sped away 
from a deputy who was trying to tell him to turn off the high beam on his 
headlights. During the chase, which ended in the hospital parking lot, the man 
ran at least 40 red lights and tried to ram a patrol car at one point, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the three deputies involved in the shooting were not immediately 
disclosed.

A would-be burglar is in custody today after police found him passed out in an 
upstairs bedroom of a Monarch Beach condominium, and stereo equipment on a 
chair by the door "waiting to be stolen," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had been called about 9:10 p.m. after a guard at the private complex on 
St. Kitts opened the gate for a resident and a pickup truck sped in behind, 
Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Bob Rivas said. The guard told police that 
the driver appeared to be drunk. 
</P>
<P>
While officers were inside the complex, police received another call from 
neighbors who had heard glass breaking in one of the condominiums. Officers 
arrived there as a man was leaving. "He yelled out that he lived there and that 
it was OK, and then ran back into the house," Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers entered the home through a broken den window. Upstairs, they found the 
man "passed out on the bed. He got a few cuts from going through the broken 
window, but that was all," Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Michael Gaffney, 25, of Dana Point was booked at Orange County Jail on 
suspicion of burglary. Bail was set at $25,000.

A two-alarm fire burned a portion of a fourth-floor chemistry lab at Cal State 
Fullerton this morning but caused no injuries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The small blaze presented a potentially greater danger because of various 
unknown chemicals and natural flammable gases contained in the room, Fullerton 
Fire Chief Marc Martin said. The Orange County Fire Department's hazardous 
materials team was called to assist. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was uncertain about how the fire began but he said it was confined to 
one corner of the lab and posed no danger to anyone outside the building. The 
building was evacuated when the fire started about 8:45 a.m., Martin said.

<P>
An East Los Angeles elementary school teacher has been charged with molesting 
five boys in his remedial reading courses, prosecutors said today. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Gross, 43, of Pomona was charged late Wednesday with one felony count of 
a lewd act upon a child and four misdemeanor counts of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Gross, who taught at Malabar Elementary School, was arrested May 2 and was 
released on $5,000 bail. He is scheduled to appear in Municipal Court for 
arraignment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time Gross has been accused of molesting students. In 1985, 
he was suspended from a teaching position at Hamel Street School in East Los 
Angeles when he was charged with sex-related offenses. Gross was acquitted and 
reinstated to his job, said district spokeswoman Diana Munatones.

EXXON CHIEF REJECTS ANGRY STOCKHOLDERS' CALL TO QUIT

Exxon Corp. Chairman Lawrence Rawl, faced at the oil giant's annual meeting 
today with angry shareholders and protesters calling Exxon a corporate 
criminal, rejected demands that he resign over his handling of the Alaskan oil 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
Rawl told stockholders that, in the wake of the tanker grounding that caused 
North America's worst oil spill, Exxon has ordered random drug and alcohol 
tests for employees in sensitive jobs, "including me." He also pledged the 
company will complete its cleanup of Alaska's Prince William Sound by September 
or earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is no, I won't (resign)," Rawl told 2,000 shareholders in a packed 
hotel room for an annual meeting dominated by the oil spill issue. "It's 
anti-productive to even consider that." 
</P>
<P>
Protesters chanting "Make Exxon pay" confronted shareholders outside the hotel 
where the meeting was held. Some wore pig costumes and some stood on stilts so 
that stockholders could read signs with slogans such as "Exxon is organized 
crime" and "Exxon is human error." 
</P>
<P>
Along a long driveway leading to the hotel, demonstrators planted mock 
tombstones bearing the names of Alaska bays and inlets fouled by the nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil spilled into Prince William Sound by the tanker 
Exxon Valdez on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and Alaska residents who own stock in Exxon pressed corporate 
management to speed cleanup efforts. Ed Rothschild, a spokesman for a coalition 
of five consumer and environmental groups, stepped to the microphone to call 
for Rawl's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Rawl responded that his stepping down would be the "worst thing we could do 
now," and only divert the corporation's attention from the cleanup effort in 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you want me to say that is going to make you happy? To say I am going 
to make it disappear out there? Because I can't," Rawl said.

ASSAULT GUN BAN IS SENT TO GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
COMPROMISE MEASURE WOULD MAKE CALIF. 1ST TO FORBID SUCH ARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislature today passed and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian a final 
compromise bill that would make California the first state in the nation to ban 
military-style assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
If, as expected, Deukmejian signs the compromise legislation by Assemblyman 
Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), the sale of about 60 models of assault firearms will 
be illegal after June 1. He has 12 days to act. 
</P>
<P>
Both houses today approved the measure, which included provisions sought by the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
The governor had complained that another assault weapons bill, sponsored by 
Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and approved earlier by the Legislature, 
provided excessive penalties for people who fail to register assault weapons 
legally obtained before the ban takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
"This (the Roos bill) recognizes the governor's concerns that an otherwise 
law-abiding citizen could face felony penalties" for possession of an assault 
weapon, Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate vote on the Roos follow-up bill was 27 to 11. The Assembly approved 
the changes on a 41-35 tally -- the exact majority needed in the 80-member 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The action came almost four months to the day that drifter Patrick Purdy used 
an AK-47 assault rifle to kill five children and wound 30 other people at a 
Stockton schoolyard Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the legislation charged that it was an overreaction to such highly 
publicized incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ed Davis (D-Northridge), a former Los Angeles chief of police, denounced 
the measure as "twisting the Constitution out of shape." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sad day for liberty in America," Davis said. "This is the result of 
emotion and panic thinking (but) it is not going to work." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would, with a couple of exceptions, ban the sale of more than 
60 models of weapons, including the type of AK-47 used by Purdy. 
</P>
<P>
People who legally obtain assault weapons before June 1 of this year could keep 
them but would have to register the firearms with the state. 
</P>
<P>
It would take a special permit, such as those required for machine guns, to 
legally keep an assault weapon obtained after the cutoff date.

King Hussein today rejected an Israeli plan for elections in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying it is an attempt to buy time. 
</P>

The Israeli blueprint avoids "facing increasing world pressures to solve the 
(Palestinian) problem in a just and durable way," Hussein said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership also 
rejected the plan, which excludes participation by PLO members. Speaking at 
Marka air base near Amman, Hussein said: "This (the PLO decision) is a 
Palestinian move, and I believe it is my duty and the duty of all our Arab 
brethren to support it."

JUSTICES LIFT STAY ON GIRL'S ABORTION; 
</P>
<P>
FLORIDA ORDERS EXPEDITED REVIEW OF 15-YEAR-OLD'S PETITION

<P>
The Supreme Court cleared the way today for a 15-year-old Florida girl -- and 
any other minor in the state -- to obtain an abortion without the consent of 
her parents or a judge. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment or recorded dissent, lifted an order Justice 
Anthony M. Kennedy had issued two days earlier blocking a Lake County girl, 
identified only as T.W., from having an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The court's action makes unenforceable, at least until September, a Florida law 
requiring some girls to get permission from their parents or a state judge 
before having an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Florida officials, reacting to the high court's order, asked the state Supreme 
Court today to expedite its planned review of T.W.'s case, or to allow the 
state law to be enforced until the Florida court's previously scheduled 
September review of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's order had sparked widespread speculation about his views on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
He is considered to hold a pivotal vote in a Missouri case asking the justices 
to reverse or curtail the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion. A decision 
in that case is expected by late June. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida case began when T.W., who is 12 weeks pregnant, sought a judge's 
permission earlier this month for an abortion. She said she feared physical and 
emotional abuse if she told her parents. 
</P>
<P>
The judge struck down as unconstitutional a parental-consent law enacted in 
February, and his ruling was upheld by a state appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the nation's highest court has approved some parental-consent or 
parental-notification laws, as long as an unwed girl under 18 and still 
dependent on her parents had the alternative of getting a judge's permission 
for the operation. About two dozen states have such laws. 
</P>
<P>
But the appeals court said the Florida law was too vague and could result in 
arbitrary denials of permission by judges. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to review T.W.'s case in the fall 
but refused to let the parental-consent law be enforced until then. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer who was appointed by the judge in T.W.'s case to represent the fetus 
then sought help from Kennedy, who handles emergency matters from Florida for 
the high court. 
</P>
<P>
"Minors in Florida are free, without constraint of any kind, to obtain an 
abortion," lawyer Richard Boylston told Kennedy. "In the absence of a stay, the 
unborn child of T.W., a minor, and hundreds of other unborn children will be 
aborted pending a decision by the Florida Supreme Court."

More physicians are agreeing to limit their charges for Medicare patients, 
although it is harder to find such a doctor in some states than in others, the 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Care Financing Administration reported that 283,475 physicians -- 
40.7% of the 696,848 doctors who bill Medicare -- have signed agreements for 
this year to charge Medicare patients no more than the government-approved 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
That's an increase from 37.3% in 1988 and 30.6% in 1987, and accounts for more 
than 60% of the total Medicare spending on physicians' services, said Louis B. 
Hays, acting administrator of HFCA. 
</P>
<P>
In Alabama, 76% of the physicians have agreed to charge only the 
Medicare-approved rate for all their Medicare patients, but in Idaho, only 16% 
have agreed to participate fully in the program.

Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.), saying she had struggled with the 
decision "for some time," announced today that she will seek reelection to a 
third term. Her decision dampened hopes of Democrats to win their first Senate 
seat from Kansas in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Kassebaum said she will run in the 1990 elections because she does not want to 
hurt the state by retiring and leaving it without her seniority. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that she had pledged to serve only 12 years when she first ran for the 
Senate, Kassebaum said she had "struggled with it for some time." But she said 
she decided to seek another term because there is no limit on the number of 
years a senator can serve.

Nearly three out of four Americans live in communities that pay more in taxes 
to support the Pentagon than they get back in defense spending, a study 
released today said. 
</P>
<P>
The study, "Bankrupting America," found that 321 of the nation's 435 
congressional districts are net-loss areas in the trade-off between defense 
spending and military taxes.

David S. Ruder is resigning as chairman of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to return to the faculty of the Northwestern University School of 
Law, the agency announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Under Ruder's command, the SEC conducted a massive investigtion into insider 
trading on Wall Street that resulted in charges against a string of financiers 
including speculator Ivan Boesky, junk bond wizard Michael Milken and Milken's 
firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President Bush, Ruder said he plans to return to Northwestern at 
the end of August. The date of his resignation will depend on the timing of the 
selection of a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Ruder assured Bush that he will continue to perform his duties actively until 
his return to Northwestern and will work with the Administration to secure a 
smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reagan Nominee 
</P>
<P>
Ruder, a nominee of former President Ronald Reagan, was appointed to the 
commission in August, 1987, for a five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
There had been widespread speculation that Ruder would be replaced by the Bush 
Administration and a search already was under way for a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Among the names that have been mentioned as possible successors to Ruder are 
John M. Richman, chairman of Kraft Inc. of Chicago; John J. Creedon, president 
of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.; Harvey L. Pitt of Fried Frank Harris 
Shriver &amp; Jacobsen in Washington; Thomas A. Russo, former director of the 
trading and markets division at the Commodity Futures Trading Comission, and 
SEC Commissioner Edward H. Fleischman. 
</P>
<P>
Other changes also are considered likely in the make-up of the five-member 
commission.

British-based mining and trading conglomerate Lonrho lost the final round of a 
court battle today to wrest control of London's luxury department store Harrods 
from the Egyptian Fayed brothers. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords, Britain's highest court of appeal, blocked Lonrho's attempt 
to force Trade Secretary Lord Young to refer the 1985 takeover of Harrods' 
parent company, House of Fraser, to Britain's takeover commission. 
</P>
<P>
It also refused to order Young to publish a secret report compiled by the Trade 
Department on the acquisition of Harrods by Mohammed, Ali and Salah Fayed for 
$990 million in one of Britain's most acrimonious takeovers. Lonrho's own bid 
was blocked by the government four years ago.

GASOLINE FUELS 0.7% LEAP IN CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR APRIL 
</P>

<P>
A record increase in gasoline prices fueled a large 0.7% jump in consumer 
inflation in April, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's climb in the Labor Department's consumer price index followed 
advances of 0.5% in March and 0.4% in February. It was the steepest one-month 
increase since an identical 0.7% rise in January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For the first four months of the year, inflation at the retail level ran at a 
6.6% annual rate, sharply higher than the 4.4% annual increases in both 1988 
and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said most of the momentum this year is coming from a 30% rise in crude 
oil prices. Once that works its way through the economy, analysts expect 
inflation to fall back to a 5% annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
In April, energy accounted for about 60% of the increase. The Labor Department 
said the 11.4% rise in gasoline prices was the largest one-month gain since the 
agency began keeping track of prices in the 1930s. The previous record was 
7.4%, hit in January, 1987, and in March, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.1% advance for all energy costs also set a record and followed a 1.1% 
rise in March. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like a Bulge' 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, noting that heavy influence of energy 
on the report, told reporters traveling with President Bush to Rochester, N.Y., 
"We think it's kind of like a bulge moving through the economy. Other than 
energy prices, inflation looks like it's in pretty good shape." 
</P>
<P>
The rate of inflation excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, which 
analysts say is often a better measure of underlying inflationary pressures, 
rose only 0.2% in April. The comparable figures were 0.5% in March and 0.4% in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans' average weekly 
earnings, after adjusting for inflation, increased 1.2% in April after falling 
0.3% a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Average weekly earnings in April, before adjusting for inflation, were $334.08, 
up 4.3% from a year earlier. Taking the 5.3% inflation rate for urban workers 
into account over the 12-month period, real weekly earnings were down 0.9%. 
</P>
<P>
In the price report, the department said food and beverage costs rose a 
moderate 0.5%. Fats and oils were up a sharp 1.0%, but sugar and sweets fell 
0.1%. Meats and poultry, dairy products, baked goods and fruits and vegetables 
all rose. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department offered these other details on price changes in April: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Apparel rose a modest 0.3% after jumping 1.4% a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Medical care was up 0.5%, the same as in March. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Entertainment climbed 0.6%, double the March rate of 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Transportation costs, reflecting gasoline hikes, rose 2.1%, the sharpest in 
nearly seven years. Gasoline was offset somewhat by a slight 0.1% rise in new 
car prices and a 0.3% decline in used car prices. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The cost of services, one sector not tracked by the wholesale price index, 
rose a modest 0.2% in April despite a tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
Economist James Annable of First National Bank of Chicago said April's energy 
jolt will probably be the worst for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hear oil prices are going up, it usually takes about three months for 
most of the effect to show up in consumer prices. We'll get some more in (May), 
and then we'll get dribs and drabs," he said.

FIELD OF 9 ENTERED IN PREAKNESS

<P>
Nine horses were entered today for a Preakness that looks "pretty much like a 
two-horse race" to trainer Charlie Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham's Kentucky Derby winner, Sunday Silence, is fully recovered from a 
sore right forefoot that cost him two days of training earlier this week, and 
is ready to renew his duel with 2-year-old champion and Derby runner-up Easy 
Goer. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got pretty much the same horses that were in the Derby, only about half 
as many," Whittingham said. "I think the smaller field will help us. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there are a few horses you can't rule out entirely, and racing luck 
has a lot to do with it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence worked a quick half-mile today in 47 1/5, galloping out 
five-eighths in 1:01 2/5. Afterward, Whittingham pronounced Sunday Silence fit 
and said the two lost days of training would be no problem. 
</P>
<P>
"He could run all the way to Los Angeles without taking a breath," Whittingham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence drew the No. 8 post for the $350,000-added Preakness over 1 3/16 
miles at Pimlico. The entries include seven of the 16 3-year-olds that were in 
the Derby -- Sunday Silence, Easy Goer, Awe Inspiring, Dansil, Hawkster, 
Houston and Northern Wolf. The two other starters are Pulverizing and Rock 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
From the rail out, the lineup is Hawkster, Easy Goer, Pulverizing, Awe 
Inspiring, Rock Point, Dansil, Houston, Sunday Silence and Northern Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham sent Sunday Silence out for a 1 1/2-mile gallop on Wednesday, 
postponing the workout until today when sunny skies broke a May record of 13 
straight days with rain. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of track isn't perfect for a work," Whittingham said Wednesday. "We 
only lost two days, but you can see that after galloping 1 1/2 miles, he's not 
even breathing hard. It won't affect this horse." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham said the injury probably was caused by a shoe nail too close to the 
tender part of his foot, but it also could have been a bruise caused by a 
stone. The foot was soaked in Epsom salts, and Sunday Silence worked today 
wearing bar shoes, which have a protective piece of metal across the open end. 
</P>
<P>
"He's 100% right now if nothing else happens," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
Shug McGaughey trains both Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring, but they were not 
entered as a single betting interest in Maryland as they were in Kentucky 
because they have different owners. Ogden Phipps owns Easy Goer, and Awe 
Inspiring is owned by his son, Dinny Phipps. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey said Awe Inspiring probably would be scratched unless it's an off 
track Saturday, and then he would consider scratching Easy Goer. McGaughey 
hadn't even planned on entering Awe Inspiring until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"At 9:30 I got a phone call from Dinny," McGaughey said. "Dinny said he wanted 
to protect himself; maybe it'll rain in Maryland." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence was the 7-5 favorite in the morning line, followed by Easy Goer 
at 8-5. Awe Inspiring was the 6-1 third choice. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey said Sunday Silence "should be the favorite" at post time, but "Easy 
Goer probably will be the favorite because he's better known around here among 
the bettors. But Sunday Silence deserves to be the favorite."

END ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS, EDUCATOR ASKS

The head of the umbrella organization for the nation's colleges and 
universities told Congress today that athletic scholarships should be ended and 
the football, basketball and baseball seasons shortened to heal the "basically 
unhealthy" system of campus sports. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, also proposed 
the elimination of freshman eligibility in football and basketball, and an 
equal sharing of television revenues among all schools. 
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost," said Atwell, "we must try to break the insidious 
connection between money and winning" in big-time college sports. 
</P>
<P>
Atwell was among several academic, media and sports federation officials who 
testified before a House Education and Labor subcommittee on problems 
afflicting collegiate sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Deford, former senior editor for Sports Illustrated, declared that 
"big-time college athletics has always been a scandal and always will be, 
unless major changes are made. It is a professional game which poses as 
amateur; a big business which uses free labor." 
</P>
<P>
Deford rejected arguments that revenues generated by glamour sports benefits 
higher education as a whole. "Rarely," he said, "does any money raised for 
big-time athletics leave the athletic department to enhance the university 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Atwell, who said his proposals were his own and not those of the council's 
member institutions, said "there is a major set of systemic problems that must 
be addressed if we in higher education are serious about restoring public 
confidence in intercollegiate athletics. . . . We must take care to diagnose 
and treat the underlying pathology, lest we deal only with the symptoms." 
</P>
<P>
"But I also believe that the fundamental responsibility for dealing with these 
problems lies with the institutions, and there is only a limited amount the 
federal government can do that would be appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schultz, executive director of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 
said "I'm not here to tell you there are not problems," ranging from drug abuse 
to academic and monetary cheating. "But the NCAA has not been sitting idly by," 
he added.
