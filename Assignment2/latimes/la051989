PROTEST CRISIS SPLITS CHINA'S LEADERS; 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Crisis engulfed China on Thursday as the nation's leaders appeared split over 
whether to use the army to put down massive demonstrations demanding that 
senior leader Deng Xiaoping step down. 
</P>
<P>
Reports circulated among some Chinese officials and Communist Party members 
that commanders of the elite 38th Army have refused orders to move into Beijing 
and that other generals also refused to move troops. Some army units, however, 
were said to have begun heading toward the capital from outlying regions. 
</P>
<P>
The 38th Army, stationed about 100 miles southwest of Beijing, is reputed to be 
one of China's best-trained and most reliable units. Some soldiers from the 
38th were moved to Beijing late last month when authorities were trying to 
control large-scale student marches. 
</P>
<P>
Central Beijing was the scene of a second day of mass protest Thursday as 
hundreds of thousands of demonstrators -- some estimates placed the total at 1 
million -- gathered in and near Tian An Men Square. Slogans were broadly aimed 
against the entire leadership but also focused with growing intensity on the 
84-year-old Deng. 
</P>
<P>
Before dawn this morning, Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, 
looking somber and tired, appeared at the square to speak with pro-democracy 
students who have been on a hunger strike since Saturday, and he pleaded with 
them to end their protest. 
</P>
<P>
"We were too late coming. I'm sorry," Zhao said in a seven-minute speech later 
broadcast on state-run television. "Your criticism of us is justified. I'm not 
here to ask your forgiveness. I'm just saying that your bodies have become very 
weak. Your hunger strike is already in its seventh day. Things can't go on like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleads With Students 
</P>
<P>
Zhao, who was accompanied by Premier Li Peng, said that "the situation in 
Beijing can't go on like this" and pleaded with the students to "understand 
what a serious point you've brought things to." He promised that government and 
party leaders would continue to listen to the students' views even after they 
end their protest. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao's comments were made in the security of one of about 150 buses parked in 
the square to provide demonstrators with shelter from thunderstorms. Students 
on the bus appeared to react favorably to Zhao's speech and seemed happy to get 
his autograph. But students in the square later said that a large majority of 
the protesters were not satisfied and would continue their demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"This talk by Zhao Ziyang is the same as the three recent discussions they've 
had with students," said one protester. "They're cheating us all the time. 
They're not sincere, and they're doing as little as they can. They have to come 
see us -- that's the least they can do. They're not doing any more than they 
have to. These little talks do not solve problems, and they are not a real 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
In one of these earlier talks, Premier Li, who has been one of the key targets 
of criticism, spoke Thursday with 12 protest leaders, telling them that 
"disorder has now occurred in Beijing and spread to the whole country." He also 
appealed unsuccessfully to the students to end their protest. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout most of the day Thursday, open-backed trucks raced through Beijing, 
horns blaring, carrying workers with banners that criticized Deng and 
proclaimed support for the 2,000 or so hunger-striking students still in Tian 
An Men Square. More than 1,000 hunger strikers have been taken away for 
treatment, medical workers say, but some have returned to the square after 
partially recovering. 
</P>
<P>
"Victory Is Within Sight," declared one banner on a truck. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao, widely viewed as the most enthusiastic advocate of rapid reform among 
China's top leaders, continued to be spared specific criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Many protesters said Thursday that their actions might help Zhao consolidate 
power as Deng's successor, but these same people denied having any enthusiasm 
for him. A group of half a dozen students interviewed in Tian An Men Square 
said the key goal of the demonstrations is to force elderly and hard-line 
orthodox leaders from power and place the government in the hands of "the 
reform faction" headed by Zhao. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just choosing the lesser of two evils," one of the students said. "We 
aren't supporting or opposing Zhao Ziyang. We still haven't expressed an 
opinion about him." 
</P>
<P>
In his 50-minute meeting with student leaders, held in the Great Hall of the 
People and broadcast later over government television, Li appeared to hint at a 
possible crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The government of the People's Republic of China is responsible for the whole 
nation," Li said. "We have the duty to safeguard the students' lives, 
factories, the fruits of socialism and our capital." 
</P>
<P>
Li suggested to the student leaders that "all hunger strikers be hospitalized 
right now, without waiting until they are critically ill," according to the New 
China News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The students should leave the square without preconditions," Li continued. 
"Tell them to leave the square." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently angered, one of the student leaders, 21-year-old Wuer Kaixi, 
retorted: "Whether we leave the square or not is not ours to decide. The 
responsibility is on the government side." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting then collapsed when one student leader told Li, "This is not a 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Party leader Zhao, since first making a conciliatory statement toward the 
students on May 4, has taken the lead in promoting a soft approach toward the 
pro-democracy demonstrations, which began in mid-April. He has repeatedly 
stated that the students are patriotic and that many of their goals, such as 
political reform, more funding of education and an end to official corruption, 
conform with what the Communist Party itself wants to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
The Thursday evening national television news program showed pre-dawn visits to 
hospitalized hunger strikers by Zhao, Li and two other members of the 
Politburo's Standing Committee, Hu Qili and Qiao Shi. 
</P>
<P>
"Zhao Ziyang, Li Peng and the other leaders affirmed the enthusiastic 
patriotism of the students," the television news reported. "They said that the 
zeal of the students to demand democracy and the rule of law, oppose corruption 
and push forward reform is very commendable." 
</P>
<P>
The newscast quoted Zhao as stating that "the goals of the Communist Party and 
the government are the same as those of the students -- there is no basic 
conflict." 
</P>
<P>
"There are various methods we can use to share our thoughts and solve 
problems," Zhao said. "There's no need to use the method of a hunger strike. 
You're still very young, you still have a lot of time to make contributions to 
the nation. You should take care of your health." 
</P>
<P>
Li, in his later talk with students, declared: "The situation will not develop 
as you wish and expect, even though you have patriotic zeal. . . . I do not 
intend to blame the students for all the turmoil. But I hope you will think 
over what the final consequences might be should the situation worsen." 
</P>
<P>
Support for the student demonstrators, who remain at the core of the protest, 
has come from broad sectors of society in the last few days, including 
employees of many mainstream organizations controlled by the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily, official newspaper of the Communist Party, reported that 
more than 1,000 of its own employees had marched in Wednesday's demonstrations, 
with some high-ranking editors and reporters marching in front.

FAA ORDERS MAJOR REPAIRS FOR NATION'S OLDER AIRLINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government, concerned about the danger of aging airliners, on 
Thursday tentatively ordered $142 million in modifications to older Boeing 
727s, 737s and 747s. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the Federal Aviation Administration, which is expected to become 
effective in the fall, would apply initially to 115 planes. It comes in 
response to the accident last year in which a 19-year-old Aloha Airlines 737 
that had logged almost 90,000 flights lost an 18-foot section of its fuselage 
while flying over Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the order represents a "fundamental change in the FAA's 
philosophy for maintaining the airworthiness of older aircraft." The new order 
would cover additional aircraft as they grow older -- a potentially huge group, 
because the average age of commercial transportation aircraft is about 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of simply requiring regular inspections of planes for corrosion, 
cracking and other signs of metal fatigue, the FAA order would require 
modifications of planes when they become 20 years old or have made a certain 
number of flights, regardless of what inspections show. The number of flights: 
60,000 for 727s, 75,000 for 737s and 20,000 for 747s. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to move away from an inspection-intensive system," said FAA 
spokesman John Leyden. "We're saying we need to replace certain parts," like 
landing gear, after a specified amount of use. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed FAA "airworthiness directives," open to public comment until June 
30 and expected to become final by September, call for numerous modifications 
on wings, doors, tail assemblies, landing gears, fuselages and landing struts. 
The changes include structural reinforcement and replacement of a variety of 
parts, such as skins, bulkheads and frames. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the large number of work hours required to make the modifications, 
airlines would be allowed four years to comply with the rules. Meanwhile, 
inspections will continue. 
</P>
<P>
The modifications vary, as does the time it will take to perform them, 
depending on the aircraft series. The fuselages of 747s must be strengthened, 
for example, a task requiring 14,000 work hours for each plane. Among the total 
of 115 Boeing aircraft covered are 67 of the 727s, 28 of the 737s and 20 of the 
747s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Jets Not Covered 
</P>
<P>
Although foreign airlines with these planes in their fleets would not have to 
comply with the FAA rules, they are expected to do so voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
In the Aloha Airlines accident, a flight attendant was killed when she was 
swept out of the plane through a gaping hole in the fuselage. The plane landed 
safely with no other fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
The April, 1988, accident focused unprecedented attention on aging airliners 
worldwide, leading to the formation of an FAA-sponsored international 
conference on the problem two months later. That, in turn, spawned a joint 
government-industry task force headed by the Air Transport Assn. Its mission 
was to develop plans for dealing specifically with Boeing aircraft. The FAA 
based its new rules on the task force recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Another task force is developing similar recommendations that will apply to 
McDonnell Douglas aircraft, and a third is working on plans covering all other 
planes. FAA officials said that they expect to issue those rules later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Stephen D. Hayes, vice president of the association that 
represents air carriers, praised the FAA for "moving ahead quickly" on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes acknowledged that the cost of the modifications would be significant, but 
he added: "I don't think we're going to see any fare increases as a result of 
this." 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said that the company was "very 
pleased" with the proposed rules, adding that they would "raise the standard of 
safety" in air travel. 
</P>
<P>
Both men asserted that some carriers already have initiated some of the FAA 
requirements, reflecting a view among experts that the new rules would serve to 
ensure that the less progressive and conscientious airlines would be most 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
"The rule places a platform in the industry," Gamble said. "It will bring 
everybody up to the same level."

ASSAULT GUN BAN WINS FINAL VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
DEUKMEJIAN'S PROMISED APPROVAL WOULD MAKE IT 1ST SUCH U.S. LAW

<P>
The Legislature beat down the gun lobby Thursday and sent to Gov. George 
Deukmejian for his promised signature a landmark bill making California the 
first state to ban military-style assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Jubilant supporters, who broke out in applause when Assembly approval of the 
heavily lobbied measure was announced, declared that the action "sends a 
message" to President Bush, Congress and other state legislatures that concern 
for public safety outweighs the demand to sell and own semiautomatic combat 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Deukmejian said the Republican governor intends to sign the 
bill next week under a compromise reached with the Democratic authors of the 
legislation, Assemblyman Mike Roos and Senate leader David A. Roberti, both of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uphill Battle 
</P>
<P>
In California, attempts to impose new controls on gun ownership are always 
uphill battles. The last time the Legislature enacted a major ban on firearms 
occurred in 1934 when machine guns, a favorite of mobsters, were put off 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
The assault gun proposal was first approved by the Senate on Thursday by an 
almost routine 27-11 bipartisan vote. Later, the Assembly approved it 41-35, 
the precise simple majority required in the 80-member chamber. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the televised Assembly debate, an opponent of the bill, 
Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), demonstrated how a legal 
semiautomatic rifle can be quickly made to look like an assault weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you get permission to carry that onto the floor?" cried out Assemblyman 
John Burton (D-San Francisco), a supporter of the ban. "Is it loaded?" Mountjoy 
assured him that the gun was unloaded and that he had received permission to 
bring it into the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the bill provides that effective next Jan. 1 it will be against the 
law to sell, give, lend, import, distribute or manufacture about 60 types of 
semiautomatic rifles, shotguns and pistols declared by brand name to be 
"assault weapons." The bill also sets up a system to register such guns if they 
have been legally acquired by this June 1. 
</P>
<P>
The final vote actually occurred on a conference committee report that 
contained compromises agreed to by the lawmakers to win Deukmejian's signature. 
Except for the compromise provisions that dealt with penalties for possession 
of unregistered guns legally obtained before June 1, the bill by Roos was 
identical to an earlier measure by Roberti that had been sent to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was strongly supported by top law enforcement officials, teachers, 
physicians and church-based community organizations in Los Angeles County where 
terrorized neighborhoods have become shooting galleries for drug trafficking 
street gangs armed with such assault weapons as Uzis and AK-47s. 
</P>
<P>
Bitterly opposed to the proposal were gun-owner groups, including the usually 
politically influential National Rifle Assn., which waged an all-out lobbying 
campaign to kill the legislation. Gun owners argued that it would do nothing to 
stop criminals but would disarm law-abiding citizens of one type of gun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NRA Defeated 
</P>
<P>
Roberti declared that final legislative approval of the bill demonstrated that 
"the National Rifle Assn. can be beaten and the special interests don't always 
win every year . . . . The fact that the Legislature responded to the concerns 
of the public and defeated the NRA, that is something we are very, very pleased 
about." 
</P>
<P>
But Richard E. Gardiner, the NRA's Washington-based director of lobbying in 
state legislatures, insisted that final approval of the bill was "based on a 
lot of untruths" and asserted that the compromise changes sought by Deukmejian 
"are not in this bill." 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly sends a message very clearly that the state of California is not 
interested in doing anything about crime," he charged. "It's a clear message 
that the government of California so detests its own citizens that it wants to 
make criminals out of them." 
</P>
<P>
Gardiner also forecast that the California action, rather than encouraging Bush 
and Congress to enact a national ban on assault rifles, would have "no effect" 
on the White House or Capitol Hill. He said the NRA, as expected, intends to 
file a lawsuit against the California ban next year when the bill becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
From the other side, state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a strong supporter 
of the bill and a Democratic contender for governor next year, asserted that 
"the focus now shifts from Sacramento to Washington." He praised Republican 
President Bush for proposing a ban on some imported assault weapons, but said 
"he needs to do much more. The time for half-measures is past. I call for a 
national ban on assault weapons and urge the Congress and President to act as 
responsibly as our Legislature and our governor have." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Efforts 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to ban assault weapons in California reach back at least five years and 
previously have always failed, largely at the hands of the NRA, whose members 
total about 270,000 in the state and are considered a political bloc not to 
trifle with. 
</P>
<P>
While the Roberti-Roos legislation was announced in December, it was the Jan. 
17 murders of five Southeast Asian refugee children in a Stockton schoolyard 
that provided the emotional ingredient required to advance the bill and gain 
the support of Deukmejian, long an opponent of new controls on guns. 
</P>
<P>
The children were cut down by Patrick Duffy, a demented drifter clad in combat 
fatigues, who fired 105 shots from a Chinese-made AK-47 across the playground, 
reloading at least once. He then shot and killed himself. Twenty-nine other 
children and a teacher were wounded in the attack that focused national 
attention on military-style assault guns. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the backing of the GOP governor for the Roos-Roberti legislation, all 
but two Assembly Republicans -- Charles Quackenbush of Saratoga and William 
Filante of Greenbrae -- either voted against the bill or did not vote at all 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Roos, who during floor debate commended Deukmejian for his "courageous" stance, 
urged Republicans to vote aye and "change the culture of violence as it badly 
affects many of our cities up and down the state." Roos told them that the 
"Bush Administration has made this safe to do." 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) countered that misdemeanor and 
felony penalties in the bill are "certain to make criminals out of thousands 
and, more than likely, tens of thousands, of law-abiding, decent Californians" 
without touching criminal gun users. 
</P>
<P>
Roos claimed, however, that such arguments constituted the "last gasp of the 
NRA." 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), former chief of police in Los 
Angeles, warned that the assault gun ban would swiftly lead to future controls 
against other guns -- an overriding fear of many California gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be a sad day for liberty in California," Davis declared. "We will be 
the first state in the nation to declare war on semi-automatic weapons. This 
(bill) is a result of sentiment, emotion and panic-thinking. It's not going to 
make anyone safe. It's just a placebo." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., said actions 
such as California's send a "strong signal to Congress that Americans want to 
take back our streets." She urged Bush and Congress to "follow California's 
lead." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous California attempts to outlaw assault weapons, the latest 
effort featured a new wrinkle in packaging. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier campaigns, Handgun Control Inc., chief adversary of the NRA, took 
the leading, up-front role in lobbying. Some law enforcement organizations, 
while mostly gingerly supporting Handgun Control, did not band together in a 
united front. 
</P>
<P>
For many legislators, representatives of Handgun Control were synonymous with 
gun confiscators knocking on doors in the middle of the night demanding that 
weapons be surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, law enforcement took the leading role in public and 
successfully cast the issue as a public safety matter. Handgun Control, 
meantime, provided major financial support for indirect lobbying of the 
Legislature through paid advertising and helped organize citizen efforts for 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Jerry Gillam contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GUN LAW AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Major provisions of the "Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989," 
which will become law Jan. 1, 1990, include these: 
</P>
<P>
The law establishes a new classification of firearms known as "assault 
weapons." It declares that an assault weapon has "such a high rate of fire and 
capacity for firepower that its function as a legitimate sports or recreational 
firearm is substantially outweighed by the danger that it can be used to kill 
and injure human beings." 
</P>
<P>
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES 
</P>
<P>
It will be punishable for a term of from four to eight years in state prison 
for civilians to import, manufacture, distribute, sell, give or lend any 
assault weapon. Possession, except for people with a special permit, will be 
punishable either as a misdemeanor with a jail sentence or as a felony with a 
prison term. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a misdemeanor to advertise the sale of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
REGISTRATION OF ASSAULT WEAPONS 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who legally possesses such a firearm as of this June 1 has 18 months or 
until Jan. 1, 1991, to register it with the state Department of Justice. The 
fee will be a maximum $20. (A person seeking to buy an assault weapon after 
June 1 first must get a difficult-to-obtain permit from the department by next 
Jan. 1.) 
</P>
<P>
Possession generally is restricted to the gun owner's home, business or any 
private property where permission is granted. Other legal sites include 
approved target ranges, licensed shooting clubs and certain exhibitions. 
Transporting an assault weapon in a locked container to and from such places 
will be legal. 
</P>
<P>
If the owner of a legally acquired assault gun did not register it, he or she 
will be subject to a fine of $350 to $500 for the first violation. For the 
owner of an illegally obtained weapon, simple possession of the outlawed gun 
will be a misdemeanor or a felony at the discretion of a judge. 
</P>
<P>
No one under 18 or anyone convicted of a felony or who has been adjudged to be 
mentally ill and dangerous can possess or register an assault gun. 
</P>
<P>
A person who inherits such a gun either must, within 90 days, obtain a permit, 
make it permanently inoperable or sell it to a licensed gun dealer. Newcomers 
to California with legally obtained assault weapons must do the same. Gun 
dealers will be authorized to possess weapons and transport them between 
dealers in California and to sell them outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
The new law also seeks to outlaw copies of the banned assault weapons. Dozens, 
and perhaps scores, of such guns exist, although supporters of the legislation 
maintained that the copy-cat firearms were too numerous to identify in the bill 
and that their model numbers changed frequently. For these current facsimiles 
and look-alikes that might be manufactured in the future, the law empowers the 
attorney general to challenge such firearms in the Superior Court of major 
urban counties, such as Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego and San Francisco. If 
the judge is persuaded that the facsimile is actually an assault weapon, the 
jurist can outlaw it. 
</P>
<P>
PENALTIES FOR ASSAULT GUN USE 
</P>
<P>
It will be a felony, punishable by up to 12 years in prison, to attack another 
person with an assault weapon. 
</P>
<P>
A person armed with an assault weapon who commits or attempts to commit a 
felony will be subject to an additional five years in prison beyond the 
sentence imposed for the basic crime. An unarmed person participating in a 
felony or attempted felony in which an assault arm is used by an accomplice 
will be subject to an extra three-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>

$300-MILLION BRENTWOOD PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
GETTY CENTER CHALLENGES A PREMIER U.S. ARCHITECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Meier sits at a white lacquered table in a light-filled office in 
Westwood with unadorned white walls. His white shirt matches his collar-length 
white hair. The bookshelves and telephone are white, as is the single carnation 
peeking out from a bud vase. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the world's leading architect, Meier is -- not surprisingly -- famous 
for gleaming white buildings covered with porcelain panels. He is also 
celebrated for making light bend in unusual and interesting ways, for 
structures that appear to have been dropped from a helicopter into the 
surrounding landscape and for a formal approach that has won him many more 
admirers in Europe than in California. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for more than four years now, the New York-based Meier, 54, has been 
reinventing himself as he tackles what some have called the architectural 
commission of the century: five buildings that will sprout from a 742-acre 
chaparral-studded hill above Sunset Boulevard in Brentwood with a panoramic 
mountain-to-ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
The $300-million J. Paul Getty Center, which will include a museum, a 
conservation institute and a library and research facility for art historians, 
will not bear any of Meier's signature features -- in part because of the 
demands of the client, in part because of the demands of a neighborhood that 
imposed 107 conditions on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Despite obstacles that often seem "arbitrary" to him, Meier exudes confidence 
about his assignment, which he has compared to designing the Acropolis. The new 
Getty museum, he asserted in a recent interview, "will be the foremost tourist 
attraction in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be rather an exciting museum to visit, both in terms of 
what's displayed but also in terms of how it's displayed and the quality of the 
spaces as you go through . . . ," he said. "I think people will come here also 
to see Los Angeles. You have a sense of the city -- a sense of the breadth of 
it, a sense of the expanse of it, from the desert to the sea -- that you don't 
have as you go from one place to another by car." 
</P>
<P>
The blueprints for the college campus-style complex will not be finished until 
next year, and the museum is not scheduled to open until 1995, four years after 
the originally announced completion date. But construction will start this 
summer on the underground parking garage at the base of the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the Getty commission has been endlessly frustrating for the blunt 
and prickly Meier, a tall, ruddy-complexioned man who wears the round-framed 
spectacles popular with architects. "Every time you turn around there's someone 
there saying, 'You can't do that,' " he said, referring to the restrictions won 
by the Brentwood Homeowners Assn. on everything from setbacks to sight lines to 
building height. 
</P>
<P>
In others respects, however, the unique endeavor has afforded luxuries that 
most architects can only dream of -- trips to Europe with Getty Trust officials 
to inspect villas, gardens, museums and hill towns and the chance to examine 
samples of stone from "every quarry in the world." For the first year after he 
was hired, he did not even have to pick up a pencil. 
</P>
<P>
For the two weeks each month when he is in Los Angeles, Meier has had the 
opportunity to live atop the hill itself, in a brown wood-frame house that will 
eventually be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
He has spent many hours hiking on the rugged site with his personal trainer and 
observing not only changes in the quality of the light but also "the sounds, 
smells, things that are going on all around that affect your experience of 
being on the hillside." 
</P>
<P>
The complex will bring together most of the components of the Getty Trust, a 
nonprofit foundation established by the oil magnate, who died in 1982, to 
foster the visual arts and related fields. The trust has a $3-billion 
endowment, by far the biggest in the art world. 
</P>
<P>
Only the auditorium, restaurants and the museum, which will house paintings, 
photographs, drawings, illuminated manuscripts and decorative objects (the 
antiquities will remain at the original museum in Malibu), will be open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
The project has posed enormous challenges, and not just because of the 
restrictions. Meier, who oversees 20 architects working exclusively on the new 
Getty project, must accommodate the needs of programs that have not yet 
finished defining themselves. 
</P>
<P>
He must create buildings of architectural distinction that will not do violence 
to their dramatic natural surroundings. And he must design a museum that will 
draw people to the artworks without competing with or overwhelming them. 
</P>
<P>
John Walsh Jr., director of the Getty Museum, said a museum building and its 
collection should relate to one another as an accompanist does to a singer. 
"The accompanist plays a subtle and important part in emphasizing and setting 
off the words and music, and sometimes has solo passages, and that's great," 
Walsh said. "But if ever the accompanist drowns out the singer, you know it's 
going to be trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood that Meier, who nearly pursued a career in painting instead of 
architecture, would be able "to some extent to subordinate the building to the 
art" was one reason he was chosen in 1984 after a highly publicized 18-month 
search, according to Stephen D. Rountree, director of the building program. 
</P>
<P>
Meier had just won the Pritzker Prize, architecture's highest honor, and had 
recently designed two widely praised art institutions -- the High Museum in 
Atlanta and the Museum for the Decorative Arts in Frankfurt, West Germany. Both 
buildings reflect the influence of Le Corbusier, a dominant figure of the 
post-World War I era whose passion for the simplicity and purity of white cubes 
helped define the International Style. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Newark, N.J., and educated at Cornell University, Meier had never built 
anything in California. 
</P>
<P>
Some authorities on local architecture were skeptical about Meier's selection 
and questioned whether he could adapt to the special characteristics of 
Southern California. "He has a set form, whether it's in the United States or 
Europe," said David Gebhard, professor at UC Santa Barbara and co-author of 
"Architecture in Los Angeles." "It's the same old thing." 
</P>
<P>
But Getty officials say it did not trouble them that Meier's previous museums 
were not exactly what they had in mind. For example, they believe older 
paintings look best when lit from above rather than from the side, Meier-style. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh recalled how the issue was broached with Meier: 
</P>
<P>
"We said at the outset: 'You make wonderful buildings of a certain type, but 
those materials and forms aren't going to suit a collection of older art or sit 
very well in that landscape.' 
</P>
<P>
"He (Meier) said, 'I know. That's what's so interesting about this job.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hired at an unusually early stage of the project, Meier spent the first year 
watching closely and asking questions as the Getty Trust formulated and refined 
its programs -- an evolutionary process that is still going on. 
</P>
<P>
Other extravagances included two European trips in the company of top Getty 
officials. The group drew inspiration from some of the sights they visited, 
such as the monastery, Certosa del Galluzza, near Florence, whose buildings and 
courtyards seemed of a scale that would suit the Getty. Arriving at the Villa 
D'Este outside Rome on a hot summer day, the Getty officials were impressed by 
how the fountains appeared to cool the air and resolved to provide the same 
relief in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone said, 'Isn't it wonderful what the water does in terms of making you 
feel that it's not so hot?' " Meier said. "If we had sat around the table and 
tried to discuss that, it would not have had the same effect." 
</P>
<P>
Even now that the project is in what is known as the "design development phase" 
-- meaning that plans are being negotiated room by room -- the field trips 
continue. As recently as last month Meier, Walsh and Rountree visited the 
National Gallery of Art in Washington, a favorite of Walsh's, to study the way 
fabric is used on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Getty officials say the trips have enhanced communication between architect and 
client. But Meier has remained closed-mouthed about some of his thinking, 
including the type of stone he is contemplating for the building exteriors. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we knew more about it than we do . . . ," Rountree said. "It's one of 
those things where artistically he isn't showing us much. He feels that it's 
not yet time." 
</P>
<P>
What has been disclosed is that the five buildings, with 400,000 square feet of 
space, will be located in a kind of wishbone configuration on two ridges that 
-- to Meier's delight -- run along the same axis as the San Diego Freeway 
below. 
</P>
<P>
The museum will be on the eastern ridge and visible from the freeway. Adjacent 
to it will be the Conservation Institute and other offices. 
</P>
<P>
On the western side, and shielded from view, will be the Center for the History 
of Art and the Humanities, the research facility for scholars. The buildings 
will be connected underground. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like taking away the hillside . . . and then rebuilding the hillside with 
buildings," Meier said. "When you perceive the Getty you (won't) see it as this 
monolithic object up there on top of the hill but rather as a series of small 
entities." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will be whisked to the top of the hill by an electric tram that will 
take four minutes to travel the three-quarter-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
Once they arrive at the museum -- five two-story clusters -- Meier wants them 
to have an experience quite unlike what they get at the Museum of Contemporary 
Art or the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Most museums tend to be "hermetically sealed" and disorienting, he believes, 
but in Brentwood, as at the Getty Museum in Malibu, visitors will not simply be 
"looking at painting after painting after painting" but will travel back and 
forth between the courtyards, gardens and galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Such integration of building with landscape is something of a novelty for 
Meier, who, despite his professed admiration for Frank Lloyd Wright, is known 
for creating structures that "seem to stand free of the land," as architectural 
historian Esther McCoy put it. 
</P>
<P>
Describing his Douglas house in a wooded area of Northern Michigan, Meier once 
told an interviewer that it was "built as though dropped by helicopter, so that 
even the trees within six inches of its base haven't been touched." 
</P>
<P>
Emmet L. Wemple, who landscaped the Malibu facility, is in charge of the even 
more massive landscaping project in Brentwood, where thousands of trees and 
shrubs are being planted, with an emphasis wherever possible on such natural 
vegetation as chaparral, live oak and sycamore. Whether palm trees will be 
included is one of the questions still being debated, Wemple said. 
</P>
<P>
Meier, the kind of administrator who sees "every piece of paper" that enters or 
leaves his office, clearly intends to maintain control over the landscape 
design. But it will be Wemple's task to "make the kind of environment that I'm 
talking about happen," the architect said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the interiors, Meier and his staff are gathering information from Getty 
employees -- more than 600 people will work in Brentwood -- so they can 
painstakingly plan each space, giving the clients what they want while 
remaining true to the architectural vision. The details will not be final until 
next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To provide flexible conservation laboratories that will not quickly become 
obsolete, for example, Meier had to learn about the processes involved and 
anticipate technological developments, said Luis Monreal, director of the 
Getty's Conservation Institute, now temporarily located in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
What Meier came up with, Monreal said, are empty modular spaces -- almost like 
a theater -- "that can change as the technology changes." 
</P>
<P>
"He is not a compromiser," Monreal said. "He knows the things that are 
uncompromisable, if there is such a word, because they will be detrimental for 
the quality of his architecture." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Getty originally announced that construction of the project would 
begin in 1987, Meier is unperturbed by the delay. By his estimate, he said, the 
project was always slated to take 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with the neighbors and with the California Transportation 
Department, which owns much of the nearby land, have slowed the project, and 
original projections failed to take into account the period that the Getty 
would need to develop its programs, according to Rountree. 
</P>
<P>
Given the wealth of the Getty Trust, one might imagine that Meier is working 
with limitless funds, but Rountree maintains he is on a tight budget. As an 
economy measure, Rountree was forced to "shrink the entire project" by 10% to 
12% -- what he describes as a "Xerox reduction." 
</P>
<P>
Another cost-saving will come in not allowing Meier to design all of the 
furniture, as is his custom. "You'll see gallery benches designed by Richard 
Meier, but you won't see secretarial desks (and) you won't see your chair 
designed by Richard Meier," Rountree said. 
</P>
<P>
Told about Rountree's comment, Meier snapped, "Why is that?" Then he added, 
smiling: "We'll have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Involved as he is in the Getty project, it does not occupy all of Meier's 
attention. He is designing a museum of contemporary art in Barcelona, for 
example -- a very different task because the facility will be hemmed in by 
urban buildings. 
</P>
<P>
He was invited to compete for the design of a huge $1-billion library in Paris; 
the preliminary proposals are due in July. Though the size and cost of the 
library might seem to dwarf the Getty, Meier maintained that it will not be as 
important to Paris "as this institution will be to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Meier, who is divorced and the father of two young children, is also spending 
some of his time learning about Los Angeles, since he expects to keep his 
Westwood office open after the Getty is completed. 
</P>
<P>
He is continually exploring new neighborhoods -- Monterey Park was a recent 
discovery -- and was surprised to find that the movie industry is not as 
predominant as it seems from afar. He is puzzled that Los Angeles residents 
seem so preoccupied with fashionable restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing would be having a restaurant in a tent," he said. "When that 
location is no longer popular, you move on." 
</P>
<P>
He has brooded about whether the Getty Center should have been located in a 
less affluent area and has concluded that "by being where it is, the way you 
see Los Angeles . . . it belongs to the whole city." 
</P>
<P>
He has wondered why in Los Angeles, public buildings, such as museums, face so 
much resistance from neighborhood groups while commercial buildings seem to go 
up largely unchallenged. "You look out there at these monsters that change the 
city," he said, pointing out the window toward several skyscrapers on Wilshire 
Boulevard, "and somehow they don't have the same problems." 
</P>
<P>
He still believes, for example, that a white exterior would have been 
"appropriate in this climate." Banning it "seemed totally arbitrary to me," he 
said. But he has not given up entirely on his trademark white porcelain. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have it somewhere, inside the building. . . ," he said with a sly grin. 
"It will be like an Easter egg hunt. You'll have to search for it."

THE LOS ANGELES TEACHERS' STRIKE; 
</P>
<P>
IN PLAIN LANGUAGE, THESE 2 SEE STRIKE AS ANOTHER BARRIER

Odir Romero, 12, and his best friend, Hugo Ruiz, roamed aimlessly across the 
crowded playground at Le Conte Junior High School on Thursday morning, 
discussing the teachers' strike that has turned their school lives upside down. 
</P>
<P>
The boys, who immigrated to the United States less than a year ago, casually 
dodged balls and ballplayers as they ambled through basketball and volleyball 
courts, never breaking stride or losing the thread of their conversation. 
</P>
<P>
While more and more of their classmates are staying home each day the strike 
continues, these two keep showing up for class. Like the majority of this 
school's non-English speaking students, the boys share one overriding ambition 
-- they want to learn English. And strike or no strike, they plan to keep 
coming to school. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with the teachers' strike is that they're sacrificing us," said 
the Spanish-speaking Ruiz, 15, who arrived in the United States from Mexico 
five months ago. "My father says they should resolve their differences without 
going out on strike." 
</P>
<P>
"But you think they're going to give them the money they deserve just like 
that?" Romero, snapping his fingers, asked his friend. "No, hombre! (No, man). 
</P>
<P>
"I want to learn English fast," said Romero, who joined his mother in Los 
Angeles about 10 months ago from El Salvador. "The faster I learn, the faster 
I'll be able to communicate with people. When you don't speak English, 
sometimes you feel lonely." 
</P>
<P>
The boys said trying to learn through the strike has been frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents have taught me that the more you study, the better you do in life," 
Ruiz said. "I want to learn, but because of this strike, I can't." 
</P>
<P>
At one point Thursday, a voice over the public address system directed students 
in the schoolyard to pick up the day's attendance cards, take them from class 
to class and turn them in at the end of the day. The instructions are in 
English, but Romero headed straight to the tables where the cards are 
distributed. "I just follow everybody," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
The boy said he felt lost when he first arrived at Le Conte. 
</P>
<P>
"The school seemed so large," he recalled. "And I had never seen so many 
different people talking different languages." 
</P>
<P>
The two-story brick school in Hollywood boasts one of the city's most diverse 
student bodies. Although Le Conte's 1,500 students are predominantly Latino, 
Soviet Armenian and Asian, the school has counted 34 different native languages 
among its students. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I have friends from different countries and I know words in other 
languages," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
As they waited to go inside the school for their second-period class, the boys 
said they would have liked to have joined one of the informal basketball games. 
Instead, they sat on the bleachers watching several groups of Armenian 
youngsters play. Generally, they noted, the two ethnic groups play only among 
themselves. When they do play with each other, it often ends in a fight, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When the bell calling them to class finally rang, Romero and Ruiz went their 
separate ways, each headed for one of 10 English classes scheduled for 
non-English speakers. The boys miss their regular teachers, but said things 
have improved since the first day of the strike. That day, they spent most of 
the time watching cartoons and wandering around the schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother says that as long as some teachers are still teaching, I should keep 
coming to school, that learning a little is better than nothing," said Romero, 
whose mother works in a garment factory. "I want to know everything about life 
and to get a good job so that my mother and I don't have to live in such a 
limited way."

FDA ALLOWS DOCTOR TO CONTINUE TESTING ALZHEIMER'S DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. William K. Summers' controversial research into an experimental drug for 
Alzheimer's disease will be allowed to continue under an agreement worked out 
this month between the Arcadia psychiatrist and the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Summers must abide strictly by federal research rules that 
the FDA accused him of violating in his study, which concluded 2 1/2 years ago 
that the experimental drug THA had caused "dramatic" improvement in Alzheimer's 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Summers must personally conduct and supervise research activities 
that the FDA accused him of delegating to others. He also agreed, in a May 4 
letter to the FDA, to keep accurate patient records and not deviate from his 
approved research plan. 
</P>
<P>
"His problems were more in the areas of sloppiness and lack of understanding of 
exactly what is required in the conduct of a truly high-class, scientific 
study," Dr. Alan Lisook, chief of clinical investigations for the FDA, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Summers, however, insisted in an interview that the agreement with the agency 
contains nothing he has not already done. He said any perceived shortcomings in 
his work were mere technicalities and the conclusion of his study remains 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
"If they actually had anything, they would have gone the legal route," Summers 
said of the FDA, which began investigating him in 1987. He likened the 
investigation process to having been turned upside down and shaken until small 
change fell out of his pockets. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA in the agreement did not address the question of the effectiveness of 
the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Summers attracted the attention of the FDA in November, 1986, when he published 
in the New England Journal of Medicine a report stating that the drug, also 
known as tacrine, had improved memory function in 16 out of 17 patients Summers 
had studied. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lisook, the agency then embarked upon an audit of Summers' records 
because of the potential significance of his study. Word of his findings had 
attracted worldwide interest and set in motion a large, nationwide study of the 
drug, which is now under way. 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's, a progressive brain disorder that impairs thinking and behavior, 
is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. It affects 2.5 
million Americans, and there is no effective treatment or cure. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA investigation culminated in January, 1988, in a six-page letter 
accusing Summers of "repeatedly or deliberately" violating research rules by 
submitting false information, deviating from his study plan and failing to 
maintain adequate records. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the FDA accused Summers of failing to mention that 10 of 12 
subjects lived more than 2,000 miles away and were monitored largely by 
telephone. He had failed to provide evidence that he had actually conducted 
certain tests he claimed to have done, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA also said Summers had failed to account for about 6,250 capsules of the 
drug during a one-year period and had failed to follow federal rules requiring 
that all patients give their "informed consent" before participating in drug 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
In the new agreement, outlined in letters between the agency and Summers, 
Summers agreed to personally conduct various parts of the study -- a condition 
Lisook said was intended "to guard against excessive delegation to other 
people," including patients' relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Summers also agreed to adhere strictly to his study plan, keep accurate and 
adequate records, ensure that adequate records are kept, obtain the informed 
consent of patients and keep close track of distribution of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the request of the FDA, Summers has written to the New England Journal 
of Medicine clarifying aspects of his methodology that the agency felt he had 
misrepresented. That letter, approved by the agency, is to be published as a 
letter to the editor. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Summers insisted the agreement included nothing he 
was not already doing. He said that he sees all of his patients regularly and 
that any shortcomings in record-keeping were "within the range of error that is 
typical for this type of work." 
</P>
<P>
"What we did was human science," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
Only 11 of the 45 original patients in Summers' study remain on the drug, 
Summers said. Seven were asked to drop out for failure to abide by study rules. 
Of the others, about half have died and the other half have dropped out because 
their spouse or caretaker died.

CONSTRUCTION WORKER WINS $21.3 MILLION 
</P>

A construction worker who picked up five Lotto tickets while buying gas earlier 
this week has become the California Lottery's second-biggest single winner in 
the history of the popular game, lottery officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Layne Landry, a Riverside father of four, won the $21.3-million jackpot after 
correctly matching all six numbers drawn Wednesday night, lottery spokeswoman 
Joanne McNabb said. 
</P>
<P>
The winning numbers were 31, 33, 22, 10, 26 and 46, while the bonus number was 
37. 
</P>
<P>
Landry could not be reached for comment Thursday and told lottery officials 
that he did not want to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
But the owner of Fastrip Food Store, the Riverside gasoline and convenience 
market where Landry purchased five "quick pick" tickets just before 4 p.m. 
Monday, had plenty to say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'So, So Big' 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful, just wonderful," said Tim Feng, 50, who estimated that he 
sells about $30,000 worth of lottery tickets each month. "We had a $1-million 
winner a few years ago, but this is so, so big. I am happy and am sharing my 
happiness with my customers." 
</P>
<P>
Feng, who under lottery rules will receive one-half percent of the jackpot, or 
about $106,000, said he will give his employees 50% of his winnings. 
</P>
<P>
Feng said Landry apparently spent "his last $5 on a quick pick" after buying 
gas at the Arlington Avenue store. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that was a pretty good investment," said Feng, who plans to use his 
windfall to take a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The Lotto jackpot had been building since May 6, the last time a player 
correctly matched the numbers selected during a drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Landry's jackpot is the second largest ever captured by a single person. The 
highest Lotto prize snared by a solo player was $25.7 million, won by two 
Northern Californians who split winnings of $51.4 million June 4. 
</P>
<P>
California's largest jackpot was $61.98 million, which was won on Oct. 29 and 
divided among 41 people. 
</P>
<P>
Landry was not the only player reaping rewards from Wednesday's drawing. McNabb 
said there were six tickets that matched five of the six numbers plus the bonus 
number. Those tickets, worth $412,799 apiece, were sold in Oakland, 
Placerville, Redondo Beach, San Diego, Inglewood and Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there were 359 people who won $3,554 by matching five of the six 
numbers, 21,125 winners of $54 each who matched four of the six and 412,524 $5 
winners who picked three correct numbers. 
</P>
<P>
But hundreds of Southern Californians who thought that they had struck gold 
were disappointed after learning that a Los Angeles television station had 
broadcast the wrong set of numbers Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said KTTV Channel 11 accidentally aired the numbers chosen April 12 
during its broadcast Wednesday of the Los Angeles Dodgers game. KTTV 
interrupted the game soon after to explain the error and televise the correct 
numbers.

LEGISLATORS HOPING TO SPREAD AROUND $2.5-BILLION WINDFALL 
</P>

<P>
The general framework for a budget compromise emerged in the Capitol on 
Thursday as legislators sought to use part of the $2.5 billion in newly found 
revenues to avert proposed cuts in health and welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, the lion's share of the windfall would go to public schools 
and community colleges because of provisions of Proposition 98, the school 
spending initiative approved by voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance estimates that public schools and community colleges 
are now in line to get about $1.9 billion of the $2.5 billion, with about $350 
million available for taxpayer rebates and only about $250 million left to be 
divided up by the rest of state government. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said Thursday that is not enough because the governor's $47.8-billion 
budget includes $750 million in health and welfare cuts. Lawmakers are 
particularly incensed because the cuts are proposed at a time when medical 
trauma centers are closing around the state, mental health programs are 
faltering because of past budget cuts, welfare mothers are squeezed by rising 
rents and food costs, and the number of Californians unable to afford health 
care is growing. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on a possible budget compromise began almost immediately after 
Deukmejian announced the surprising windfall Wednesday. A group of legislators 
met Wednesday to discuss the possibility of suspending the voter-approved 
spending limit and Proposition 98 and another group met Thursday to discuss 
transportation budget issues. 
</P>
<P>
According to a well-informed source, a veteran of past budget wars who asked 
not to be identified, Republicans have embraced a plan first outlined by 
Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville) as their negotiating posture. 
Democrats said they are willing to listen and negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP plan would incorporate a desire by Democrats to limit the schools' 
share of the new money to 40%, or about $1 billion, and free up the rest for 
spending on other programs. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Republicans are going to insist that Democrats suspend automatic 
cost-of-living increases to welfare recipients, something first proposed by 
Deukmejian and immediately criticized by Democrats. GOP lawmakers also want 
Democrats to agree to Deukmejian's proposed transportation program, including a 
ballot measure asking voters to approve an immediate 5-cents-a-gallon increase 
in the gasoline tax, followed by four penny-a-year increases in the tax to a 
maximum of 9 cents. 
</P>
<P>
GOP legislators are willing to support efforts to suspend the voter-approved 
Gann spending limit, but in exchange they want Democrats to agree to a 
constitutional amendment that would require all future tax increases to be 
approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have said they favor a ballot measure to repeal a portion of the 
voter-approved spending limit and provide schools with the 40% split of the 
money -- but none of the other items on the GOP agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Both Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who have been negotiating directly with 
Deukmejian, said they are optimistic about reaching an agreement with 
Republicans. They said Republicans, particularly Deukmejian, have not taken an 
absolute position on any particular issue and appear open to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time this week, Roberti said he is willing to talk about 
suspending automatic cost-of-living increases on welfare and other government 
programs, something which he had never been willing to discuss before. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Roberti said the stakes were just too high not to negotiate. "It 
would be a crime not to do anything about the problem (of health program cuts) 
when we have this money available," the Senate Democratic leader said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Brown said Deukmejian has made what he considers an unprecedented 
effort to involve Democrats in negotiations. "It is clearly an open dialogue 
process that appears to be meaningful," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Assemblyman Baker, who came up with the original proposal, said, 
"I'm very optimistic that a compromise can be reached." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extremely Optimistic' 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Baker and other negotiators Thursday, Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar) also said he was "extremely optimistic." Katz added, "I've 
expressed optimism before, but this time I think something is going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
All parties to the negotiations cautioned that talks are still in their early 
stages and a formal agreement is far from certain.

MARCOS SUFFERS KIDNEY FAILURE; 'VERY CRITICAL'

Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos was in "very critical" 
condition Thursday, suffering from kidney, cardiac and pulmonary failure, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, 71, suffered acute renal failure and was taken to St. Francis Medical 
Center's operating room late Thursday morning for vascular access surgery, 
according to Gene Tiwanak, the hospital's assistant administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos also suffered cardiac and pulmonary failure, Tiwanak said. 
</P>
<P>
"The prognosis is very poor, and his condition is very critical," Tiwanak said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, who was undergoing kidney dialysis, suffered severe infection, 
including pneumonia, according to Dr. Azucena Ignacio, his personal physician 
and an internist at St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Receiving Medication 
</P>
<P>
Ignacio said Marcos was being treated with antibiotics and a heart medication, 
which she refused to name. 
</P>
<P>
"Some medications are working, some are not," Ignacio said. 
</P>
<P>
The Marcos family was informed of his worsening condition and that he was 
conscious before surgery and had been conscious on and off since, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2 3/4-hour surgical procedure, his veins were prepared for hemodialysis, 
or the removal of body wastes from his blood by machine, Tiwanak said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that his kidneys failed and we had to get him on dialysis 
quick," Tiwanak said. 
</P>
<P>
The deposed president, who is also suffering from pneumonia, was placed on 
dialysis in the hospital's intensive care unit, Tiwanak said. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure is not life-threatening, but the hours following the surgery were 
expected to be crucial, considering Marcos' frail health, the hospital 
administrator said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad had said Marcos had only a 2% chance 
of surviving the operation, but Tiwanak refused to comment on Marcos' 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos' wife, Imelda, was praying in the hospital chapel with son Ferdinand 
Jr., Trinidad said.

AMERICANS WORKING IN PANAMA TESTIFY TO NORIEGA HARASSMENT

American and Panamanian citizens have been beaten, threatened and held captive 
by Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega's government forces, witnesses told a 
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A parade of witnesses told of a mounting campaign of harassment against 
American employees of the Panama Canal Commission as political conditions in 
Panama have worsened. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Roy Dyson of the subcommittee on the Panama Canal noted that Noriega 
has become more abusive toward commission employees since the United States 
imposed sanctions on Panama last year after Noriega was indicted in Florida for 
drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Marohl, president of the international union of operating engineers, told 
the subcommittee that he was held for 14 hours in March and kicked and beaten 
repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Marohl said that while more U.S. troops have been sent to Panama, this did not 
offer much reassurance to commission employees since the soldiers remain in 
barracks. 
</P>
<P>
Panamanian forces have police jurisdiction in U.S. housing areas, and the 
committee was told that they harass commission employees going to work, school 
or shopping by stopping their cars.

ELECTION NO HELP TO ARGENTINE ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
PERONIST WINNER, INCUMBENT MEET, DISCUSS DEBT MISSION TO U.S.

<P>
Four days after the Peronist party's landslide election victory, Argentina slid 
closer to the economic abyss Thursday as the nation's currency plunged and the 
markets ignored pleas for calm. 
</P>
<P>
President-elect Carlos Saul Menem and President Raul Alfonsin of the ruling 
Radical Civic Union agreed in their first meeting since the election Sunday to 
work together to make the transition "the least traumatic possible." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to an atmosphere of inflation-fed anxiety, the government announced that 
utility rates, the price of gasoline and bus fares and other public service 
charges would be increased, effective today, by an average of 40% to bring them 
into line with soaring costs. 
</P>
<P>
Uncertain about what will happen between now and Dec. 10, when Menem is to take 
office, and what will happen afterward, many Argentines were converting their 
savings into dollars. The dollar, worth 16 australs in February and 106 on the 
Friday before the election, shot up 18.5% Thursday to close at 165 australs. 
</P>
<P>
Menem said after half an hour at Casa Rosada, the presidential palace, that he 
and Alfonsin had discussed sending a bipartisan delegation to the United States 
to try to renegotiate the foreign debt and arrange for fresh financing. 
</P>
<P>
Mired in its worst economic morass of the century -- this helped propel Menem 
to a 49% to 37% victory Sunday -- Argentina has made virtually no payments on 
its $60-billion debt in more than a year and is about $3 billion in arrears. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old president-elect avoided questions on what specific measures 
should be taken to stabilize the situation. He said that Alfonsin will be in 
charge until December and that the two parties cannot govern together. He and 
Alfonsin have both rejected suggestions that the interim period be shortened, 
although this is sure to be an issue in impending constitutional reform talks. 
</P>
<P>
The clear-cut outcome of the election had raised hopes of easing the tension 
that took hold in February, when Alfonsin's price and currency stabilization 
program collapsed and the economy went into a sharp decline. Many Argentines 
had worried that a close vote would lead to months of political wrangling, but 
the decisive Peronist victory gave Menem clear control in both houses of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the economic problems have quickly overcome the optimism. The inflation 
rate for May is officially expected to be 45%. Buying power has withered. 
Uncertainty has led producers to slow their output, and this has led retailers 
to limit some goods such as sugar to one or two packets to a customer. Some 
brands of aspirin and other medicines are not available. 
</P>
<P>
The Menem-Alfonsin meeting did nothing to calm turbulent markets, which resumed 
the violent swings that have characterized them since the stabilization plan 
fell apart. The stock market surged nearly 16% while short-term interest rates 
rose to an annualized 1,600% from 1,400% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Artana, an economist at a private research institute, said Menem needs 
to give some specific signals that he will attack the budget deficit, the 
principal cause of inflation, "to show that Peronism really has changed." 
</P>
<P>
"If Menem would say, 'We are going to attack the state deficit, we are going to 
send thus-and-such measures to Congress,' that would calm the situation," 
Artana said. "The people see that Alfonsin cannot govern, and Menem hasn't said 
what he is going to do, so the people are seeing a great uncertainty and are 
taking refuge in the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
Menem, a leader of the reformist wing of the worker-based Justicialist Party, 
as Peronism is officially called, has promised a pragmatic, modern approach to 
economic issues, based on pacts with business and labor to achieve a 
"productive revolution." 
</P>
<P>
He has acknowledged the need to reduce the state's domination of the economy, a 
legacy of the party's founder, Juan D. Peron, that goes back to the mid-1940s. 
Hapless government-owned businesses, such as the state oil company, run up 
multibillion-dollar deficits every year. 
</P>
<P>
Aware that the Radicals' economic failure contributed to his victory, Menem was 
clearly reluctant to share the blame for the government's handling of the 
economy before he takes office. 
</P>
<P>
Menem said he will visit the United States in the interim period, if a meeting 
can be arranged with President Bush. U.S. Ambassador Theodore E. Gildred met 
with Menem on Thursday and said he assured him of "the complete support of my 
government so that this country has every possibility of recovery." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to harsh U.S. criticism of Peronism in the past, the United States 
was neutral in the campaign. American officials said that what matters most is 
a free and democratic transition.

<P>
Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, who has been out of public view since the May 7 
elections and resulting violence led to international calls for his ouster, 
appeared before about 1,000 chanting supporters Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But the beaming Defense Forces chief, wearing a white tropical shirt and gray 
pants, did not respond to calls by the United States and the Organization of 
American States for him to give up control of Panama's government. 
</P>
<P>
He did not address the gathering. When reporters asked how many years he could 
continue in power, he laughed and said, "That's a good question." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega appeared at a rally called at the government's Atlapa Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
"The people united shall never be defeated!" and "Noriega, for sure, hit the 
Yankees hard!" chanted the general's admirers as he waved. 
</P>
<P>
The government nullified the presidential elections, which the opposition and 
government candidates both claimed to have won, after Noriega supporters beat 
up the opposition candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Official media said Thursday that the Organization of American States has 
neither the right nor authority to negotiate a change in Panama's government or 
Noriega's departure.

Yaacov Mishulan, who grows roses and grapes on a cooperative farm in 
north-central Israel, staggered toward the Mediterranean Sea near Caesarea in 
the hope that the tide and a handful of Valium he had swallowed would end the 
agony of heavy debt and humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
He never made it to the water. The overdose of Valium brought him down on the 
sandy beach, and passers-by got him to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But no such rescue is in sight for his debt, which totals about $300,000. 
Shunned by his neighbors and pursued by banks, Mishulan is in a downward spiral 
that threatens a livelihood he once held dear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Left Out on a Limb' 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when everyone pulled together," Mishulan, 43, said with a 
sigh recently in an interview at the home of watchful relatives. "Now it is 
every man for himself. And I was left out on a limb. I could not take it any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Israel's system of cooperative and collective farms -- moshavim and kibbutzim 
-- is threatened by a financial crisis swamping them with debt. At the same 
time, the socialist, all-for-one values that were the underpinnings of 
community life are fading rapidly in a society turning sharply to the right. 
</P>
<P>
The implications of the two fundamental changes in the farm landscape go beyond 
questions of planting and harvesting, however. The kibbutzim and moshavim had 
come to be identified with something basic in the Israeli character, a selfless 
pioneering spirit that had helped forge the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Their existence had been viewed as important to Israel's self-image, much in 
the way the family farm is in the United States, the ejido cooperative in 
Mexico, the commune in Maoist China. 
</P>
<P>
But the kibbutz and the moshav are facing a severe restructuring in order to 
survive. Utopian aspects of sharing and sacrificing are being replaced by 
individual decision-making and arrangements that encourage members to go it 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Israel's perestroika," observed Zeev Shabtai, referring to Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of political and economic 
restructuring. Shabtai, a longtime resident of the pioneering kibbutz of Beit 
Oren, near Haifa, added that "we are changing with the times." 
</P>
<P>
Yaron Ezrahi, a political theorist at Hebrew University, said: "The communal 
and cooperative styles of farming were based on persons who made extraordinary 
sacrifices for an ideal of nationhood. Their decline is an aspect of the 
country's ideological crisis, a lost sense of mission." 
</P>
<P>
Although only 4% of all Israelis live on kibbutzim or moshavim, they contribute 
more than twice that percentage to the nation's production. As emblems of the 
Jewish state, the farms have provided soldiers and civic leaders beyond their 
proportion of the population. 
</P>
<P>
Now, reports of strain on the farm are almost daily fare in Israeli newspapers. 
Not long ago, members of a cooperative in the north, angered that a bank had 
attached their income in order to collect on a debt, brought a cow into the 
local branch office and challenged the banker to take care of the animal 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
As economic conditions have worsened, members of moshavim and kibbutzim are 
fleeing to the city, leaving their debts behind. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they have tried to flee life itself. Mishulan's suicide attempt in 
February was the second in Aviel. The first, by an Auschwitz survivor and 
veteran of four Arab-Israeli wars, succeeded; the man hanged himself from a 
tree in his back yard. Like Mishulan, he had fallen in debt and felt that he 
had no prospect of getting out from under it. A member of a moshav near the 
Arab town of Tulkarm also killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
The debt crisis started in 1984, when the Israeli government began to make 
sharp changes in economic policy in order to curb inflation, which had reached 
1,000% a year. Among the changes were sharp and sudden increases in interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Billions Owed 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, overall debt has worsened. The 280 kibbutzim owe about $4.25 billion 
and the 420 moshavim about $1.5 billion, the government estimates. In both 
cases, the total debt is twice as high as in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The government and farm associations are now locked in tough negotiations on 
how to pay off -- or not pay off -- the debt. Farmers want the banks to cancel 
part of the debt, while the banks are asking the government to pick up their 
losses. The government, for its part, is urging members of the kibbutzim and 
moshavim to recover their solvency by altering a way of life built up over 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
The moshavim operate in loose federations that supply money for planting and 
provide marketing services after the harvest. Members took out debts 
individually, but the cooperative as a whole guaranteed repayment. But when 
Mishulan and other farmers fell into debt, associates who were better off 
balked at bailing him out. 
</P>
<P>
Mishulan, a rangy former dockworker who has farmed at Aviel for 10 years, 
complained: "I can't get a loan now. No one will give one to me. I can't plant 
without money." 
</P>
<P>
His slide into debt began with a loan to buy a tractor and was aggravated by a 
decision to build a new greenhouse for his roses, plus a new, two-story home 
for himself and his family. Remains of the projects have become monuments to 
Mishulan's declining condition: The tractor stands idle; a bare skeleton is all 
that is left of the greenhouse, and vines are growing over the half-finished 
shell of his home. 
</P>
<P>
As Mishulan realized that he could not get out of debt by himself, he turned to 
his fellow cooperative members for help. They turned their backs, ending a long 
relationship of mutual help at Aviel. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to socialize together, eat dinner at each other's houses, sit out in 
the yard and talk," he said. "Now, no one wants to see my face. People turn 
away if they see me on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever form the final resolution takes for moshavniks like Mishulan, it is 
clear that the era of mutual help is over. Many moshavim have already put an 
end to the tradition of sharing debts. They are splitting up into single-family 
farm holders in all but name. 
</P>
<P>
On the kibbutzim, problems are similar, but because of their tighter community 
structure the solutions may differ. About a fifth of the kibbutzim are 
considered to be in deep and chronic financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Born of socialist theories imported from Eastern Europe and Russia, the 
kibbutzim once had a purely egalitarian outlook. Wealth and poverty were shared 
equally. Children were boarded at schools outside the home to ensure a 
scientific, equal education. Work was assigned by centralized committees. Debt 
too was shared. 
</P>
<P>
"It was classical Marxism: From each according to his work, to each according 
to his needs," Shabtai said. "We believed that the best way to live was in a 
full community." 
</P>
<P>
Beit Oren, Shabtai's kibbutz, produces chickens and fruit and includes a small 
soldering shop and a guest house for visitors to the scenic mountaintop where 
it stands. 
</P>
<P>
Shabtai, 48, recalls the time when every question that came up was decided 
collectively. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't even have a cup that was different from your neighbor's," he 
said. "If we grew bananas, then everyone had to work the banana plantation." 
</P>
<P>
The debt of Beit Oren mounted in the 1980s, as some of its investments failed 
to pay off and interest rates soared. Communal decisions began to be questioned 
by maverick members. Investments that went wrong brought I-told-you-so 
complaints from the once closely knit members. 
</P>
<P>
Younger residents began to drift away, and Beit Oren appeared to be on the 
verge of collapse. Starting in 1984, the debt doubled to $6.5 million; the 
population shrank from 130 families to 60. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the moshavim, the kibbutzim take out loans as a community. Individuals 
who leave are not liable for the debt; it is as if they were employees of a 
business gone bust. 
</P>
<P>
Salvation for places like Beit Oren is seen in the form of change in the life 
of the kibbutz. In order to attract new members, ideals of pure equality have 
been shelved. Everyone contributes his pay to a central fund, and it is shared 
out in cash rather than goods, after kibbutz expenses are deducted. 
</P>
<P>
The debt problem remains intractable, and at Beit Oren the favored solution is 
cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not paying," Shabtai said. "The new members would not have come if they 
felt they would have to pay." 
</P>
<P>
Just how tolerant banks and government will be to such attitudes is not clear. 
Once, cooperative and communal farms were seen as the country's backbone, but 
that view has been changing. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1977, the Labor Party ruled at every level of Israel's political 
structure, and the farms were part and parcel of the party's socialist outlook. 
A kibbutz could always count on a helping hand. But after 1977, the rightist 
Likud Party began a string of electoral successes, in part as a result of 
preaching the value of an open economy with reduced government interference and 
subsidies and a greater emphasis on individual achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"The kibbutzim felt they were in harmony with an overall political mentality in 
the country," political theorist Ezrahi said. "There is now a discontinuity of 
that ideological link." 
</P>
<P>
Shabtai put it another way, "We once knew we could get government aid. Now we 
are sure of nothing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL'S COLLECTIVE FARMS 
</P>
<P>
Main types -- Kibbutz: originally, socialist-style communal farm; some now hire 
outside labor. Moshav: loose federation of farms; provides funds for planting 
and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Membership -- Total of 4% of Israelis on 280 kibbutzim and 420 moshavim. 
</P>
<P>
Debt -- $4.25 billion for kibbutzim, $1.5 billion for moshavim (estimated).

Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Thursday that he has obtained a "very 
large measure" of support from U.S. officials for his government's 
controversial proposal to hold elections among Palestinians in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a very large degree of understanding and a very large measure of 
agreement on the issues we discussed," Arens said after a 45-minute meeting 
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
Arens also said he has won backing for a three-way meeting involving President 
Bush and the leaders of Israel and Egypt, which is one of four elements of the 
peace plan approved by the Israeli Cabinet and Parliament earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a commitment of the Administration here to support . . . the 
entire initiative," Arens said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-way meeting of the governments that signed the 1978 Camp David 
Accords would be intended as a reaffirmation of that pact, which led to peace 
between Israel and Egypt. Other aspects of the Israeli plan include 
establishing normal relations between Israel and other Arab neighbors and an 
international effort to improve living conditions for Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
But a U.S. official, speaking on condition he not be named, said that while the 
Israeli plan had "promising possibilities, much work needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
The official also said that Baker told Arens the next step would be for Israel 
to start talks with Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Arens, who earlier in the day met with National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and plans to meet with Vice 
President Dan Quayle today, told reporters he did not discuss details of the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should get sidetracked . . . in talking about this or that 
detail," he said.

HUSSEIN ASSAILS ISRAEL'S PLAN FOR ARAB ELECTIONS

King Hussein on Thursday assailed Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan 
for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, calling it an attempt 
to buy time. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli proposal avoids "facing increasing world pressures to solve the 
(Palestinian) problem in a just and durable way," Hussein said. 
</P>
<P>
"My own suspicions are very much alive that Shamir and the Cabinet are really 
trying to find a way out of the situation they are facing and (to find) a way 
to waste time." 
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization leadership has already rejected the plan 
as a trick to usurp Palestinian rights and evade U.N. resolutions on Israeli 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Marka air base near Amman, Hussein said, "This (the PLO decision) 
is a Palestinian move, and I believe it is my duty and the duty of all our Arab 
brethren to support it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Many Concerns' 
</P>
<P>
"I have concerns, many concerns, but I think the Palestinian leadership is 
capable of expressing itself," he said in his first public comment on the 
proposal since it was endorsed by Israel's Knesset, or Parliament, on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the election of Palestinian representatives to negotiate 
limited self-rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinians would gain 
autonomy for five years, then negotiate control of the territories that Israel 
captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, essentially a revival of the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel 
and Egypt, also makes provision for talks with Jordan on a final settlement.

RABIN RULES OUT GOOD-WILL MOVE FOR PALESTINIANS

Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Thursday ruled out good-will gestures to 
improve conditions in the occupied territories and to encourage Palestinians to 
accept Israel's peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of a 10-day visit to the United States, Rabin said Israel 
is not now ready to release prisoners, reopen universities and public schools 
or take other measures to improve the climate as the uprising by Palestinians 
in the occupied lands stretches into its 18th month. 
</P>
<P>
"The present situation leaves no room for gestures," Rabin said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin specifically ruled out releasing large numbers of the 6,300 Palestinian 
security prisoners or reopening 11 Palestinian universities and colleges in the 
West Bank with a total enrollment of 17,000. They have been closed since 
February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He said two attempts were made to restart classes at 1,194 grade schools and 
high schools in the West Bank. But he said violent clashes immediately began 
between students and soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the schools were closed, there was a sharp reduction in the number of 
youngsters who were injured or worse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin suggested that Israel might be willing to show flexibility on the 
election participation of 140,000 East Jerusalem Arabs, international 
supervision and other unresolved questions about balloting if Palestinians 
first indicated agreement in principle to Israel's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"If there will be acceptance in principle of (the plan) by Palestinians in the 
territories, we can go on and tackle other problems which are related to the 
matter of elections," he said.

The officials said that Bennett had chosen Morris as his deputy director for 
supply, a position with responsibility for drug interdiction and law 
enforcement efforts. President Bush has not yet made the nomination official, 
but sources said that they see no obstacle to Morris' appointment. 
</P>

The 47-year-old official is credited with rejuvenating the Marshals Service, 
which he took over in 1983. He had served previously in the Justice Department

Robert Morris College -- its dormitories, classrooms, library, gym and 20 acres 
-- sold at auction Thursday for $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
The College Education Foundation, a nonprofit group of area businesses, made 
the only bid. If the college's trustees approve the sale, which is considered 
likely, the buyers want to find another school to take over the facilities. The 
two-year business school used to be based here but now has its main campus in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In December, school officials stunned Carthage residents with their decision to 
close the campus because of a deficit of $460,000. 
</P>
<P>
The school was one of largest employers in this city of 3,000. The college, 
which will close this summer, has about 370 students and 110 faculty and staff 
members.

The 56-year-old senator, daughter of former Republican presidential candidate

Kassebaum said her original qualms about a third term centered on whether any

STANFORD PRESIDENT BOWS TO DEMANDS, WILL INCREASE MINORITY FACULTY MEMBERS

Stanford President Donald Kennedy, faced with increasingly strident student 
demonstrations, announced Thursday that he will attempt to hire 30 minority 
faculty members within the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
But he stopped short of endorsing key demands of students, and recommendations 
of a 240-page report he commissioned, including a proposal that an ethnic 
studies course be made a graduation requirement and that financial aid programs 
be increased. He said he is studying all proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, speaking to the faculty in an annual report to the Academic Council, 
also said the university will attempt to increase minority enrollment in 
graduate programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We confirm that many minority issues and concerns are not the special 
pleadings of interest groups but are Stanford issues -- ones that should engage 
all of us," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
The report was released in April by a committee of 20 teachers, administrators 
and students who spent 18 months studying minority issues at Stanford. Kennedy 
asked for the study after complaints about the treatment of minorities on the 
13,000-student campus. 
</P>
<P>
The report made 120 recommendations, among them calls for the addition of 30 
minority faculty members to be hired in the next decade, a doubling of the 
number of minorities enrolled in doctoral studies, and the addition of an 
ethnic studies course to the graduation requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's speech followed a week of demonstrations by students who are 
demanding additional ethnic studies courses and minority teachers. In an action 
more characteristic of its cross-bay rival, UC Berkeley, students took over 
Kennedy's office on Monday. More than 50 were arrested. Stanford had not 
witnessed a take-over of the president's office since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"I fear that events of this week have wrought heavy damage and may have 
rekindled doubts among our friends as to whether we are a community dedicated 
to rational process and deserving of their respect," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said he will meet with students on Monday to discuss the issues. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said his speech was prepared before the student demonstrations and that 
he was not pressured by the actions. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the faculty is debating whether to make more explicit 
prohibitions against racial and sexual slurs by amending Stanford's so-called 
Fundamental Standard. The two-sentence standard says students can be expelled 
for failing to show "such respect for order, morality, personal honor and the 
rights of others as is demanded of good citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say that any expansion of the standard would infringe on freedom 
of speech. 
</P>
<P>
Racial incidents in the past year fueled the debate. In one, someone scrawled a 
racial epithet on a poster announcing a party at a black fraternity. In 
another, masked students held a vigil outside a predominantly minority 
dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
For all the negative attention that Stanford has gotten lately, the university 
in some ways has taken a lead in reaching out to minorities. Over criticism 
from such persons as former Education Secretary William Bennett, the university 
two years ago expanded its mandatory Western Culture course to include writings 
by women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
And although other universities have looked at campus race relations, 
Stanford's undertaking is unusually complete. A month after its release, the 
university continues to field an average of 35 requests a day for copies and 
may require a second printing. 
</P>
<P>
Although more than a third of the students are minorities, the report said that 
20 years after Stanford began targeting minorities for recruitment, its record 
is mediocre compared to other research universities, and fewer blacks and 
Latinos are enrolled now than in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Points to Areas of Ignorance 
</P>
<P>
The report also cited students' "widespread ignorance about the history and 
culture of American racial minorities." Most incoming white students, the 
products of upper-class rearing, have had little contact with minority or poor 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The report chided the university for not having Asian-American or American 
Indian courses, and for making "frustratingly slow" progress in the hiring of 
minority teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Camarillo, a history professor who chaired the group that prepared the 
report, said that while many departments have made concerted efforts to recruit 
minority faculty, others have not. And of 66 minority faculty members who were 
on the tenure track between 1978 and 1987, 25 resigned and another 16 were not 
promoted.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: TOW TRUCKS TO LOWER BOOM ON SCOFFLAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scofflaws beware. Starting in July, San Diego parking controllers will be armed 
with hand-sized computer gizmos. 
</P>
<P>
As they write you a parking ticket, they'll punch in your license number. If 
you have five or more unpaid tickets, lights will flash and a tow truck can be 
summoned. 
</P>
<P>
To reclaim your car, you'll have to pay your tickets, a late penalty and a 
towing fee. 
</P>
<P>
Unpaid tickets are serious fiscal stuff in San Diego: There are about 10,000 
vehicles with five or more tickets, totaling $3.6 million in fines and 
penalties. This in a city that is threatening to cut back on recreation 
programs and library hours for lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
To ease the shock, the City Council on Monday is set to designate June as 
Parking Citation Amnesty Month. Tickets can be paid at face value, with 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Along with eliminating the cumbersome need to lug around lengthy lists of 
repeat offenders, the computer system is seen as having another salutary 
effect: improving the morale of parking controllers. 
</P>
<P>
Next to being called meter maids, nothing bums out the scooter-riding 
controllers like knowing that a lot of their tickets are just a waste of paper. 
If all goes well, that will change.Vacations Born Again 
</P>
<P>
Christmas and Easter are making a comeback in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
A minister and a leader of a Christian political group petitioned the school 
board to scuttle a year-old policy of using the terms winter and spring 
vacation. The policy was meant to avoid any religious overtones. 
</P>
<P>
"If the schools can celebrate Halloween, which was originally a celebration of 
devils and witches, we see no reason that Christmas and Easter cannot be 
mentioned," said Helen Rocha, a school bus driver and leader in the Christian 
Voters League, which includes 300 families in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The board agreed, and the old terms will soon return.Back on the Map 
</P>
<P>
Update: Rand McNally will include Cardiff-by-the-Sea in its 1990 Road Atlas. 
</P>
<P>
After being dropped from the 1989 edition, Cardiff pleaded for reconsideration. 
To community activists, disappearing from the atlas is the civic equivalent of 
looking into the mirror and not seeing a reflection. 
</P>
<P>
The giant map maker relented after discovering that Cardiff has its own freeway 
signs and post office.Long Arm of the Bar 
</P>
<P>
Almost five years after the fact, former Poway city attorney Jean Leonard 
Harris has been publicly scolded by the California Supreme Court for an illegal 
land sale. 
</P>
<P>
Without comment, the court ordered Harris "publicly reproved," a punishment 
less severe than disbarment or suspension but more serious than a private 
scolding. He will also be required to pass an exam within a year. 
</P>
<P>
A referee for the State Bar, who investigated the case, had recommended that 
Harris be suspended from practicing law for 30 days. The justices rejected that 
suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was the $63,000-a-year attorney for a newly elected slow-growth council 
in the early 1980s when his private land dealings went sour. "Jean caught a bad 
case of real estate fever," says a former colleague. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the fever broke, Harris had resigned, and a real estate company he 
formed had filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded guilty in July, 1984 to a misdemeanor count (plea-bargained down 
from a felony) of selling a large chunk of land without telling the buyers it 
was heavily indebted and not cleared for development. He was put on probation 
and ordered to pay $49,528 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
His $15-million civil-rights suit against the district attorney was thrown out 
of court. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 50, has been city attorney for Rancho Mirage near Palm Springs for five 
years. In 1986 his legal past became an issue in a City Council election in 
Rancho Mirage, a fact that he blames for reheating the State Bar's interest in 
his case. 
</P>
<P>
"It disgusts me that it takes them that long to decide what to do," Harris 
said. "A lawyer really has no rights in the state of California in the way they 
can be dealt with by the State Bar. It's not fair that I have to keep reliving 
this thing."

RESTAURANT HAS ITS WORK CUT OUT IN SIGN SPAT WITH SOLANA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past couple of years, the folks at Coast Carbo Station, a Solana Beach 
eatery popular with local bodybuilders and triathletes, have livened up the 
sidewalk in front of the place with an amusing gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
Sketched on a piece of plywood is a cartoon of a muscle man and a bikini-clad 
woman, complete with cutout faces so passers-by can poke their heads in place 
and pretend they're a beach bombshell or the second coming of Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
Solana Beach city officials, however, have failed to get the joke. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a city code-enforcement officer tagged the restaurant for the 
portable billboard, saying it violates city sign laws and should be removed. 
The $100 citation irked the restaurant owners, Kevin Dodson and Charlie 
Terhune, who have vowed to fight City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The pair say they plan to argue their case in Vista Municipal Court when the 
citation goes before a judge in about a month, hoping to show that their 
humorous plywood cutout should not be hammered down by the law. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's just flexing their muscles and getting everyone upset," said 
Dodson, a weightlifting aficionado who has hardly had time to pump a barbell 
since opening the busy business three years ago. "I think it's really stupid. 
The city is in no way, shape or form showing any good faith or willingness to 
deal with the business community on this." 
</P>
<P>
Dodson contends that the plywood piece, which does not bear the restaurant's 
name, hardly constitutes a sign. But city officials maintain 
</P>
<P>
that the hand-painted billboard does indeed fit the legal description for 
sandwich boards and other portable signs, which are forbidden in Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Dan Hentschke acknowledges that he enjoys the humor of the plywood 
cutout, but argues that it conveys "an advertising message" because the buxom 
beach girl is holding a sandwich platter and the muscle man is balancing a 
shake on a flexed biceps. Nutritional shakes and deli sandwiches are prominent 
menu items at Coast Carbo Station. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the cutout qualifies as an attention-getting device intended to lure 
potential patrons to the lunch spot, much like pennants and whirligigs at a 
used-car lot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the attorney said he sees significant room for compromise, 
suggesting that the billboard might be allowed to stay if the milkshake were 
eliminated and the sandwich replaced by a beach ball, freeing the billboard of 
any hint of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maybe a Bolt Would Do 
</P>
<P>
Other city officials, meanwhile, have suggested that the sign be bolted to the 
ground so it qualifies as a permanent fixture. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think we can have a reasonable meeting of the minds," Hentschke 
said. "Obviously, the city has an interest in prohibiting the proliferation of 
sandwich-board signs, which can really clutter up an area and cause problems 
for pedestrians; but, on the other hand, we don't really want to infringe on 
anyone's freedom of artistic expression." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant owners, however, are in no mood for compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Dodson said he and Terhune got the idea for the billboard from a little oyster 
bar in Atlantic City. Since it was unveiled two years ago, their own sign has 
become something of a fixture on the landscape along the coast highway. 
</P>
<P>
About a month ago, however, a code-enforcement officer marched into Coast Carbo 
Station at the height of the lunch hour and, as befuddled employees and patrons 
looked on, wrote up a ticket for the plywood cutout as well as an illegal 
banner stretched across the restaurant out front, Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodson and Terhune were puzzled by the sudden crackdown. It seems that the 
city, two years after incorporating, finally got around to gearing up its sign 
enforcement effort, and the result was a rash of tickets and warnings for 
businesses throughout the community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What's the Attraction? 
</P>
<P>
As a show of good faith, Dodson and Terhune pulled in the banner and 
voluntarily removed a nonconforming pole sign, which they hope to eventually 
replace with something that meets city standards. 
</P>
<P>
But the restaurant owners flatly refused to pull in the cartoon billboard. As 
they see it, city officials are stretching things by saying the cutout 
qualifies as a sign. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't say, 'We have the coldest beer in town!' or 'C'mon in for today's 
special!' " Dodson said. "How can it be considered an attraction-gathering 
device?" 
</P>
<P>
He said that any subtle advertising message in the billboard is certainly less 
flagrant than the wine and beer labels emblazoned on umbrellas at alfresco 
eateries throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Dodson is loath to begin altering the cutout, arguing that simply 
eliminating the shake and sandwich would amount to tampering with the original 
work of the artist. Bolting it in place, meanwhile, would simply invite 
vandalism, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning, the billboard has been as much an attraction for people 
who don't patronize the business as for those who do, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When people are on vacation -- and this is a vacation community -- it's nice 
to have those little remembrances of your trip," Dodson said. "A day doesn't go 
by that people don't pose by it or come in and ask us to hold the camera for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents hold their babies so the head sticks out from the big guy. We've had 
three or four people send us Christmas cards that they made from here." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he figures the cartoon billboard's main benefit to his business is in 
providing his employees with a continual source of amusement as folks pose 
behind the bulging bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have fun watching people enjoy it all day long," Dodson said. "It's a 
riot."

HIGH COURT REFUSES TO BAR L.A. CITY HALL DISPLAY OF MENORAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday refused to bar the display of a Jewish 
menorah at Los Angeles City Hall, rejecting claims that the exhibit violated 
the constitutional separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without dissent, declined to hear a challenge by lawyers for the 
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California to a ruling last January 
by a state appeal court upholding the display. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's refusal to review the issue came in a brief order signed by 
Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas. Justice Joyce L. Kennard, who as an appellate 
judge at the time had joined in the January decision, did not participate in 
Thursday's action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Frankly Surprised' 
</P>
<P>
Carol A. Sobel, an attorney for the ACLU, said she was "frankly surprised" by 
the action and that the case may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. "We're 
disappointed but we certainly will continue to press this important issue," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel noted that the federal high court is set to rule by this summer in a 
similar case involving the display of a menorah at a government building in 
Pennsylvania. A ruling invalidating that exhibit could provide new grounds to 
challenge the display in Los Angeles, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the city, which had defended the display as constitutional, were 
not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in December, 1985, when Chabad, an Orthodox Jewish organization, 
obtained permission to display the menorah -- a Hanukkah candelabrum crafted in 
the 19th Century and kept for decades in a synagogue in Poland -- near a 
Christmas tree erected in the City Hall rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU sued to block the display, but both a Los Angeles Superior Court judge 
and the state Court of Appeal held that the exhibit did not promote religion 
and thus was constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal court, in an opinion by Appellate Justice Roger W. Boren, found that 
the display had a valid secular purpose, did not advance or inhibit religion 
and did not represent "excessive entanglement" of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
While the display had religious significance, it also served the "valid public 
purpose" of educating the public because it was once saved from destruction 
during the Nazi Holocaust, Boren pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
This display showed no more preference for Judaism than the Christmas tree 
showed for Christianity, the justice said. Further, Boren noted, its unimposing 
presence -- remaining unlit and in the corner of the rotunda -- was far less 
visible to the public than the lighted cross formed by City Hall windows that 
was barred by the state Supreme Court in a 1978 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU, appealing the decision to the state high court, argued that the 
menorah should be banned under both federal and state constitutions. The state, 
in particular, mandates "absolute" separation of government and religion and 
prohibits both the "fact and appearance" of any official endorsement of 
religion, the ACLU said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Significance Explained 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the city denied that the display promoted religion and noted that a 
sign had been placed near the exhibit, explaining the significance of the 
menorah and pointing out it had been rescued from the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
While the case has been in the courts, two political groups have been denied 
requests to erect displays in City Hall. Last month, city officials also 
refused to allow another organization to set up an exhibit celebrating atheism. 
</P>
<P>
In another action Thursday, the justices let stand a state appeal court ruling 
limiting the ability of authorities to confiscate deadly weapons in the 
possession of people who have been detained for mental examinations. 
</P>
<P>
An appellate panel in San Diego last February struck down a law that required 
such people, upon release, to obtain court approval before they could regain 
weapons taken away by police. The panel found that the requirement of going to 
court posed an unfair burden on property owners who were neither placed under 
arrest nor subject to civil commitment as dangerous to themselves or others. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was widely criticized by law enforcement officers as a threat to 
public safety.

BRADLEY'S LAWYERS FOCUS ON ROLE OF S&amp;L IN INVESTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

As Mayor Tom Bradley's lawyers sort through his tangled financial records, they 
are attempting to determine what role Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. and its 
vice chairman, Abraham Spiegel, may have played in the mayor's personal 
investment activities, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the mayor said Spiegel's office served as a conduit of 
information between Bradley and one of his stockbrokers. Another source 
identified the brokerage firm as Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as January, 1987, Spiegel's office corresponded with Bradley 
concerning the mayor's investment portfolio, the source close to the mayor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suggests Possible Advice 
</P>
<P>
This suggests that Spiegel may have provided Bradley with advice on personal 
investments just as his son, Columbia Chairman Thomas Spiegel, has acknowledged 
advising Assistant House Majority Leader Tony Coelho (D-Merced). Thomas Spiegel 
has said he recommended and helped finance an unusual purchase for Coelho of a 
$100,000 "junk bond" issued by Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills savings and loan and its top officers are being investigated 
in connection with Drexel's indicted junk bond king, Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Thursday that records of Bradley's investments with Drexel 
have been subpoenaed by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. The demand for 
the records is believed to be part of a broader inquiry by prosecutors into 
Drexel's relations with several politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia and Thomas Spiegel are under investigation by the U.S. attorney's 
office in Manhattan in connection with the allegedly illegal activities of 
Milken and Drexel. Thomas Spiegel said in an interview this week that he 
offered investment advice to a few public officials, whom he did not name. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham Spiegel has provided advice to at least one other Los Angeles elected 
official besides Bradley. County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said he purchased 
Columbia stock after it was recommended to him by Abraham Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
The source close to Bradley said Abraham Spiegel's office served as a conduit 
to the mayor on his investment in Columbia. It is not known if other stocks 
were involved. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Abraham Spiegel and Bradley regarding investments is 
among the subjects being reviewed by the mayor's lawyers, said Mark Fabiani, 
Bradley's legal counsel at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Asked specifically whether Abraham Spiegel may have passed any investment 
advice onto Bradley, Fabiani said: "That's part of the information being 
assembled." He would not provide any further details about how the lawyers are 
piecing together the mayor's financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia spokeswoman Lenore Hatch said Thursday that Abraham Spiegel was out of 
the country and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'20-Year Relationship' 
</P>
<P>
"Abraham Spiegel has had a 20-year relationship with the mayor," Hatch said. 
"We don't believe that anything inappropriate has been done. Beyond that, we 
can make no comment about the relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Faigen, a Shearson spokesman, said the firm does not comment on its 
customers "out of respect for people's privacy." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo said the council's 
Governmental Operations Committee is considering expanding its review of 
Bradley's financial affairs to include his relations with Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has already held two sessions dealing with City Atty. James K. 
Hahn's investigation into fees paid to Bradley by Far East National Bank and 
Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., both of which had dealings with the 
city. That investigation is expected to last several months. 
</P>
<P>
"The central question in all these matters is: Did the mayor use his capacity 
as mayor to benefit himself personally?" Woo said in an interview. "The 
disclosures about Drexel Burnham relate back to that central question." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley refused Thursday to discuss his investments or the subpoena of his 
records. 
</P>
<P>
"You've known for a long time that I have not taken any questions dealing with 
the inquiries that the city attorney and others are now engaged in," Bradley 
told reporters after a National League of Cities meeting on gang problems. 
"When that's over, I'll be glad to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Purchase in 1979 
</P>
<P>
Bradley first purchased Columbia Savings stock in 1979 and then obtained more 
stock in the thrift in 1984, according to his financial disclosure forms. In 
1986, he reported that his investment in Columbia exceeded $100,000 in value. 
After the stock market crash of October, 1987, Bradley reported in his most 
recent filings that he owned between $10,000 and $100,000 of Columbia stock. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley reports having a loan of at least $10,000 from Columbia Savings, and 
his longtime special assistant, William Elkins, has reported earning more than 
$10,000 annually in outside income as a Columbia director. Elkins also holds 
between $10,000 and $100,000 in Columbia stock. 
</P>
<P>
The Spiegel family, Columbia and its employees have contributed $53,130 to 
Bradley's political campaigns since 1983, records show. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and Abraham Spiegel have enjoyed a close personal relationship since 
Bradley was a city councilman in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel has been Bradley's "point man" in the Jewish community that is such an 
important part of his political and fund-raising base, said one Democrat, who 
is influential in Westside Jewish politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Abe Spiegel has taken Tom Bradley by the hand to all sorts of Jewish events I 
have been at," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel accompanied Bradley on a 1985 trade mission to Jerusalem, where Spiegel 
announced a $1.5-million donation to the Yad Vashem memorial for Jewish 
children killed in the holocaust. Bradley and Spiegel returned to Jerusalem in 
1987 to attend the dedication ceremony of the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley tentatively planned to join Spiegel on his current trip to Israel but 
backed out "some weeks ago," said Bill Chandler, the mayor's spokesman. 
Chandler said he characterized as mere speculation any suggestion that the 
mayor canceled his trip because of his sudden political troubles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plays Pivotal Role 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Spiegel was among several influential business leaders who played a 
pivotal role in persuading Bradley to reverse his opposition to Occidental 
Petroleum Corp.'s plan to drill for oil off Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
In Antonovich's case, the advice from Spiegel led the supervisor to purchase 
common stock in Columbia Savings in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him for some good investments, and I ended up investing in Columbia," 
Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Antonovich named Spiegel, whom he described as a longtime friend, as 
his representative to the county Board of Retirement. 
</P>
<P>
According to his statement of economic interests, Antonovich purchased between 
$10,001 and $100,000 of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan stock on May 31, 1985 and 
acquired more later. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next two years, Antonovich sold his Columbia stock because the trades 
turned out to be "poor long-term investments." 
</P>

<CORRECTION>
<P>
FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Friday that Columbia Savings &amp; Loan executive Abraham 
Spiegel was among several influential business leaders who played a pivotal 
role in 1985 in "persuading" Mayor Tom Bradley to reverse his opposition to 
Occidental Petroleum's proposed oil-drilling off Pacific Palisades. The 
assertion oversimplified material in a previous article in The Times, in which 
Spiegel was identified as one of several business leaders who supported the 
Occidental position. Friday's article was not meant to imply that Spiegel spoke 
directly to the mayor on the issue. The mayor said Friday that he made an 
independent judgment on the Occidental plan, and did not discuss it with 
Spiegel or any other business leader.

CARDINAL MANNING HAS CANCER OF THE SPINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cardinal Timothy Manning, 79, who retired as Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles 
four years ago, is suffering from cancer of the spine, it was announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The wiry, soft-spoken prelate -- who presided over the Los Angeles Archdiocese 
from 1970 to 1985 -- has been active in his retirement with no public hints of 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
Without identifying the ailment, the archdiocesan weekly newspaper told readers 
in today's issue for the first time that Manning is undergoing medical 
treatment and published a letter from Pope John Paul II extending his blessing. 
</P>
<P>
"Having learned of your present illness, I wish to assure you of my spiritual 
and affectionate union at this time," wrote the Pope in a letter dated April 
24. 
</P>
<P>
An archdiocesan spokesman said Manning has had at least 16 radiation treatments 
for cancer in his spine. The cardinal had asked chancery officials not to make 
an announcement before this week, said Bill Rivera, public affairs director. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, who lives at the Holy Family parish rectory in South Pasadena, was not 
available for interview late Thursday. But he acknowledged the concerns of 
associates in a short letter published in today's Tidings, the archdiocese's 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
"I am aware of the gathering anxiety among those I have served and loved for 
over a half century," Manning said, referring to his 55 years as a priest. "I 
am under the expert care of physicians who encourage the continuation of my 
ministry according to my abilities. I leave everything in the hands of the good 
Lord." 
</P>
<P>
Manning has frequently preached at clergy retreats and early this month 
conducted one for the bishops of Michigan and Ohio. This Sunday, he is 
scheduled to preside over the "Mary's Hour" devotional service in the Hollywood 
Bowl and give the homily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prayers Offered 
</P>
<P>
In calling on the archdiocese's estimated 3 million Catholics to keep the 
Irish-born prelate in their prayers, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony said no other 
priest or bishop has spanned as long a period of church growth in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Named an auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles in 1946, Manning was part of a 
chancery that rapidly expanded parishes and built schools in the post-World War 
II population explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Manning was appointed bishop of the Fresno diocese in 1967 but returned to Los 
Angeles two years later as coadjutor archbishop to Cardinal James Francis 
McIntyre. Manning succeeded the ultraconservative cardinal in January, 1970, 
while disputes still flared between the chancery and Latino activists, and 
reform-minded Catholic clergy, nuns and lay people were openly unhappy with the 
slow implementation of Second Vatican Council policies. 
</P>
<P>
In his 15-year tenure, Manning is credited with bringing a more open, 
conciliatory approach to problems. Manning, who was named a cardinal in 1973, 
submitted his resignation to the Pope before his 75th birthday on Oct. 15, 
1984, in keeping with Vatican policies. His successor, Mahony, was named eight 
months later.

SHERIFF'S SHARE OF $1.4-BILLION COUNTY BUDGET IS SHORT OF REQUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $1.4-billion San Diego County budget unveiled Thursday includes $109 million 
for the Sheriff's Department -- more than a 20% increase -- but nonetheless 
falls far short of the spending increase sought by Sheriff John Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
In his proposal, County Chief Administrative Officer Norman Hickey recommended 
that the department's budget be increased by $18,822,493 for the fiscal year 
starting July 1. That amount includes money for the salaries of 221 more 
employees, a new psychiatric unit at the women's County Jail at Las Colinas in 
Santee and about $4 million for operating the newly expanded Vista jail, which 
is scheduled to open July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy had wanted an increase of $31 million. At last year's budget hearings, 
Duffy vehemently opposed his allocation and underscored his protests by 
temporarily disbanding the sheriff's child abuse unit, claiming the department 
lacked adequate funding. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the Sheriff's Department has been harshly criticized by the 
county Grand Jury, the public and the press over conditions in the county's 
seven jails and the behavior of some of the jail deputies -- problems that 
Duffy, in past public statements, blamed directly on lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy was unavailable for comment Thursday. Sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Bob 
Takeshta said, "We're very pleased with the fact that our crime prevention unit 
is going to be fully funded, as well as additional dispatchers and the new 
internal affairs positions which were recommended by the Grand Jury." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Probably Ask More 
</P>
<P>
Takeshta said he had not spoken directly with Duffy regarding the budget, but 
expects that the Sheriff's staff will review the proposal and go before the 
Board of Supervisors to ask for more money. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant CAO David Janssen said he and Hickey met with Duffy on Wednesday to 
show him the proposed budget. Although Duffy expressed concern about lack of 
funding for medical staffing in the jails and for adding law enforcement 
personnel in unincorporated areas, Janssen said he expects "a positive budget 
relationship this year." 
</P>
<P>
Janssen said the sheriff and the Board of Supervisors are "particularly 
interested in coming to an agreement on standards in the jails and in law 
enforcement, so we don't have to fight about it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Susan Golding, in a morning press conference, 
was more direct in her assessment of Duffy's relationship with the county. 
Golding said that Duffy had employed "a great deal of rhetoric" to convince the 
public he was short of money, "when in fact his budget has received perhaps the 
most substantial increases of any." 
</P>
<P>
"The sheriff can use more money, and I believe that, but so can every other 
department," Golding said. "The entire social services and health area is more 
in need of funds." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, 55% of the total proposed budget has been set aside for health and 
social services. The health-services budget includes a $1.6-million increase in 
the contract the county has with UCSD Medical Center for the hospitalization 
and emergency treatment of indigent patients. There are also provisions for 13 
new employees in the Office of AIDS Coordination, and 37 more staffers to 
handle increased caseloads in foster care, general relief and Aid to Families 
With Dependent Children. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed budget, 33 more county employees will be hired to address 
growing environmental problems such as medical waste and asbestos in buildings, 
and 41 positions will be added to the planning and land-use department, which 
will manage the sensitive-lands program. 
</P>
<P>
Other budget provisions falling under the category of "public protection" 
include $2.3 million for construction of a medium-security jail and probation 
camp on Otay Mesa, scheduled for completion in 1991, and $1.1 million for 
expansion of Juvenile Hall. The budget also provides money for 13 more Superior 
Court judges, 12 Municipal Court judges and 15 new attorneys each for the 
district attorney and public defender. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the proposed budget is the largest in the county's 
history, up 12% from last year, Hickey described the county's financial outlook 
Thursday as "bleak and somber." 
</P>
<P>
Even with a balanced budget, as required by state law, the county will fall 
$185 million short in funding of necessary programs, Hickey said. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no money in the 1989-90 budget for increased medical services in 
the jails or for legal representation of juveniles in dependency cases, despite 
recent recommendations by the County Grand Jury to step up funding for both. 
Money for the County Medical Services program for medically indigent adults 
will be cut, and a juvenile detention camp for convicted youths may be closed 
if no more funding is found.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTHER CHARGED IN 2ND CHILD DROWNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mother charged with a misdemeanor in California four years ago after her 
daughter drowned in a pool has been arrested in Pensacola, Fla., after the 
drowning of a second child, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Key, 31, of Pomona, was arrested Wednesday and released on $15,000 bond 
after being charged with felony child neglect in the death this week of her 
2-year-old son, David. 
</P>
<P>
Key's lawyer, Bob Heath Jr. of Pensacola, said Key, who is in town visiting her 
mother, is scheduled to be arraigned June 8. He said his client plans to plead 
not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
David Key was playing in the back yard of his grandmother's home Saturday and 
threw a ball over a fence, according to the warrant. Key said that when she 
returned from retrieving the ball, she could not find her son. 
</P>
<P>
When she decided to go for a swim about 15 minutes later, she found the child 
face down in the pool. The boy was taken by helicopter to a hospital and died 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 9, 1985, Key's 2-year-old daughter, Laura Elizabeth Key, died in Lake 
Elsinore, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Heath said that Key faced a misdemeanor count in that case, although he was 
unsure of the precise charge.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA ENACTS BUILDING MORATORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica City Council has passed a 45-day moratorium on residential 
building permits in a 14-block area north of Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the North of Wilshire Residents Group told the council last week 
that their quality of life was deteriorating because of construction projects 
-- mostly condominiums -- that have brought traffic, noise, air pollution, dirt 
and litter to their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David Finkel, who originally proposed the ordinance, said the 
moratorium will allow the council to "stop (construction) for the time being, 
step back, take a breath of fresh air and let the staff do its work" in coming 
up with solutions to the problems of residents. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium prohibits the granting of residential construction permits, 
including hotels and motels, retroactive to April 28.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 26-YEAR TERM GIVEN IN GANG EXECUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gang member was sentenced Thursday to 26 years to life in state prison for 
murdering a man with a shotgun blast fired at point-blank range in the mistaken 
belief he was a member of a rival gang. 
</P>
<P>
Noe Alvarez, 18, convicted of first-degree murder Jan. 31, was sentenced in 
Compton Superior Court in the death of Henry Sao, 25. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said Sao was murdered Nov. 26, 1987, after he 
went to a beer party thrown by Alvarez and other members of his gang. 
</P>
<P>
Sao knew one of the people at the party, but was not a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Alvarez's gang accused Sao of being a rival gang member, then got 
him drunk and took him to the rear of a nearby liquor store. There they killed 
him with a single shotgun blast to the side of his head.

MEXICAN CONSUL JOINS TALKS ON MIGRANT WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The consul general of Mexico met with a cadre of North County leaders Thursday, 
showing the increasing concern by officials on both sides of the border over 
the growing tension between migrant workers and suburbanites. 
</P>
<P>
In a private home in Encinitas, Hermilo Lopez-Bassols told an assembly of 
county, state and legislative representatives that "bilateral cooperation" 
would be needed to finance housing for workers living in squalid conditions in 
North County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible for just one body of government to solve this problem," 
Lopez-Bassols said. "Solutions and money must come from my government, from 
Sacramento, from Washington, from the city and the community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Result of Growth 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly surrounded by the new subdivisions that are part of the North 
County development boom, migrant workers have retreated to their camps of 
plywood and cardboard hooches, creating pockets of poverty amid affluence. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of these workers contribute to the North County work force, often 
doing domestic labor for its residents, their living conditions have raised the 
ire of homeowners and many elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, angry residents have simply demanded the workers' removal. But, 
since many of them are now residing here legally under the federal amnesty law, 
such action is no longer a viable option. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like the Irish and other immigrants who have come here, so have these 
people," said Oceanside Councilwoman Melba Bishop. "They're here legally, and 
that makes them our responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Many regional leaders have criticized the amnesty law for allowing workers to 
stay in the United States while not providing any money to build housing for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Amnesty is a good idea, but for Congress to have passed it without 
</P>
<P>
enough money for housing was a mistake," said Gloria Valencia-Cothran, who 
deals with social-service issues for County Supervisor John MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia-Cothran and other local leaders asked that the consul general join 
their efforts to gain more housing money from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We need another voice," Valencia-Cothran said. "Congress has already heard 
from us. The consul general has access to Washington. He can serve as a 
bullhorn to let them know about our problem."

TIME TO LIGHTEN UP AFTER WEEK OF GRAY DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Relief is in sight for Southern Californians suffering from weather blahs 
because of a succession of gray, overcast days and cool temperatures. It's 
supposed to be a "very nice weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist Patricia Cooper of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times, expects the improving trend to start today, with mostly sunny skies 
and warmer temperatures -- ranging from the upper 60s at the beaches to the 70s 
and 80s inland. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a few clouds, according to Cooper, but the marine layer will not 
be as deep, and that means clearing skies, at least through most of Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"By the first of next week, we can see more clouds across the area," Cooper 
said. "It's going to be a kind of brief respite, but it should be a very nice 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
The gray days that have aggravated sun lovers so much were the handiwork of a 
lingering low-pressure area that is now moving east into the Central Plains, 
making way for a high-pressure area over Southern California, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
What that means is that, whether you go to the beach, the mountains or desert 
this weekend, it should be nice. 
</P>
<P>
The only minor exception will be in the deserts, where gusty winds and blowing 
sand are expected today. The gusts are expected to be lighter on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists heading into the northern deserts and Owens Valley were advised 
Thursday to expect blowing sand and winds up to 45 m.p.h. Drivers of campers 
and trailers were warned to use extra caution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low-Pressure Front 
</P>
<P>
The winds were being whipped up by a low-pressure front extending from the 
northern Rockies to Nevada and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Those heading to Nevada for the weekend can expect temperatures at night to 
drop to freezing in some protected areas in the north. 
</P>
<P>
Stay-at-homes can expect lows in the 50s and low 60s in the coastal areas of 
Southern California, with temperatures dropping into the mid-30s to mid-40s in 
the mountains at night. 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area weekend travelers can expect mostly sunny skies with highs ranging 
from the upper 60s to near 80.

STATE HIGH COURT REFUSES TO REINSTATE VOIDED LA MESA GUN-SEIZURE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court refused Thursday to reinstate a law that allowed police 
to seize guns and other weapons from people who are being held for mental 
examinations. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day that the Legislature voted final passage of a law virtually 
banning the sale of semiautomatic weapons, the court left intact a lower-court 
ruling declaring the state gun-seizure law unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
In a case from San Diego County, the 4th District Court of Appeal said the law 
is invalid because it required the gun owner to go to court to seek return of 
the weapon, rather than providing automatically for an administrative hearing 
soon after the seizure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appealed by La Mesa 
</P>
<P>
The court did not forbid the confiscation of guns from people apparently 
suffering from mental illness, but struck down the only state law on the books 
that provides for weapons seizure. As a result, the practice will not be 
allowed in California until a new law is passed that complies with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Only Justice Stanley Mosk voted to grant a hearing to the city of La Mesa, 
which had appealed the lower-court decision. Four votes are needed for a 
hearing by the seven-member court. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which dated from 1986, allowed police to confiscate deadly weapons 
from a person being detained for a psychiatric examination. 
</P>
<P>
The law said the weapons would not be returned without a Superior Court order 
and left it to the owner to seek the order. Under the previous seizure law, the 
weapons were returned within 30 days unless police could show at an 
administrative hearing why they should remain confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
The case began when Kathleen Bryte, a registered nurse and a psychiatric 
outpatient at Grossmont Hospital, called police to her La Mesa motel room to 
report a burglary. They arrived, decided she needed a mental examination, and 
found four rifles, a shotgun, a handgun and a knife in the room. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sued to Recover Weapons 
</P>
<P>
Bryte was examined at a hospital, found not to be dangerous, and released. She 
asked for the return of her weapons, which were worth about $2,700, and was 
refused, so she went to court and sued successfully to get them back. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal court, in a 3-0 ruling, said Bryte should not have had to file suit 
to get her property back. 
</P>
<P>
"A person's property may not be confiscated by the state without some kind of 
notice and opportunity to be heard," said Justice Charles Froehlich, citing a 
U. S. Supreme Court ruling. He said that, in unusual cases, the hearing can be 
held after the seizure but that the burden of starting the process cannot be 
placed on the property owner. 
</P>
<P>
"The imposition of a requirement of affirmative action by the property owner, 
including the preparation of formal pleadings, the payment of a filing fee and 
subsequent participation in all the formal procedural devices of a Superior 
Court action, must be deemed unreasonable," Froehlich said. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, he said, even though the city was told soon after Bryte's 
detention that she posed no danger, it fought her attempts to recover her 
weapons at every step. The city had her case transferred to federal court and, 
after she got it transferred back, it required an evidentiary hearing even 
though it had no evidence to contradict her right to the property, Froehlich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the law, to be valid, must require an administrative hearing on the 
recovery of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Jay Bloom, whose office had asked the Supreme Court to 
reinstate the law, said the procedures required by the appellate court appear 
to be less protective of the property owner than the law that was struck down. 
</P>
<P>
"You would have more full-blown rights in a Superior Court hearing, as opposed 
to some sort of administrative hearing before a police chief" or other 
government official, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the city did not return a telephone call.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge issued a gag order Thursday barring attorneys and court personnel from 
talking to the press regarding the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud trial. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Earl Gilliam refused to discuss his reasons for the order 
after the court session Thursday, saying he is also covered by the gag order. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Marmaro, one of Hunter's attorneys, protested the gag order in court, 
saying it is unfair that the defense cannot air its side of the story to the 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
Marmaro told the judge the gag order is an "inappropriate restraint on the 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
But Gilliam responded that there is to be "no trying the case in the press." 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam expressed irritation at Assistant U. S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo on Thursday 
about some comments she made, but did not address the remark specifically. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the San Diego Union quoted Hugo as saying that the defense is 
"making a mountain out of a molehill and the judge is letting them." She was 
referring to a longstanding dispute between the prosecution and the defense 
attorneys, who allege that she is not turning over documents to them on time. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam said the order will last until after the jury returns its verdict in 
the case, which concerns Hunter's involvement in the scandal-tainted J. David 
&amp; Co. investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
The failed business was begun by Hoover's former lover, J. David (Jerry) 
Dominelli, who is serving a 20-year federal prison term for his part in the 
Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of $180 million. 
</P>
<P>
The order will also forbid court clerks and attorneys from disclosing whether 
the trial is in recess or in session, when the jury is deliberating or when a 
verdict has been reached.

Just as Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative Democrats were about to begin 
their annual slugfest over the budget, $2.5 billion fell out of the sky over 
Sacramento. The latest state tax windfall will not automatically solve the 
problems inherent in the governor's proposed $48-billion budget for the fiscal 
year starting July 1. But there's nothing like $2.5 billion to generate comity 
in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that the Republican governor pledged to work with the 
Legislature to allocate the funds to critical state programs, including 
California's deteriorating transportation system. The first step Deukmejian 
should take is to abandon his penny-wise, pound-foolish approach to balancing 
the budget with cuts in programs to help the aged, blind, disabled, the poor 
and the sick in California. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he and the lawmakers need to work their way around two voter-passed 
initiatives that ordinarily would prevent them from spending the found money on 
the state's most urgent needs. The unanticipated tax revenues normally could 
not be spent because they would push the budget over the Gann spending limits 
adopted by voter initiative in 1979. That restriction is even further 
complicated by Proposition 98 of last year. Under the proposition, 40% of the 
$2.5 billion would automatically go to education from kindergarten through the 
community colleges. The next $600 million also would go to schools, regardless 
of the Gann limit. Without changes in Gann, however, some might ultimately have 
to be returned to taxpayers rather than used to finance essential public 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature can suspend the Gann limit on a one-time basis. But one key to 
a reasonable allocation of the windfall will be negotiations with Bill Honig, 
the state superintendent of public instruction and the leading advocate of the 
Proposition 98 campaign. Honig already has indicated a willingness to 
compromise on a long-term reform of the Gann limit. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly education needs the money. But fairness dictates in this period of 
state budget crisis that reasonable amounts also go to prisons, health care, 
mental health, aid to the poor and elderly, local government, highway 
maintenance and other programs that Deukmejian had attempted to cut. 
</P>
<P>
State officials earlier announced that tax receipts for the current budget year 
were running $750 million above previous estimates. On Wednesday, the governor 
announced that the collections were running $1.1 billion higher for this fiscal 
year and $1.4 billion for the budget year starting July 1. The $1.4 billion 
would be just about the amount needed to maintain existing state programs, 
providing most of it did not automatically flow into the education fund. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the tax receipts are higher because the economy has been 
stronger than expected. But the administration had also used a conservative 
revenue estimate this year because of the volatility of tax receipts in recent 
years, caused in part by federal and state tax reform. In 1987, a surplus of 
more than $1 billion went back to taxpayers in refunds. Last year, tax receipts 
ran more than $1 billion below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
The new windfall presents California leaders with a happy opportunity to 
provide the state with a reasonable spending plan in the coming year, if past 
partisan differences can be overcome. That should be Sacramento's first 
priority. Next is a long-term solution to the budgeting restrictions imposed by 
the Gann limit and Proposition 98. And then, the governor and Legislature 
should try to iron out the quirks in the state tax system that are producing 
this feast-or-famine cycle of tax revenues.

BRADLEY: 'NOT YET ENOUGH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Only in L.A. -- The Mayor Is on the Firing Line but Draws 
Little Flak," by John Allswang, Op-Ed Page, May 11: 
</P>
<P>
Don't you ever believe the public is not very concerned about Bradley's 
activities. The flak comes from the silent majority of citizens who could never 
be heard through a newspaper which has supported the mayor all these years. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has been on the fence for so long, never taking a stance on any 
controversial issue, he should have many pickets. But alas, grinning Tom is 
finally having to say something about something. 
</P>
<P>
Why shouldn't his relationship with the business community and power structure 
be excellent, he is their man. And similar to the old Mayor Richard Daley 
regime in Chicago, everything slips quietly into operation before the public is 
aware. 
</P>
<P>
Low key, of course. A sure way of not broadcasting your "errors in judgment," 
or the fact that the mayor has taken "outside employment." Give us a break, 
Tom. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat and Republican politicians alike have a hands-off policy, not unlike 
House Speaker Jim Wright's dilemma, because of the "glass houses and stones" 
theory. I am one of the former locals who say "get him," Tom Bradley for 
starters, then get all of them. Vote out all incumbents who have even a faint 
smell of corruption.

BRADLEY: 'NOT YET ENOUGH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a fourth-generation Angeleno, I found Allswang's commentary on our mayor to 
be another deplorable example of a non-native's ignorantly myopic view of our 
all-too-complex city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bradley has earned the respect and admiration of all Angelenos, no matter 
their ethnic, economic, or political backgrounds. Over the years of his tenure 
many have (most often wrongly) questioned his decisions; the Olympics, Metro 
Rail, etc. However, no one in his right mind can question Bradley's honesty. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, I find it ludicrous that anyone who purports to know our city would 
want to see the confusion of New York or Chicago municipal politics rung down 
upon our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is not like any other city in the world. Its uniqueness is as 
difficult to define as it is to manage. Mayor Bradley more than any other mayor 
in this century has shown vision, courage, composure, and compassion as he has 
helped us all to live through our own urban evolution. No city is perfect; Los 
Angeles is proof enough of that. However, if Allswang would like a (New York 
City Mayor) Ed Koch or a Daley, I suggest he return to the city or state where 
he might better find that type of partisan prima donna.

CONTRA AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently President Bush and the Congress, dominated by the Democrats, agreed to 
provide $50 million in humanitarian help to the Nicaraguan Resistance, to see 
if the Sandinistas will really carry out the agreement signed in El Salvador, 
in which they promised to move forward the elections and to make them fully 
free. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas did not realize that the Bush Administration would make such an 
agreement with Congress; the Sandinistas thought that by just signing the 
accords, the Contras would be annihilated and that the promise of free 
elections would just be another fraud as many other promises that they never 
completed. The Sandinistas' headache is the Nicaraguan Resistance (Contras) and 
they know that they have to destroy them. 
</P>
<P>
We Nicaraguans living in the exile support the idea of keeping the Resistance 
alive because this gives us the hope that some day Nicaraguan families will be 
together again. It gives us the hope that some day we will go back to that land 
we love, to a free and democratic Nicaragua.

I have been reading about the anticipated closing of the county probation youth 
camps. As a physician, I have treated many young men who have been in these 
camps. Most have received quite a good education. 
</P>
<P>
May I note that in your editorial "A Modest Proposal" (May 3) you state that 
about 40% of the current state government revenue surplus must go to education 
due to Proposition 98. 
</P>

Why do the youth camps not qualify for education -- why can't Proposition 98 
money be applied to them?

ART TEACHER, DISTRICT STILL AT ODDS OVER INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A meeting between Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District officials, its 
insurer and art teacher Chizuko de Queiroz has failed to change battle lines in 
a dispute over whether on-the-job injuries prevent her from returning to the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Citing numerous claims filed against the district by de Queiroz for emotional 
and physical injuries suffered between 1983 and last December, the district and 
its insurer -- in a statement read at a Board of Education meeting Monday -- 
said "it is clear from the record" that she "is vulnerable to significant 
re-injury in her employment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ready to Return to Work' 
</P>
<P>
Despite de Queiroz's "representations that she is ready and willing to return 
to work" the statement continued, "medical experts (say) that this is not the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz was injured initially when she hurt her back, neck, shoulders and 
upper arms in 1983 while lifting 50-pound bags of sculpting material, and has 
aggravated that injury six times in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the district's insurer said in interviews Wednesday that her 
history of injuries compelled her removal from the classroom to prevent future 
injuries and claims. They said her medical history underscores the need to bar 
her from returning to work until she is retrained for another job or, if 
possible, her job is modified to accommodate her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
After an evaluation, a rehabilitation counselor would determine what type of 
work she could do. 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz, who has not been in her Palos Verdes High School classroom since 
she was told March 31 that she could not continue teaching, is as firm about 
her fitness to work as the district's insurer is dubious. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that she has learned to live with her disability, she said, "Now that I 
realize what I can do and what I can't do, this happens to me. All I can do is 
teach." 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Jack Price said the district removed her from the classroom on the advice 
of the self-insurance pool that covers the district -- along with seven other 
South Bay school systems -- in workers' compensation matters. Palos Verdes pays 
$600,000 a year to belong. "The district becomes liable, rather than the pool, 
if we don't follow the insurer's advice," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
The removal of de Queiroz, 57, from the classroom provoked an outcry on the 
Palos Verdes High campus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faculty, Students Petition 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 students have signed petitions since March asking that she be 
given back her job. A separate petition was signed by more than 70 faculty 
members, objecting to the "callous way" she was removed from her job and citing 
her "outstanding" accomplishments. She has been art department chairman at the 
high school since 1980, and a teacher in the district for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, the campus petitions generated several news stories in 
which she discussed aspects of her condition. The resulting publicity led the 
district, which previously had refused to comment on the case, to go public 
Monday and disclose more information about her medical and claims history. The 
four-page statement was written by the insurer. 
</P>
<P>
The release of details of de Queiroz's medical history was blasted Wednesday by 
one of de Queiroz's lawyers, who called it an invasion of her privacy and a 
breach of confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
John Huerta, a Pasadena lawyer, termed that and her removal from the classroom 
"retaliation because she filed workers' compensation claims." 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz said that she had hoped the dispute could be resolved in a closed 
meeting Monday with the school board, the insurers and attorneys for both 
sides. The meeting was held prior to the public school board session. Price 
said the closed session was held "to let her tell her side of the story to the 
board." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
List of Claims 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz said she was upset by the meeting. She went into it thinking that 
all she needed to return to work was a medical release from the doctor who had 
examined her for the insurer May 11. Instead, she said, she was "hit" with the 
list of claims and the insurer's position that her history indicated she must 
undergo retraining. 
</P>
<P>
She has refused to do that. 
</P>
<P>
According to Price and Tom Blake, claims manager for the Tustin firm that 
manages the insurance pool, an injured employee works with a counselor who 
determines if the person's job may be modified to accommodate the injury. If 
this is not possible, the employee is retrained and placed in another job, 
preferably with the current employer. Disability retirement also is an option. 
</P>
<P>
According to the insurer's statement, de Queiroz has filed a total of eight 
claims with the district for physical and emotional injury. 
</P>
<P>
Two of these claims led to cases pending before state Workers' Compensation 
Appeals Board in Long Beach: a claim for emotional injury filed in 1988 that 
covers her entire employment with the district back to 1961, and a Dec. 7, 
1988, re-injury to the shoulder, back, neck and arms, and headaches. 
</P>
<P>
In the two appeals, she is seeking payment for medical expenses, as well as 
possible temporary and/or permanent disability benefits, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement also cites the April 28, 1983, injuries to the shoulder, neck, 
back and upper extremities that led to her removal from the classroom on March 
31. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disability Rating 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, she was awarded a 41 3/4% permanent disability rating and $25,819, 
which, she said, she has been receiving in monthly payments of $130. She said 
the money is used for household help to do tasks she is no longer able to 
perform because of her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Nezen, attorney for the insurance pool, said Wednesday that de Queiroz 
is not just a "dedicated, neat lady that everybody admires" but a litigant with 
two lawsuits against the district. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at possible expenses," he said. "There is a history of claims, 
through the current claim. We are concerned over re-injury. . . . There is no 
assurance they will not continue." 
</P>
<P>
He said the initial 1983 case cost insurers $59,138 in awards and legal fees 
and said, "We are facing expenses from the two pending claims." 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz, in a statement she wrote this week to set out her position, said 
she "had to bring suit against the district because when I have injured myself 
at work, the district recorded it as sickness and not as a job injury," 
complicating her efforts to win workers' compensation payments. When the 
district incorrectly records an injury, she said, a teacher can lose sick pay 
and is unable to document an on-the-job injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Take Action' 
</P>
<P>
Her statement said that to protect "one's rights, it appears that one has to 
take legal action against a group as powerful as the district and the school 
board, whose insensitive and uncaring actions can often be injurious" to their 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz said the pending appeal of the emotional injury claim stems from 
stress she felt in May, 1988, as she tried to stave off cuts in performing arts 
and visual arts programs at the high school. She thought she was having a heart 
attack and was hospitalized. "I had chest pains and could not breathe," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the district told her she could have no workers' compensation coverage 
for $500 in subsequent psychiatric bills and so she filed the stress claim in 
November, 1988. "I believe the stress was caused by unreasonable school 
administration and district dictates," her statement read. 
</P>
<P>
Though filed last year, that claim encompasses stress accumulated since she 
began working for the district in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz said the second appeal -- for injuries last Dec. 7 -- stems from a 
day she spent using a hand-held machine to cut mats used to mount and frame art 
work. As she went to her car, she said, she felt a pain in her arms and 
shoulders. That evening she could not move her arms, or use her arms and hands 
for several days. She had to have physical therapy and medication. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five Minor Injuries 
</P>
<P>
Prior to that injury, "I had been feeling really good and thought I was really 
well and all was fine with my body," she said in an interview Tuesday. "I was 
doing exercise, doing my physical therapy." 
</P>
<P>
She said earlier physical injury claims -- for five minor injuries for such 
things as shoulder and neck pain between 1985 and 1988 -- all stemmed from the 
injury incurred on April 28, 1983. The district's insurer accepted those 
claims, and paid medical expenses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The first physical injury, de Queiroz said, happened as she was lifting 
50-pound bags of materials and putting them in containers to make a solution 
used in stone sculpting. 
</P>
<P>
"I did this all the time," she said in the interview, "but this day as I was 
doing this, it felt like I was being knifed in the upper and lower shoulder. It 
was intense pain and I slumped to the floor. I felt like I was having a heart 
attack." She said she was taken to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Harbor 
City and missed two days of school. The claim was settled in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz contends that as a result of the injury last December, she has 
stopped carrying and lifting and heavy repetitive work. She has had two art 
assistants do the lifting for her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$43,000 Annual Salary 
</P>
<P>
"I know my limitations . . . what I can do and what I can't do," she said, 
adding that the insurers and the district should not look at numbers but "look 
at me as a human being." 
</P>
<P>
Price said de Queiroz is receiving her $43,000 annual salary until her sick 
leave runs out. He did not know when that would be. He said whether she can 
receive her full salary under workers' compensation depends on the resolution 
of her December, 1988, claim. 
</P>
<P>
The school district wants de Queiroz to enter a rehabilitation program 
conducted by a trained rehabilitation counselor through the workers' 
compensation board but so far, she has refused. 
</P>
<P>
"We are perfectly willing to consider any kind of workplace modification that 
would be acceptable to the vocational rehab people and that would allow her to 
return to work," Price said. But he said the district's "hands are tied" until 
de Queiroz agrees to work with a counselor. 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz said she does not require rehabilitation. She said she has already 
made modifications in her work, using student assistants, so she does not have 
to do tasks such as lifting that have led to re-injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retraining Recommended 
</P>
<P>
Price, however, said there "always have been promises (by her) that she could 
change, that she would no longer do these things, would use assistants. That 
didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
According to the insurer's statement read at the board meeting, Dr. Ray L. 
Craemer, a Torrance physician who has periodically examined de Queiroz since 
1983, recommended in February that she be retrained so she can avoid re-injury 
and greater disability. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Nezen said Wednesday that there is only a "slight possibility" that 
she can go back into her art classroom. But de Queiroz contends Craemer told 
her the district can make accommodations in the classroom that allow her to 
continue in her present job. 
</P>
<P>
Price said de Queiroz was sent to another doctor, Dr. Alan Roberts, "because of 
her insistence that she can do the job." He said Roberts' report is expected at 
the end of May and if he concludes she is fit to return to the classroom, she 
will be able to resume teaching. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Removed for Medical Reasons 
</P>
<P>
Price said the statement by the insurer was read at the Monday board meeting to 
show that de Queiroz was removed from the classroom for medical reasons and not 
-- as she and some of her supporters contend -- as retaliation for a dispute 
over the purchase of art supplies last year. 
</P>
<P>
Price said a clerical error resulted in the purchase of supplies from a 
retailer rather than a wholesaler, as de Queiroz recommended, resulted in an 
order for supplies costing the art department an additional $500. He said $276 
was put back into the high school's account in September after de Queiroz told 
the district of the error. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, she "got all upset" at a administrator-department head meeting in 
March, saying that even more should have been returned to the high school 
account. The balance, a total of $500, was subsequently returned to the 
account. 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz insists that none of the money was returned to the high school 
account until she insisted on it at a school meeting on March 14. Three days 
later, she said, "$523 was put back in the art budget" and a few days after 
that, she was told she could no longer teach. She contends her removal is a 
vindictive response to her criticism of the administrators.

SEAMEN BATTLE FOR FLOATING MUSEUM BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph B. Vernick knows a thing or two about war. More than 40 years ago, he 
served in the U.S. Merchant Marine, often braving enemy fire to ferry supplies 
and ammunition to his country's armed forces. When the Japanese torpedoed his 
ship, he was taken prisoner and was interned for three years at a camp in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
For four decades after World War II ended, Vernick and other merchant seamen 
lobbied the federal government to grant them status as veterans. They won that 
battle last year -- and Vernick, who lives in North Hollywood, finally received 
his prisoner of war medal just two months ago -- but their fight for 
recognition and respect isn't over. 
</P>
<P>
Today Vernick and the Long Beach-based U.S. Merchant Marine Veterans World War 
II, which he heads, find themselves battling a new adversary: the Los Angeles 
Harbor Department. 
</P>
<P>
Vernick's group is planning to convert a former cargo ship into a floating 
museum, a monument to their comrades who died at sea. The ship, the Lane 
Victory, is now at Suisun Bay, waiting to be towed to the Port of Los Angeles, 
where the seamen want to dock it at a berth in San Pedro, near the Los Angeles 
Maritime Museum and a statue that honors merchant seamen. 
</P>
<P>
But Harbor Department officials say that site, which houses a container cargo 
terminal at a time when demand for such space is high, is unavailable. They 
want the veterans to put their museum in Wilmington, but the seamen will have 
none of that. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to send us out somewhere where we'll never be heard of again," 
Vernick complained. "The people who made Los Angeles Harbor valuable are the 
Merchant Marine. . . . Through this harbor passed hundreds of thousands of 
troops. The least that we want is a central location for the vessel, which it 
deserves." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Ira Distenfield, president of the Los Angeles Board of Harbor 
Commissioners: "I am extremely supportive of them having the ship, and I'm also 
supportive of that ship being put on harbor property in a way that would give 
the community an opportunity to enjoy it. But we can't put it on property that 
has the ability to be rented for the purpose that it was entrusted to us." 
</P>
<P>
For the merchant seamen, getting the Lane Victory was a battle in itself, one 
that began in 1982. The seamen began seeking one of the Liberty ships, which 
were dubbed the workhorses of World War II. But they were refused by the U.S. 
Maritime Administration, which has jurisdiction over the nation's reserve 
fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the seamen settled on the Lane Victory, a 455-foot-long vessel that 
was built at Los Angeles Harbor in 1945 and used at the tail end of World War 
II and in later wars. U.S. Rep. Glenn Anderson (D-San Pedro) took up their 
cause and introduced legislation asking Congress to assign the ship to 
Vernick's group. Anderson's bill passed last year, and former President Reagan 
signed it into law last October. 
</P>
<P>
Since Congress gave its approval, the seamen -- who have waged their campaign 
from a cramped office on the fifth floor of the U.S. Post Office in Long Beach 
-- have concentrated on obtaining berths 87-89 at the Port of Los Angeles as a 
home for their floating museum. 
</P>
<P>
Those berths, which front a cargo terminal, have traditionally been rented by 
small or medium-sized shipping lines, according to Mark Richter, assistant 
director of property management for the port. The terminal, which includes a 
giant crane that lifts containerized cargo on and off ships, was recently 
vacated by its last tenant, Evergreen Marine Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But Richter said he knows of other potential tenants who are interested in the 
space. And, he said, the Harbor Department can hardly afford to relinquish the 
terminal at a time when it can barely handle the existing containerized 
shipping trade, not to mention what is projected for the future. 
</P>
<P>
The seamen, however, argue that the terminal should be abandoned because it is 
the only industrial site remaining on a stretch of waterfront that includes the 
port's World Cruise Center, Ports O' Call Village and the Cabrillo Marina. The 
San Pedro Peninsula Chamber of Commerce has also taken up this position. It 
sees the Lane Victory as a way to promote tourism and ease the traffic 
generated by the cargo terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"The ship would fit in well with what we're trying to do in the way of 
tourism," said the chamber's executive director, Leron Gubler. "You've got this 
shipping terminal right in the middle (of the west bank), which isolates the 
World Cruise Center from the rest of those activities." 
</P>
<P>
Replied Richter: "Our feeling is that we certainly have not committed the San 
Pedro waterfront exclusively to tourist and visitor activities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Sites Offered 
</P>
<P>
Richter said the port has offered the seamen space at two sites in Wilmington: 
one along the Cerritos Channel and another -- the more desirable -- at the foot 
of Avalon Boulevard, where the Harbor Department is planning a recreational and 
commercial complex for the residents of Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
Vernick, however, complained that the Avalon Boulevard site is years away from 
being completed and that the veterans, many of them senior citizens, are in no 
mood to wait. "Let's face it," said Vernick, who celebrates his 76th birthday 
today, "I want to see the ship down here before I kick the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
Vernick said he and his group plan to press elected officials for the San Pedro 
site, although it is unclear how much good this will do. Jeremiah Bresnahan, an 
Anderson aide, said the congressman is supportive of the seamen's plans to 
berth the Lane Victory in San Pedro but "realizes that the Harbor Department 
has its own concerns to take care of." 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the 
harbor district, said the councilwoman too would like to see the ship berthed 
near the Los Angeles Maritime Museum. "But it is really up to the port," the 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
And Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley -- who, the seamen bitterly complain, has yet 
to acknowledge an honorary membership they bestowed upon him last December -- 
wrote to Vernick last month to tell them that he is backing the Harbor 
Department's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Vernick and his fellow veterans, however, remain undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
Said John Smith, the vice president of the mariners organization: "We're 
fighters. We've been fighting for 45 years."

VOTERS TO DECIDE FATE OF LAWNDALE GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS AGUILAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council has unanimously agreed to let a citywide vote decide 
the fate of the General Plan, the document governing all zoning and development 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinance 82, a 26-year-old city law that permits residents to vote on the 
General Plan, will be placed on the Nov. 7 ballot. The law, which was adopted 
in 1963, was declared unconstitutional in a state attorney general's opinion in 
1974 and has never been implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the 1974 state ruling, the City Council adopted the city's first 
General Plan in 1976 without placing it before voters. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, at the urging of Lawndale activists Steve Mino and Herman 
Weinstein, city officials asked the state to re-evaluate the 1974 ruling. State 
officials reversed themselves last December, labeling the 1974 ruling 
"erroneous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Options Spelled Out 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 7 ballot, which will also list local school district candidates, will 
offer two, and possibly three, choices on Ordinance 82. 
</P>
<P>
One option is to repeal the ordinance. If voters choose that option, the power 
to approve the General Plan would remain with the City Council. The second 
option is to amend the ordinance, allowing residents to vote on major revisions 
to the General Plan. Ordinance 82 currently does not address revisions. 
</P>
<P>
The third option is to vote for the original 1976 General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
The council said it will further review the third option before deciding 
whether to place it on the ballot. City Atty. David J. Aleshire said it was 
uncertain how the third option would affect the status of Ordinance 82. The 
council also said it would further define what should be considered a major 
revision. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Carol Norman said she was relieved that the ordinance is 
finally going to be put to a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
"The council has never meant to keep control of the General Plan away from the 
public. We were just confused if they wanted (Ordinance 82) or not." 
</P>
<P>
Mino, present at the council meeting Wednesday, said he supported the citywide 
vote but was leery about the language of the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be satisfied when I make sure the ballot has clear, honest language on 
it," he said.

AMENDMENT TO BILL CALLS FOR SHIFTING PRISON SITE FROM L.A. TO CAMARILLO; 
</P>
<P>
ROOS PLAN IMPERILS AGREEMENT ON PLACEMENT OF NEW FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal in the state Legislature to shift a planned state prison from 
downtown Los Angeles to Camarillo State Hospital threatens to jeopardize a 
painstakingly negotiated bipartisan deal to build prisons in Los Angeles and 
Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), whose district includes 
Camarillo, charged that the proposal, an amendment to a prison construction 
bill, was a politically motivated attack on him. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock angrily accused the amendment's author, Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los 
Angeles), of engaging in "the cynical subversion of critical public policy to 
petty partisanship." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the location of a 1,450-bed maximum-security facility that will be 
used to process and screen inmates entering the crowded correctional system. 
Roos' proposal for the $148-million lockup, which includes converting the 
present psychiatric hospital to a prison, is certain to provoke heated 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
With no fanfare, Roos, the Assembly Speaker pro tem, introduced the amendment 
Wednesday to a prison construction bond measure, which was then passed by the 
Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Veto Promised 
</P>
<P>
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, who had reached agreement with the 
Democratic-led Legislature on the two Los Angeles County prisons in 1987 after 
long and bitter debate, promptly vowed to veto the amended bill. 
</P>
<P>
"It is contrary to the five-year-plus effort that we made to secure a prison 
site in Los Angeles County," said Kevin Brett, Deukmejian's press secretary. 
"It's contrary to the legislation that the governor signed in 1987. And if the 
legislation reached the governor's desk with this amendment in it, the governor 
would veto the bill." 
</P>
<P>
The measure would upset a delicate political balance that was achieved in 
legislation sponsored by Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), which included one 
prison in heavily Democratic, urban Los Angeles and another in 
Republican-dominated, suburban Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo is in overwhelmingly Republican Ventura County. Roos' amendment would 
thus put both prisons in Republican areas. 
</P>
<P>
Roos, who reluctantly voted in 1987 for siting a prison in Los Angeles, acted 
this week because a three-member state panel set up to determine the 
consequences of building the prison in Los Angeles rejected in April an 
environmental impact study for the proposed penitentiary, said his chief of 
staff, Richard Milner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Many Beds 
</P>
<P>
Milner said he had recommended the Camarillo site to Roos within the past 10 
days because studies have indicated that the state has too many psychiatric 
hospital beds and has considered closing the Camarillo facility in the past. 
Moreover, he said, part of the hospital might be converted to house mentally 
ill inmates, thereby meeting another pressing need. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Corrections, which strongly opposes Roos' amendment, 
plans to submit a revised environmental impact study for the Los Angeles prison 
by September and hopes to break ground for it by mid-1990, spokesman Tip Kindel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason to move," he added. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock, an outspoken conservative who has engaged in vitriolic sparring 
with the Assembly's Democratic leadership on gun control and other issues, said 
Roos was attacking him by proposing to locate the prison in his district. Such 
facilities generally incite intense opposition from nearby residents, placing 
elected representatives under great pressure. 
</P>
<P>
In a news release Thursday, McClintock included a transcript of a heated 
exchange between himself and Roos during an April 4 meeting of the Assembly 
Public Safety Committee. A McClintock aide subsequently played a tape recording 
of the dialogue for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
During the committee meeting, McClintock argued for construction of more 
prisons; Roos responded that the Democrats' priority was creation of economic 
and educational opportunities for the downtrodden. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco), the committee chairman, 
interjected: "Mr. Roos, as I understand it, you will support legislation to 
have a state correctional institution at Thousand Oaks?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Roos: "Absolutely! And watch him scream like a pig!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fulfilled That Threat' 
</P>
<P>
Now, McClintock said Thursday, Roos has "fulfilled that threat" with his 
amendment. While the proposed prison is in Camarillo rather than Thousand Oaks, 
both are within McClintock's district. 
</P>
<P>
"This action constitutes the very worst political gamesmanship imaginable and 
deserves the scorn and disgust of every Californian," McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
Milner said he did not believe that Roos' remark in the Public Safety Committee 
and his choice of Camarillo were linked. Nevertheless, he had some pointed 
words for McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
"McClintock has been going around saying we need more prisons," Milner said. 
"But as soon as you say you have to have a prison in his district, he gets all 
mad. If he's for more prisons, he ought to be able to say it's OK in his 
district." 
</P>
<P>
The prison bill, which calls for a measure on the 1990 ballot asking voter 
approval of bond sales to pay for prison construction, was passed by a Ways and 
Means subcommittee and the full committee Wednesday on partisan lines. 
Democrats voted for it; Republicans against it. 
</P>
<P>
It was sent to the full Assembly, which is expected to consider it in several 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funds Approved 
</P>
<P>
The funds for the prison that was to be built in Los Angeles have already been 
approved in a previous bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new legislation, which was sponsored by Assemblyman Willard H. Murray 
Jr. (D-Paramount), the Camarillo site would replace the original Los Angeles 
location near Boyle Heights, which Latino activists have intensely opposed, 
Milner said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancaster site, the second part of the 1987 compromise, would remain 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Milner acknowledged that the Democrats' priority is to keep a lockup out of Los 
Angeles, rather than to locate one in Camarillo.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: A REVAMPED VIC'S LIMITS CHOICES BUT WHAT REMAINS 
MERITS PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Nelson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vic's opened in late 1986 as one of the most ambitious restaurants in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
It was difficult to dislike Vic's style, which took a grand point of view and 
encompassed a formal decor, first-class service and a cuisine that emphasized 
large portions of carefully cooked, top-quality foods. 
</P>
<P>
All this came at a price, however, one so steep that Vic's deep booths were 
empty more often than not. Changes were made, including the departure of chef 
Jim Hill and a scaling back of the menu that allowed the restaurant to decrease 
prices considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Because these changes failed to generate sufficient business, Vic's recently 
underwent yet another metamorphosis and emerged with Jim Hill again in command 
of the kitchen and a new, even more-abbreviated menu that offers something for 
everyone -- as long as everyone has relatively circumscribed desires. The 
present, somewhat Spartan list limits itself to prime rib and 
rotisserie-broiled chicken, augmented by the four or five offerings mentioned 
on the daily specials sheet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Steakhouse Mood 
</P>
<P>
The new menu keeps Vic's more or less in the original all-American steakhouse 
mood -- except that steak, when it is offered, appears only on the specials 
list. Appetizers are hearty and simple; the choice includes oysters on the half 
shell, the redoubtable shrimp cocktail and, in a more conscious bow to San 
Diego sensibilities, shrimp in garlic butter. If two guests have an inclination 
to share, they should not be disappointed by the rack of baby back ribs, which 
cooks slowly to a nice tenderness under a glaze of sweet but sharp barbecue 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
All meals include a "spinning bowl" salad, a Gargantuan assortment of greens 
that the server whirls at the table in a salad bowl set in a larger bowl of 
crushed ice (this gesture is vaguely hokey, although it does ensure crisp 
greenery, and is in any case not done in the same spirit of phony elegance as 
the ridiculous chilled salad forks offered by some establishments). Musky 
Italian balsamic vinegar flavors the simple vinaigrette dressing -- even in a 
steakhouse, Chef Hill can not resist his attraction to nouvelle niceties -- and 
it suits quite well, although the salad could be moistened more generously. The 
option of an alternative soup would be welcome, though (in its early days, 
Vic's served a marvelous sweet potato soup). 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the new Vic's is an elaborate French rotisserie, and it is 
used for the preparation of virtually all the entrees. Lest the standing entree 
list of prime rib and chicken seem too austere, there is the option of a 
sampler plate that offers hefty servings of both. 
</P>
<P>
The chicken is the more interesting of the two because it soaks in olive oil 
spiced with cilantro and chipotle chilies before taking its place on the 
rotisserie. These flavoring agents add subtle notes to the chicken and give it 
more interest than the garden-variety bird. The cooking process is carried out 
with some care, and the flesh takes on that moist, toothsome quality peculiar 
to spit-roasted fowl. 
</P>
<P>
The prime rib, wheeled to the table on a closed cart and carved to order, also 
benefits from its sojourn on the rotisserie, and is appropriately tender. This 
cut of beef enjoys immense popularity, although it really seems much less 
interesting than steak. But Vic's spurs it along a bit with well-chosen 
seasonings, a splash of roasting juices and a spoonful of a particularly sharp 
and likable horseradish sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Both the chicken and the prime rib are automatically accompanied by mashed 
potatoes and gravy, another example of absence of choice that makes this menu 
seem too limited. A baked potato is available at an extra charge; the one 
sampled was notably undercooked. Other optional side dishes are creamed corn 
and creamed spinach, both traditional steakhouse fare. The creamed spinach, 
served in a portion that could have fed four, was nicely done and featured an 
unusual, sweet flavor accent that tasted as if it were derived from caramelized 
pearl onions. 
</P>
<P>
Hill is an accomplished chef, and he blossoms on his specials list, which 
recently included two fish and three meats. Where the standing menu seems 
almost self-consciously old-fashioned and plain, the specials tend a little 
toward modern fantasy and international contemporary cuisine -- broiled ahi, 
for example, was bedded on angel hair pasta and finished with a Thai-inspired 
sauce spiked with sesame, red pepper and ginger. Among the meats, Hill offered 
filet mignon in a sauce of Stilton cheese and Port wine, a dish that has gained 
much currency in San Diego in recent years, and broiled wild boar, always a 
rarity, in Sherry vinegar sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Another special, a rack of lamb in a thoroughly clever sauce of white wine, 
cream, sorrel and mint, showed the kitchen at the top of its form. Mint 
commonly seasons lamb, but to make the combination tart with sorrel and smooth 
with cream is a novel idea, and it made for an almost explosive taste. At 
$23.95, this dish, like most specials, was costly contrasted with the standing 
menu, which begins at $8.95 for the basic half chicken and at $14.95 for the 
smallest cut of prime rib. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert selection practices the same restraint as the rest of the menu, but 
an extravagant chocolate mousse concoction renders the preceding austerity 
moot. Surrounded by a chocolate cookie crust, the filling is so buttery as to 
be phenomenally, even fantastically, rich. A certain sort of chocolate melody 
seems to run through this dessert that is, in performance, quite seductive.

ALUMNI GIVE IN TO BURBANK SCHOOL OFFICIALS; 
</P>
<P>
CAST AGREES TO CLEAN UP 'GREASE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The school authorities apparently won again. 
</P>
<P>
Bowing to orders to clean up a production of the popular musical "Grease" at a 
Burbank high school tonight, members of an alumni cast said Thursday they 
agreed to eliminate "suggestive dancing, pelvic thrusts" and to tone down 
sexual lyrics and phrases. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the adult cast, all alumni of John Burroughs High School, had said 
previously that they would refuse to perform rather than make the changes. 
</P>
<P>
They complained that they had to fight the same battle eight years ago when 
they staged "Grease" as students, and that it was unreasonable to ask them to 
change the show just before the first performance. 
</P>
<P>
But school officials remained adamant, and they were in position to back up 
their demands. The stage is on school property, and $9,000 in student-body 
funds was used for props, sets and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
So Dana Anderson, supervisor of the production, said that the show must go on 
-- although grudgingly. 
</P>
<P>
"To the best of our ability, we will make the changes in the show that they 
have asked for," Anderson said. "I'm not happy about it, but our main concern 
is to have our show go on." 
</P>
<P>
The play tonight is being performed by two casts, alumni and current students, 
who will each stage one act. The joint performance is a benefit for a fund 
established in memory of the play's co-writer, Warren Casey, who died in 
November of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said that ticket demand had been high and that those planning to 
attend include Jim Jacobs, the play's co-author, and actress Olivia 
Newton-John, who starred in the film version. 
</P>
<P>
James Perino, deputy superintendent of instruction for the Burbank Unified 
School District, warned earlier this week that "Grease" would not go on if the 
cast did not tone down the show. He said the district had a responsibility to 
put on a tasteful production for general audiences. 
</P>
<P>
The musical comedy, a nostalgic tribute to the teen-agers of the 1950s, was one 
of the longest-running shows in Broadway history. School administrators 
objected to sexual language, to a part in a song in which a teen-age boy lies 
on the ground and thrusts his pelvis in the air and to a dance number in which 
a boy grabs a girl's breasts. 
</P>
<P>
The current Burroughs students performed a toned-down version of "Grease" last 
weekend and are scheduled to perform the entire show at a Saturday matinee. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the alumni cast would "try to keep" the demanded changes during 
performances on Saturday and next weekend, which raised the possibility of 
history repeating itself. 
</P>
<P>
When many in the same cast performed "Grease" as students eight years ago, 
district administrators also demanded that they change the show. 
</P>
<P>
And so they did. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the final performance.

MAN ACCUSED OF TAKING GUN INTO COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 27-year-old Pacoima man was arrested Thursday morning at the door of the San 
Fernando Courthouse after he tried to bring a loaded gun into the building, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Martinez Ortiz was carrying a .357 magnum wrapped in a black leather 
purse when he tried to enter the courthouse about 9:45 a.m. It is a felony to 
bring a loaded weapon into a courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Marshal Jimmy Garcia, who was conducting routine security checks at the 
front door, discovered the weapon when Ortiz allowed him to look in the 
handbag. 
</P>
<P>
When Garcia discovered the gun, Ortiz denied any knowledge of the weapon. He 
said the purse belonged to a female friend who was waiting in court for another 
friend's arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
A police check revealed that the weapon had been stolen. Ortiz will be charged 
with carrying a concealed weapon and possession of stolen property. He faces a 
maximum sentence of five years. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz was booked into the San Fernando Police Department and bail was set at 
$1,500.

2 HURT AS VEHICLE BECOMES IMPALED ON GUARDRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Jeep became impaled on a guardrail Thursday on California 138 in the Antelope 
Valley, injuring two people, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
At about 8 a.m., Gayle Swaim, 32, of Victorville, who was driving east in a 
truck, attempted to pass three other vehicles, crossed onto the shoulder to 
avoid an oncoming car and struck the guardrail end on, Highway Patrol Officer 
Scott McKnight said. The guardrail ran through Swaim's Jeep from end to end and 
ripped loose. The Jeep landed in a creek bed, still impaled by the rail, 
McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger, Ronald Raymond Leatz, 47, of Victorville, was airlifted to 
Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center, where he was in fair condition, 
hospital spokeswoman Frankie Richards said. Swaim was treated at the hospital 
for minor injuries and released, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident happened near 155th Street East, between Pearblossom and Llano.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL HIT OVER REFINERY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neighborhood leaders from southwest Carson accused City Council members Tuesday 
of subjecting residents to "environmental abuse" by not opposing a 
controversial project at the Fletcher Oil refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Post, spokeswoman for project opponents, charged that council members 
are too close to industry and fail to heed neighborhood concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher is building a $16-million vacuum distillation unit that will allow 
production of asphalt at the refinery, located between Figueroa and Main 
streets near the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Post said Fletcher's conditional use permit, approved by the city in 1978, has 
expired and the project cannot proceed until an environmental impact report is 
updated. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly appears that someone really screwed this one up," Post said. "If 
you have any integrity, fix this one and fix it fairly." 
</P>
<P>
She warned council members: "We can put you in office, and we can take you 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Another resident, Shaaron MacLeod, said the project will subject homeowners to 
"environmental abuse" by increasing pollution and noise. "We are saying no more 
in our back yard." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Councilwoman Vera Robles DeWitt volunteered to attend a South 
Coast Air Quality Management District meeting on May 31 to read a letter from 
the council questioning issuance of air quality permits for the project. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Glenn Watson also softened his previous position that the city had 
no basis for requiring Fletcher to do an updated environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"Fletcher may have not used the permit within the time required by law," Watson 
said. "If it lapsed, then I would have to re-examine the question."

ROBERTS HELPS GET PADRES UP TO SPEED; 
</P>
<P>
HIS PRESENCE ON BASES IS CAUSING EXCITEMENT -- AND RUNS

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It had been a couple of days since Mothers Day, but the topic was mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I know most mothers can't run very fast," Bip Roberts was saying 
Wednesday afternoon in the dugout of Montreal's Olympic Stadium. "But this one, 
well, she looked pretty big and mean. And she looked like she could move. I 
didn't want to take any chances." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts was talking about a day, maybe 15 years ago, on an Oakland playground. 
Roberts had been taunted by a bigger boy. 
</P>
<P>
Acting as he normally would under the circumstances, Roberts listened for a 
second, then walloped the kid. The kid started to cry. A big car then pulled 
up, and out rolled the kid's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"And here she comes after me, takes off like I don't know what," Roberts 
recalls. "And there I go." 
</P>
<P>
And it was at precisely that instant that Roberts came to a realization similar 
to one reached many years earlier by another tiny athlete, last name of Pan. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts realized he could fly. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned around, and she was gone," he said, although she wasn't gone, he was 
gone. "I realized, I had run so far so fast, the park was out of sight. And I 
thought to myself, hey, I can do this." 
</P>
<P>
After seven professional seasons, he is now sharing this insight with the rest 
of the National League. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, Bip Roberts can do that. He can run. He can run faster than any of his 
Padre teammates and perhaps as fast as anyone in the league. 
</P>
<P>
He can turn a dull game into an exciting one. Thus far, he has done that in six 
weeks worth of season. Into an otherwise mediocre 1989 beginning for the 
Padres, Roberts has come bursting out like, well, like a guy whose running 
style matches his nickname. What it lacks in definition, it makes up for in 
quickness. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, a 5-foot-7 infielder-outfielder who made the team this spring as a 
utility man and a surprise, has since been cast in the role of designated 
terror. In the Padres' first 42 games, Roberts was used as a pinch runner 10 
times. Three of those times, he stole a base. Three other times, he scored a 
run, twice moving from first or second base to score on simple hits that would 
score no others on this team. 
</P>
<P>
The five times Padre Manager Jack McKeon has allowed Roberts to start -- twice 
at second, twice in right field, once in left -- he has also responded with 
speed. He has three triples, second on the club and already one more than he 
had in all of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the fastest man on the team, and you are seeing what speed can do," said 
Tony Gwynn, who led the league in stolen bases with 17 in the team's first 42 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"Bip is our spark," said Greg Riddoch, the first base coach. "You can see it in 
his eyes when he runs down to first base to pinch run. He always wants to take 
off. You can tell he's tickled to death to be be here." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always that way. When Roberts was prematurely made the starting 
second baseman in 1986 following the abrupt departure of Alan Wiggins in 1985, 
his life became one of misery and worry. Although he hit a decent .253 that 
year, teammates found him cocky and unwilling to change bad habits, and he soon 
found himself on the bench. He spent all of 1987 and all but the last couple of 
weeks of 1988 in triple-A Las Vegas, lost behind Roberto Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed his future with the Padres was finished until this spring, when 
Roberts showed he can also play third base and the outfield. He also gave 
McKeon this idea that, heck, why not keep this fast guy around to replace Jack 
Clark or Carmelo Martinez if they reach base in the late innings? If speed is 
his best weapon, why not use just that? 
</P>
<P>
"We could see right away his value on this team," McKeon said. "A guy like 
that, so you don't play him every day, when you do play him, things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Take Monday in Montreal, where the Padres entered having lost five of their 
past six games and then found themselves trailing, 4-3, in the ninth. After 
pinch hitter Tim Flannery hit a one-out single off Expo reliever Tim Burke, 
Roberts came on to run. 
</P>
<P>
Marvell Wynne then hit a soft single, but Roberts didn't stop running until he 
had reached third. From there he was able to score the tying run on Tony 
Gwynn's single to shallow center field, which might not have scored him from 
second. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't enough for Roberts just to tie the game. Two innings later, he 
drew a one-out walk on four consecutive pitches from Andy McGaffigan, later 
apologizing for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys on other teams say I'm so small, it's hard to find my strike zone," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Four pitches later, Wynne doubled to right, and Roberts scored all the way from 
first with the go-ahead run. He didn't even need to slide. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Amos Otis (hitting coach), 'Did the outfielder bobble it, why did I 
get in so easily?' " Roberts recalled. "He just looked at me like, 'You don't 
know?' It was a nice feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I don't know how fast I am. You don't feel those things. Maybe you 
hear a little wind rushing through your helmet, but you don't feel being fast. 
You just run like anybody else runs." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts has obviously not been like any other Padre this year, even when he 
stops. He seems to be having more fun. He is often one of the first ones at the 
park, one of the first to sit on the bench and watch the opponents take batting 
practice and certainly one of the only ones to openly dance to pre-game music. 
</P>
<P>
"You bet I'm having fun," Roberts said. "You spend a couple of years thinking 
you're out of baseball, you'd have fun too." 
</P>
<P>
Even if, to this day, people still mishandle his nickname, given to him by an 
uncle in memory of a cartoon character. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon still calls Leon Roberts "Biff." A New York newspaper recently referred 
to him as "Dip." 
</P>
<P>
And then there was his little weekend first-base visit with the Mets' Keith 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"He turns to me and says, 'How are you doing, Biff?' " Roberts remembered. "I 
turned to him and said, 'Fine, Keef.' " 
</P>
<P>
Quick, this kid. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Joey Cora, the Padres' 1987 Opening Day second base prospect who had recently 
fallen on hard times, fell a little further when he suffered ligament damage in 
his right ankle May 14 while rounding second base for triple-A Las Vegas in a 
game in Vancouver. He will have surgery and probably will miss 6-8 weeks. At 
the time, Cora was hitting .294 and leading the Stars with 12 stolen bases. . . 
. Another former Padre starter, pitcher Eric Nolte, struggled for Las Vegas in 
his first two outings after recovering from an ulcer that required surgery 
during spring training. In his first start he allowed four runs in 4 1/3 
innings, and in his second he allowed six runs in 4 2/3 innings. . . . 
Outfielder Thomas Howard, a top outfield prospect who went backward last season 
and finished at double-A Wichita after starting at Las Vegas, finally seems to 
be putting it together for Las Vegas this season. In early May, the 
switch-hitter reeled off a nine-game hitting streak to improve his average to 
.340, with 11 doubles and 11 stolen bases in 37 games. . . . Earlier this year, 
the Padres may have had a first in organization history -- two teammates whose 
brothers were also teammates in a different organization. Reliever Dave Leiper 
and outfielder Jerald Clark each had brothers playing for double-A London, 
Canada, in the Detroit Tiger organization. Philip Clark is a top catching 
prospect, and Tim Leiper is an outfielder who was recently recalled to triple-A 
Toledo. . . . All the stink about the Padre middle relievers should start 
easing up, considering their performance in the nine games played thus far on 
the trip. The middle men -- Leiper, Mark Grant and Greg Harris -- have allowed 
just three runs in eight appearances covering 23 1/3 innings.

SOCKERS ROUT SIDEKICKS, FORCE GAME 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recall, if you will, two seasons in Socker history: 1984-85 and 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the days when Branko Segota scored a total of 212 points, 106 in 
each. The years of Juli Veee and, for a season and a half, Steve Zungul, at the 
peak of his career. 
</P>
<P>
That's about how things looked in the first half of the Sockers' 7-2 victory in 
Game Six of the Major Indoor Soccer League semifinals at the San Diego Sports 
Arena Thursday night. It's also how things looked in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers and Sidekicks will now play Game 7 here Saturday night at 7:35 to 
determine who will go to the championship series. 
</P>
<P>
To midfielder Brian Quinn, the emotion of Thursday's game was reminiscent of 
last season, when the Sockers won their final seven playoff games to take the 
MISL championship. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were on the road, there wasn't as much emotion," Quinn said. "That's 
one of the main ingredients in championship soccer. I don't think we had it in 
Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
The goals on this night were artistic, good enough to be accompanied by 
classical music rather than the rock-and-roll that circulates through the arena 
through much of the game. The defense was alert, together. 
</P>
<P>
And Segota and Zungul looked fresh. Zungul looked particularly so while giving 
the Sockers a 2-0 lead with 14 seconds remaining in the first quarter. He took 
a pass from Quinn in the air, volleyed to himself and, with his back to the 
goal and defender Doc Lawson virtually stuck to his jersey, turned and drilled 
it past goalie Krys Sobieski. 
</P>
<P>
"Beautiful goal," Segota said. "It's one of the best goals you'll see in indoor 
soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Zungul said the team was inspired out of necessity. 
</P>
<P>
"We were put on the line, and we had to prove something to ourselves," he said. 
"Everybody was very disciplined tonight." 
</P>
<P>
His first goal fell between first-half goals by defender Kevin Crow and 
midfielder Waad Hirmez. Crow left defender Bruno Ferretti looking as if he were 
posing for a photograph; Hirmez capitalized on a rare Sidekick mistake, 
intercepting a pass from defender Mike Powers intended for Sobieski and 
punching it in. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief return to the form that cost them the past two games in Dallas, 
Segota -- the Segota of old -- took over in the fourth quarter. This is a guy 
who, hampered by an injured toe and a strained hamstring, was having trouble 
getting by defenders in Tuesday night's loss. 
</P>
<P>
But just when some of the 7,664 fans on hand had to be wondering if he had 
scored his last goal of the season, Segota pasted a left-footed shot that 
Sobieski wasn't able to touch. That made it 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two minutes later, Segota spun by Beto and slipped a shot off Lawson. 
Hirmez scored again late in the fourth period after Dallas put in a sixth 
attacker, and Zungul scored again with 13 seconds remaining to wrap the 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"Things haven't been working for me the last couple of games, playing with the 
aches and pains" Segota said. "When I scored the first goal, it was 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Though the Sockers looked much like the vintage Sockers during much of the 
first half, signs of the inconsistencies that have plagued them all season 
surfaced late in the second quarter and early in the third. Before halftime, 
Sidekick midfielder Kevin Smith advanced on Socker defender Paul Dougherty, who 
backed toward the goal. Smith took a shot with Dougherty still retreating; it 
wasn't much to look at but served its purpose, skipping past the Sockers' 
Victor Nogueira and into the left corner of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers' 3-1 halftime lead was shaved to 3-2 with 9:05 remaining in the 
third quarter when midfielder Michael King took a pass from Marcio Leite and 
scored his third goal of the series. 
</P>
<P>
And the Socker offense that had looked so bouncy early suddenly took a bit of a 
rest. They finished the third quarter with no goals and few "close but not 
quites." 
</P>
<P>
"We were very nervous at that time," Socker Coach Ron Newman said. "It was a 
poor second goal that we let in. I think Branko's (first) goal was critical for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
And critical for Dallas. The word from Tatu, the Sidekicks' leading scorer, is 
that this series is history.

CITY BASEBALL PLAYOFFS FACE QUICK DEATH IF STRIKE PERSISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Section's 4-A Division baseball playoffs appear dead unless the strike 
against the Los Angeles Unified School District is settled by Monday, according 
to City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness. 
</P>
<P>
Two wild-card games scheduled for today have been canceled and the City's 
athletic office likely will announce Monday a decision to scrap the rest of the 
playoffs because of a boycott by the 4-A coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland-El Camino Real and Birmingham-Gardena games scheduled for today 
were to determine the final two entrants in the 12-team 4-A bracket. Harkness 
said that those games will not be rescheduled even if the strike is ended by 
Monday, adding that El Camino Real and Gardena will advance to the first round 
-- if one is played -- based on better overall records. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness has ruled out the possibility of rescheduling the playoffs if the 
strike -- and boycott -- last past Wednesday, when the 4-A playoffs are 
supposed to begin. All coaches whose teams have qualified for the 4-A playoffs 
voted this week to boycott the season until the strike ends. Harkness said it 
seems unlikely that administrators will field teams without the coaches 
present. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my sense from most of the administrators I've talked with that nobody 
wants to get involved with fill-in coaches," he said. "It looks like the 4-A 
playoffs are in real jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
The Chatsworth administration rejected an appeal by players to field a team 
even if Coach Bob Lofrano continues to boycott. 
</P>
<P>
"Until I hear different from our supervisors, it is our position that if the 
coach of record is not present, we will not provide a substitute," Assistant 
Principal Roy Kawamoto said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches have taken their action despite a recommendation by the Los Angeles 
City Coaches Assn. that would allow coaches to continue to direct their teams 
after school while honoring picket lines. Postseason play in other spring 
sports -- such as golf, softball, swimming, track and volleyball -- have been 
unaffected by the strike. 
</P>
<P>
That fact rankles the parents of the Palisades High baseball team, according to 
Jeff Myrow, president of the school's athletic booster club. Myrow's group has 
persuaded Palisades to field a team despite the absence of Coach Russ Howard, 
and the group has embarked on a campaign to persuade other 4-A schools to 
follow suit. So far, only Palisades has committed to play.

CAL LUTHERAN OUSTED FROM SOFTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MIDLAND, Mich 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second consecutive season, Cal Lutheran has been eliminated in two 
games at the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics softball 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
The Regals committed five errors and suffered their first no-hit defeat in two 
seasons in losing a first-round game to Kearney (Neb.) State, 3-0, Thursday. 
Bloomfield (N.J.) College then ousted Cal Lutheran from the double-elimination 
tournament with a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
DeeAndra Pilkington (18-5), the first CLU player to be selected to the NAIA 
All-American team, had her streak of 25 consecutive scoreless innings snapped 
when she allowed an unearned run in the third inning of the first game. The 
Lady Antelopes (30-14) added two more unearned runs in the seventh on three Cal 
Lutheran errors. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I didn't wish we played a little better," Cal Lutheran Coach Wendy 
Beckemeyer said. "Five errors is very unlike us. 
</P>
<P>
"You just never know when you walk into a tournament like this who is going to 
walk out with it. We expected them to be tough, but I thought our team had the 
potential to beat them on our best day." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore right-hander Susan Johnson (22-7) of Kearney State struck out nine 
and walked one en route to a complete-game victory. She allowed only two Regal 
baserunners -- Pilkington, who reached base on an error in the first, and 
Danielle Piotrowski, who walked in the third. 
</P>
<P>
"Their pitcher was very strong, but I can't say she was tougher than any of the 
pitchers we faced on a Division II level," Beckemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Cal Lutheran (35-18) collected five singles and stranded 
six. Sophomore right-hander Leslie Stevens (12-6) gave up five hits and struck 
out five in suffering the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Patti Murphy tripled to right-center field with two out in the third and scored 
on Kelly Dockx's single to center for the Lady Deacons' only run. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman right-hander Pam Koller (23-2) struck out one and walked two en route 
to a complete-game victory. 
</P>
<P>
Beckemeyer, whose resignation became official Thursday, said that she was 
disappointed with the Regals' early exit from the tournament but pleased with 
their success this season. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look back on the entire season and not just the way it ended," 
Beckemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran advanced to the national tournament after winning its second 
consecutive District 3 title last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Regals were eliminated in two games in the national tournament last season, 
losing to Minnesota-Duluth, 6-2, and West Florida, 5-1.

SURPRISING HARBOR PITCHERS BOOST HOPES 
</P>

<P>
Bad pitching. It can prevent even the strongest-hitting ballclub from making 
the playoffs, as many thought it would do to Harbor's baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
But the Seahawks, veterans of postseason action, are in the Southern California 
Regional playoffs again after winning their fourth straight league crown. 
</P>
<P>
Under Coach Jim O'Brien, Harbor has won 10 conference championships and two 
state titles. This year the Seahawks cruised through the weak Southern 
California Athletic Conference (29-13, 18-2) and today at 3 p.m. face 
fourth-seeded Palomar (21-15-1, 18-6) in the the playoffs at Rancho Santiago 
College in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In order to advance to the state finals May 27-29 in Sacramento, fifth-seeded 
Harbor needs two victories in the double-elimination tournament, which includes 
Cypress and Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Going to Sacramento would exceed the Seahawks' expectations since they were 
labeled dark horses from the start. Harbor wasn't ranked in the state's 
preseason top 20 for the first time since O'Brien took over in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of several key starters played a role in that, but the main reason was 
pitching, or rather lack of it. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's forte has always been defense and pitching. However, before the season 
O'Brien learned that his two veteran hurlers, Jeff Hunter and Sky Lasowitz, 
wouldn't return because of injuries. Freshmen and three inexperienced 
sophomores would have to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching "was a big question mark at the beginning of the year," O'Brien said. 
"They were untested and very young. They made a lot of mistakes and they lacked 
confidence. It cost us a lot of games early in the year." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor pitching coach Tony Bloomfield said, "They came in with the ability to 
throw, but they just didn't have the ability to deal with pressure situations." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until Easter, a third of the way through the season, that Harbor's 
pitching prevailed. Experience and extra physical conditioning played a big 
part in the improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"They have about five pretty solid pitchers," said L.A. Mission Coach John 
Klitsner, whose team finished second in the SCAC. "They shut us down pretty 
well. Actually, they knocked us out real good. They beat us five times and good 
pitching was one of the main reasons." 
</P>
<P>
It's also why the Seahawks are in the playoffs, according to O'Brien. He says 
that without a variety of solid pitchers it's impossible to be successful in 
postseason games. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just have one great guy," he said. "You need a whole lot of guys 
that are pretty good to win these tournaments. You need five or six of them and 
you have to develop them along the way." 
</P>
<P>
In Harbor's case, there are six reliable pitchers on the staff. The three 
starters -- Pat Ahearne, Leonard Fletcher and Chris Garrett -- are within 
statistical range of one another. 
</P>
<P>
Ahearne, a freshman from St. Bernard High, is known for his sinking fastball. 
The 6-foot-3, 186-pound right-hander ended with a 6-1 SCAC record (9-4 overall) 
and a 3.71 earned-run average. Garrett (Westchester High), a transfer from San 
Diego State University, is known for his split-finger fastball and fielding. 
The 6-foot, 175-pound hurler has a 5-3 record and a 3.11 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
And Fletcher is the Seahawks' best breaking pitcher. The 6-foot-3, 177-pound 
sophomore from Banning High has a 4-1 record and a 3.21 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"Their pitching is definitely good enough to stop a good-hitting team," said 
East L.A. Coach Roger Lawson, whose team finished third in the SCAC. "They also 
have a lot of depth. They have a couple of good guys that they can put in the 
seventh and eighth inning and close the game." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's relievers are Robert Parga, Tom Fulkerson and John Ingram. Fulkerson 
(St. Bernard), the Seahawks' main stopper, has a 4-0 record (3.04 ERA) and 
Parga (Carson High) has a 3-2 record and a 2.84 ERA. The 6-foot-2, 170-pound 
right-hander pitched a no-hitter against Mission on March 30, which hadn't been 
done at Harbor since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"I think at first we just lacked experience," Parga said. "I know I made a lot 
of freshman mistakes. Now we're making better pitches and our conditioning is 
better, so we're lasting longer." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman outfielder Matt Nuez, Harbor's second leading batter, agrees. He says 
it was evident early in the season that Seahawk pitchers lacked determination. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like night and day," he said. "At the beginning most if not all 
(pitchers) were very shaky. We all noticed that they were a little unsure of 
themselves. Now they're so confident. You can tell by the way they carry 
themselves. Their mental attitude has improved a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks have four players batting over 300. Freshmen Ryan Karp (.390), 
Nuez (.382), Jonathan Lopez (.364) and Tony Liebsack have been forces at the 
plate most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Karp has 35 runs batted in, six home runs and 12 doubles, and Nuez has 34 RBIs. 
Sophomore third baseman Steve Kristy hit .333 and had 29 RBIs, five home runs 
and eight doubles before breaking his left hand in a game against Mission 
several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They just have a great overall team," Lawson said. I think they should win 
regionals and definitely get to Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
That was O'Brien's plan from the start, despite the brief letdown in pitching.

MIRA COSTA ADVANCES TO TITLE GAME IN VOLLEYBALL

<TEXT>
<P>
Mira Costa, the top-seeded volleyball team in the Southern Section 4-A 
playoffs, not only advanced easily Thursday night but proved Newport Harbor 
Coach Dan Glenn a prophet. 
</P>
<P>
Before the match-up at Corona del Mar, Glenn predicted that his team would lose 
if it could not extend the Mustangs to five games. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa barely broke a sweat in the semifinals, winning 15-5, 15-2 and 15-11 
and advancing to the Saturday night championship game against Corona del Mar at 
Marina High. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar beat Laguna Beach in three sets Thursday night to earn the right 
to play Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before the game that if we played just three sets and we played our 
best and they played their best, Mira Costa would win," Glenn said. "They just 
took us completely out of our game tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs started out quickly, applied a devastating knockout in the second 
set, then let their second- and third-string players secure the match in the 
third set. 
</P>
<P>
Only one Mira Costa starter saw action in the third and final set. 
</P>
<P>
"I am really, really delighted with the work of our so-called second team," 
said Mira Costa Coach Mike Cook, who is returning to the Southern Section 
championship game for the first time since 1987. "I was never going to take 
them out. It was their game to win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs led, 4-2, in the first set when senior Kevin Burd served five 
straight to extend the lead. Two sideouts later, David Swatik served three 
straight. Pat Ivie made the score 14-5, and Jason Stimpfig closed the game with 
an ace. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa fell behind, 1-0, in the second set but took a slim lead on Craig 
Adamoli's serves, one an ace. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs moved ahead, 6-1, but Newport Harbor cut one point off the lead 
before Stimpfig served nine straight points to give Mira Costa the game. 
</P>
<P>
Key plays in the runs were turned in by Adamoli and Zach Small, who teamed up 
for three key blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Newport Harbor) have a real scrappy team and had a history the whole 
year of not letting up," Cook said. "So the second game was real critical. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost one game to Santa Barbara (in the quarterfinal) 15-4, and we weren't 
going to let that happen again. Tonight we played really; the best we have all 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor regained some momentum against Mira Costa's second team in the 
third set and moved out to a 10-6 advantage. But the Mustangs, behind Canyon 
Ceman's serving, secured the match and the game with eight straight points to 
move to a 14-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later Greg Shankle's serve gave the Mustangs the win. 
</P>
<P>
"We served them tonight," Cook said. "The first time we played them (in the 
Redondo tournament) they beat us because our serve stunk. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight our serving was outstanding."

THEY TAKE BASEBALL SERIOUSLY IN EL SEGUNDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE VALENCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nestled between Los Angeles International Airport to the north, the ocean to 
the west and an oil refinery to the south lies El Segundo, a quaint little town 
that has become a baseball mecca. 
</P>
<P>
At the cornerstone of that mecca is El Segundo High Coach John Stevenson, who 
has compiled a 30-year record that the most successful major league managers 
would be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson, who played baseball and football at Redondo High and graduated from 
UCLA, has produced five CIF championship teams, three runners-up and 18 league 
champions while compiling a career record of 628-243. 
</P>
<P>
And the rich always find a way to get richer. 
</P>
<P>
In what was supposed to be a rebuilding year, the Eagles -- with only one 
starter from last year -- finished the season with a 22-5 record and earned the 
No. 2 seed for the CIF-Southern Section 2-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo, with a bye for today's opening round, will face the winner of 
today's game between Miraleste and Orange Lutheran on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're determined to win it every time we get in," said Stevenson, a day after 
his Eagles clinched the Camino Real League title with a thrilling 6-5, 
eight-inning victory over St. Bernard last week. 
</P>
<P>
So how does Stevenson produce championship teams and dominating players from a 
high school with a small enrollment of about 600 students? 
</P>
<P>
"This is a baseball town," said Stevenson. "The parents got baseball going 
here. They got together and started the Babe Ruth League, so when I got here, 
the talent was there and it was up to me to win. And we did, which helped my 
credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson, after playing backup catcher at UCLA and serving in the Navy, took 
over the El Segundo program with little coaching experience in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
"If I hadn't won right out of the gate, I would have been history," he said. 
"The people were very leery of me because, in their eyes, they had put all the 
effort into developing the kids. 
</P>
<P>
"As time went on, they accepted me." 
</P>
<P>
The community accepted him, and he in turn accepted them. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball is important to the community and to the players," he said. "When we 
play at Recreation Park, there are kids in the stands, and in their eyes, those 
players on the field will be them some day." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Cousins, a former El Segundo and minor-league player who has been 
assisting Stevenson for 14 years, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"All the little kids want to grow up and play for the Eagles," said Cousins, 
younger brother of American League umpire Derryl Cousins, also a former El 
Segundo and professional player. "They all wear one of our hats because there's 
a certain mystique to them." 
</P>
<P>
The most tangible evidence of the El Segundo mystique hangs from the walls of 
Stevenson's office. 
</P>
<P>
There are pictures of Kansas City Royals star George Brett, Kemer Brett, Scott 
McGregor, Mike McCready and John Brett, to name a few. All played at El Segundo 
before going on to professional ball. 
</P>
<P>
The El Segundo High record book lists 27 players who played professionally. 
</P>
<P>
There are pictures of the championship teams, such as the 1965 and 1966 teams 
that won back-to-back CIF championships. That success created a snowball 
effect, according to Stevenson, who said the former players are an inspiration 
to future players. 
</P>
<P>
"They is evidence that a dream can come true," said Stevenson, who is the El 
Segundo athletic director. "(Former stars) come around often and the kids can 
see that they are flesh and blood just like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cousins: "You can teach the kids things, but when it comes from a 
believable source, they do it." 
</P>
<P>
After enjoying so much success and accomplishing almost everything possible on 
the high school level, it seems only natural that Stevenson would aspire to 
coach elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But he dispels such thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"It has obviously crossed my mind," he said. "We win and we win big and you 
look to see if there is anything better. But I look ahead and see nothing but 
talent on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a supportive administration, we have a nice field and my son (Eric) is 
now going through the system, so why move? I'm not going to coach anywhere 
else." 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to understand why Stevenson feels so comfortable at El Segundo. The 
future looks bright, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' freshman team finished with a 22-0 record and the junior varsity 
team of sophomores and juniors lost the championship by only one game. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins, known as "Kooze" by his players, feels another reason for Stevenson's 
success over the years is continuity and his reluctance to stop teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"He's everywhere," Cousins said. "If you go to a baseball seminar or clinic, 
who do you think will be in the front row taking notes? John Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
"And even though I don't think we're very original in our coaching, what is 
innovative about him is he's constantly teaching and paying close attention to 
detail." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson also benefits from his involvement with American Legion baseball in 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's continuity," Cousins said. "He knows what's down there (on the freshman 
and junior varsity teams) and he knows his players." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the success, some of Stevenson's players feel a generation gap has 
developed between themselves and their veteran coach. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great coach," said junior catcher Garrett Quaintance. "But sometimes 
it's hard for him to relate to the players because things are different now 
than when he was young. If he would relate to us more personally, I think we'd 
play more as a team. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to play for him because I knew how good a coach he was, but 
sometimes I wish I had a younger coach that would let us speak our piece and 
let us give constructive criticism." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Stevenson, a reserve infielder and the coach's son, offered his opinion: 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I can get sick of him, but if I had to choose who would be my coach, 
I wouldn't have it any other way." 
</P>
<P>
"I think John does well with the kids," Cousins said. "He has to now that his 
kid is on the team and he knows so many of the parents personally." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore first baseman Danny Manjarrez, who at 15 is the youngest member of 
the varsity, offered another opinion: 
</P>
<P>
"He's like an uncle to me. Sometimes, though, you can tell when things start to 
get to him. But if we have a bad game, he never gets down on you. When I had a 
kidney infection (this season), he came to my house to see how I was and he 
told me not to rush it. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed he cared." 
</P>
<P>
After 30 years, nothing has changed.

VALLEY SPRINTER CHASING A PAIR OF STATE TITLES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nikywa Prevost, a freshman sprinter at Valley College, is the top qualifier 
among Valley-area athletes competing in the junior college state track and 
field championships beginning today at Fresno City College. 
</P>
<P>
Prevost, a graduate of San Fernando High, qualified in the women's 100- and 
200-meter sprints with times of 11.8 and 24.4 seconds, respectively. Her main 
competition is expected to come from LaShawn Simmons of Mt. San Antonio and 
Cecilia Thomas of El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
"Nikywa is the best, if not close to it, that we've had here," Valley Coach 
James Harvey said. "And she may be better as a quarter-miler than in the 100 
and 200." 
</P>
<P>
The Valley 400-meter relay team of Chris Rawlings, David Salas, Lionel Hemmons 
and Devon Beasley, which placed fifth in the Southern California finals with a 
time of 41.47, also qualified. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale will be represented by six athletes, including Karen Myers, who 
qualified second in both the discus (131 feet, 1 inch) and the javelin 
(128-10). 
</P>
<P>
Other Glendale entries include Marji Gilles in the triple jump (30-7 3/4) and 
Linda Benioff in the shotput (40-7 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
Glendale entrants in the men's competition include Marty Beck in the 400 
hurdles (52.82), John Szekely in the shotput (49-5) and Steve Barnett in the 
javelin (203-8). 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Colleen Gavin will compete in the 400 (57.57) and Anna Howald will 
run in the 1,500 (4:54.45). Howald and Gavin also will run in the 1,600 relay 
with Lisa Noller and Vicky Wagenbach. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Korey Fleck will compete in the men's javelin, in which he has a 
mark of 186-10.

THOUSAND OAKS POUNDS LOMPOC, 8-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alicia Zinner of Thousand Oaks High threw a two-hitter and struck out seven, 
including the side in the seventh inning, to lead the fourth-ranked Lancers to 
an 8-1 victory over Lompoc in the first round of the Southern Section 5-A 
Division playoffs Thursday at Thousand Oaks Community Park. 
</P>
<P>
Zinner (16-4), a junior right-hander, did not allow a hit until Tausha Pico 
singled to produce Lompoc's only run with two out in the fourth. The fourth was 
Zinner's problem inning as she walked the leadoff batter on four consecutive 
balls and took two others to three-and-one counts before allowing Pico's 
run-scoring hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I was down on myself because I was making mistakes that you can't 
afford to make in a CIF game," Zinner said. 
</P>
<P>
Zinner's teammates helped make her few mistakes insignificant, however, banging 
out 10 hits in the game and taking a 5-0 lead into the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (24-5), which beat the Braves, 4-3, two months ago in the second 
round of the Righetti tournament, rocked starter Adrian Villalobos (11-9). 
</P>
<P>
Phronsie Franco, the second batter in the Lancers' first inning, hit a solo 
home run down the left-field line, her second of the season. The junior 
shortstop finished three for four and had two runs batted in and scored two 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks will play Marina of Huntington Beach, a 2-1 winner over Santa Ana 
Mater Dei, Thursday at a site to be determined. MIKE GLAZE

DIVERS FROM CITY LEAGUE TOOK ALTERNATE ROADS TO SECTION MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine trying to practice and play basketball without the hoop, hockey without 
the ice. Or playing in a game but not having the points you score count. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of athletes in city league high schools must, because of the lack of 
facilities, scrounge for places to practice and compete. 
</P>
<P>
No city league schools have swimming pools, forcing swim teams to practice at 
local colleges or recreation centers. The situation is worse for divers, 
because there are no boards at the rec center pools. They must find a club 
program, for which they pay themselves, or the swim coach arranges for their 
training, often at a separate facility. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the San Diego Section diving championships today at UC San 
Diego's Canyon View Pool, divers must have scored 160 points in a six-dive meet 
or 250 points in an 11-dive meet. Qualifying chances for city divers were 
limited, because diving is not contested in city league meets. They had to 
qualify in nonleague meets or invitationals. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of swim meets are won because of diving points. At city schools, diving 
doesn't count in the swim team's points during a meet, so why are my divers 
here?," said Julie Green, University of San Diego High School diving coach. 
"They dive for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
City divers must not only concern themselves with how they will dive in 
competition but where. Most city divers went on their own to two or three 
invitationals during the seasons. The meets must be CIF-sanctioned to count 
toward qualifying for the section meet. 
</P>
<P>
Diving programs are strong and successful at non-city league schools such as 
Santana, Mt. Carmel and Valhalla because they have pools equipped with diving 
boards and a coach who helps divers pursue their talent. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mira Mesa swim team practices at the Mira Mesa Racquet and Swim Club, 
convenient because it is close to the school but lacking diving boards. Mira 
Mesa's two divers -- seniors Kimberly Lofft and Dawn Schmitt -- must rely on 
their club coach, training year-round at Canyon View under Tom Scotty of UCSD 
and Dive San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Scotty said he has 15 competitive divers in Dive San Diego, including five from 
the city leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Lofft and Schmitt have trained with Dive San Diego for three years and under 
Scotty, a former University of Illinois diving assistant, since October. Both 
were gymnasts who turned to diving because of injuries. Lofft joined the 
program first, then urged Schmitt to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Schmitt said their situation has advantages -- the same coach and facility all 
year -- but the inconvenience of having to find meets in which to compete and 
lack of team support is often frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, I feel secluded," said Lofft, who placed third at the section 
championships last year. "When I was a sophomore, we worked out at the Miramar 
Naval Air Station pool with the swimmers. I went to all the meets with the team 
(although she competed in few because there was no diving). Now they're at the 
rec center, and I've only competed once with the team. I don't feel like I'm 
part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
This season, the girls competed with the team in one dual meet and attended two 
invitationals on their own. Scotty attends when he has no prior commitments 
with UCSD. He also finds meets for his high school divers. They will many times 
compete in meets not sanctioned by the CIF for Dive San Diego. The experience 
is beneficial, Scotty said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, USDHS had one diver. But when Dan Crane became swim coach, Green was 
also hired. Freshman Debbie Howard and senior Mike Murphy, two of USDHS's 12 
divers, will compete in today's section meet. 
</P>
<P>
They practiced at University of San Diego's pool along with the swim team for 
most of the year. But this week, USDHS swimmers and divers were forced out 
because it was the only time for the school to have work done on it. Swim 
practice was moved to Swanson Memorial Pool. On Wednesday and Thursday, all 
divers competing today were allowed to practice at Canyon View to become 
familiar with the boards. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said she didn't think she'd qualify for the diving championships because 
she had little chance to compete -- one nonleague meet and three invitationals 
this season. She has five years of experience diving for a park district team 
in Palatine, Ill., during summers when she visits her father. Most of the other 
divers at USDHS were rookies this season, so Green started from scratch. Howard 
said that helped her become better. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt I had the advantage. I knew and perfected my dives. I took from 
what I learned and made my dives better," Howard said. "My parents never pushed 
me to dive, and Julie pushes you. It helped me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
USDHS has the largest diving team of the city league schools. Most, such as 
Mira Mesa, wouldn't be represented in diving at all if it wasn't that the diver 
had previously been involved with Dive San Diego or the other local club, Dive 
West out of Helix High School. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hardly any coaches," Green said, "and some of the kids don't have a 
coach and must dive on their own."

WOMEN'S COACH RIGGINS SAYS SDSU HAS ASKED FOR RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earnest Riggins, San Diego State's women's basketball coach, said Thursday that 
Athletic Director Fred Miller asked him to resign Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins, 52, said he refused and is now uncertain of his status at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Why would I resign? For what? I haven't done anything wrong,' " 
Riggins said. "And that was it. Fred added that they thought there was evidence 
of NCAA violations. I said, 'Good, let's bring them forth so I can challenge 
them.' " 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the situation, Miller said, "We're in an area of personnel. 
The institution's position is no comment." Miller said a comment would be 
forthcoming when a final decision was reached. 
</P>
<P>
Jayne Hancock, the associate athletic director who oversees the women's sports 
programs, also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Said Riggins: "Obviously, they're not saying anything. They want me to say 
something. But I don't know what to say because I'm under contract. Someone has 
to be in charge here. If they won't say anything, why should I? I'm the 
accused, not the accuser. 
</P>
<P>
"If the facts are there, why won't they comment? The public's got a right to 
know. If the facts are there, present them." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said his contract, signed last year, runs one more season. His salary 
was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
"My contract runs through 1990," Riggins said. "I'm not as concerned about 
coaching the team as I am about being paid the rest of my contract." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins denied that there had been any NCAA violations by his program. "If I 
did (violate any rules), they must be new rules," he said. "Ones I haven't 
heard about." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said he met with his attorney Thursday and that they scheduled a 
meeting with Sally Roush, SDSU director of personnel, next week. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said he has noticed a change in the atmosphere of the SDSU athletic 
department since Marilyn Johnson left as associate athletic director. She was 
replaced by Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt some things going astray, some things I couldn't put my finger on," 
Riggins said. "When you've been around long enough, you know people are either 
pulling for you or in the opposite direction. I've been around long enough to 
know people are not in my corner." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs are 118-67 since Riggins took over as head coach in 1983. They 
finished the 1988-89 season 25-9 and lost to Oregon in the championship game of 
the Women's National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But the program has been troubled in recent years. Star players Jessica Haynes 
and Tina Hutchinson, for example, both left school because of academic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins is not the only women's coach under fire at SDSU. The softball team has 
started a campaign to have Linda Spradley dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Spradley has a 142-212-2 record in six years, but that is just one of the 
reasons a majority of team members say they would like a new coach. Eleven of 
the 13 players signed a 2 1/4-page typed letter asking for a new coach, and 
seven delivered it during a meeting with Hancock two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The letter criticizes Spradley's insensitivity toward injured players, 
unwillingness to tolerate players having to periodically miss practice because 
of classwork, budget improprieties and pushing religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't agree with everything in the letter," Spradley said. "There are some 
things that are not factual. I will not categorically discuss any of the points 
in the letter." 
</P>
<P>
Said Miller: "We've received a report from the players, and we consider that as 
input to us. But it is our intent to retain Coach Spradley as the softball 
coach next season. 
</P>
<P>
Spradley, like other SDSU spring coaches, will be evaluated at the end of May 
or beginning of June. She is at the end of a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Robin Long, the team's leading hitter this season (.274), a co-captain 
and the author of the letter, has been asked by Spradley not to return next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not feel it would work out in the best interests of Robin or the team if 
she returned next season," Spradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Long: "There were a lot of problems, and I think she feels threatened by 
me. As a team captain, I spoke up when a lot of the girls had problems."

CONSUMER PRICES JUMP 0.7% IN APRIL, LED BY OIL'S RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OSWALD JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retail prices jumped 0.7% in April, the worst consumer price acceleration since 
the beginning of 1987, the Labor Department said Thursday. But most of the 
increase was caused by soaring energy prices, which have already begun to 
subside. 
</P>
<P>
Without the 5.1% rise in energy prices, which included a record 11.4% surge in 
gasoline prices, the increase would have been a much more moderate 0.2%. And 
the "core" rate of inflation -- which excludes energy and food, the two most 
volatile components of the consumer price index -- was also 0.2%, its lowest 
level since last August. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street interpreted the news as favorable, and the Dow Jones industrial 
average rose more than seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the main disagreement among analysts was whether to view the report as 
mostly good news or only partly good news. And that, in turn, mostly depended 
on whether an analyst believes that the Federal Reserve Board will accept the 
gradual slowdown of the core rate so far this year as actual proof of slowing 
inflation or only as a promise of it. The core rate has dropped from 0.5% to 
0.4% and now 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
"We're encouraged, because the core rate of inflation has declined markedly 
from 0.4% to only 0.2%, with every major category besides energy either rising 
more slowly than before or not accelerating," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief 
economist for Manufacturers Hanover Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Kellner said the report demonstrated that the Federal Reserve Board has 
succeeded in its effort to slow the economy and dampen inflation by raising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed should be satisfied that the slowdown is working and that inflation 
pressures are easing," he said. To Kellner, the only remaining question about 
near-term Fed policy is not whether the central bank will soon ease interest 
rates but when it will ease them. 
</P>
<P>
Other economists said the Fed would merely interpret Thursday's report as 
justifying its current policy. They pointed out that the first four months of 
1989 suggest an annual inflation rate of 5% to 5.5% -- not fast enough to panic 
over, but not slow enough to satisfy the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
"This was mixed, at best," said Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch in New York. 
"Over half of it was energy, so the rest was fairly moderate. 
</P>
<P>
"But there were some one-time events there, too. Rent and homeowner costs were 
down, and there were auto price concessions in April. So we think the 
inflationary environment will remain as it has been, in the 5% to 5.5% zone, 
which will not allow the Fed to ease in the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to inflation for the rest of the year is in labor costs," Steinberg 
said. "The employment cost index was up at an annual rate of 5.2% (the highest 
since 1983) in the first quarter and will probably stay at that rate for the 
rest of the year. That puts a floor under the inflation rate." 
</P>
<P>
David Wyss of Data Resources, a research firm in Lexington, Mass., while 
welcoming the 0.2% core rate as "better than we had expected in its details," 
also warned that higher wage settlements could well drive inflation higher 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
He warned that such events as a recently settled strike at Bethlehem Steel 
plants and the steep wage demands of teachers striking in Los Angeles could 
point the way toward some unpleasant inflationary surprises later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Ratajczak of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State 
University, a specialist in price movements, warned that only about two-thirds 
of the expected second-quarter bubble in energy costs showed up in the April 
consumer price report. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted a 2.5% jump in energy prices generally in May and a 5.5% boost in 
gasoline prices. He also noted that the unusual April drop in homeowner costs 
(down 3.6%) and in the estimated cost of rent or rent equivalents (down 0.7%) 
may merely have corrected a statistical error for March, when both those 
categories showed unusual increases. 
</P>
<P>
"If you do all the adjustments, take out the energy and the housing and the 
autos, you end up with an annual rate of 5% or a bit higher," Ratajczak said. 
"It's not exploding inflation, but it is an inflation problem." 
</P>
<P>
Before seasonal adjustment, consumer prices in the Los Angeles-Anaheim-Long 
Beach area increased by 0.8%, compared to an unadjusted 0.7% in cities 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Before adjustment, the consumer price index stood at 123.1, up 0.8 points from 
March. That means that goods and services that cost $100 in December, 1982, 
cost $123.10 in April.

Macy Says Units Not for Sale: The chairman of R. H. Macy &amp; Co. said the 
retailer -- which owns the Bullocks and I. Magnin chains -- feels its financial 
footing is secure since it went private in 1986 and it doesn't intend to divest 
any department store divisions. Edward S. Finkelstein said there have been 
persistent rumors that Macy's might be planning to sell off some assets to 
reduce its debt. There were also reports that Limited Inc., the nation's 
leading specialty apparel retailer, had preliminary talks about an investment 
in Macy.

Money Supply Measures Fall: All three measures of the nation's money supply 
dropped in early May, the Federal Reserve reported. The narrowest measure of 
the money supply, M1, fell $8.7 billion in the week ended May 8 to a seasonally 
adjusted $772.9 billion from $781.6 billion the previous week. The central bank 
said a broader measure known as M2 lost $1.9 billion to a seasonally adjusted 
$3,069.7 billion from $3,071.6 billion the previous week. An even broader 
measure, M3, fell $1.8 billion to a seasonally adjusted $3,953.3 billion from 
$3,955.1 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking 
accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts such as savings 
deposits and money market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less liquid accounts such 
as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $100,000.

Intermark: The San Diego-based firm reported a $7.2-million net loss for the 
fourth quarter ended March 31, contrasted with a $12.6-million net profit 
during the like quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose by 4%, to $175 million, up 
from $168 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Intermark reported $215,000 in net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 
down from $6.4 million during the previous fiscal year. Revenue for the year 
increased by 16%, to $721 million, up from $620 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Intermark's 1989 results were adversely affected by a $5-million loss sustained 
by Dynamark Ltd., a 50%-owned subsidiary. Also, Intermark recorded an 
$8-million charge in connection with a loss at Sunbelt Nursery Group, a 
50%-owned subsidiary that recently closed a number of unprofitable stores. 
</P>
<P>
The losses at Sunbelt and Dynamark offset record net income at Pier 1 Imports, 
another subsidiary, that grew by 36% to a record $21.9 million.

New Loan for Mexico: The World Bank will lend Mexico, the developing world's 
second-largest debtor, nearly $2 billion to fund two hydroelectric projects and 
help reduce its interest payments, the government has announced. The 
announcement by Finance Minister Pedro Aspe came the same day Mexico resumed 
negotiations in New York with a 15-member committee representing creditor banks 
and two days after the government liberalized its foreign investment rules. The 
new loan package "will support structural changes undertaken by the federal 
government in the financial, industrial, commercial and state-run sectors," 
Aspe said.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market pushed ahead to a new post-crash high Thursday, undeterred by 
a government report on inflation that was slightly worse than expected. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 7.69 to 2,470.12, surpassing the 
19-month high of 2,463.89 it reached Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 826 up, 655 down and 515 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 177.48 million shares, down from 191.21 million 
Wednesday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter 
market, totaled 216.21 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose 0.7% in April, 
bringing the increase in the index so far in 1989 to an annual rate of 6.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly number came in near the high end of advance estimates on Wall 
Street and apparently disappointed some traders who had been hoping for a 
pleasant surprise in the data. 
</P>
<P>
Still, analysts noted that much of the increase came, as expected, from a jump 
in energy prices that is not considered likely to be repeated in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expect Prices to Fall 
</P>
<P>
The increase in gasoline prices was the largest one-month gain since the Labor 
Department began keeping track in the 1930s. Economists believe that fuel 
prices will fall because of signs of stepped-up production by oil-producing 
countries and removal of supply disruptions associated with the Alaska oil 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
The view that the size of the energy price increase was an unusual occurrence 
left the door open for stock market bulls who contend that the Federal Reserve 
has a good chance of succeeding in its effort to restrain inflation without 
pushing the economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Avon Products led the NYSE active list, down 7 1/8 at 33 on turnover of more 
than 5.8 million shares. Amway Corp. withdrew a $39-a-share takeover bid for 
the company after Avon's board rejected the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue chips included International Paper, up 1 1/4 at 49 1/4; 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 1/2 at 35 1/8; Philip Morris, up 1/2 at 
136, and International Business Machines, up 1/2 at 112. 
</P>
<P>
Federal National Mortgage gained 2 3/4 to 80 1/8, trading at record highs as 
the company, which has been reaping increasing profit as a central force in the 
growing secondary market for mortgages, held its annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae stock has risen 6 7/8 since the start of the week. Last year it 
traded as low as 29. 
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo stock market, share prices closed lower after two straight days of 
rises in featureless, thin trading. The dollar's sharp rise against the yen has 
kept most investors sidelined worrying if and when the Bank of Japan will raise 
the discount rate. 
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index fell 136.12 to close at 33,856.33. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks closed sharply higher for the second straight session, 
strengthened partly by takeover speculation. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times 100-share index rose 21.5 to 2,177.3. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
Central banks battered down the dollar in a battle with currency dealers who 
had driven the currency sharply upward in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Traders shrugged off the central bank dollar sales at first, but the rally 
broke by late morning trading in New York when the dollar hit its highest point 
in years against key currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the dollar finished the day less than half a percent below its levels of 
late Wednesday, indicating that traders remained willing to challenge the 
resolve of government bankers and finance officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a market that still wants to test the upside potential for the 
dollar," said Nicholas Sargen, a Salomon Bros. analyst. 
</P>
<P>
He said estimates of the official dollar sales ranged from $1.5 billion to $3 
billion, including heavy sales by the Bank of Japan during Tokyo trading hours. 
</P>
<P>
In precious metals trading, gold plunged in late activity to levels not seen 
since August, 1986. Republic National Bank of New York reported a late quote of 
$368.30, down from $371.75 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar peaked at 1.9880 West German marks and 139.60 Japanese yen -- 
approaching what traders consider psychologically important levels of 2 marks 
and 140 yen. Reaching those levels could incite further speculative buying, 
dealers say. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.6180 from $1.6140 late Wednesday. In 
New York, sterling rose to $1.6175 from $1.6115. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins, the dollar rose 
1.18 yen from Wednesday to close at 138.88 yen. Later in London, the dollar was 
quoted at 138.60 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 138.65 yen from 139.22. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Wednesday's rates, 
included: 1.9670 West German marks, down from 1.9715; 1.7568 Swiss francs, down 
from 1.7615; 1.1927 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1908; 6.6585 French francs, 
down from 6.6760, and 1,433 Italian lire, down from 1,435. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared to late Wednesday, included: 1.9660 
West German marks, down from 1.9675; 1.7552 Swiss francs, down from 1.7580; 
6.6490 French francs, down from 6.6607; 2.2240 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2150; 
1,439.50 Italian lire, up from 1,433.00, and 1.1927 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.1925. 
</P>
<P>
Gold held steady in London at $370.75 an ounce. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold 
rose to $370.50 from $370.25. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.01 to close at 
$371.73. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery fell 
to $369.70 from $373.20. 
</P>
<P>
Silver fell on the London market to $5.43 an ounce from $5.46 on Wednesday. On 
New York's Comex, silver for current delivery fell to $5.401 from $5.429. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
The price of long-term government bonds advanced as traders discounted a hefty 
overall increase in the consumer price index because it was caused largely by 
the rising cost of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond increased 5/16 point, or about $3.10 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield fell to 8.77% from 8.81% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The price of Treasury bills also increased, while short- and intermediate-term 
government bonds were mixed. 
</P>

UAW FILES PETITION FOR ELECTION AT NISSAN'S PLANT IN TENNESEE

<P>
After 16 months of organizing, the United Auto Workers union filed a petition 
Thursday calling for an election at the Nissan automobile and truck plant here. 
</P>
<P>
The filing with the National Labor Relations Board sets up a showdown between 
organized labor and the second-largest Japanese automobile plant in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven union leaders and workers led by Jim Weaver, who has coordinated the 
drive since January, took a box of cards signed by Nissan employees to the NLRB 
office in Nashville Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Shonting, a technician in the trim and chassis plant, said, "I think 
we're going to whip the britches off of them." 
</P>
<P>
Union officials had wanted to time the filing so that the election would occur 
on a favorable day for them either before or after the plant takes its regular 
annual production break July 3-17. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials have said that it would probably take about 60 days after a 
petition is filed for the NLRB to hold an election. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Neuman, vice president of human resources for the company, welcomed a 
conclusion to months of organizing that often left employees bitterly divided. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the great majority of Nissan employees will vote against 
the union," she said.

ARCHITECTURE: NOW PLAYING: AVANT-GARDE MOVIE 'BOUTIQUES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Searching for an architecture to express the style of his small but rapidly 
expanding independent film and TV production company, Propaganda Films 
president Joni Sighvatsson told designer Frank Israel that "we need to project 
a young and funky image." 
</P>
<P>
Sighvatsson wanted at all costs to avoid what he described as the stuffy 
corporate look of established movie studios. "Our business is selling images," 
he said, "and we needed to show in our architecture that we are different from 
the old-style Hollywood-Burbank operation." 
</P>
<P>
Propaganda Films' new headquarters is distinctly young and funky. The raw and 
airy space of an old prop storage warehouse hidden away in a Hollywood back 
street has been transformed by Israel into a free-form stage set filled with 
miniature scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
The free-standing conference room, painted a deep rust, resembles a tiny round 
fort out of Antonioni's "Red Desert." A boat-shaped core of offices floating 
under the old warehouse's bare timber bow trusses has the air of a beached hull 
left over from a World War II sea battle epic. The espresso bar that replaces 
the reception area found in more conventional commercial layouts seems like a 
prop from a New Wave "La Dolce Vita." 
</P>
<P>
"Propaganda's design promotes the myth of Hollywood," Israel explained. "And 
making myths is what Hollywood is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Inside Propaganda, the Hollywood New Wave image-projection is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Hip-punk directors such as David Lynch and John Landis presided over noisy and 
casual casting sessions recently in Propaganda's espresso-bar entry. A constant 
stream of young men and women in outre Melrose Avenue outfits scurry among the 
architecture as if their every action were being taped by invisible cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Said Propaganda Films co-founder Steve Golin: "In our space we want to create a 
scene where people feel alive and energized, and -- if you'll pardon the cliche 
-- on the cutting edge." 
</P>
<P>
The company's lively design is typical of a host of independent film and 
television "production boutiques" that have sprung up in the past five years. 
As the motion-picture industry's major studios come under the control of 
conglomerates, a legion of lean and hungry young producers has spun off to set 
up their own companies in spaces designed to express an active avant-garde 
image. 
</P>
<P>
Golin said that the secret of the success of the independents is "low overheads 
and high energy, low profiles and high style." He claims his company can make 
feature films for $5 million that the studios could not match for double the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three-Year Growth 
</P>
<P>
Since its start in 1986, Propaganda has become the largest producer of music 
videos in the United States. In three years, the company has sprung from 
nothing to an annual gross of around $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sighvatsson and Golin find their new Hollywood location convenient as well as 
mythical. The area is stocked with prop-rental houses, post-production studios 
and film-supply outlets. Commercial rentals, at around $1 per square foot per 
month, are still cheap compared to elsewhere on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, Venice and Santa Monica have also become popular 
locations for new production boutiques. Drawn by the area's adventurous upscale 
ambience, these young companies have transformed a variety of spaces, from old 
warehouses to conventional office buildings, into New Wave fantasias. 
</P>
<P>
The Venice commercial production house known simply as Pytka, one of the first 
of the new breed to create its own space in 1985, commissioned architect Bill 
Adams to convert an old Main Street streetcar repair barn into a 
"mini-village." 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Pytka wanted to develop a space where a series of separate small 
production outfits, including his own, could share a communal feeling," Adams 
explained. "The village idea, in which we laid out an interior 'Main Street' 
complete with trees linking the separate areas, came out of our discussions. 
The style retains the ruggedness of the old trolley barn played off against the 
sleeker finishes of the new partitions and furnishings." 
</P>
<P>
The notion that independent film producers and small production companies can 
band together to share a building is catching on. The Lantana Center, a 
development under way on Olympic Boulevard in Santa Monica designed by Arthur 
Pereira, is recycling an old office structure into a studio "garden complex." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Privacy for Redford 
</P>
<P>
Heavyweight independents such as Robert Redford are also creating their own 
architectural enclaves. Redford's secretive new Sundance office suite on Ocean 
Avenue in Santa Monica is rumored to feature bullet-proof glass partitions and 
pass-key elevators as protection against eager sightseers and unsolicited 
scripts. 
</P>
<P>
The four-story Santa Monica Studios building on Arizona Avenue, built by 
architect-developer Vito Cetta for rental as standard office space, was snapped 
up by two production houses, Media Design West and Visual Eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Visual Eyes executive Alan Kozlowski told Bret Thoeny of Boto Design Inc. that 
he wanted something "very Venice, yet suave and muted" to characterize his 
company's style. 
</P>
<P>
Like Propaganda Films, the design of Visual Eyes sacrifices status and 
executive privacy for the noisy rough-and-tumble of open-plan spaces where 
everyone in the company may meet to argue out issues, hold rowdy casting 
sessions or simply hang out. Obscured patterned glass mutes the sunlight that 
pours in from the studio's central atrium. The subdued tones in the bleached 
oak finishes and the gray and pastel colors create an open atmosphere that 
expresses an informal, non-hierarchical style where everyone is free to 
suggest, challenge and collaborate on equal footing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rush of Juices 
</P>
<P>
"Studio execs love to leave their plush Century City or Universal City suites 
and come slumming here," Propaganda's Golin said. "Our scene's a real rush for 
them, it juices them up and sends them back to work lit up." 
</P>
<P>
A prominent Universal Studios executive, who wished to remain anonymous, 
confirmed that a visit to one of the young independents "leaves me so juiced 
I'm tempted to jump ship and lead the wild life." 
</P>
<P>
Distinctive architecture for offices and production facilities is a 
surprisingly new idea in the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days the studios, mostly vast sheds linked to strings of offices, 
were seldom distinguished in design. Classic Hollywood's reputation for style 
comes from the flair expressed in the movie sets rather than the architecture 
that housed them. Famed 1920s and '30s designers such as Erte and Norman Bel 
Geddes created Art Deco and Streamline Moderne settings that were masterpieces 
of opulence and grace. 
</P>
<P>
"The wonderful thing about the myth of Hollywood is its constant re-creation," 
Propaganda architect Israel said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality may grow stale, as the major studios show, but the idea continues 
to inspire new energies and new styles that renew the story."

JAPAN CENTER CELEBRATES ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Heisei Gannen" -- celebrating a new beginning -- was the theme when the 
Japanese American Cultural &amp; Community Center held its ninth anniversary 
and Pacific Pioneer Awards dinner Wednesday night at the Century Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The group, a consortium of businesses dedicated to community service, was also 
celebrating the fact that its new $14-million facility in Little Tokyo in 
downtown Los Angeles has finally been paid for and was now, in the words of 
JACCC president Toshikazu Terasawa, "the foremost ethnic art and cultural 
center in Los Angeles." Cards set at each place bore a drawing of the building 
under the caption, "By George We Did It!" 
</P>
<P>
Mistress of Ceremonies Kathryn Doi Todd, representing the JACCC board of 
directors, welcomed guests and introduced a dais of dignitaries, including 
Japanese Consul General Hiromoto Seki, and the recipients of the group's 
President's Awards, Madame Sohwa Hitomi and Madame Sosei Matsumoto. 
</P>
<P>
After a calligraphy demonstration by Hiroko Ikuta, who used a large black brush 
on a 10-foot-high white screen, Terasawa presented the awards to Hitomi and 
Matsumoto. The women are two of Southern California's most widely respected 
practitioners and teachers of the ancient Japanese tea ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Japan to Wyoming 
</P>
<P>
Hitomi, 94, moved from Japan to Wyoming in 1917. In 1935, she moved to an 
apartment building in the garment district of Los Angeles, where she still 
resides and manages the building. At the age of 60, she returned to Japan to 
study Tea under a master. In 1974, she was awarded the Fifth Degree Order of 
the Sacred Treasure from the Japanese government, and one year later was 
rewarded with the highest-ranking certificate available to Tea practitioners by 
a Japanese Tea grand master. 
</P>
<P>
Matsumoto teaches Tea extensively all over Southern California, and assisted at 
the serving of tea at the signing of the U.S.-Japan peace treaty at the end of 
World War II. With her help, Tea has been a regular part of the curriculum at 
UCLA since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Both women bowed, but did not speak, as the audience gave them a round of 
polite and sustained applause. 
</P>
<P>
Also honored with the JACCC's Pacific Pioneer Awards were Fujiko Ushiba, wife 
of the late Japanese ambassador to the U.S. Nobuhiko Ushiba, who accepted the 
award for herself and her husband, and AT&amp;T, which sent AT&amp;T Foundation 
President Reynold Levy to accept. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bradley Keynote Speaker 
</P>
<P>
Guests dined on American hotel-style fare (filet mignon, asparagus, sponge 
cake) before congratulatory remarks by Consul General Seki and a keynote speech 
by Mayor Tom Bradley, who arrived 45 minutes into the meal. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner, soprano Hiroko Kitano performed selections from "Madama 
Butterfly" and "Lohengrin," followed by a musical medley by Lisa Joe and Scott 
Nagatani.

REAGAN RECEIVES CHURCHILL AWARD; 
</P>
<P>
WITH REGAL PAGEANTRY, EX-PRESIDENT HAILED FOR LEADERSHIP 
</P>

<P>
Retirement can't be all bad when you still have the United States Marine Corps 
Color Guard serenading your entrance and a spotlight shining on you wherever 
you go. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the limelight the Reagans still command, especially when it's an 
occasion like Wednesday night, when former President Ronald Reagan received the 
Winston Churchill Foundation Award, presented by His Royal Highness The Prince 
Philip Duke of Edinburgh. Reagan is the fourth recipient of the award; previous 
honorees were W. Averell Harriman, H. Ross Perot and Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
The black-tie dinner at the Beverly Hilton was preceded by a VIP cocktail 
reception where the food was barely touched and guests awaited the arrival of 
the Reagans and the prince. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Polite Mobbing 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans (she was dressed in a pink and white brocade-belted jacket with a 
long white slim skirt) were politely mobbed, the prince less so; an informal 
receiving line let the honored guests greet friends and fans. 
</P>
<P>
"It all seems to come off rather well, hasn't it?" said a beaming Lady Soames, 
the youngest and only living child of Sir Winston Churchill and a trustee of 
the Winston Churchill Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation was begun 29 years ago by the late prime minister's friends 
during his life to foster Anglo-American relations. With English and American 
branches, it grants scholarships and fellowships to American graduate students, 
allowing them to study science at Churchill College at Cambridge University. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lady Soames remains one of the staunchest supporters of the 
foundation, she said she wasn't due to make any campaign speeches that night. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no, no, no," she said emphatically. "I'm purely a spectator here tonight." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impressive Guest List 
</P>
<P>
There was a great deal to take in, notably the guests, who included Walter and 
Leonore Annenberg; John L. Loeb Jr., president of the Winston Churchill 
Foundation of the United States; dinner chairman (and Arco president and CEO) 
Robert Wycoff and his wife Anne; Pamela Harriman; Barbara and Marvin Davis; Tom 
Selleck and wife Jillie Mack; British publishing czar Robert Maxwell; Bob and 
Dolores Hope; Betty and Bill Wilson; Phyllis Diller; Edie and Lew Wasserman; 
British Ambassador to the United States Antony Acland and wife Jennifer; and 
Timothy Wilkes, the 15-year-old El Toro High School junior who won an essay 
competition on the subject of Winston Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner netted more than $1 million, according to Wycoff (tickets were 
priced at a hefty $1,000). 
</P>
<P>
The evening went along at a quiet, regal gait, with all of the expected 
pageantry but little of the high-pitched fervor that other royals elicit when 
they come to town. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hope headlined the evening's entertainment, getting away with quips like: 
"This is an informal evening. The prince decided not to wear a crown, and so 
did the Reagans." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra was all but drowned out by the drone of 
chatting guests, but better heard was Rosemary Clooney, who belted out 
standards to an appreciative audience. 
</P>
<P>
Said Prince Philip, who also holds the title of Chancellor of Cambridge 
University: "It's not for me to comment on the choice of Mr. Reagan receiving 
the Churchill award except to say that it strikes me as wholly appropriate. 
What Sir Winston experienced, the responsibilities of leading a government and 
a nation in war and in peace, Mr. Reagan had the same experience, but 
fortunately he was spared the war. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Qualities of a Leader 
</P>
<P>
"I've often speculated on the qualities that make a successful political leader 
-- or any leader, for that matter," he continued. "I think I would put personal 
charm on the top of the list. The next I would put a sense of humor, a quick 
wit and the gift of self-mockery. All public figures have to suffer mockery, so 
you might as well get it in first." 
</P>
<P>
To the list of qualities he added: "A fairly thick skin to absorb criticism, 
and the patience to listen to what others have to say. And from what I've 
noticed about Winston Churchill and Ronald Reagan, I would say that all these 
qualities are present in both their characters in ample measure. And last but 
by no means least, Sir Winston had and Mr. Reagan has the extreme good fortune 
to be helped and supported by exceptional wives." 
</P>
<P>
After Prince Philip placed the medallion award around Reagan's neck, the former 
President responded: "Imagine how humble I feel receiving an award for 
supposedly representing some of the qualities of Winston Churchill. This truly 
is an honor. Winston Churchill inspires. He was truly a great man. He seemed to 
instinctively understand man, government and the importance of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan continued: "The progress of science is as unstoppable as the forces of 
the universe. And I'll tell you what I like about scientists: They are eternal 
optimists. They believe there are answers, and they believe we can find them. 
</P>
<P>
"If I may be so bold as to speak for Sir Winston for a moment, I think there is 
something he and I would agree upon completely regarding the nature of science 
and politics. It's something W. H. Auden said perfectly, that 'the true men of 
action in our time, those who transform the world, are not the politicians and 
the statesmen, but the scientists.' "

In "Road House" (citywide Friday), 1989's comic high point so far, Patrick 
Swayze plays Dalton, a man at the Zen peak of his profession. In the world of 
power drinkers, Dalton's single, ringing name is legendary. He's a numero uno 
"cooler," a saloon bouncer. 
</P>
<P>
He's also a graduate in philosophy from NYU, a fan of the novels of Jim 
Harrison, the owner of a 560 Mercedes-Benz and a man with a whole lotta pain 
behind those steely eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In a trade heavy with built-in hazards, Dalton travels with a medical road map 
of his injuries: the precise placement of the steel pins, cross-hatched scars 
and undetonated land mines he has picked up. 
</P>
<P>
Called in to shape up the Double Deuce, a decrepit Missouri roadhouse, Dalton 
already suffers from a nasty knife slash, which lands him at the town's 
emergency hospital. Shirtless, he poses, arm up behind his head, so that the 
audience can't help but notice his resemblance, torso-wise, to Michelangelo's 
David. Also, so this beautiful, sensitive doctor (Kelly Lynch) can close the 
wound with her medical staple gun. He may need a local anesthetic, she warns. 
"Pain don't hurt," he reassures her confidently. 
</P>
<P>
Not the way stupidity does. And the crushing assault that "Road House" delivers 
to fun at the movies is enough to send you crawling out of the theater on hands 
and knees, bloody and bowed. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is the dreadful compendium script by David Lee Henry and Hilary 
Henkin, who already has Whoopi Goldberg's "Fatal Beauty" and "Lost Angels" on 
her rap sheet. In this story of consummate evil (sleekly villainous town boss 
Ben Gazzara) pitted against blow-dried, Tefloned good, the dialogue wavers from 
countrified quaint to hyper-macho, without a single believable moment on its 
way. It's a screenplay with a dozen antecedents, from the hallowed Western to 
martial-arts sagas to those '50s movies where one man with his shirt off wreaks 
havoc in a steamy Southern town. The writers have added a soupcon of Stallone, 
a pinch of Chuck Norris and a few "Mississippi Burning" fire-bombings for 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Most to be pitied among the actors is Sam Elliott, playing Dalton's grizzled 
best friend and mentor. Elliott is a man of genuine authority, lending his wry 
and indelible presence to goings-on that are simply not in his league. Swayze 
genuinely doesn't seem to know the trouble he is in, and Gazzara is too busy 
smirking at his own villainy. Besides, he is allowed to sing. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the thudding direction by Rowdy Herrington, known previously as 
the writer-director of "Jack's Back." Melodramatic at best, Herrington is in 
his element in fight scenes, and out of it the rest of the time. At first that 
doesn't much matter, since two-thirds of "Road House" is fights or explosions, 
or men howling, "Waaallll, (blank) you," at one another. "Road House" probably 
has more (blanks), pound for pound, less inventively employed, than "Platoon." 
</P>
<P>
But it's supposed to have more delicate moments, too, as the doctor shows up at 
Dalton's place for staple inventory and to murmur admiringly, "You live some 
kinda life, Dalton . . . ." Here, a light touch might have helped, a sense of 
humor, a bit of irony. Nada. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the hope is that the presence of Swayze will bring the "Dirty 
Dancing" crowd running. Unfortunately, these film makers, including producer 
Joel Silver, have no clue what made "Dirty Dancing" the hit that it was; they 
seem to believe it was the dirty half. Consequently, if they slavishly copy the 
lighting and even the setting from the first Swayze hit, and this time have 
Swayze and the lady in question fill in the gaps that "Dirty Dancing" left to 
our imagination, it would presumably be enough to send audiences into a 
ticket-buying frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong, wrong, wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen-year-olds could have told them that. It wasn't sex that "Dirty 
Dancing" delivered, it was romance. But in deep "Road House" country, with 
(blank) on everyone's lips, (it's MPAA-rated R for language and violence) and 
the undefined made crassly visible, there isn't a whiff of romance anywhere, 
any more than there's a single jot of common sense.

TROUPE TAKES ITS FIRST STEPS ON A N.Y. STAGE;

"IF I CAN MAKE IT THERE, I'LL MAKE IT ANYWHERE. IT'S UP TO YOU, NEW YORK, NEW 
YORK."

<P>
So says the Big Apple's unofficial theme song. And performers throughout the 
country tend to take those words to heart. 
</P>
<P>
When Three's Company decided it was ready for serious scrutiny -- after 15 
years of making modern dances on the home front -- the troupe packaged its 
strongest program of repertory works and took it east. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, it's the biggest center of dance in the world," director Jean 
Isaacs said. "There were eight other dance events going on there the same time 
we were performing (last week). That's where it's at. 
</P>
<P>
"New York is also a major media center, and their validation is very important 
in attracting the attention of big grant givers. And all the presenters are 
there, so you get a good chance to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"We got reviewed in the New York Times and the Village Voice," Isaacs said. 
"Those mean a lot more (to major funding sources) than a good review in the San 
Diego Union." 
</P>
<P>
Although the New York Times review was far from glowing, it was basically 
positive, particularly where Isaacs' choreography was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"The company was best when it was most vigorous and least fussy," wrote 
reviewer Jack Anderson, singling out Isaacs' "Tabula Rasa" as the prime example 
of that simple vitality. Michael S. Roth's throbbing accompaniment was also 
praised. However, Anderson thought the two major theater pieces by resident 
choreographer Nancy McCaleb "abounded in affectations." 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't all that discouraged" by the review, Isaacs said. "It was actually 
pretty good, although it was more descriptive than evaluative. His one 
criticism about 'a tendency to exaggerate' was valid. We're used to dancing in 
a larger house, and the stage is so close at the Merce Cunningham Studio that 
we should have made adjustments. We'll know better next time." 
</P>
<P>
Three's Company fared better in the weekly Village Voice, which came out with a 
review Wednesday, more than a week after the concert. 
</P>
<P>
Dance critic Gus Solomons dubbed the troupe "a breezy bunch," and admitted he 
was skeptical of the "passel of raves" from California critics that preceded 
Three's Company to New York. Nevertheless, he found the six repertory works on 
the program "solid . . . and nicely performed. 
</P>
<P>
"Cutting-edge work it is not, but (it was) bright, intelligent and neatly 
staged." 
</P>
<P>
McCaleb thought the New York concert "went beautifully," noting that the second 
performance had a near-capacity crowd, including a respectable contingent from 
the city's dance community. 
</P>
<P>
"More important than the critics was the response from dance professionals," 
McCaleb said. "And we definitely made connections." 
</P>
<P>
Self-producing in New York is expensive, but Isaacs is convinced the trip will 
pay dividends. 
</P>
<P>
"It's already helped here at home with fund-raising," she said. "Everybody knew 
about our going to New York. We even got flowers from Maureen O'Connor. It was 
great." 
</P>
<P>
"We showed people in New York that we can take such a big dog-and-pony show on 
the road," McCaleb said. "It's important to show your work if you want to do 
touring, which we do. We demonstrated our ability to take a technically 
intricate show to the most professional setting. The dancers learned something, 
too: that they can get out on any stage and just do it." 
</P>
<P>
There were also fringe benefits to San Diego aficionados, McCaleb noted. 
</P>
<P>
"People enjoy the whole idea of San Diego taking its work out of town. Everyone 
was proud when the theater had its successes in New York. It says something 
about the arts growing up in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
When Three's Company debuted at the Merce last week, it was not only the first 
stint in the nation's dance capital for the San Diego-based troupe, it was the 
first time any local dance group had appeared on a New York stage. But it 
certainly won't be the last, according to Isaacs. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to go back," she said. "It was a wonderful experience for us, and I 
think others will be going too in the future."

KTTV Channel 11 broadcast the wrong set of Lotto numbers Wednesday night, 
setting off a chain of disappointments for people who thought they had won. 
While televising a Dodgers baseball game against the Mets in New York, KTTV 
superimposed six numbers and a bonus number at the end of the game telecast. 
Lotto officials, who reported receiving about 100 phone calls per hour Thursday 
concerning the error, said they had been told that there was a technical mix-up 
and KTTV accidentally used numbers that had been chosen in the April 12 
drawing. "We've had calls from people who said they had the winning number, but 
they tore up their tickets," said California Lottery spokeswoman Joanne McNabb. 
Said KTTV program director Don Tillman: "It was one of those things that 
shouldn't happen."

Lainie Kazan has left the cast of CBS' fall series "The Incredible Teddy Z" 
after taping six episodes, Columbia Television and Kazan's publicist have 
confirmed. Kazan, who was cast as the mother of young Hollywood agent Teddy 
Zakalakis (John Cryer) in the series from producer Hugh Wilson, quit "because 
she did not like the way her character was being written," according to 
publicist Jim Dobson. "They wanted her to be an old woman, and she wanted to 
play someone younger, more vital." No replacement has been named; Columbia says 
it will re-shoot Kazan's scenes in the already-taped episodes.

MTV Networks announced plans Thursday to launch a new basic cable television 
channel exclusively featuring comedy programming. The new channel, in 
development for the past 18 months, will be called "HA" TV Comedy Network. In 
addition to producing original programming, "HA" TV Comedy Network will acquire 
shows and movies from existing television and film libraries and will have 
access to comedy programs distributed by its parent company, Viacom. Launch 
date is early 1990. Cable giants HBO and Ted Turner also are planning comedy 
channels.

Judy Davis, playing the title role in "Hapgood" at the Ahmanson Theatre, was 
forced to leave at the end of the second act Wednesday night because of voice 
problems. She replaced by understudy Babbie Green. Davis earlier had received 
medical treatment for a throat ailment, and thought she was well enough to 
perform, said theatre spokesman Tony Sherwood. "She went on, thought she could 
get through it and lost her voice," he said. She missed Thursday's matinee 
performance, but was expected to be back on stage Thursday night, Sherwood 
said. Davis was the star of the Australian film, "My Brilliant Career."

Indian film maker Satyajit Ray underwent heart surgery Wednesday in Calcutta 
and was fitted with a pacemaker. Hospital sources said the 68-year-old director 
was recovering well and would be moved out of intensive care in about two days. 
Ray, best known in the West for his depiction of corruption and life in village 
India, was to have gone to the Cannes Film Festival this week for the launch of 
his latest work, "An Enemy of the People."

EDWARD MORGAN IN ARPINO'S 1977 'TOUCH ME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To a fervent gospel recording by the Rev. James Cleveland and the Charles Fold 
Singers, a black, bare-chested male in pleated white culottes kicks high, 
reaches wide, rolls his hips, walks on his knees, flings his voluminous garment 
up over one shoulder like a toga and reels back from passages of flailing 
intensity into poses of soulful pride. 
</P>
<P>
No, the Alvin Ailey company isn't back in town. This is "Touch Me," the 1977 
solo that Gerald Arpino created for Christian Holder and revived this Joffrey 
Ballet season for Edward Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
It graced an otherwise familiar program Wednesday in the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion and showed Morgan to be a dancer of great power and versatility. It 
also displayed Arpino's fluency in a modern-dance vocabulary that had nothing 
in common with his usual lyric/virtuosic classicism. 
</P>
<P>
You could argue, of course, that Arpino was merely working in Ailey's shadow 
here. However, the results had greater integrity and relevance to the 
accompaniment than what Peter Martins and New York City Ballet inflicted on the 
music of Ray Charles in "A Fool for You" (telecast a week ago on PBS). And 
Morgan's performance gave the borrowed dance-rhetoric superb immediacy. 
</P>
<P>
In George Balanchine's "Cotillon," Deborah Dawn danced stylishly as the 
Mistress of Ceremonies. However, Julie Janus and Peter Narbutas looked none too 
secure in the severely conventionalized mime and rapid, intricate cycles of 
supported turns of the "Hand of Fate" pas de deux. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the program: Arpino's "Round of Angels" and "Light Rain," which were 
both substituted for other Arpino ballets that could not be performed due to 
dancer injuries.LEWIS SEGAL

'A CRY IN THE DISTANCE' AT THEATRE/TEATRO; 'SICILY'S GRANDCHILDREN' IN STUDIO 
CITY; 'TWELFTH NIGHT' AT GLOBE; 'REVOLUTION' AT BEYOND BAROQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Theatre/Teatro, the only bilingual theater in the city, is staging a timely 
South American political play, "A Cry in the Distance," which is powered by a 
searing performance by Annette Cardona. 
</P>
<P>
It's a theatrical, scenery-chewing role for an actor to play physical torture. 
But it's a more difficult challenge to interpret the aftereffects of that 
torture. 
</P>
<P>
That is precisely what Cardona enacts so well in the English-language 
production of South American playwright Jorge Diaz's true-life drama at the 
Bilingual Foundation of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Condemned by her leftist politics to exile in Madrid, and haunted by her legacy 
of rape and torture in a Chilean prison, Cardona's psychological breakdown is 
fierce without being melodramatic. Credit director Margarita Galban's 
restraint. 
</P>
<P>
The other actors pale in this turmoil except for a convincing, metallic-cold 
turn by Rodrigo Catalan as a young hustler Cardona purposefully brings to her 
apartment to defile her body and exorcise her guilt over past demons. 
</P>
<P>
Galban's staging has its flat moments (notably in the first act), and the 
material can be taxing. But there's passion here too. Translator Margarita 
Stocker (who plays the heroine in the alternating Spanish-language version) 
seems on top of her text. 
</P>
<P>
The bristling dialogue that shapes the ruthlessly candid breakup between the 
suicidal Cardona and her bloodless, hapless husband (Richard Moffitt) is 
charged with sexual darkness that cuts to the woman's soul. 
</P>
<P>
Production values are fine. It's refreshing to see the BFA take this topical 
plunge into South American politics. 
</P>
<P>
 At 421 N. Avenue 19 (Lincoln Heights), in English, Wednesdays and Thursdays, 8 
p.m.; in Spanish, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 p.m. Through June 
4. Tickets: $9-$12. (213) 225-4044. 
</P>
<P>
'Sicily's Grandchildren' 
</P>
<P>
The theatrical woods are strewn with playwrights who write about their own 
families. The perils are even greater when the playwright is an actor who 
reserves the key role for himself. More power to him if he pulls it off. 
</P>
<P>
Debuting playwright Anthony J. Barbarotto plays the sulking brother in his 
semi-autobiographical play about a warring Italian-American family, "Sicily's 
Grandchildren," at the Chamber Theatre. Barbarotto has written some good 
dialogue but he hasn't distanced himself enough from his material. 
</P>
<P>
The play has no particular rhythm, and the production, directed by Dierk 
Torsek, is uneven and kind of clunky. Nothing's larger than life. Everything's 
a little too real, which is not a virtue in theater (Devin Meadows' interior 
set and Chris Robert's lighting are depressingly mundane). 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Barbarotto, doesn't fall on his face either. This is a 
kitchen-sink drama that builds to a genuine moment of reconciliation between 
embattled brothers (the morose Barbarotto and the more outgoing Rick Lohman). 
</P>
<P>
And there are a couple of gems in the 11-member cast: Argentina Brunetti's 
Sicilian grandmother, who pretends to be deaf, is the production's sterling 
fixture. Ever so quietly, she steals the show. Another actress, orange-beehived 
Virginia Bingham, is a lark. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3759 Cahuenga Blvd. West (Studio City), Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., 
Sundays, 2:30 p.m. and 7 p.m.; through May 28. Tickets: $12-$15. (213) 
472-0525. 
</P>
<P>
'Twelfth Night' 
</P>
<P>
The bard's wardrobe at the Globe Playhouse looks like something out of 
"Cabaret." Director Frederick Hoffman sees dark excesses in "Twelfth Night," 
enough, in fact, to set Shakespeare's bountiful comedy of love, lyricism and 
rowdy laughter in pre-Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It's a curious update that stretches awfully hard to make a discernible 
connection to the coming of the Black Shirts. Last year, the Company of Angels 
transported "Twelfth Night" ("If music be the food of love, play on") to the 
rock music scene in L.A. The palm tree metaphor at least had a point. The 
Globe's experiment seems irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, this is the traditional "Twelfth Night" in funny clothes. 
Notwithstanding an Art Deco phone and 1930s costumes (humorously designed by 
Ellie Shanahan), there's no visual design concept here to remind you we're in 
pre-war Germany. The period cries out for adventuresome design. 
</P>
<P>
For another thing, the sentimentality and self-deluding figures in "Twelfth 
Night" hardly suggest the coming of the Holocaust. The debauchery is leggy, 
though. One key player (Steve Peterson's super-stuffy Malvolio) attempts a 
guttural German accent that is incomprehensible, ruining an otherwise 
interesting performance. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, John Michalski's clown Feste is vivid but also suffers from overkill 
and garbled diction. Elsewhere, the text is well-spoken. Finally, the 
production is a mishmash. But if you can ignore the quirks, you can enjoy its 
strengths: Terence Marinan's misguided Duke Orsino, Koni McCurdy's deft dual 
role as the wondrous Viola and the male-disguised page Caesario, Robin 
Christiaens' amusing countess, and Alan Altshuld's geeky Sir Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1107 N. Kings Road, Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; through June 3. 
Tickets: $8.50-$17.50. (213) 654-5623. 
</P>
<P>
'Revolution in America' 
</P>
<P>
An absurdist piece on the corruption of our electioneering process, "Revolution 
in America," features the talented Jan Munroe as a political Dr. Frankenstein, 
a pollster who kills a senator he manufactures from cloth. 
</P>
<P>
Director Alec Doyle's production at Beyond Baroque is astutely and tightly 
produced, with a sort of magician's sleight of hand corresponding to the Munroe 
character's bag of tricks. So it comes as something of a rude shock to find 
that, despite its cleverness, "Revolution in America" is annoying, grueling and 
ultimately boring. 
</P>

Playwright Shem Bitterman has written what amounts to a discordant fugue on the 
maddening manipulators in our poll-happy society. But thematically Bitterman 
doesn't say anything new and, theatrically, the production is dry and rather 
chilly. 
</P>
<P>
The only whimsy comes from Jon Sharp's programmed senator talking without 
trousers, socks or shoes. George Shannon and Seth Isler lend able support. This 
is a show you expect to like and discover it leaves you exasperated. It's too 
facile for its own good.

 At 681 Venice Blvd., Venice, Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m.; through May 8. 
Tickets: $5-$8. (213) 822-3006.

THE ODD CHARACTERS OF 'CADILLAC JACK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
**** "Cadillac Jack" by Larry McMurtry. Read by Wolfram Kandinsky. Unabridged 
on 10 cassettes. Books on Tape. 
</P>
<P>
Larry McMurtry, author of "Lonesome Dove" and several other novels, is also an 
antiquarian book collector and dealer. The first person narrator of "Cadillac 
Jack" is a scout who makes a (good) living looking into flea markets, auctions 
and obscure shops from one end of the U.S. to the other, buying beautiful 
things for resale to dealers and collectors. He also collects women with rather 
more mixed results. The book is wonderfully satirical about Washington (where 
McMurtry now lives) and Texas (where he hails from) and all points in between. 
"Cadillac Jack" is rich in oddball characters, funny in its dissection of 
relationships, quite touching in the passionate detailing of the scout's love 
of objects rare, beautiful and bizarre, or all three. Kandinsky, who has read 
all of McMurtry's work for the label, has a laconic voice and a subtle command 
of American regional accents that fits the material like a caressing glove.

'ABSURD PERSON' STARTS AS A HOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The newly refurbished West End Playhouse in Van Nuys looks sharper than ever. 
But the same can't be said for its first production, Alan Ayckbourn's "Absurd 
Person Singular," as directed by Heidi Helen Davis. 
</P>
<P>
This three-act comedy, set in three successive kitchens on three Christmas 
Eves, can be a howl in the right circumstances. At the West End, the first two 
acts are something of a hoot, if not a howl. 
</P>
<P>
But the third act, when the Christmas cheer is at its least cheery, is another 
story. Davis' staging becomes duller, not darker. During the first half of the 
act, the actors are locked into uninteresting blocking patterns. Their dialogue 
no longer crackles. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't help that two long intermissions are required to transform the 
kitchen sets. While it's initially interesting to watch the stagehands do their 
jobs, watching them do it twice seems excessive and drags down the pace of the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even after all that remodeling, the second and third kitchens, supposedly 
more upscale, look no bigger than the first one. Set designer Nicholas Dorr 
hasn't solved this problem, which somehow wasn't as noticeable in earlier 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
The individual performances are stronger than the ensemble work. As the Mrs. 
Clean character, Rachel Dix is very funny, whether scrubbing inside her own 
washing machine or her host's oven. Neil Hunt is very adept as the bored 
banker, the sort of fellow who needs a vacation but wouldn't know what to do 
with it. Maggie Peach's costumes are eye-catching confirmations of the 
characters' personalities and classes. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7446 Van Nuys Blvd., Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 6 p.m., 
through June 11. Tickets: $15-$17.50; (818) 904-0444 or (213) 466-1767.

THE GALLERIES: THE VALLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
For artist and gallery owner Phillip Orlando, the way the figure is depicted 
can be telling. He sees in figurative representation something of a cultural 
mask that can simultaneously reinforce certain ideas or hide them from the 
uninitiated. This idea, pretty basic to social archeologists but not often 
discussed in relation to figurative art, forms the premise to his paintings and 
small constructions. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the naive, somewhat predictable paintings of African masks and spirit 
effigy don't add much to the notion. Like hero worship content with 
appearances, they seem happy to copy the artifacts in a sort of Dadaesque 
appreciation of the abstract figurative form. Meaning isn't amplified. 
Occasional pieces like "Marka With Shadow" look good and keep the original's 
mysterious aura of spirituality. But even collaged magazine photos can't 
connect the overall symbolism to this culture. 
</P>
<P>
In his trendy magazines turned trashy masks, however, Orlando sets up an 
interesting analysis of figuration-as-symbol in this culture. It's a point of 
view reflecting the harsh glare and hype of media promotion on ideas of 
sexuality and success. Not incidentally, the glitzy magazines make strangely 
empty masks. Fascinating yet repellent, they pointedly turn Orlando's cutting, 
collaging and painting into something part exorcism, part adolescent fan club.

MAKING MUSIC IS A POWERFUL EXPERIENCE FOR THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY CHORALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE ZIAYA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Margaret and Bob Rouse, both 67, have been married for 43 years. They met 
nearly half a century ago at Colorado Springs High School. Margaret had the 
lead role in Gilbert and Sullivan's "H.M.S. Pinafore." Bob was a string bass 
player in the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
They loved music then -- and still do. 
</P>
<P>
"Our music is a strong bond," Margaret said. And as members of the San Fernando 
Valley Chorale, the Van Nuys couple eagerly attend choral rehearsals each week 
at Our Saviour's Lutheran Church in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"When spouses go out separately, there can be a degree of resentment," Bob 
said. "But we go out to rehearsals together. It brings us closer." 
</P>
<P>
Every Tuesday evening, the Rouses blend their voices with about 30 other 
Chorale singers. Their repertoire includes a variety of music -- classical, 
liturgical, comedy, folk, motion picture themes, and of course, those 
ever-popular Broadway hits. 
</P>
<P>
The Rouses agree that the Chorale brings them a sense of accomplishment, 
relaxation and pleasure. Making music is fun. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, the Chorale has provided the opportunity for such qualities to 
dozens of non-professionals -- singers of all ages and from all walks of life. 
Started by John Ellis, who also founded the Burbank Civic Light Opera in 1950, 
the Chorale has, over the years, made appearances throughout the Valley and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There have been performances at convalescent homes, hospitals, meetings of 
civic organizations, churches and shopping malls. The group also has performed 
on a couple of occasions at the Music Center of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
and has regularly appeared at the Hall of Liberty in Forest Lawn with the Los 
Angeles Solo Repertory Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The Chorale has also performed with the Highland Park Symphony Orchestra and 
the Korean Philharmonic Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
For Chorale members like Carl Frain, 63, who served as the group's first 
president, it is the thrill of performing that keeps him coming back year after 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young, I thought I might be a Big Band singer -- me and everyone 
else," Frain reminisced. "In high school, I sang and acted. I've been singing 
all my life. There's nothing better to do than sing." 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, Frain did sing professionally, but his chief occupation was as a 
machinist. 
</P>
<P>
When he suffered two strokes two years ago, getting back to the Chorale served 
as a powerful incentive to recover. "I was singing within three or four 
months," he said. "When I got back into singing, it was good exercise. Like 
sports, your muscles build up. As soon as I got back, it helped me vocally." 
</P>
<P>
Joining the Chorale is relatively painless, said President Ron Blair. 
Interested vocalists simply show up at one of the rehearsals and start singing 
with the group. 
</P>
<P>
After three rehearsals, the prospective member can meet with the director, who 
has the power to accept the newcomer or not. More often than not, he or she is 
welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, a few people have been turned away, however. And some have been 
accepted who dropped out later. Blair remembers one man who had difficulty 
blending with the group. "He sang like he was in a bar," Blair recalled, 
laughing. "Eventually, he did quit." 
</P>
<P>
Besides attending weekly rehearsals, participants are required to meet a 
performance dress code and pay yearly dues of $50, which are used to offset the 
group's expenses, including payments to the Chorale's director and accompanist. 
</P>
<P>
Although joining is simple, in recent years, keeping the nonprofit group alive 
has been a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
A major difficulty has been finances. When the Chorale was started in 1974, it 
was sponsored by Los Angeles' Bureau of Music and received municipal funding. 
However, in July, 1986, the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department cut off the 
city's assistance. This resulted in a crunch for the Chorale, since its annual 
operating budget is between $4,000 and $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
To make ends meet, the group raises funds with regularly scheduled concerts and 
occasional special fund-raisers, and solicits donations from friends. Last 
summer they held a garage sale. 
</P>
<P>
"We're running on a shoestring," Blair said. They are actively seeking a 
sponsor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the financial problems, the Chorale recently faced another obstacle. In 
December, 1987, Robert Mantzke, the Chorale's popular director since 1984, died 
of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
To keep things running smoothly, the Chorale's board appointed member Margaret 
Blair interim director -- a move that made some members unhappy. "Maybe they 
weren't comfortable having a woman as a director," Ron Blair (no relation) 
said, "even though she was qualified." 
</P>
<P>
A division within the group ensued. In January, 1988, about 20 members decided 
to leave the Chorale to start a separate singing group. 
</P>
<P>
The schism added to the already low spirits of the Chorale. Yet, determined to 
prevail, in July, 1988, they selected Conrad Immel as a new director, and a new 
era began. 
</P>
<P>
As a Fulbright scholar, Immel had studied in Vienna and Italy before launching 
an eight-year operatic career in Germany and Austria. He has a master's degree 
in music literature and a bachelor's degree in voice from the University of 
Texas in Austin, and was an assistant professor of vocal arts at the USC for 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
Immel says that his standards are high, but that members of the Chorale share 
his enthusiasm for quality work. "My philosophy is that anything worth doing is 
worth doing well," he said. "With an amateur group, it just takes a little 
longer. Excellence in this type of situation is something worth striving for." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike former directors, Immel dedicates part of each rehearsal session to 
actually teaching vocal techniques. But it's not all hard work, he said. "I try 
to be funny," he said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
More important, he views the group as an outlet for creative expression and 
values its continued existence. "With TV and records, it is really easy to slip 
into the mode of letting other people make music," Immel said. "The Chorale 
provides members with the opportunity to sing great music from their heart and 
soul. It's an opportunity to project their emotion, and when they perform, to 
move other people, too. They are able to create a real special sense with the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Chorale presents two major concerts each year. On May 
21, it will perform at 3 p.m. at Our Saviour's Lutheran Church, 16603 San 
Fernando Mission Blvd., Granada Hills. Admission is by donation. For additional 
information about the Chorale, call (818) 891-2922.

A PASSEL OF PERSONAL PICKS THAT PASSED THE TACO-TRUCK TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every night, right down the street from my home, a pretty good taco truck parks 
and opens for business. I eat there often. After all, it's close, reasonable 
(75 cents a taco) and the food is fresh and wildly tasty. I can eat the tacos 
in the coziest of environments -- my own home -- and the service is direct, 
cheerful and non-problematic. 
</P>
<P>
The taco truck has also proved useful to me as a gauge to measure how I feel 
about a restaurant I'm reviewing. Sometimes, when I return home from a meal, 
I'm so satisfied and content that I don't even notice the truck. Other times, I 
feel reassured by its presence -- at least I know that there's something good 
to eat nearby. And other times, I gaze at it with yearning and frustration and 
think why why why did I drive all those miles and waste all that time and money 
to consume those awful calories when I would have been so much happier eating 
at the taco truck? 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, there have been some restaurants that have passed the taco-truck test. 
The following is a partial list of them. As it is drawn exclusively from my 
personal San Fernando Valley eating adventures, this list is in no way 
comprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
Fresco: This sophisticated Italian restaurant in Glendale is, hands down, the 
best Valley restaurant I visited this year. There are so many small courtesies 
from the attentive, professional staff -- so many nice touches and surprising 
flavors on the plate that after a while one can't help but feel pampered, safe 
and happy here. The decor might not be memorable, but since my last visit to 
Fresco I have been besieged with yearning for the lamb risotto, the stuffed 
quail and the excellent, definitive tirami su, (espresso-soaked ladyfingers 
with mascarpone cheese). 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. R.A. Sperry's Pantry: When people ask where they can get great, unusual 
food for practically no money, I taunt them for awhile and then send them to 
Mrs. R.A. Sperry's in Glendale. When my crotchety, hard-to-please, prudent old 
Uncle Jack wants to take me out to dinner, I have him take me there as well. 
Robert Alan Sperry is a genius with fish -- cooking, saucing, presenting it. 
Mrs. R.A. Sperry, Bernadette, is a genius with cakes and sweets. Try R.A.'s 
Chilean sea bass or Cajun catfish in a red pepper cream. Try Bernadette's Sans 
Rival Torte or, if she has it, her Italian cappuccino cake. The only thing I 
can't endorse are the dinner salads -- luckily, the homemade soups are 
generally excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Brio: Bernadette Sperry's brother, Andre Guerrero, owns this bright new Tarzana 
restaurant, which might well be the Valley's most ambitious and best California 
cuisineria. Since wild rice latkes and a sole tamale proved a little too . . . 
out there . . . for Brio's first customers, the menu has been toned down since 
opening night. But Andre is irrepressible, and keeps going out there with 
nightly specials. Whatever you do, don't leave Brio without eating a chocolate 
souffle: They puff up gorgeously and stay rich and custardy within. 
</P>
<P>
Angkor: This Cambodian restaurant in Encino is so new you may not find it in 
your phone book unless your most recent one has been delivered. The number is 
(818) 990-8491. It serves food that is spicy, delicious, refreshing, fragrant, 
surprising and utterly fresh. Here, for the first time, I ate banana blossoms 
(like big chewy leathery mushrooms), jackfruit (a mild, compelling, dense 
melon-type fruit) and winter melon (looks and tastes like a large cucumber). 
Now I want them all on a regular basis. I especially recommend the prawn salad 
with fresh herbs, the heady red curry chicken soup with pineapple and tamarind 
broth, and the beef with fresh sweet basil. 
</P>
<P>
El Silencio: This South American seafood restaurant will make you forget you're 
in Van Nuys. It makes the best ceviche, or marinated raw fish, in the Valley: 
juicy and gloriously, fearlessly seasoned; spicy enough to set a fire in the 
mouth and refreshing enough to quench it. Shrimp-lovers can chose the spicy 
camarones picante or the garlic-ridden camarones al ajo. Music-lovers might 
find a Peruvian band there on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Luna Rossa/Il Tiramisu/Lombardo's/Zios: Surely Sherman Oaks has more little 
neighborhood Italian joints per capita than any other town. And Sherman 
Oaksters are especially lucky to have these four. Although none is singularly 
spectacular, it's worthwhile to have a working knowledge of their individual 
strengths. Luna Rossa is great for capellini ala checca (angel-hair pasta with 
fresh tomatoes and basil), arancini (cheese-filled rice balls), pesto and other 
pizzas, as well as cafe au lait, but skip the entrees. Il Tiramisu has good 
pastas and salads and an excellent cheesy spinach calzone. Lombardo's has some 
great pastas: rotelle (cartwheels) in a dreamy, comforting tomato cream sauce 
and a simple but perfect ravioli in butter with fresh sage. Don't let the big 
papier mache creatures at Zio's scare you away from the antipasto selection, 
which just doesn't quit. Go for the bitter broccoli salad, the garlic beets, 
the canellini kidney beans with tuna, the dense earth-toned caponata (cooked 
vegetables with relish) and everything else in the case. I also liked a tender 
lemon-roasted chicken and a truly light lasagna made with ziti pasta, ricotta 
and a fresh tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Sanamluang Cafe: This little Thai fast-food joint serves some of the freshest 
and most authentic Thai food around. The chicken soup has a pristine, clear 
broth, white noodles and succulent steamed chicken. The fried rice biscuit is a 
little greasy but has a glorious, chewy texture. The yum-pla-krob is smoked 
fish that has been fried, bones and all, and dressed in lime juice and chile so 
that it's smoky and crunchy and juicy all at the same time. The Sanamluang Cafe 
is in the Bangluck Plaza in North Hollywood, so before or after eating there 
one can visit the shrine of the Brahma, the golden four-armed deity who is 
guarded by rows of brass and wooden elephants and draped with thick ropes of 
plastic flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Salomi: Archeologists of the future may be surprised to find vestiges of 
Moorish architecture in North Hollywood, but we were delighted to find 
spirited, full-flavored Indian cuisine at this almost-elegant restaurant. The 
chef here is a genius with the common onion. Try the onion bhaji, the fresh 
onion chutney, the chicken dupiaja, and chicken from the tandoor. If you want 
your third eye to open, order the food hot. 
</P>
<P>
El Rincon Taurino: If any place could compete with my taco truck and win, it's 
this Panorama City taco stand. Recently expanded to accommodate more eat-in 
customers, this popular take-out joint serves tacos made with the crunchiest 
Milanesa (breaded and fried steak) and chicharones, (fried pork rind), the 
smokiest asada (grilled steak) and the most pungent al pastor (grilled 
marinated pork and onions). Actually, everything on this mostly meat menu is 
the best of its type. Entertainment includes walls full of bullfighting 
memorabilia (including a bull head that somehow escaped the cabeza oven) and a 
very busy intersection where close calls and fender-benders are the order of 
the day. Cabeza, by the way, is a delicious barbecued head of beef.

NEW BREED OF COUCH POTATO COMES TO LIGHT: VIDEO FREAKS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIE LOVERS FIND HAPPINESS IN HEAVY DAILY DOSES OF TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMUEL GREENGARD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Scott Paluski gets off work and heads for home, he almost always stops off 
at his local video store. Watching movies, he will tell you, is a relaxing and 
enjoyable way to spend the evening. 
</P>
<P>
That might not seem unusual. But Paluski doesn't just watch a film or two, 
brush his teeth and head to bed. The 29-year-old Van Nuys resident, who runs 
his own delivery company, views as many as five videotapes in one evening. His 
head might not hit the pillow until 3 a.m. Then he must wake up three hours 
later to start work. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen just about everything," he admitted. "I enjoy watching films, 
studying different styles of acting and film making, and remembering the 
details of specific movies. It's definitely a hobby. It's something I really 
get into." 
</P>
<P>
Paluski has plenty of company. Over the last decade, as the selection of 
videotapes has ballooned and the price of renting has dropped, a whole new 
breed has been born: the video fanatics. They watch movies before they head to 
work, at lunch and until the wee hours of the morning. Many watch the same 
films over and over, and stand in line at their local video store to be the 
first to rent a new release. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, they forgo dates, social events, even relationships to stay at 
home and bask in the cathode rays of Tinseltown's latest hit. Said Jeff Balin, 
manager of the Odyssey in North Hollywood, one of the Valley's largest video 
rental outlets: "It's a form of video couch-potatoism, but it's not necessarily 
a bad thing. Basically, these are people who just love watching movies. They 
come from all walks of life -- there are doctors, lawyers, secretaries, you 
name it." 
</P>
<P>
The Odyssey, which stocks more than 25,000 titles, has a daily limit of five 
films per person. But, Balin pointed out, if he knows people well enough, he 
will allow them to rent additional tapes. He has had people rent as many as 10 
in a day. In fact, one customer has checked out 1,800 movies in the last 6 1/2 
months; half a dozen others have rented between 1,000 and 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, people have their favorite section -- drama, comedy, mystery, 
foreign films or action. They really get into it. We have people who know the 
adult film section so well they could work here. If we put something new up on 
the shelf, they are right there pulling it off," Balin said. 
</P>
<P>
At National Home Video in Chatsworth, which stocks about 6,000 titles, the 
scene is much the same. Several people regularly rent four or five tapes a 
night, and on weekends it's not unusual for people to rent 10 tapes. At this 
family-run operation, half a dozen people have rented more than 1,000 tapes 
during the last year. 
</P>
<P>
John Flower, a 26-year-old pharmacy technician from Canoga Park, is one of 
them. He and his wife and two children typically watch three to five tapes a 
day, three to five days a week. "I have a very stressful job, and after work 
it's nice to just sit around and watch films. It's something the entire family 
can do together." 
</P>
<P>
Flower usually stops at the video store at 6:30 p.m., heads home and watches a 
movie. The family eats dinner at 8 p.m. ("We don't review a film during dinner 
unless it's a new release we're dying to see") and then watches two or three 
more films in the evening. In fact, Flower has three VCRs in his home so that 
he and his wife can watch separate movies, and the children can have their own 
entertainment available. 
</P>
<P>
Scott James of North Hollywood, who works for MCA Music, is especially 
attracted to old classics. He has a film and video collection of about 300 
movies, and collects posters and memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday or Saturday, he will often rent 10 tapes from Eddie Brandt Video, a 
North Hollywood shop that allows customers to keep tapes for half a week for 
$2.50 each. Then he and his wife will watch them between other activities -- 
sometimes viewing as many as four in one night. 
</P>
<P>
The way James looks at it, video isn't a lot different from collecting baseball 
cards or art. He often studies books about movies and hunts down specific tapes 
for favorite actors such as Laurel and Hardy, Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart and 
William Powell. Taking a scholarly approach, he will work his way through an 
entire body of work by an actor or director. "It's a hobby that's fun, 
interesting and relaxing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's not unusual for videophiles to spend $25 to $50 a week renting tapes. Yet 
most see that as a bargain compared to the price of movie tickets, popcorn and 
soft drinks. And because many video stores feature special prices on certain 
days -- the Odyssey, for example, offers its selection for 99 cents Tuesdays 
and Thursdays -- they can afford to sample a great variety of films. 
</P>
<P>
But do they really watch all the videotapes? "I watch most of them," said 
Paluski, who estimates that he has seen 5,000 videotapes in the last five years 
or so. "If it is a real dog, I shut it off. But I usually try and force myself 
to stick it out." Flower added: "Sometimes we will do household chores while 
the film is going. If you have seen it before, you can usually follow along 
with the sound." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, for true fanatics, video viewing is nothing less than a science. Most 
make heavy use of the scanning feature on their VCR to look for interesting 
scenes -- which they'll view at regular speed -- and skip over parts of the 
movie that seem unappealing. As Flower put it: "It can save a lot of time and 
allow you to watch other films you're more interested in." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, all have their favorites. The Flowers have watched "Willow" half a 
dozen times and such comedies as "Airplane" and "History of the World Part I" 
several times with friends. Paluski's favorites include "The Dead Pool," 
"Crocodile Dundee II," "Clean and Sober," "Platoon" and "Full Metal Jacket." 
</P>
<P>
"I've probably seen most major releases at least twice," Paluski said. "When 
you watch a film more than once, you pick up things in the plot that you didn't 
notice before. There's always something new." 
</P>
<P>
Cult favorites such as "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," "Pink Flamingos," 
"Eating Raoul" and old Twilight Zone episodes score high on the list, too. 
They're especially popular for video parties, where groups sometimes watch 
films all night long. "A lot of times it doesn't matter how many times you've 
seen the film before. With friends, you can joke around and everyone can join 
in and say the lines," Flower said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the gourmands of the video world who can watch just about 
anything. Tom Harvey, a clerk at National Home Video, said customers frequently 
ask him to pick out their nightly entertainment. "I've had people ask me to 
suggest five good action films. I name a few titles, and they say, 'That's 
fine, I'll rent them.' They trust you to make good choices for them." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, friends and spouses don't always share a videophile's enthusiasm for 
watching an endless stream of movies. One San Fernando Valley woman named Karen 
recently broke off a relationship with a boyfriend because he watched as many 
as three videotapes a night an average of three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It drove me nuts," she said. "I couldn't get him to go out and do anything. It 
got completely boring, but he would deny that he was spending so much time 
watching videos. He didn't think there was a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, video viewing "can become an addictive behavior, like food, alcohol or 
drugs," said Alan Solomon, a Torrance-based psychologist who has counseled 
video addicts. "It can interfere with other aspects of a person's life. In some 
cases, the technology is controlling the person instead of the person 
controlling the technology." 
</P>
<P>
Even Paluski admits that he is subjected to a certain amount of kidding about 
his hobby. "Some of my friends think it's kind of crazy to watch so many films, 
but since most of them watch a lot of videotapes themselves, they don't say too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
But most videophiles don't mind putting their life on horizontal hold to watch 
hundreds, even thousands of tapes. Said James: "Not everybody can understand 
why someone wants to watch so many films. It might seem a bit obsessive. But I 
really enjoy it, and that's what counts."

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: FOOD THAT COMFORTS AT DA PASQUALE

No picture this week, because there's not a lot to look at. The best cheap 
restaurant in Beverly Hills is just a coffee shop with a counter and two of the 
most uncomfortable tables it will ever be your misfortune to sit at. But if 
food interests you more than ambience, you'll want to know about Da Pasquale, 
9749 Santa Monica Blvd., (213) 859-3884. 
</P>
<P>
"If we make some money," says Pasquale, the former pizza chef at Angeli, "we'll 
take out the counter and put in some tables." Meanwhile his guests sit on 
stools eating baskets of his wonderful bread, burning their tongues on his 
calzoni and devouring the panini. The pasta dishes are mostly in the $6 range, 
and the most expensive item on the menu, osso buco, is $9.50. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not in the mood for breakfast,lunch or dinner (they serve all three), 
you might just want to have a cappucino and some of the best tiramisu in town. 
"The recipe's my mother's," says Pasquale, "perhaps you've tasted it at my 
parents' restaurant, Trattoria Nanni?"RUTH REICHL

CD CORNER: COMPILATIONS SPOTLIGHT CLASSICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ever wonder what the pop hit parade sounded like just before the rock 'n' roll 
explosion? 
</P>
<P>
"Radio Classics of the '50s," just released by Columbia Records, wasn't 
designed to answer that curiosity because Elvis Presley and Little Richard were 
already dominating the pop charts by the time several of these 14 selections 
(including Johnny Mathis' "Chances Are" and Johnny Horton's "The Battle of New 
Orleans") were on the charts. 
</P>
<P>
The reason the 40-minute package -- whose other selections range from Tony 
Bennett's "Rags to Riches" and Rosemary Clooney's "Hey There" to Doris Day's 
"Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera, Sera)" and Frankie Laine's "High Noon" -- 
serves as a sampler of pre-rock pop is that Columbia Records didn't begin 
signing rock acts until the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
There are some other noteworthy moments in "Radio Classics" (including Marty 
Robbins' "El Paso" and Louis Armstrong's "Mack the Knife"), but the only record 
with a trace of the raw intensity of rock was Johnnie Ray's R&amp;B-influenced 
"Cry," a highly influential 1951 hit that is often overlooked in discussions of 
the evolution of rock. 
</P>
<P>
"Radio Classics" is part of a new budget series of nostalgic albums from 
Columbia. Each package contains colorful liner notes that detail the histories 
of the records involved, though the dividing line between pop and rock in some 
of the collections is fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
The other Columbia budget collections available in CD: "Pop Classics of the 
'60s" (34-minutes, ranging from O.C. Smith's "Little Green Apples" to the 
Byrds' "Mr. Tambourine Man"), "Rock Classics of the '60s" (41 minutes, from 
Santana's "Evil Ways" to Bob Dylan's "Rainy Day Women . . ."), "Pop Classics of 
the '70s" (44 minutes, from Toto's "Hold the Line" to Dr. Hook's "Sylvia's 
Mother"), "Rock Classics of the '70s" (52 minutes, from Mountain's "Mississippi 
Queen" to Janis Joplin's "Me and Bobby McGee). 
</P>
<P>
Another new compilation from RCA Records focuses on the Broadway pop tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Showstoppers" is a generous, 64-minute sampler of Broadway tunes, mostly from 
the '20s and '30s. The selections range from Fanny Brice's "Second-Hand Rose" 
and Paul Robeson's "Ol' Man River" to composers Cole Porter and Harold Arlen 
offering their own vocal interpretations of their respective "You're the Top" 
and "Stormy Weather."

AT THE GALLERIES /DAVID LEWINSON: GABER'S FORCEFUL PAINTINGS DELVE INTO 
CULTURE'S PSYCHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Lewinson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harley Gaber's visual art was last seen locally in 1985 at the now-closed 
Photography Gallery. There, he exhibited Polaroids, photo collages and 
representations of his involvement with avant-garde music, a domain in which he 
has distinguished himself over a 25-year period that includes two album-length 
recordings of his compositions. 
</P>
<P>
Gaber's activity in visual media dates back only a decade and, until recently, 
consisted mostly of the types of work in the 1985 show. Thus the unmitigated 
style of paintings on view in his exhibition at the Gwydion Gallery in La Jolla 
is new to him. 
</P>
<P>
The show bears the enigmatic title "The Imperial Army Marches Backward in 
History." The major works on view are large canvases bearing frightful, often 
freakish images of Buddhas, witch doctors, embryos and gooey faces. Their style 
recalls the figurative expressions (a la DeKooning) produced in quantity in the 
United States and Europe during the 1950s and early '60s, as evidenced by the 
paint slashed in thick blobs onto some of the canvases and, in an apparent 
contradiction, applied to others with a palette knife in a manner that results 
in a finicky surface resembling Byzantine mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
Gaber, who lives in La Jolla, describes the paintings as attempts to explore 
past-life experiences that he feels survive within his psyche. Regardless of 
whether one believes in such a possibility, the notion, especially when 
conjoined to the disturbing imagery, tempts invocation of one of the most 
problematic modes of art appreciation in circulation these days: that of 
playing amateur psychiatrist, which appears to become more attractive to people 
the more the art affronts their taste and sense of propriety. 
</P>
<P>
Giving in to this temptation, however, merely sidesteps the challenges that 
such art poses in favor of the relative safety of systems that try to account 
for why the artist is being so uncooperative. It also injects the implication 
that such behavior -- that is, such art -- is a sign of something "wrong" in 
the artist's personality. But this is too easy a way around the work. Gaber's 
considerable accomplishments, in music at least, elevate him far above being 
dismissible as a flake or crackpot. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Gaber's ferocious imagery, in neat concert with his handling of 
form, address conflicts and consternations that are symptomatic not only of the 
workings of a single personality but of contemporary culture in general. This 
should constitute attractive material for any lively mind, yet psychological 
systems have few resources capable of responding to the remarkably clumsy yet 
elegant force of Gaber's style. 
</P>
<P>
As suggested above, it's not so much in the paintings that Gaber is 
particularly successful. These come across as excited first steps into paint 
and large formats, and seem adolescently strident in both their hyper-worked 
surfaces and their insistence on conveying what is highly problematic material 
(the past-life experiences). Although there may be a cult appeal to such 
imagery and ideology, there's not much beyond it. 
</P>
<P>
Gaber is much more successful and communicative in a number of smaller, more 
informal paintings on rice paper that date mostly from this year. A series of 
such works, titled "I Quattro Fiori" (The Four Flowers), combines black 
gestural outlines of primitive figures with collage elements taken from fashion 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting images of elegantly made-up lips, fingernails and eyes, conjoined 
to the crude and visceral figures, offer a surprisingly poignant assessment of 
the role of artifice and affectation in the ideal images we have of ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Another group of these painted collages juxtaposes cultural emblems such as a 
group of cherubs from a Baroque painting or part of a Hindu sculptural frieze 
with the stark figure outlines. Here, too, basic sensibilities and impulses, 
symbolized by the crude figures, collide with cultural forms that exist outside 
the individual, where they dictate the normative terms of what reality is, what 
life means and how to behave properly. 
</P>
<P>
If an individual starts to ask too many questions about these terms -- in other 
words, doesn't conform -- conflict results. Yet without such conflicts, in the 
individual and in society, the world would never change. 
</P>
<P>
To assert that the artist's role is to give form to such conflicts is a bit of 
a cliche, but it's an accurate one, except it has things backward. What happens 
is that artists can't do anything but play that role. It's a direct consequence 
of a serious involvement with art making, a striving to work at that edge where 
what is faces what's possible. That can be a very turbulent, uncertain location 
for the simple reason that time and habit haven't had the chance to wrap 
everything up into neat, seamless sets of conventions. 
</P>
<P>
It's not all chaos out there, however. The third and latest group of paintings 
and photo-collage reveal Gaber working more confidently and deliberately. The 
spirit images he pursues so excitedly in the large paintings are evident here, 
but they are much more accessible and, therefore, much more plausible. 
</P>
<P>
The techniques and expressiveness of Gaber's earlier efforts come together in 
this group in a way that suggests he has found a niche in visual form that 
satisfies his needs as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
One work from this group, a depiction of an Indian in ceremonial dress, is 
titled "Revelation." The designation aptly describes the passions and processes 
of Harley Gaber's plunge into art making. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition continues through June 16 at 7825 Fay Ave. For information on 
gallery hours, call 456-3737.

A committee of the National Religious Broadcasters has urged Paul F. Crouch, 
president of Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting Network, to seek "Christian 
arbitration" to resolve a bitter dispute with a former business associate. The 
decision appears to be at least a partial victory for Crouch's longtime 
adversary, the Rev. Keith A. Houser of Dallas, who has sought such a resolution 
for nearly three years. The NRB's five-member Ethics Committee strongly 
recommended that Crouch and Houser submit the "alleged business practices that 
relate to contractual disputes" to "a recognized Board of Christian 
Arbitration." Houser said he welcomed the finding. Efforts to reach Crouch were 
unsuccessful. In his complaint last year to the Ethics Committee, Houser 
accused Crouch of unethical conduct in connection with Trinity's 1981 purchase 
of WTBY-TV in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., which Houser helped found.

Thousands of protesters demonstrated in 11 South Korean cities on the 
anniversary of the 1980 uprising in the southwestern city of Kwangju, burning 
effigies of President Roh Tae Woo and calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops 
from the country. In Kwangju, an estimated 100,000 people rallied, while in 
Seoul and other cities, thousands joined marches, protests and religious 
services. The 10-day Kwangju uprising, which killed nearly 200 people by 
official count, hundreds more by unofficial reports, occurred after Roh's 
predecessor, Chun Doo Hwan, declared martial law and jailed opposition leaders.

Eighty people were hurt when rival members of Mexico's oil workers' union, 
still feuding after the arrest of their powerful boss in January, clashed over 
control of a union local in Veracruz state, about 135 miles east of Mexico 
City. Police said that about 200 club-swinging workers stormed union 
headquarters in the oil town of Poza Rica in a bid to oust members of a rival 
faction that had seized the building. Police broke up the clash but made no 
arrests, a spokesman said. The skirmish apparently pitted union members backing 
the new national leadership against followers of Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, who 
was arrested on arms-smuggling and murder charges in January.

An all-white jury in Mobile, Ala., convicted a former Ku Klux Klansman of 
murder for supplying the rope and pistol used to abduct and kill a black 
teen-ager who was strangled and strung up in a tree. The conviction of Benjamin 
Franklin Cox, 27, was the third successful prosecution in six years in the 1981 
slaying of 19-year-old Michael Donald. A federal jury in 1987 ordered the 
United Klans of America, then the nation's biggest klan organization, to pay $7 
million to Donald's mother. Cox whispered, "I love you" to his weeping wife, 
Gail, before he was led away in handcuffs. Cox, a truck driver, could receive 
10 years to life in prison. Circuit Judge Michael Zoghby revoked Cox's $28,000 
bail and set sentencing for June 23.

Foreigners with AIDS will be allowed to seek 30-day visas to enter this country 
on business, attend conferences or visit relatives, the Justice Department 
said. New regulations to be issued by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service allowing such travel were drafted following last month's dispute over 
the detention of a Dutch AIDS patient en route to a conference in San Francisco 
on the deadly disease, department spokesman David Runkel said.

2ND CONDOR CHICK HATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A California condor chick hatched at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, bringing 
the endangered bird's population to its highest level in more than 20 years, a 
park official said. The chick was the second in the last month to hatch at the 
park in Escondido. Its arrival raised the condor population to 30 for the first 
time in two decades, said Tom Hanscom, a park spokesman. A third hatching is 
expected soon from an egg laid at the Los Angeles Zoo and transferred to the 
Escondido park, Hanscom said. The latest hatching is part of a captive breeding 
program designed to save North America's largest land bird from extinction. All 
California condors known to exist are in captivity -- 16 at the park and 14 at 
the Los Angeles Zoo.

Record shipments of cocaine and its more addictive derivative, crack, are 
threatening to turn Europe's serious drug problem into a disaster, a British 
government minister said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a plague we are visiting on ourselves," Home Secretary Douglas Hurd 
said at the opening of a two-day meeting of the Pompidou Group, which links 19 
Council of Europe countries.

He added, "The North American markets have been saturated and the cocaine 
barons of Latin America are now driving their product into Europe."

An Interpol report showed that the amount of cocaine seized in Europe rose from 
341 pounds in 1978 to over six tons last year.

ROUND ONE OF HAL WALLIS CASE; 
</P>
<P>
LACMA LOSES PLEA FOR HOLD ON SALE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A state judge in New York has denied the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's 
request for a court order freezing the $39.6 million sale proceeds from an art 
auction last week until a legal dispute over the funds can be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The museum contends that eight Impressionist paintings on permanent loan to the 
museum were fraudulently reclaimed by a foundation set up by the late film 
producer Hal B. Wallis. It had asked for a temporary restraining order blocking 
transfer of auction sale proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Justice William Davis, of the state Supreme Court -- the trial level comparable 
to Los Angeles County Superior Court -- denied the museum's request at a 
Thursday morning hearing. However, Davis agreed to a second hearing to 
determine how the money will be held until the museum's suit is settled. 
</P>
<P>
Davis scheduled another hearing in the case for June 6 after attorneys for the 
museum, the Wallis foundation and Christie's agreed late Thursday to establish 
a formal escrow account in which the sale proceeds will be held pending 
disposition of the case. 
</P>
<P>
The museum had sought the restraining order to impound money generated by the 
May 10 auction sale of eight Impressionist paintings from Wallis's collection 
that were removed from the museum in early January by the Wallis Foundation, 
headed by Wallis' son, Brent. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art filed its suit Wednesday in New York 
demanding award of the sale proceeds, commissions earned at the sale by 
Christie's and a sum equal to the future appreciation of the artworks while the 
litigation is in progress. In New York, an attorney representing the Wallis 
Foundation said the organization would seek to have the county museum's action 
dismissed on grounds that New York state courts have no jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute centers on a document the museum contends is a binding set of 
written instructions by Wallis to his foundation's trustees, signed two weeks 
before his death in October, 1986, stipulating that the paintings in question 
be turned over to the museum on permanent loan. 
</P>
<P>
The document adds that, if the paintings are withdrawn, they must be displayed 
permanently at another publicly owned museum. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Glassman, a Los Angeles lawyer who is secretary of the Wallis Foundation, 
said Thursday that the signed letter of instruction was not legally binding on 
the foundation board. Glassman said the "museum understood that the loan of the 
paintings was not a gift and would be for an indefinite period of time." 
</P>
<P>
But, said Glassman, "there always remained the possibility that if the 
circumstances were such that, if the foundation believed it would be in the 
best interests of its charitable purposes to sell the paintings, it had that 
right." Much of the dispute between the museum and foundation may depend on 
seven words in the instruction letter saying the loan was for "a definite or 
indefinite period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Loss of the Wallis collection was the second recent major blow to the Los 
Angeles County museum. In January, 1988, industrialist Armand Hammer withdrew 
an earlier commitment to donate $250 million worth of his own art collection 
and announced a plan to build his own museum in Westwood to house it. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, court documents emerged in a related case in federal court in New 
York that indicate that many of the same paintings from the Wallis collection 
figured in a bizarre series of events in 1980 and 1981. The episode was largely 
kept out of public view at the time, according to Jeremy Epstein, an attorney 
for Wildenstein &amp; Co., Inc., a New York gallery that has emerged as a 
central figure in the new dispute. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Wallis' wife, 
former actress Martha Hyer, was allegedly fleeced by three "confidence men" in 
Los Angeles who eventually offered for sale to a gallery in New York City two 
of the paintings that figure most prominently in the new dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The court pleadings identify the trio as Harold Pruett, Gerhard Whiffin and 
Rory Keegan. Harold Pruett eventually emerged, in 1986, as a central figure in 
a $5-million Los Angeles ponzi scheme and was convicted on fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Wallis, whom Hal Wallis wed in 1966, was the film producer's second 
wife. His first wife, the mother of Brent Wallis, was actress Louise Fazenda, 
who died in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Wildenstein, the court filing contends, subsequently sold the pictures back to 
Wallis in exchange for a contract -- now the subject of the federal court 
litigation in question -- in which Wallis allegedly agreed to allow Wildenstein 
to sell off his art collection after his death. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, it was Wildenstein that learned of the existence of the disputed 
letter of instructions signed by Wallis and informed the museum of the 
document's existence. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildenstein court documents allege that, in 1980, Martha Wallis sought to 
borrow $1 million for purposes that were not stated at the time. Other court 
documents indicate that Mrs. Wallis had occasional financial problems. Wallis's 
initial instructions setting up a trust in his name specify that, in the event 
of his death, any outstanding debts incurred by Martha Wallis be satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Wallis, according to an attorney who has represented the Wallis family, 
resides in Santa Fe, N.M. Attempts to reach her were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildenstein court documents say that, in December, 1980, Mrs. Wallis turned 
over paintings, including works by Monet and Gauguin, to the three men and that 
the works were later used as collateral for loans without the knowledge of Hal 
Wallis. 
</P>
<P>
Two paintings by Frederick Remington were eventually sold, the court documents 
indicate, but were later recovered by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1981, the documents contend, two works that are involved in the new 
dispute were offered to Wildenstein by two men who claimed to represent Martha 
Wallis. The works are Claude Monet's "Le Parlement, Coucher de Soleil" and Paul 
Gauguin's "The Field of Derout-Lollichon," a Brittany landscape. The Monet was 
sold in the Christie's auction for $14.3 million. The Gauguin was given to the 
Los Angeles County museum in a separate transaction by the foundation in 1987 
and remains on display there. 
</P>
<P>
The Christie's auction also included such works as Mary Cassatt's "Mother, Sara 
and the Baby," which went for $3.85 million, Monet's "Asters," which went for 
$9.35 million, Edgar Degas' "Sur la Scene," sold for $6.6 million, and a river 
view by Camille Pissarro, which brought $2.31 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wallis, the court filings indicate, did not learn of the 1981 sale of the Monet 
and Gauguin works until after it had been completed, at which point the film 
producer tried to regain possession. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildenstein court filings contend that it was in the confusion after the 
gallery purchased the two works in 1981 -- for $650,000 -- that the Wildenstein 
organization agreed to sell them back to Wallis in return for the agreement 
that Wildenstein would be the selling agent if the works were ever sold. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery's own filings indicate that Wildenstein held out in an attempt to 
keep the disputed artworks in a tug-of-war with the late film producer, who is 
perhaps best known as the producer of the 1943 classic "Casablanca." 
</P>
<P>
The status of that agreement eventually led Wildenstein to attempt 
unsuccessfully to block the May 10 Christie's auction on grounds it had 
exclusive rights to act as selling agent for the Wallis collection. 
</P>

Times researcher Charles Hirshberg in New York contributed to the reporting of 
this story.

METALLICA, WOODSTOCK TAPES COMING IN JUNE

The critically praised band Metallica has (almost) given speed-metal rock a 
good name -- especially among video dealers, who have sold an astounding 
175,000 copies of the group's "$19.95 Home Vid: Cliff 'Em All." Those same 
video dealers -- along with fans -- will be happy to hear that June will bring 
another Metallica cassette from Elektra Entertainment: "Metallica: 2 of One," 
consisting of two versions of the song "One," one of them about 10 minutes and 
incorporating scenes from the film "Johnny Got His Gun." 
</P>
<P>
If Metallica is a little too, uh, '80s for you, you might prefer this news: 
"Woodstock" is coming out on video June 28 (August marks the 20th anniversary 
of the festival). Warner will put out a letter-boxed version for $29.98 
(laserdisc, $39.98). Cable channels MTV and VH-1 will also be showing the film 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
"Rain Man" arrives Aug. 30 from MGM/UA with a Buick commercial attached but 
(uh-oh!) no price break for buyers ($89.95). Other coming releases: "Twins" 
(June 15), "The Accidental Tourist" (June 28), "Bird" (June 21), "Talk Radio" 
(July 13), "My Stepmother Is an Alien" (June 8), "Crusoe" (July 12), the Marx 
Brothers' first movie "The Cocoanuts" (July 13) and, turning back to music, 
"New Order: Substance" (June 6). 
</P>
<P>
The Bargain Bin: "Beetlejuice," "Innerspace," "Barfly," "Dancers" and "The 
Mosquito Coast" will be reduced by Warner from the $80-$90 range to $19.98 on 
July 19. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 American Film Institute Video Festival will be held Oct. 26-29 in Los 
Angeles, and the deadline for submitting videos is June 1. Meanwhile, tonight 
AFI is hosting the L.A. premiere of "Motorist," a 70-minute video by Chip Lord 
(co-founder of Ant Farm). Information: (213) 856-7787. 
</P>
<P>
Like to add a videodisc player to your home-tech equipment but you've been 
scared off by the high prices? Pioneer Electronics may have the answer -- it 
will soon be marketing the cheapest combination laserdisc/CD machine yet. The 
CLD-1070 retails for $600, which means it should sell for maybe $100 less when 
it reaches stores in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
"Coming to America" (Paramount, no suggested retail price) came to video stores 
Wednesday with a soft-drink commercial. Eddie Murphy plays an African prince 
who chooses Queens, N. Y., to search for a bride. Arsenio Hall plays the 
prince's best friend. John Landis directed this R-rated 1988 comedy, which 
grossed about $130 million at America's theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The sexy "Stealing Heaven" (Virgin, $89.95) came to theaters very recently, but 
also arrived at video stores Wednesday -- in both its R-rated version and a 
more explicit unrated version. The Clive Donner-directed film concerns the 
legendary 12th-Century romance of Abelard and Heloise. 
</P>
<P>
Other new movies-on-tape, all from CBS/Fox: "Halloween 4: The Return of Michael 
Myers" ($89.98, 1988, R), "The Other" ($59.98, 1972, PG), "Spellbinder" 
($79.98, 1988, R). 
</P>
<P>
OTHER VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
In the half-hour "Yellowstone Aflame," Holiday Video chronicles how the 
national park looked before, during and after last year's huge fires. Holiday 
also has a new 56-minute tape on "Everglades National Park," also for $29.95. 
Information: (213) 945-3325.

</P>
<P>

$15 MOVIES ARE IN THE PICTURE FROM PARAMOUNT AND HBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember when you had to wait several years for your favorite movie, initially 
priced at $80 or $90, to drop to $30 or maybe even $25? 
</P>
<P>
Now you may only have to wait 18 months -- and the price may be under $15. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount and HBO are leading the low-price charge with late summer releases in 
that price range. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Sept. 16, HBO will market horror titles such as "Return of the Living 
Dead," "Howling II" and "Dawn of the Dead" for $14.99. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's 15-title package, due Aug. 2, is much more impressive. Included are 
such hits as "Beverly Hills Cop," "Witness," "Flashdance," "Trading Places," 
"48 HRS." and the four "Star Trek" movies -- at $14.95 each. 
</P>
<P>
Movies priced this cheaply on home video are not new. IVE offered a Rambo movie 
for $14.95 last year, for example, but generally, most of the low-priced movies 
weren't major titles. Nor were they good-quality tapes. They were made for 
viewing at the slowest VCR speed, which saves tape and, consequently, money for 
the manufacturers. But at that slow speed, images are not as sharp, the colors 
are not as vivid and the audio is frequently uneven. 
</P>
<P>
The Paramount and HBO releases, however, are at SP -- the fastest speed. 
</P>
<P>
Fans shouldn't be thanking Paramount and HBO for dropping prices. They should 
be thanking mass merchants such as Target and K mart, who have revolutionized 
the home-video sales market. These mass merchants have begun stocking 
low-priced tapes strictly for sales, leaving rentals to video retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"The expansion of the mass-merchant market allows us to market these titles at 
a lower price," said Eric Doctorow, Paramount's senior vice president and 
general manager. "If the only market was video retailers, we wouldn't be 
dropping prices like this. Most of these $15 tapes will be shipped to mass 
merchants." 
</P>
<P>
That's because they can make up for in volume what the studio is giving up in 
profit margin on each low-priced cassette, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Will the price drop much below $15? 
</P>
<P>
"We have no plans for market titles at a lower price in the near future," 
Doctorow said. "Going lower isn't profitable for us." 
</P>
<P>
But some of these low-priced titles will be available at even lower prices 
anyway. They'll be discounted by the mass merchants, possibly as low as 
$11-$12. 
</P>
<P>
Though no other major video companies have any immediate plans to drop their 
prices below $15, industry speculation is that they will soon climb aboard the 
low-pricing bandwagon. It's not likely that they'll leave that growing market 
to Paramount and HBO.

1 KILLED, 2 HURT AS CAR VEERS, FLIPS AND CRASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman was killed and two family members, including her 11-year-old grandson, 
were severely injured when their car veered out of control on the San Diego 
Freeway, became airborne, flipped over and crashed into a tree. 
</P>
<P>
The accident shut down a section of the freeway for 2 hours. Special heavy 
rescue equipment and nearly two dozen firefighters were needed to free the 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
"Investigators said they all would have been fatally injured if they all hadn't 
been wearing seat belts," California Highway Patrol Officer Leslie Lazo said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the accident occurred about 11:15 a.m. as the driver, Huyn Sook Cho, 
30, of Los Angeles, was southbound on the San Diego Freeway, approaching the 
transition to the eastbound Garden Grove Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Cho, driving a 1988 Hyundai at about 70 m.p.h., tried to change lanes to the 
left but saw a vehicle approaching, so she swerved back to her right. The sharp 
movement made the vehicle fishtail, Cho lost control and her car veered to the 
right, Lazo said. 
</P>
<P>
The car struck a curb and became airborne for about 80 feet, flipping on its 
side, she said. The top of the car hit a tree down an embankment and came to 
rest on its right side. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger in the right front seat was killed, Lazo said. A coroner's 
official identified the woman as Yon-Ok Cho, 65, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The driver and her 11-year-old son, David Hwang, who was sitting in the left 
rear seat, were rushed to UCI Medical Center after they were cut out of the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
The boy is in critical condition, the mother in guarded condition.

PEOPLE / KENNETH T. YAMADA: FAMILY TRAGEDY SPURS CHP OFFICER TO LECTURE 
STUDENTS ABOUT DRUNK DRIVING

<TEXT>
<P>
Haunted by the deaths of an aunt and two teen-age cousins in an accident caused 
by a drunk 17-year-old driver a decade ago, California Highway Patrol Officer 
Al Arredondo is determined to keep drunk drivers off the road. 
</P>
<P>
So while on the job, he keeps his eyes open for drunk drivers. And after work, 
Arredondo organizes high school assemblies, talks to driver-education classes 
and lectures community groups. He sometimes asks victims of drunk-driving 
accidents to help him spread the message that drinking and driving are a deadly 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're on the road (on patrol), you don't ever feel like you're doing 
enough," said Arredondo, 35. Arresting a couple of drunks a night is not the 
answer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His message is especially urgent during spring, he said, the season of proms, 
graduation parties and consequently, drunk-driving arrests. While off duty, the 
6-year California Highway Patrol veteran and Orange resident spoke at more than 
40 Orange County schools last year. He also is a volunteer with the Orange 
County chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and has spearheaded a 
springtime campaign that has so far taken him to five high schools in an effort 
to keep celebrations from turning to tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
High school students are especially at risk, Arredondo said, because, "they are 
inexperienced drinkers and inexperienced drivers." Such students, he said, "are 
still at the age when a driver's license is a big thing." 
</P>
<P>
Youths face peer pressure to try drugs and alcohol, a pressure that he hopes 
his 9-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son can withstand. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to let other students put pressure on (my children) to risk their 
lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arredondo, who is assigned to a CHP office in South Los Angeles, said he wants 
to spread his message to Orange County teen-agers because many of them tend to 
have more mobility, money and access to cars than teen-agers in less affluent 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Arredondo spoke to a group of 400 students at University High School 
in Irvine. He warned students: If you drink, don't drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be stupid," he said. "Use your options." 
</P>
<P>
Call a friend, relative or cab to pick you up, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
At the assembly, Arredondo invited KEZY disc jockey Mark (The Shark) McKay to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
"Call me," McKay told the students. "If you can't find one person, if no one 
else understands, then call me. I'm totally serious." 
</P>
<P>
McKay, 22, said he will suggest options and solutions for students who find 
themselves too drunk to drive home. 
</P>
<P>
McKay said his memories of a happy school prom were shattered when his 
girlfriend, who had been drinking, stepped on her car's gas pedal instead of 
the brake, flipping the car and killing her 2 weeks before prom night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a stupid way to die," McKay said. "It's not fun to spend the day before 
your high school graduation in a . . . church." 
</P>
<P>
Arredondo also asked James P. Quinn to speak. Arredondo first saw Quinn 3 years 
ago, lying on a highway with a severely fractured skull. On that night, 
Arredondo reached down and failed to detect a pulse. Quinn was dead. Or so 
Arredondo thought. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Arredondo discovered that Quinn, 25, was alive. 
</P>
<P>
At the assembly, Quinn stood up and spoke to a hushed audience. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, he said, a friend gave him a ride from a Halloween party. They 
had both been drinking. Their car grazed another car before even pulling out of 
a driveway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so loaded I didn't have enough sense to get out of the car then," Quinn 
said. He stayed in the car, which eventually flipped in the near-fatal 
accident. The driver, he said, later pleaded guilty to felony drunk-driving 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn concluded by saying, "If you choose the life of a drug addict or an 
alcoholic, there (are) only two places you could end up: in prison or in hell." 
</P>
<P>
The message, Arredondo said, is: "Remember your options."

</P>
<P>
PLIGHT OF RAIN FORESTS SPARKS 3,000-MILE RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To raise awareness about the world's diminishing rain forests, Lucian Spataro 
will start a 3,000-mile horseback ride from Huntington State Beach to New 
Jersey at 5 a.m. today as part of "Ride Across America," sponsored by the 
Rainforest Action Network. 
</P>
<P>
Spataro, 31, the president of an electronics company in Tucson, Ariz., will 
ride an Arabian horse named Sweet William for the 4- to 5-month journey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a romantic thing that people talk about doing all the time, and I 
always wanted to do it," Spataro said. "But the issue is the No. 1 reason why I 
am doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Spataro and Sweet William will make up to 100 stops for rallies and 
presentations, said Randy Hayes, executive director of the Rainforest Action 
Network. Their first stop will be in Riverside on Saturday.

COMPANY COVERS PIT FULL OF TOXIC WASTE; 
</P>
<P>
FUMES FROM 48-FOOT-DIAMETER POND IRRITATED NEIGHBORS OF SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The beleaguered owners of a contaminated landfill in Huntington Beach covered a 
48-foot-wide toxic pit on the property Thursday to stifle a stench that has 
bothered neighbors for decades. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Ascon Properties also moved one step closer toward final 
settlement of a $7-million lawsuit filed 19 months ago by state health and 
anti-pollution agencies seeking cleanup of the site. The company's lender has 
foreclosed on the property. 
</P>
<P>
As Ascon Vice President John Lindsey stood beside the sump, workers laid final 
touches on a round, black rubberized sheet that will keep the highly toxic pond 
of styrene-type ooze protected from the sun and other elements. 
</P>
<P>
It will also confine the noxious fumes, which for decades have prompted 
complaints from residents as far away as Costa Mesa. The fumes, if chronically 
inhaled, could trigger nausea, eye and skin problems, general weakness and 
respiratory tract irritation, health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now attempting to show everybody good faith and that we want to remedy 
the problems associated with the site," Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
Total cleanup of the sprawling 39-acre dump site behind the Southern California 
Edison Co. power plant is months if not years away, however. Estimates for that 
job have topped $50 million, and a Huntington Beach Fire Department specialist 
in hazardous waste said there is no guarantee it would be successful. 
</P>
<P>
The city granted land-use changes in February that will allow Ascon to build up 
to 600 condominiums on its property, although the company first needs to rid 
the land of its contaminated soil. 
</P>
<P>
Key among recent Ascon developments is the question of who would pay for such a 
monumental cleanup, especially when Ascon's lender, Signal Mortgage Inc. of 
Long Beach, has foreclosed on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey said Ascon, which he co-owns with Phil Spiller, owes Signal more than 
$4 million in loans on the former landfill and that Signal has refused to 
refinance the loans. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Broedlow, Signal president, confirmed Thursday that "we have been in 
foreclosure for 70 to 75 days" but declined to discuss Ascon's financial state 
because Ascon "is in serious negotiations with prospective joint-venture 
partners." 
</P>
<P>
But Lindsey said Thursday that, while there are several developers interested 
in building condominiums on a site so near the beach, "every one of them is 
daunted by the risk potential of the site." 
</P>
<P>
"There's not too many angels around when you have a hazardous-waste pit," 
Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
The rubber cover over the pit, however, may help remove one of Ascon's 
obstacles to cleaning the site and developing it. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District, in its Oct. 10, 1987, lawsuit 
against Ascon, charged that fumes from the toxic wastes found on the site, near 
the intersection of Magnolia and Hamilton avenues, posed a serious public 
health threat and sought a court order forcing Ascon to clean it up. The AQMD 
also sought $7 million in fines against Ascon. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 5, 1987, Orange County Superior Court Judge Tully H. Seymour ordered 
Ascon to cover the toxic pond or pay fines. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey said that Ascon will pay a $25,000 fine before the judge Tuesday, when 
a settlement agreement with the AQMD is to be formally signed. 
</P>
<P>
Even as it prepares to pay the fine, Ascon maintains that the former oil 
refinery dump was not declared a hazardous-waste site by the state until 6 
months after the company bought the land in July, 1983. Ascon claims that 
previous owners never disclosed the extent of waste dumped at the site. The 
company is awaiting trial of a $250-million lawsuit that seeks damages from oil 
companies that Ascon alleges dumped their oil field waste on the property.

MAN WHO RAN OVER WIFE ARRESTED IN ALLEGED BEATING OF HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Costa Mesa resident Jerry Allen Holland, who ended an argument with his wife by 
driving their 2-ton pickup truck over her three times in April, was arrested 
Thursday morning for allegedly beating her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old man was arrested at his home on the 300 block of Ogle Street 
after police received a call from his wife, Lindy Sue Holland, who reported 
that her husband had assaulted her, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Sam Cordeiro said. 
</P>
<P>
Holland was being held at Orange County Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail on 
suspicion of beating his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Cordeiro said the woman told police that her husband woke her early Thursday 
and started beating her for no apparent reason, which led to the call to 
police. The 33-year-old woman had red, swollen marks on her arms and her left 
ankle, Cordeiro said. 
</P>
<P>
At the couple's home Thursday afternoon, Lindy Holland said she did not want to 
talk about the alleged beating. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very emotional time. . . . I just can't talk about it right 
now," she cried as she retreated into the couple's home on a quiet Costa Mesa 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Only 2 weeks earlier, the woman requested that her husband be released from 
jail after he ran over her with their truck after she refused to give him her 
$400 paycheck, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher P. Kralick said. 
</P>
<P>
Kralick declined to say whether Holland would be charged in the latest 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Holland was charged with attempted murder, assault and assault with a deadly 
weapon in the April 19 incident. His wife suffered only cuts and bruises 
because the truck ran mainly over her legs while she was lying flat on the 
ground, Cordeiro said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, however, refused to cooperate in prosecuting Holland on the 
attempted murder charge, Kralick said. 
</P>
<P>
"She made it real clear that she was in love with him and they were going to go 
to counseling together," Kralick said. 
</P>
<P>
Without her cooperation, prosecutors were forced to drop the attempted murder 
charge. Holland then pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon and was 
sentenced to 3 years' probation by a Harbor Municipal Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the circumstances with that case, I felt fortunate that we were able to 
get the probation sentence," Kralick said. "Other situations where spouses 
refuse to cooperate usually get dismissed without a hearing." 
</P>
<P>
Kralick said incidents in which girlfriends or wives stick up for their 
companions happen very often. "We have lots of girlfriends and wives (who) 
refuse to prosecute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And there's a myriad of reasons: "They don't want to go to court. They love the 
man and say it's an isolated occurrence. They say it'll never happen again. Or 
they want to go on with their lives," Kralick said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the probation sentence, Holland was restricted from contact with his 
wife unless she initiated it. He was ordered not to violate any laws and was 
required to seek counseling and cooperate with his probation officer.

TEACHERS SEEK NEW TALKS IN ANAHEIM STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid reports that some of a $2.5-billion state budget surplus may go to 
schools, Anaheim Union High School District teachers, who staged a 1-day strike 
last week, said Thursday that they will ask administrators to return to the 
bargaining table to resolve their bitter contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from each of the district's 19 campuses attended a special 
meeting at union headquarters Thursday and agreed to ask school administrators 
to postpone taking the labor dispute to fact-finding, a process in which a 
representative of the state Public Employment Relations Board examines the 
school district's financial status. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise announcement Wednesday, Gov. George Deukmejian disclosed that the 
state will probably have a $2.5-billion surplus, and educators statewide are 
hoping that much of the windfall will go to schools. The surplus could, for 
example, mean a settlement for teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, who have been on strike since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope for Settlement 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Lahtinen, president of the Anaheim Secondary Teachers Assn., said his 
district's 900 teachers are hopeful that the surplus could lead to a settlement 
of their drawn-out wage dispute. If not, he said the teachers may consider 
another strike in the coming school year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to be communicating with the district to go back to the 
bargaining table to reach a settlement with us," he said. "If the district is 
not willing to do that, we are suggesting that we stay in mediation until July 
1 . . . after the state budget is adopted and see if we can get a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to get a settlement (by July 1) through mediation, then we can go 
through with the fact-finding," Lahtinen said. "Also, we have decided to take a 
strike action early this fall if don't have a settlement (during the summer)." 
</P>
<P>
Lahtinen said the union would be mailing letters to school trustees today, 
requesting that they resume negotiations with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But Anaheim Union Assistant Supt. LeRoy Kellogg said Thursday that there is no 
definite word yet on whether the surplus will indeed translate into more 
dollars for his financially strapped school district, which serves intermediate 
and secondary students in most of Anaheim, as well as La Palma and Cypress. 
District administrators have said they cannot meet the teachers' demands 
because more than 2 decades of declining enrollment has eroded the district's 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea," Kellogg said. "We're still planning to go to fact-finding at 
this stage of the game." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revised Budget Due 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg said Deukmejian is scheduled to release a revised budget soon that will 
outline what will happen to the budget windfall. 
</P>
<P>
"But until we get hard figures, there's not much to get excited about until you 
know what it is," he said. "We know it's going to help districts throughout the 
state, but to what extent, we do not know." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim teachers have been working without a contract since last August. 
</P>
<P>
According to the offer from the district for this year, teachers could receive 
about a 1% salary increase because the raise is tied to budget surpluses. The 
association has said it is willing to accept that. But for next year, teachers 
are seeking a 3.2% increase, equal to the state's projected inflation rate, 
plus a portion of the surplus after the district sets aside a 3% reserve.

VALENZUELA IS DESERVING OF HAPPY ENDING TO HIS STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Dodgers like to live out those Hollywood endings: 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson limping around the bases after winning Game 1 of the 1988 World 
Series with one swing in a life-imitates-art impersonation of Robert 
Redford-Roy Hobbs. 
</P>
<P>
Orel Hershiser kneeling in prayer on the mound after winning the final game of 
that Series, surely a scene Jimmy Stewart played out for June Allyson and the 
cameras somewhere, somehow. 
</P>
<P>
If only the Dodgers could evoke a Capra-esque ending now. For if ever there was 
a player in need of a happy ending, it's Fernando Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
Not just because, as a premier pitcher, Valenzuela is struggling. Other 
star-caliber starters, such as Jack Morris and Frank Viola, have struggled, 
too. But Fernando, in the eyes of his peers, his public, is special. 
</P>
<P>
He genuinely is the game's last great dream-weaver, having come along just in 
time to put some magic back in the game when it needed it most. Fernando 
injected strike-torn 1981 with youthful exuberance, a genuine innocence, not to 
mention an assortment of pitches that translated into a slew of victories. A 
19-year-old fresh out of Mexico, he spoke no English but did not have to; what 
he had to offer transcended language barriers, team loyalties. 
</P>
<P>
Now, less than 10 years later, it's not baseball, but Fernando who is tormented 
by realities. 
</P>
<P>
He is not old, but his arm may have aged beyond its 28 years. Some say that 
1,948 innings, built on a steady diet of arm-killing screwballs, made it that 
way. Some wonder if the arm is too far gone to ever bounce back. 
</P>
<P>
When Valenzuela took the mound against the Mets Wednesday, he not only was 
winless this season, but had not won since June 14. 
</P>
<P>
After six starts, Valenzuela's record was 0-3, his ERA 4.91. His prospects 
seemed as much in doubt as they did in July, when Fernando was disabled for the 
first time ever, because of a sore left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of culprits, including too many screwballs and not enough caution, were 
blamed. But, to his credit and undoubtedly to the Dodgers' relief, Fernando 
never partook in the finger-pointing. Instead, he has channeled what could have 
been negative energy into his comeback. Extensive rehabilitation to regain arm 
strength still goes on. And a new motion to eliminate harmful pitching patterns 
was incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
The pain is gone now. But the old Fernando, he's still not back. 
</P>
<P>
The fastball of respectable velocity has slipped drastically from its 87-89 mph 
range. He is more often clocked at about 77. In one start, Valenzuela 
reportedly did not throw faster than 75 mph. In his start prior to Wednesday's 
game, he was KO'd by the Cardinals in the second inning, having allowed five 
hits and five earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
But what people forget, Los Angeles pitching coach Ron Perranoski said, is that 
Valenzuela shut out the Cardinals for seven innings in his previous start. 
</P>
<P>
"You will see improvement, but there will be peaks and valleys," Perranoski 
said. "You have to remember, he didn't throw a ball in competition from July 
through August. He spent all winter in physical therapy. He's had to build 
something up that was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's no pain. That's an important, great sign. It's just a matter of 
getting his strength back. And you get stronger by throwing the baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"And all we ask of him is that he keep us in the ballgames." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Valenzuela could make some demands of his own, and be justified in 
doing so. Little demands, such as some runs, some laughers. In his six starts 
prior to Wednesday, the Dodgers scored a total of 11 runs on his behalf. Seven 
runs were in one game -- the only game he started that the Dodgers won. Twice 
the Dodgers were shut out and twice more they were limited to one run. 
</P>
<P>
That pattern is probably the only thing that is at all familiar to the 
struggling pitcher, who had the best ERA (3.16) of all active pitchers in the 
1980s coming into this season. Yet he had managed to win only 118 of his 256 
career starts through last season. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, it was more of the same. When the Dodgers scored a run against the 
Mets' Ron Darling in the third inning, it was their first in three Valenzuela 
starts. When they scored a third run, it was the second-highest total put 
together for him this season. But when Valenzuela departed after six innings, 
he had to settle for a moral victory. He'd allowed the Mets only five hits and 
six walks, but three earned runs. Yet the Dodgers gave him only three runs in 
support. So that winless streak slipped up another notch to 16 consecutive 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday night's performance, he sounded encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked three or four on close pitches. But no matter how many walks, I threw 
the ball pretty good. I was surprised it (his control) was all right," 
Valenzuela said, referring to not having pitched since May 4 because of 
rainouts. "Twelve days, it's really a little too long, especially because I 
need to throw more." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, a proud man who never demanded much, has not sought sympathy, at 
any point. All he wants is time. 
</P>
<P>
"The arm doesn't come back fast, so people start to worry," he told reporters 
Monday. "For me, it's just 'keep working.' I know my arm doesn't feel pain. 
You'll see in a couple months." 
</P>
<P>
Does he have a couple of months? All you have to do is listen to the Dodgers, 
watch them circle the wagons, mount their vehement defense to see that he does 
have time. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt we're all pulling for him," Perranoski said, "because everybody 
respects Fernando as a young man, as a pitcher and for the way he's handled his 
success." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' Sid Fernandez, a former teammate, watches and hopes on behalf of a 
pitcher who gave the game a lot of hope not so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"When you dominate for so many years, people expect a lot," Fernandez said. 
"They want him to be a Superman. He is ... but he can't win 24 games every 
year."

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: AT LEAST, LAKER FANS WON'T HAVE TO HEAR HEINSOHN'S 
ANALYSIS

Complaints, observations and opinions: 
</P>
<P>
 Here's some news that should brighten your day. Tom Heinsohn isn't working the 
Laker-Phoenix series. It will be Dick Stockton and Hubie Brown on Game 1 
Saturday. Game 2 Tuesday night will be on Prime Ticket and TBS, and Game 3 
Friday night will be on Channel 9 and TBS. CBS will televise the rest, using 
Stockton and Brown or Brent Musburger and Bill Raftery. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Game 5 of the Laker-Phoenix series, if there is one, will be played Tuesday, 
May 30, at 8:30 p.m. at the Forum and will be televised throughout the country 
at 11:30. But the good news is that it will be televised live in Los Angeles, 
according to a Channel 2 spokeswoman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Why did CBS have to jam in four commercials and a promo last Sunday before 
switching from the Chicago-New York game to the Lakers and Seattle? More than a 
minute was missed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Couldn't Lesley Visser have come up with someone better to interview after the 
game last Sunday than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? He was hardly the star of the game. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Why do directors continue to force-feed viewers with floor-level and 
behind-the-basket camera angles during live action? TBS is the worst offender. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Does Oscar Robertson of TBS ever have anything insightful to say? The other 
night, after Rod Hundley had mentioned that Manute Bol is 7-foot-7, Robertson 
offered one of his typical comments: "He's a tall man." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Daly, Detroit Piston coach, will attend tonight's New York-Chicago game 
and will be wearing a TBS microphone so that he can make periodic comments. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has been using a lot of reporters during the playoffs, but none are as good 
as the master, Pat O'Brien. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A reminder to all announcers and producers: You can't give the score too often. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Attention, hockey fans: There will be one more delayed Stanley Cup telecast. 
Game 5 of the finals next Tuesday will be on late because of a Dodger telecast 
that night. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that for public-relations reasons, Z Channel, despite contractual 
commitments, could have gotten the Dodgers and Angels to change telecast dates 
to avoid these irritating delayed hockey telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Z Channel is making an effort to appease hockey fans. Program 
director Rockey Flintermann said that a few cable companies with the channel 
capabilities have agreed to show Game 5 live on a separate channel, free to all 
subscribers. So check with your cable company. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Congratulations to Channel 2 and Keith Olbermann on the new look for the Sunday 
night sports wrap-up show. It's an improvement. Olbermann comes across as 
softer and more relaxed and comfortable around all his sports memorabilia. He 
seems to have slowed down his rapid-fire delivery, which is a big plus. 
</P>
<P>
Olbermann originally invited viewers to submit possible names for the new show, 
saying the person who submitted the best name would be interviewed live. But 
the station decided to simply call it, "The Keith Olbermann Show." Said 
Olbermann: "It's the one my mother liked." It was a nice touch on Mother's Day. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Merlin Olsen may be out at NBC. Terry O'Neil, 
the new executive producer at NBC Sports who used to produce football for CBS, 
has been publicly critical of Olsen in the past. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Neil, along with Dick Ebersol, the new division president, met with Olsen 
this week, with positive results. O'Neil reportedly told Olsen he likes his 
work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil and Ebersol also met with Vin Scully while Scully was in New York with 
the Dodgers this week to discuss his future with the network. Scully has 
already signed to continue doing golf for NBC after CBS takes over baseball in 
1990, and there may be other assignments as well. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil, in his book, "The Game Behind the Game," says it would be a mistake for 
CBS to use Brent Musburger as the primary host during the 1992 Winter Olympics. 
Then whom should CBS use? Channel 2 news anchorman Jim Lampley is the most 
logical candidate, but we'll probably get Musburger anyway. . . . 
</P>
<P>
ABC will again take 1 1/2 hours, 1:30 to 3 p.m., to cover a two-minute horse 
race, the Preakness, Saturday. That's a lot of time to fill. The race is 
expected to start about 2:30. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Attention, boxing fans: Nigel Benn of England faces Michael Watson in the 
second fight of a doubleheader in London on NBC's "SportsWorld" Sunday at 1 
p.m. Benn has fought in 22 fights, and has 22 early-round knockouts. None of 
his fights have gone beyond seven rounds and his last 10 all ended in the first 
or second round. Benn is nicknamed the Dark Destroyer. His bout Sunday is 
scheduled to start at 2 p.m. If you tune in late, you may miss it. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Jones Jr., the victim of one of the worst judging decisions in Olympic 
boxing history, is scheduled to fight Stephan Johnson June 11 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Evander Holyfield is scheduled to meet Adilson Rodrigues of Brazil at Caesars 
in Lake Tahoe July 15 in a heavyweight bout to be televised by Showtime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven cable systems representing 1.1 million homes in the Los Angeles 
market have signed up to carry the pay-per-view telecast of the July 12 Thomas 
Hearns-Sugar Ray Leonard fight at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Most are 
charging $39.95, with the price going to $44.95 the day of the fight. Cable 
systems in San Diego County are charging $34.95 and $39.95. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Who's the best boxing commentator on television? Our candidate is ESPN's Al 
Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Bernstein, he's shooting a show, "Al Bernstein Sports Party," next 
Thursday at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas that will be syndicated at a later 
date. Bernstein and Tony Rome are the hosts, and Michael Nunn and Roy Firestone 
are among the guests. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Updates: Chet Forte, the guru of sports directors when he was doing "Monday 
Night Football" for ABC, was most recently working indoor football telecasts 
and this fall will be directing something called "RollerGames," a futuristic 
version of roller derby. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former Laker Kurt Rambis will file reports on the Lakers for Scott St. James' 
sports segments on the Channel 9 news through the remainder of the NBA 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
St. James, by the way, will be the emcee on the first tee of the 19th Police 
Celebrity golf tournament at Rancho Park in West Los Angeles Saturday, 
beginning at 10 a.m. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joe Buttitta, former Channel 5 sports anchor and Angel play-by-play announcer, 
is doing a morning sports show for radio station KGIL and writing for a golf 
magazine. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Buttitta is an outstanding golfer, and so is Channel 11 sportscaster Tom 
Nettles, who came to Los Angeles from the NBC affiliate in San Francisco last 
year. Nettles, a star wide receiver at San Diego State in the 1960s, is 
planning to join the Senior PGA Tour when he turns 50 in about seven years. 
Nettles, by the way, is Graig Nettles' cousin. . . . 
</P>
<P>
An up-and-coming radio star is Steve Hartman, now working with Bud Furillo on 
KFOX-FM. Hartman, a UCLA graduate and former Raider public-relations man, is a 
whiz with sports trivia. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KFI is now calling its sports talk show, which runs weeknights from 7:05 to 8, 
the "Chris Roberts KFI Sports Call." It used to be called "KFI Sports 
Magazine." Said Roberts: "We want to get our callers more involved in the 
show." . . .

SHOEMAKER, LIKE KAREEM, WILL HAVE A FAREWELL TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jockey Bill Shoemaker, who has ridden 8,799 winners and won more than $120 
million in stakes money during an extraordinary career, announced Thursday he 
will retire next year after a worldwide farewell tour. 
</P>
<P>
The tour will begin June 4 in Zurich, Switzerland, and move on through England, 
Ireland, Holland, West Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Spain and Italy, the 
announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Shoe" will return to the United States in July, where he will appear 
throughout North America until October. The tour will then take him to 
Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia before it concludes back 
in the United States, where Shoemaker has ridden for parts of the last five 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker's final ride will come in California in either January or February, 
said spokesman Peter Debreceny. After retirement, Shoemaker has no specific 
plans.

ROUSH PITCHES 1-HITTER; SAN CLEMENTE WINS, 1-0

Kathy Johnson doubled home the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning 
Thursday to give San Clemente High School a 1-0 victory over University in a 
Southern Section 3-A first-round girls' softball playoff game at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's game-winning hit supported the one-hit pitching of Tara Roush (9-6), 
who struck out eight, to pick up the victory that advances San Clemente (12-13) 
to Tuesday's second-round game against West Torrance, a 1-0 winner over Laguna 
Hills Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
University sophomore Shareen Patton (11-7) retired the first 17 batters she 
faced before Kim Denyer ruined her perfect-game bid by lining a single to 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"She just threw the ball right up the middle and it was ready for me to hit 
it," said Denyer, who was 0 for 25 in South Coast League play. 
</P>
<P>
Patton, who retired the next eight batters after Denyer was caught stealing to 
end the sixth, also yielded a single to Denyer with two outs in the ninth. 
Denyer, who stole second, came around to score when Johnson slammed a 2-2 pitch 
through the right-center field gap for the game-winning double. 
</P>
<P>
University (15-9), which played without its leading hitter, freshman Thea 
Curtis (flu), got its only hit off Roush in the top of the first on Lakita 
Johnson's two-out single. After that, the Trojans didn't have another 
base-runner until Roush walked Lisa Anthony with two outs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
In other 3-A softball: 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 3, Tustin 1 -- Junior Paige Lauby (13-7) pitched a one-hitter, striking 
out seven and walking none, to lead El Toro (13-8) at Tustin (17-8). Jaime 
Smith had two hits, scored a run and drove in a run for El Toro, which will 
play Montclair (22-4) in a quarterfinal game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 3, Mayfair 0 -- The host Vaqueros (19-7) scored three unearned runs in 
the third inning to beat Mayfair (15-10). Jennifer Brundage pitched a 
three-hitter, struck out six, walked one, and also went two for three with a 
run scored for Irvine, which will play Saddleback (24-4) Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 4, South Torrance 1 -- Mission Viejo, an at-large team from the 
South Coast League, upset host South Torrance (14-5), the winner of the Ocean 
League. Erin Fitzgerald (9-4) pitched four-hitter and Michele Daugherty hit a 
two-run home run for the Diablos (15-8), who will play top-seeded La Mirada 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback 2, Woodbridge 0 (10 innings) -- Desi Abrego pitched a five-hitter 
with nine strikeouts and no walks for visiting Saddleback (24-4). The 
Roadrunners scored twice in the 10th on a bases-loaded dropped third strikeout 
with two outs.

LAGUNA BEACH GETS LEVELED BY SEA KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There was no 'cruise' for the Corona del Mar High School boys' volleyball team 
Thursday night in the Southern Section 4-A volleyball semifinals, but there was 
near perfection. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings turned what was supposed to be a close match into a runaway at 
Newport Harbor High School. They took second-seeded Laguna Beach out in three 
games, 15-5, 15-7, 16-14, to advance to the championship match. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (15-2) will play No. 1 seeded Mira Costa in the title game 
Saturday at Marina High School. Mira Costa defeated Newport Harbor, 15-5, 15-2, 
15-11, in Thursday's other semifinal at Corona del Mar High School. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach (19-2) had lost only 12 games all season. The Artist had beaten 
just about every top team in Orange County, including Corona del Mar three 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
In that match, the Sea Kings had won the first game and led, 12-5, in the 
second only to lose in four games. 
</P>
<P>
"We call that the 'Corona Cruise,' " middle blocker Jason Perkins said. "It 
seems that every match we have a moment where just let down." 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings had only a brief lapse Thursday, but Perkins quickly put an end 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the first two games without too much resistence, Corona del Mar 
jumped to a 5-0 lead in the third game. However, behind the play of Dain 
Blanton and Sean Stafford, the Artists rallied to tie the score, 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins re-entered the match and provided three quick kills to stop Laguna 
Beach's momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"Jason has been our big-game player all season," Corona del mar Coach Charlie 
Brande said. "He's picked us up in wins over Newport Harbor and University this 
year. This game is all momentum and Jason provided it tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Perkins had 16 kills, 10 of which came in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach managed to take a 14-13 lead at one point and had a chance to 
prolong the match. However, the last of Matt Herrington's 12 kills gave the Sea 
Kings service. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington served three times, the last of which ended in Stafford missing on a 
kill attempt to give Corona del Mar the match. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time we played Laguna Beach, we were intimidated," Herrington said. 
"We blew that one. We knew we could beat them and we wanted a little revenge." 
</P>
<P>
Through the first games, the Sea Kings got it. 
</P>
<P>
The Artists led, 3-2, in the first game, but watched as Corona del Mar ran off 
seven consecutive points. Laguna Beach took a 4-0 in the second game, but the 
Sea Kings again reeled off seven in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington and Matt Cwiertnia, who also had 12 kills, worked the outside in the 
first two games. When the Artists adjusted, Perkins was able to score in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
"We got them down early and I don't think they knew how to handle it," Brande 
said. "They're a well-coached team, but they're use to being ahead."

VOTE ON SANTA MARGARITA DELAYED; 
</P>
<P>
DECISION TO INCLUDE SCHOOL IN PUBLIC LEAGUE POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Margarita High School, which appeared to have taken a step toward finding 
a public league to call home last week, was pushed back a step Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section's executive committee decided to delay a vote on whether 
to include the school in the Orange County geographical area after county 
principals and superintendents complained that they were not properly informed 
about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we're back at square one," said Santa Margarita principal Father 
Michael Harris, whose school will remain in the Olympic League through the 
1989-90 school year. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita, a two-year-old Catholic high school in south Orange County, 
asked to be placed in the Orange County region, which would mean its inclusion 
in a public school league, most likely the Pacific Coast, South Coast, Sea View 
or Sunset. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, it appeared to have its wish when Orange County league 
representatives voted to recommend to the section's executive committee that 
Santa Margarita be included in the Orange County area for the 1990-92 
releaguing years. 
</P>
<P>
But after the vote, some high school principals and district superintendents 
complained to the Southern Section that league officials had not communicated 
or met with them before it. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had a meeting of the minds," said Stan Thomas, Southern Section 
commissioner. "But apparently some of the league representatives did not 
communicate well with their principals." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Packer, an executive committee member and superintendent of the Duarte 
Unified School District, chided league representatives during the meeting for 
not communicating with their principals. 
</P>
<P>
The executive committee will meet June 7 at the Southern Section office in 
Cerritos to vote on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas will meet with Orange County principals and superintendents today at 
Foothill High School to answer questions.

EL DORADO'S SVOBODA GETTING A JUMP ON COMPETITION AFTER AN OFF-SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, Lori Svoboda was leaping her way into prominence at El Dorado 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Svoboda, then a sophomore, became an Orange County sensation in the girls' high 
jump. She won almost every meet she entered, and set the top mark in the state 
that year -- 5-feet 10 1/4-inches -- in winning the event at the 1987 Southern 
Section Masters meet. She was named the 1987 Times' Orange County girls' track 
and field athlete of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Then came 1988 -- a year Svoboda would like to forget, at least as far as the 
high jump is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Although Svoboda started that season with a respectable mark of 5-8, she was 
plagued by inconsistency, and failed to improve on that height. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the Southern Section 3-A championship her first two years, she 
finished second as a junior. And a week later at the Masters meet, she finished 
last. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awful," Svoboda said of her junior year. "I didn't jump worth beans." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Svoboda said the pressure of her own high expectations probably 
upended her abilities last year. El Dorado Coach Chuck Titus agreed, but added: 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of it, but there were some very heavy expectations placed on Lori 
by everybody -- students, teachers, everyone. They all expected Lori to win 
every single time. . . . "If she went to a meet, it wasn't 'Did you win?' They 
just assumed that. It was 'How high did you jump?' . . . It got to be so that 
she felt she had an obligation to win. I think they forgot she was human." 
</P>
<P>
Svoboda returns to the Southern Section meet Saturday to seek her third 3-A 
high jump title in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Svoboda would appear to have a very good chance of winning this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I'd go out and have no idea if I'd jump great or horrible," Svoboda 
said. "I'd push myself and put a lot of pressure on myself to win. This year, 
I'm really calm and really confident," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I'd be trying so hard, but it would never work. I couldn't get my 
step down, and it got me really frustrated. . . . Plus, I'd always get up there 
and think too much. This year, I've learned not to think, just do it." 
</P>
<P>
The results have been impressive. 
</P>
<P>
At the Bishop Amat Relays at Mt. San Antonio College last month, Svoboda set 
her personal best (5-10 3/4), which is the best in the section this season and 
ranks her among the nation's top 10 for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Svoboda also won the high jump at the Orange County Championship with a mark of 
5-8, and placed second to state champion Chrissy Mills of North Hollywood 
Campbell Hall at the prestigious Arcadia Invitational. Mills and Svoboda both 
cleared 5-8, but Mills did so on fewer misses. 
</P>
<P>
Svoboda, who is 5-feet-10 and 130 pounds, also competed in the 100 and 200 
meters through much of the Empire League season. She placed second in both 
events at the league championships last week, and qualified for the 3-A 
100-meter final Saturday. (She won't compete in the event to concentrate on the 
high jump, she said). 
</P>
<P>
Although speed is one of Svoboda's major assets, Titus said her biggest 
strength is strength. 
</P>
<P>
"Lori can leg press for repetitions over 600 pounds," Titus said. "Lori's not a 
wimpy high jumper. It's amazing when she goes into the weight room, the 
football players are awed by her." 
</P>
<P>
Titus said he believes Svoboda will clear 6 feet before the 1989 season is 
finished. If so, Svoboda would tie the Orange County record of 6-0 set by 
Anaheim's Yleana Carrasco in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Svoboda is now third on the county's all-time list behind Carrasco and 
Kennedy's Ursula Lovely, who cleared 5-11 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"All her practices so far indicate she can go 6 feet within the next three 
weeks," Titus said. "One day, I had the bar set up at 6-2. She thought it was 
at 5-11, that's what I told her. And she damn near made it. She cleared it, but 
knocked it with her hand on the way down. 
</P>
<P>
"She's gotten really up there, but the little bitty things have just kept her 
from making it." 
</P>
<P>
Svoboda said she's certain that 6 feet is within her reach. And breaking -- or 
at least tying -- the county record is something she doesn't talk about, but 
would love to do. 
</P>
<P>
But even if neither of those things happen, Svoboda said one major goal this 
year has been met: She believes in her own abilities again. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out this year with an open mind," she said. "I knew I could jump, but I 
had to prove it to myself and to all those other people out there that, yes, 
Lori is still here." 
</P>
<P>
And she isn't finished yet.

OWNERS OF MID-SIZE O.C. FIRMS WELL PAID

Owners of private, mid-size businesses in Orange County are the best paid in 
the state and rank among the best paid in the nation, according to a study by 
the Geneva Cos. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide study of 2,500 private companies with sales of $1 million to 
$100 million, Geneva found that the median compensation for business owners in 
Orange County was $224,000 a year over the past 2 years. Nationwide, that pay 
was $151,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County median compensation ranked eighth on a list of 80 
metropolitan areas nationwide. It was the highest in California, far surpassing 
Stockton, the next highest metropolitan area in the state listed. Stockton 
ranked 21st with a median pay of $193,000. 
</P>
<P>
"On average, the business owners are paying themselves 78% in direct salary and 
the remaining 22% in such indirect compensation as club memberships and 
personal financial planning expenses," said Charles B. Tillson, president of 
Geneva's international financial services division. 
</P>
<P>
Geneva, one of the nation's most active mergers and acquisitions firms, said 
the national median increased about 13% from the median $131,000 recorded in 
Geneva's 1986 survey. 
</P>
<P>
The median is the point at which half the salaries are higher and half are 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
Other California metropolitan areas on the list were Los Angeles (22nd), San 
Francisco (32nd), San Diego (39th), Bakersfield (58th), Sacramento (64th), Palm 
Springs (69th), San Bernardino (76th) and Santa Barbara (80th).

OFFER SENDS STOCK PRICE UP 20%; 
</P>
<P>
SMITH INTERNATIONAL DRAWS BUYOUT BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Hong Kong investment firm offered Thursday to buy Smith International Inc., 
an oil exploration firm that recently moved its operations from Orange County 
to Texas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial Equity Ltd., which is Smith's largest shareholder with about 35% of 
its stock, did not name the price it is willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
The offer helped push the value of Smith's shares up 20% Thursday, giving the 
company a market value of $366 million. Smith's shares closed Thursday at 
$12.875, up $2.125 per share in very heavy trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald A. Brierley, a New Zealand investor who controls Industrial Equity, said 
in a letter to Smith's board that he wants to negotiate a price that is fair to 
Smith and its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Loren Carroll, a Smith board member, said the board will meet to consider 
Brierley's offer. 
</P>
<P>
Smith filed for bankruptcy in 1986 and emerged from the proceedings in late 
1987 as a much smaller company. A year ago, Smith reported its first operating 
profit since 1985, and revenue for 1988 reached $320.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
In its effort to consolidate operations and save money, Smith moved its 
headquarters from Newport Beach to Houston and relocated its manufacturing 
plant from Irvine to Ponca City, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Brierley said Industrial Equity deserves much of the credit for Smith's 
turnaround. Last year, Robert Sutherland, an Industrial Equity executive, was 
named Smith's chairman. Brierley said Industrial Equity would retain Smith's 
senior management if its offer is accepted. 
</P>
<P>
He said Smith's turnaround is complete, but a downturn in oil drilling early 
this year resulted in a $1.1-million first quarter loss for the company. 
</P>
<P>
If successful in acquiring Smith, Brierley said his firm will continue current 
efforts to sell much of Smith's operations and focus on its core business of 
providing drilling products and services.

SOME NORTHROP WORKERS RESIGNED TO THE INEVITABILITY OF FIRM'S SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day after the chairman of Northrop Corp. strongly suggested that the 
company's Anaheim facility would be sold, some employees there seemed resigned 
on Thursday to the idea that their jobs are in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've known it (a sale) has been in the works for the last year," said Mike 
Girgis, an engineering support worker who lives in Irvine. "We just don't have 
the final details of when and how." 
</P>
<P>
Security guard Walt Rohling agreed. "There is no two ways about it," he said. 
"The property is for sale." 
</P>
<P>
While the potential sale was a subject of conversation among many workers, 
others -- like a group of men outside Northrop's cafeteria -- said they were 
continuing to focus on their work. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,800 employees in Anaheim design and manufacture infrared and optical 
sensors used by pilots and anti-aircraft missiles to shoot their targets. They 
also manufacture equipment to test missiles. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Northrop announced it would reduce its Anaheim work force by 
transferring 400 engineers and their support staff to a sister facility in 
Hawthorne. At the annual shareholders' meeting Wednesday in Los Angeles, Jones 
said the company would trim its national work force by 2,500 to 3,000 people by 
the end of the year. In response to a question, Jones said the company will 
sell any properties that are not useful. "Certainly Anaheim is one of those," 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
After Jones made his comments, a Northrop spokesman said no final decision had 
been made on whether to sell the Orange County facility. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts believe that the company will sell the Anaheim facility soon. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop has refused to comment on the extent of any layoffs that would 
accompany a sale but has said any job losses would be included in the 2,500 to 
3,000 planned job cuts. The company said it hoped to achieve most of the 
planned cuts through normal attrition. 
</P>
<P>
Several workers interviewed said they preferred to remain in Orange County 
rather than transfer to another facility, such as Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
"The drive between here and Hawthorne is very difficult," said Girgis. 
</P>
<P>
The giant aerospace company is experiencing problems because of technical 
complications that have caused delays and funding cutbacks that have lowered 
production. The company has endured declining revenue and profits on many of 
its projects. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue in Northrop's electronics business -- which includes both the Anaheim 
and Hawthorne plants -- has declined 13% from 1986 to 1988 to $1.1 billion; 
operating profit plummeted 61% to $39 million.

REGGAE TAKES THE HIGHER GROUND IN WAILERS' HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the death of the charismatic Bob Marley in 1980, reggae lost much of its 
luster, and its popularity seemed to be on the wane for several years. 
</P>
<P>
But with the emergence of such groups as Grammy-winning Ziggy Marley &amp; the 
Melody Makers -- a group composed of Marley's children -- and such recent hits 
as UB40's "Red Red Wine," reggae is no longer on the decline. On the contrary, 
it shows signs of finally earning real, broad-based popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night at the Universal Amphitheatre, on a program that will repeat 
tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, the Wailers -- formerly Bob 
Marley's backup band -- played an hour-plus set that was long on fire and 
urgency and even showed an occasional burst of high-spirited invention. 
</P>
<P>
Percussionist Irvin (Carrot) Jarrett danced like a man possessed, his nearly 
waist-long dreadlocks whipping the air as the band took Marley's signature 
"Exodus" to higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
Lead singer Junior Marvin, smoothly assured and authoritative in his dapper 
white suit, revved up the crowd on "I Shot the Sheriff" (though a mid-song plea 
to "free James Brown!" merely drew polite applause). 
</P>
<P>
Bob Marley often expressed dismay that his music never attracted a sizable 
black following in the United States, so it's noteworthy that the audience at 
the Universal contained young black reggae fans who were children when Marley 
was at the peak of his fame in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Third World, the headline band, played a set that was longer on energy than on 
merit. They espoused Bishop Desmond Tutu's opposition to apartheid at the end 
of a song that urged listeners to let the "reggae jam boogie getta hold of 
you." Talk about a philosophical stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Third World has gained favor with black record buyers on the strength of the 
vibrant, Stevie Wonder-produced "Try Jah Love" and a great, reggae-powered 
version of the O'Jays' "Now That We Found Love." 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday they concentrated on new material. The new songs sounded fine, 
but "Now That We've Found Love" they're not. 
</P>
<P>
The Wailers and Third World play tonight at 8 and 10:30 at the Coach House, 
33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $25. Information: (714) 
496-8930.

POP MUSIC REVIEW;

TEPPER SWAPS WEIRDNESS FOR SONG-SERVING SIMPLICITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After playing with two of the most determinedly individualistic musicians in 
the history of pop -- Don Van Vliet, a.k.a. Captain Beefheart, and Tom Waits -- 
it's only fitting that Moris Tepper's music bears no relation to his work for 
his former employers. 
</P>
<P>
In place of the maddeningly complex, angular guitar work Tepper brought to such 
Beefheart albums as "Ice Cream for Crow" and Waits' "Frank's Wild Years," his 
performance at UC Irvine's well-hidden Zot Spot Cafe on Wednesday night focused 
on his own stubbornly original folk-based songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than the thorny thickets of sound he's known for (by a small number of 
fans, granted, though at least one person in Wednesday's audience hummed 
Beefheart bass lines between songs), Tepper applied a song-serving simplicity 
to his acoustic guitar, banjo and mandolin awork. While not quite ready for the 
"genius" label attached to his mentors' music, Tepper's faith in his songs was 
well placed. 
</P>
<P>
His music might be comparable to the folk forays of fellow L.A. musician Peter 
Case, but only inasmuch as he is hewing his own path through a musical 
wilderness. Tepper's songs used touches of Japanese koto music, skewed circus 
tunes, jug band music, Irish balladry and even an adapted anthem from the Boer 
War as a set-closer, but he pulled the disparate styles together into an 
impassioned package. 
</P>
<P>
That feat was abetted by an empathetic trio (which should have been a quartet, 
but its bass player was presumed lost on the highway) composed of former Motels 
drummer Brian Glascock, keyboardist Louis Durra and multi-instrumentalist Tom 
Roach. With their assistance, Tepper found an emotional heart in arrangements 
-- using jaw harps, concertinas, duck calls, slide whistles and sundry -- that 
might have seemed errant novelties in other hands. 
</P>
<P>
With a straining voice that bears some relation to the Waterboys' Mike Scott, 
Tepper's vocal on "Man Overboard" detailed the plight of homelessness, but with 
a wry eye for the things its narrator has lost: "I even had my own front lawn." 
</P>
<P>
"When I Dream" placed the tale of a crumbled relationship into the sort of 
jaunty, jangly arrangement little heard since Dylan's "Please Crawl Out Your 
Window." 
</P>
<P>
Tepper's most pointed song, "Dead Presidents," applied a Scottish flair to a 
lyric on the way money can color one's feeling for living: 
</P>
<P>
Life is always the same 
</P>
<P>
You have to drive to the doctor in the pouring rain 
</P>
<P>
Life never seems to make as much sense 
</P>
<P>
As when you have a pocketful of dead presidents.

COMEDY REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
OBSERVATIONS ON CHILDHOOD SET THE PACE FOR A NIGHT OF LAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most shocking discoveries for neophyte comedy fans -- right up there 
with getting the crushing news about the Easter Bunny -- is learning that most 
headliner-level comedians recite the exact same jokes, often in the exact same 
order, every night. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, even if they do change jokes, many comedians never really improve 
that much. Some comedians even get worse over the years, done in by road 
fatigue, diminished inspiration, their own excesses or the caprices of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
So it's particularly refreshing to run into someone like Michael Pace, who's at 
the Laff Stop in Newport Beach through Sunday. He's been performing for a 
number of years and has worked locally on several occasions -- and each time, 
he appears to have improved a bit more. 
</P>
<P>
Not that his show Wednesday was without shortcomings: His 50-minute set 
probably would have been better as a tight, focused 40. He was victimized 
briefly by some overly chatty audience members and, perhaps not coincidentally, 
he lost his rhythm a few times. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he continued to demonstrate enormous potential Wednesday. 
He's eminently engaging -- an expressive, natural performer. Even when his 
material is less than stellar or sophisticated, he delivers it extremely well. 
</P>
<P>
This puts him way ahead of the game, especially for the future: Material can be 
improved, while natural ability, obviously, is either there or it's not. 
</P>
<P>
And anyway, much of Pace's material is already fine. He tends to emphasize 
observations about various phases of childhood, often summoning key details 
with a Seinfeldesque flair. 
</P>
<P>
A few of his bits addressed the typical adolescent's extreme self-absorption 
and obsession with what other people think. "Puberty's a very, very tough time, 
'cause you don't really know where you are sexually," he said. "You go to the 
movie with your buddy (and) you sit like three seats apart so no one thinks 
you're a 'homo.' " 
</P>
<P>
He then pointed out that this kind of concern can kick in much younger, for 
instance, when you're bringing your lunch to grade school: "You had to be real 
careful about the kind of desserts you ate when you were a kid," he recalled, 
adding that cupcakes or Twinkies were OK. But one day his Mom sent some of 
those pink Sno-Balls. "I had to run to the bathroom to hide and eat them. 
'They'll think I'm a (sissy) if they see me eating this thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the strength of Pace's pieces were as much visual as verbal. He 
punctuated many jokes with some delightful facial expressions -- and he can do 
some amazing things with his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In a segment about Easter, he first described the nonstop candy-eating. Then he 
said, "And your little brother's working those malted milk-egg things in the 
corner; he's got grass hanging out of his mouth," which he acted out, 
portraying a heavy-lidded kid in the throes of a sugar overdose. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he neatly evoked the struggle of a youngster on a diving board 
trying desperately to get his mother to watch him dive, while the mother 
happens to be paying no attention: "Mommy . . . Mommy . . . Mommy! Mommy! Mommy 
look!" 
</P>
<P>
While such childhood remembrances and observations are Pace's specialty and 
strength, he laced his act with a hodgepodge of other kinds of material. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of some topical stuff, he asked, "Is it just me, or does (Barbara 
Bush) look like the guy on the Quaker Oatmeal box?" 
</P>
<P>
Later, he suggested the reason that discipline may be fleeting for someone who 
decides to lay off booze and get in shape: ". . . work out really hard, wake up 
the next morning, feel like somebody beat you with a meat tenderizer (and 
think), 'Heck, I can drink and feel this (lousy)." 
</P>
<P>
And when he moved into the inevitable section on flying (stand-up's de rigueur 
topic), he at least put a different spin on it by zeroing in on pilots at both 
ends of the age spectrum. The first premise: that pilots seem to be getting 
younger and younger. On one flight, Pace recalled, they occasionally would say, 
"Radical air pocket, dude." 
</P>
<P>
On another flight, there was an announcement: "Ladies and gentlemen, Capt. 
Johnson will be retiring at the end of this flight." A worried Pace imagined 
the captain in the cockpit doing shots of Jack Daniels, executing aerial spins, 
and gloating: "What are they going to do -- fire me?" 
</P>
<P>
We don't know what kind of career Capt. Johnson had, but at this rate, we're 
expecting big things from Michael Pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Pace and impressionist Rich Natole are at the Laff Stop, 2122 S.E. 
Bristol St., Newport Beach, through Sunday. Show times: 8, 10 and 11:45 p.m. 
Friday and Saturday; 8:30 p.m. Sunday. Tickets: $6-9. Information: (714)

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Kachina, 222 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-5546. Open nightly from 5:30 
to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Kachina is new, but it already may be the county's best restaurant. Named for 
an American Indian doll of the Southwest, the restaurant serves food that is 
rare and exotic -- edible art. David Wilhelm, late of Pave and the El Torito 
Grill, has composed a menu featuring some of the most imaginative, intelligent 
cooking this side of the Twilight Zone, full of sumptuous tastes and 
color-splashed textures. Run, don't walk, to taste their green corn tamale, 
honey glazed pork and celestial chocolate bread pudding. And go early. 
</P>
<P>
Agostino's, 34700 Coast Highway, Capistrano Beach. (714) 661-8266. Open 
Tuesdays through Sundays noon to 3 p.m. and 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Entirely new management is in place at this Chicago-style Italian restaurant, 
famous for its homemade sausage and romantic beach view. Much of the menu, 
including the tableside Caesar and the rich, creamy pastas, is the same as it 
was when the place was called Sabatino's. But Agostino already has added many 
seafood dishes including mussels, fresh salmon and calamari. The bar is as good 
a hangout as you'll find on Capo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttomare, 545 Newport Center Dr., Newport Beach. (714) 640-6333. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Fridays 11 to midnight; Saturdays 11:30 
to midnight, Sundays 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Service is fluid and solicitious at this smart, stunning restaurant, located 
in the building that used to house the Savannah Grill, but the kitchen is 
having its ups and downs. Wonderful, yeasty foccaccia bread served with virgin 
olive oil and the fine grilled seafoods are some of the ups. Naked vegetables 
and bland pasta dishes are some of the downs. Lombata di vitello, veal chop 
with fontina and prosciutto, is one reason to go back for a second look. 
</P>
<P>
Umi, 2075 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 631-2208. Open Tuesdays through 
Sundays 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5:30 to 10:30, Fridays and Saturdays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
Umi is a modern and imaginative but often unprofessional sushi bar with 
high-tech pretensions, and knowing what to order is important: You are safe if 
you stick with the sushi, which is fresh and crafted with an excellently 
prepared rice, but it is easy to run aground on the many hot dishes. Among 
them, best are a wonderful scallop casserole, a toothsome Japanese steak, and 
yaki-onigiri, grilled triangles of sushi rice with various fillings. Service 
can be painfully slow. 
</P>
<P>
Pinnacle Peak, 9100 Trask Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 892-7311. Open Mondays 
through Fridays 5 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., weekends till 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy Horse Steak House, 1580 Brookhollow Dr., Santa Ana. (714) 549-1512. Open 
Mondays through Fridays 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturdays and Sundays 5 p.m. to 2 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
While everyone else is busy disavowing addiction to good steak, sneak off to 
one of these places. Leave the tie at home when you visit Pinnacle Peak; 
someone will sneak up on you and cut it off. Honest. The restaurant's trail 
boss steak, cooked over an open flame, is a char-broiled monster, a great value 
at $9.95. The Crazy Horse is a bit longer on atmosphere but, apart from the 
high-grade beef, it's run-of-the-mill. Many of the side dishes have been 
frozen, and the whole place has a packaged feel about it.

RED-TAILED HAWK 
</P>
<P>
(Buteo jamaicensis) 
</P>
<P>
Description: About 22 inches long, with a 50-inch wingspan. Wings are broad and 
fairly rounded, plumage is variable. Reddish upper-tail, paler red under-tail; 
pale mottling on shoulders, 
</P>
<P>
contrasting with dark mantle and often forming a "V" in perched birds. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Woodland and open country with scattered trees; often seen perching on 
light poles. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: More than 85% rodents; also amphibians, crayfish, fish and refuse. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Aerial display: pair spiral, recross, male usually circling behind 
and above female. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Bulky nest of sticks and twigs built in crotch of large tree with 
commanding view. Alternately uses several perennial nests. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: White to bluish white, spotted with brown or unmarked; about 2 1/2 inches 
long. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: The most common and widespread of the buteos 
(high-soaring hawks that are among the easiest daytime birds of prey to spot). 
While it shuns the deepest woodlands and most heavily-urbanized areas, it is a 
common suburban bird in the county. In addition to the local breeders, many 
migrating red-tails visit the county in spring and fall. 
</P>
<P>
Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or 
to get information on the breeding bird atlas (now in its fifth and final 
year), call Sea and Sage Audubon Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714) 
962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714) 786-3160. 
</P>

THE NATURAL POET; 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE ARTIST'S WORKS OFTEN REFLECT QUEST FOR HER PLACE IN AMERICAN CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE MOFFET, Penelope Moffet is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every day, Irvine poet Mitsuye Yamada rises before dawn to write. It's that 
quiet time that poet Sylvia Plath called the "blue hour." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody calls me up at 4:30 in the morning," Yamada said. "I have a body of 
time. I have a journal I keep with fragments of thought, and I try to put them 
into a poem." 
</P>
<P>
Many of her poems reflect her efforts to find her place in American culture. 
Yamada, who was born in Japan and raised in the United States, sees herself as 
part of a movement of Asian-American writers exploring their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Long active within the Orange County literary community, Yamada, 65, recently 
published her second book, "Desert Run." She'll read from the book at the 
Fullerton Museum Center on Saturday at 8 p.m., along with Janet Jue and Sarie 
Sachie Hylkema, as part of a poets reading series. 
</P>
<P>
"Desert Run," published in late 1988 by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press of 
Latham, N.Y., has won praise from critics such as Scarlet Cheng, who wrote in 
the Arlington, Va.-based Belles Lettres magazine that "Yamada's poetry has a 
terse blend of emotions and imagery: the twist of words that creates the twist 
of vision that makes poetry alive for us." 
</P>
<P>
Poet Eloise Klein Healy, coordinator of the Cal State Northridge women's 
studies interdisciplinary program, says she's "impressed by the kind of dignity 
that (Yamada) brings to everything. She has such an open vision of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Yamada's progress as a writer in the years between her first book of poetry, 
"Camp Notes and Other Poems" (1976, Shameless Hussy Press, Berkeley), and 
"Desert Run" is considerable, Healy said. "The technical growth in these poems 
is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her books, Yamada has published work in a number of literary 
magazines and anthologies, including the 1989 Norton anthology of 
cross-cultural writing, "New Worlds of Literature." In 1981 she was featured, 
along with Bay Area writer Nellie Wong, in a film, "Mitsuye and Nellie: Two 
American Poets," that aired nationally on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
Yamada was one of the editors for a 1986 anthology of Orange County poets, "The 
Webs We Weave," and in 1981 founded a group called the Multi-Cultural Women 
Writers of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Her poems are narratives written in free verse. "You have to make your own way 
into finding your own form," she said. "I don't know if I've found mine." 
</P>
<P>
A recently retired Cypress College professor of English, Yamada has lived in 
Irvine for 17 years with her husband of 39 years, Yoshikazu Yamada, a retired 
research chemist who recently became the proprietor of a Laguna Beach art 
gallery. They have four children and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Yamada said her teaching helped pay the family's bills while leaving her some 
time to write, though the full-time job contributed to the long lapse between 
her first and second book. It's very difficult -- if not impossible -- to earn 
a living as a poet today, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
"The books themselves don't seem to sell very well. We live in a society where 
not very many people sit down and read poetry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Given the limited readership for poetry, she's not sure why she goes on writing 
it, Yamada said. Yet, she added, "if we want to survive as human beings, be 
aware of our place in the world, you might say that (writing and reading) 
poetry is a matter of survival." 
</P>
<P>
Yamada was born in Kyushu, Japan, and raised in Seattle. She began writing at 
age 13, but became more serious about it much later, in the mid-1960s. "There 
was a period when I was sick. I was in bed a lot," Yamada said. "That was when 
I really started writing a lot. I wanted my children to know about my life." 
</P>
<P>
She was misdiagnosed first as having terminal emphysema, then cystic fibrosis. 
"I didn't sleep much at all, my lungs were in such bad shape. I did a lot of 
writing and thinking about things." Later, the diagnosis was changed to asthma, 
which medication brought under control. Yamada discarded much of what she'd 
written while sick but went on putting her thoughts on paper. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1970s, when various feminist publications started coming out, I started 
sending my things out," Yamada said. Poems were accepted. "That was exciting, 
an affirmation." 
</P>
<P>
Yamada's father, Jack Yasutake, was also a poet. When she was a girl, Yamada 
remembers, every Sunday he met with a large group of poets in Seattle. "In 
fact, that's what they were doing on Dec. 7," 1941, the day Pearl Harbor was 
attacked by the Japanese, Yamada said. "That's where they were when my father 
was arrested." 
</P>
<P>
The writers had inscribed poems on a big piece of paper on a wall. FBI agents 
removed the paper. "They thought it was some sort of code. They took it away to 
see if some kind of subversive activity was going on that day," Yamada said. 
Yasutake was incarcerated in prisoner-of-war camps near Albuquerque, N.M., and 
Crystal City, Tex., for most of the war. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other Japanese Americans, Yamada, her mother and brothers were 
interned. Yamada was held from 1942 to 1943 at Minidoka, an Idaho camp. Once 
released, she was at first eager to leave her camp memories behind, but later 
these memories became the subject of much of her writing. 
</P>
<P>
In her new book's title poem Yamada likens herself, and other interned 
Japanese-Americans, to "the bull snakes brought/into this desert by the 
soldiers/we were transported here/to drive away rattlers/in your nightmares. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the poem, still using the image of the bull snake as a metaphor 
for herself, Yamada writes that "I cannot stay in the desert/where you will 
have me nor/will I be brought back in a cage/to grace your need for exotica. . 
. . If you must fit me to your needs/I will die/and so will you." The "you" to 
whom she speaks in the poem is the culture that allowed the internment of 
Japanese-Americans, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"The American guilt about the camps is to keep it quiet. That's why it took 40 
years for this redress issue to come out," she said. "Even in the Japanese 
community, the fear is that there might be a backlash. But as (poet) Audre Lord 
said, 'My silence did not protect me and your silence will not protect you.' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many thousands of people still don't know what this (redress) 
is about," said Yamada, who was active with the National Council of 
Japanese-American Redress, which brought an unsuccessful class-action lawsuit 
on behalf of those interned during World War II. (Recent federal legislation 
mandated that World War II Japanese-American internees be paid $20,000 each as 
redress, but those payments have not yet begun.) 
</P>
<P>
Although Yamada was born in Japan, she doesn't feel Japanese. In 1981 she paid 
her first adult visit to her birthplace, and "I knew that this was not my 
country," she said. Brought to the United States at age 4, Yamada had spent 
another 18 months in Japan when she was 11, but she hadn't been back since. 
</P>
<P>
"My heritage is really with the pioneers, no matter what race. I feel more 
connected to the emigres from throughout the world who move from one culture to 
another and spend the rest of their lives trying to wedge themselves into this 
new culture," Yamada said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. laws discriminating against people of Asian origin prevented Yamada from 
becoming an American citizen until 1953. "I was unnatural before, so I had to 
become naturalized," she joked. "That term is so . . ." She left the sentence 
unfinished, shaking her head. "But by then I was already more American than 
Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of her personal encounters with injustice, Yamada feels a strong 
kinship with political prisoners around the world. She's been a member of 
Amnesty International, the human rights organization, for more than 20 years 
and is up for reelection to its national board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Through her teaching, Yamada presented her students with alternative traditions 
within American literature. In her American literature class, for instance, the 
reading list was mostly books by ethnic American writers. 
</P>
<P>
"The students would complain that there were too many ethnic novels. They'd 
want to know why they weren't reading Hemingway, and I'd explain there were 
many years when we read nothing but white male writers," Yamada said. 
</P>
<P>
"Students are so conformist. . . . We didn't throw all the mainstream people 
out. I kept some of the women" writers, she added, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Yamada continues to be an active member of Multi-Cultural Women Writers of 
Orange County. "We started out as an Asian-American women writers group," she 
said. However, the membership soon expanded to include several other "women 
with a very strong ethnic consciousness." Nine women now meet every other week 
to share their writing. 
</P>

In 1988 the group won a 3-year grant of $2,000 a year from the California Arts 
Council to present a few seminars and to publish a multilingual anthology of 
members' writing, due out next year. 
</P>
<P>
Yamada's current writing, which includes a book of political essays for 
Firebrand Press, is going slowly. She said her life "feels very disordered 
right now" because she's trying to do so many things. 
</P>
<P>
One of her projects involves trying to find out why her father was considered a 
dangerous spy during World War II. "The paper trail takes forever. . . . I 
should have retired 10 years ago to work on some of these things," Yamada said. 
</P>
<P>
She's happy to have more time to pursue interests close to her heart. "I think 
I deserve it," she said.

LAGUNA STUDENT HOPES TO RAISE AWARENESS OF SPECIES ABUSE

</HEADLINE>

<P>
By REBECCA LEUNG, Rebecca Leung is a senior at University High School in 
Irvine, where she is editor of the school magazine Sword and Shield. In the 
fall, she will attend USC, where she plans to major in journalism.

<P>
Antonio Aguilar has three goals. 
</P>
<P>
He wants to change all of his household items -- shavers, pens, shampoos, soaps 
-- over to those brands that contain no animal byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
Next, he hopes to persuade the city of Laguna Beach not to issue any more 
business licenses to fur shops. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, he plans to initiate a campaign protesting animal dissection in 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Raising awareness of animal rights is a difficult, expensive and ambitious task 
for Aguilar. However, it is an issue with which he is emotionally involved as 
an animal rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think animals should be killed for any purpose," said Aguilar, 16 and 
a sophomore at Laguna Beach High School. "I don't see why human beings think 
that they are superior to animals. What makes them think that animals don't 
have a life of their own, a family of their own, or a living standard of their 
own? 
</P>
<P>
"Especially in this day and age, humans have no right to kill animals for their 
fur coats when there are plenty of alternatives. It is the animal's right to 
live his life unexploited and free, without humans saying that animals need to 
provide them with new coats." 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar has been actively involved in protests and demonstrations since he was 
12, when he went with his mother to a rally protesting United States 
intervention in El Salvador. As a charter member of his high school's Young 
Liberal Activist Club, Aguilar is also a supporter of the Animal Liberation 
Front. 
</P>
<P>
His animal rights mission began 4 months ago, when Aguilar first saw a 
television advertisement against fur and animal trapping. He requested 
information about animal rights from People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals in New York and In Defense of Animals in San Francisco, and began 
researching the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I am fighting for animal rights and human rights," he said. "It is important 
to raise public awareness. If you speak to 50 people and convince two not to 
buy furs, 160 minks are saved." 
</P>
<P>
"Also, some products which are tested on animals that scientists call safe, 
often end up hurting humans. For instance, Tylenol kills cats, but it doesn't 
kill humans. PCP and mushrooms don't kill animals, but they kill humans. So, 
when I am working with issues like vivisection, I am also fighting for human 
rights, because every time you take a pill that says 'new and improved' or 
'extra-strength' or 'new formula,' you are really testing it out on yourself." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Aguilar has been fairly successful. He has received support in the form 
of money, legal advice and literature from such other animal rights 
organizations as the Vegetarian Society, the People for Reason in Science and 
Medicine, Last Chance for Animals and Real People for Animals. And 2 weeks have 
passed since Aguilar stopped using products made from animals or tested on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar organized a vigil at Laguna's Main Beach on April 9 in an attempt to 
close down a fur store. He had earlier tried to put cards -- describing how 
animals are supplied or killed for furs -- into the pockets of the coats at the 
store. After successfully slipping one card in a pocket, he was asked to leave 
the premises. 
</P>
<P>
He came back a week later and began passing out literature in front of the 
store. Again he was asked to leave and finally did so, peacefully, after the 
police were called. 
</P>
<P>
"I know my rights as a citizen, and I know what I can and can't do," Aguilar 
said. "I know that I can pass out leaflets without being harassed. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as there is a demand for fur coats for ladies, how about the demand 
for fur coats for the animals? A lot of people are becoming aware of the fact 
that wearing furs is not a fashion statement anymore. When I look at someone 
wearing a fur coat, I don't see fashion -- I think of the animal that had the 
fur before she did." 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar is now embarking on a protest aimed at making his fellow students aware 
of their rights to refuse to take part in dissection of animals in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
He has spent about $400 attending to his various goals. But he added that the 
money has been well spent on a cause that has provided him with great personal 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"People think I am a rebel against society and that I like to rebel against 
anything that goes on," he said. "That is not true. I just have more causes 
than the basically regular ordinary teen-ager would have because I want to be 
active and do different things. 
</P>
<P>
"If those are reasons why someone is classified as a rebel, then go ahead, 
classify them as such. But every person who has a worthy two or three causes to 
pursue is always going to be called a rebel." 
</P>

HONESTY, TRUST: IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS FOR FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What we require from our friends varies from person to person. Some may seek 
out friends for constant companionship while others are looking for a shoulder 
to cry on. Some may look to their buddies for advice while others are looking 
to share a really good secret. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Topics wonders: "What do you value most in a friendship and why?" 
</P>

versa."

I feel without criticizing me or judging me."

<P>
Carmen Nagy, 16, junior, Brea-Olinda 
</P>
<P>
"Trust; in trusting someone you have an understanding in someone whom you can 
talk to and share your feelings without having everyone in the world know it." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Kracik, 16, sophomore, Brea-Olinda 
</P>

friendship."

The lastest distribution of sales and use tax income left Orange County nearly 
$17.5 million richer. The city of Anaheim received the largest amount, $2.25 
million, while Villa Park's $11,200 was the smallest. The largest per-capita 
amount, though, went to Costa Mesa, which received $16.25 per resident. Villa 
Park also received the smallest per-capita amount, $1.61. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to neighboring counties, Orange County's $17.5 million ranked second. 
But its per-capita figure, $7.66, was by far the highest. 
</P>
<P>
Each month city and county governments and other governmental organizations 
receive from the state three advance payments in anticipation of actual sales 
tax revenues. In the fourth month they receive an adjusted amount -- the 
difference between actual revenue and amounts previously received plus the 
first advance for the next quarter. The amounts listed in the chart below 
consist of the second advance payment for the first quarter.

JIM MURRAY: TED AND YAZ AND RICE AND YES, DWIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He wasn't Carl Yastrzemski. He wasn't Ted Williams. He never won the triple 
crown. He never won the batting title. To tell the truth, he batted over .300 
only once in his career. Last year. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to contributing to the lore of the Boston Red Sox over the 
last decade and a half, you better put the name Dwight Evans up in lights a 
foot and a half tall. 
</P>
<P>
He's about a thousand hits behind Yaz, and he'll never come close to hitting 
.400, like Williams, but when it comes to being in the lineup, being dangerous 
and putting in nine innings of impeccable fielding, night after night, Dwight 
(Dewey) Evans might be as valuable an asset as the Red Sox or any team in the 
league has or had. 
</P>
<P>
He never played for anybody else. He's 37 now and doesn't look a day older than 
when he was a rookie. The belly is flat, the hips lean, the attitude hungry. No 
game is a bye to Dwight Evans. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Red Sox used to have the reputation as a clubhouse full of 
dilettante weekend players. The baseball equivalent of polo players. Country 
club was the term most frequently applied to the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
They came into focus as a clique of soloists. The team was on its own. A 
pennant was for peasants. They played a game that could only be compared to 
Long Island polo. Victory was nice but not necessary. Playing well was more 
important. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox had the record to back up their attitude. They almost appeared to 
resent the attitude of the community, which insisted on winning. The Red Sox 
left one n out of that word. And, sometimes, put an h in it. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Barzun said that whoever wanted to know the heart and soul of America 
had better learn baseball. Well, whoever wanted to know the heart and soul of 
New England had better study the Red Sox. They were New England's problem 
children. Exasperating, frustrating, but you kept hoping they'd grow up. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Evans didn't exactly change all that. Yastrzemski had started it before 
he got there. But he was a player of intensity and fierce pride right from the 
start. He couldn't come to grips with losing. He never gave up on a fly ball -- 
or a pennant -- no matter how out of reach it looked. 
</P>
<P>
Consider only the other night at Anaheim Stadium. It is the second inning. The 
Red Sox are already behind, 5-0. There are two outs, no one on. With the count 
two strikes, Evans starts to bite at a curve, low and away. He struggles to 
hold up his swing. The plate umpire rules in his favor. The first base umpire, 
100 feet away, rules against, on appeal. Strike 3. He's out. 
</P>
<P>
It's not like striking out with the bases loaded and the game on the line, it's 
the third out in an inning already gone. One at-bat out of 500, one game out of 
162. But Evans hurls his bat skyward in a rage. It is not a simple bat toss. It 
is a major league bat toss. 
</P>
<P>
It recalls the time a grizzled old umpire watched another outraged batter flip 
his implement high in the air after a strikeout and noted wryly, "If that comes 
down, you're outta here." 
</P>
<P>
Dwight's finally came down and he was out of there and no doubt will be fined. 
But the statement was made: Evans does not suffer any defeat gladly. He does 
not treat a game, even an at-bat, with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
He will probably not be in the Hall of Fame at Cooperstown but he easily makes 
the one at Fenway Park. The franchise fortunes picked up with Evans. This is a 
team that had been in only two World Series in 55 years when Evans joined them. 
In his 16-year tenure, they have been in two World Series and three league 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1975 World Series, popularly conceded to be one of history's greatest, 
Dwight Evans got two home runs. One, he hit. The other, he caught. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the sixth game at Boston and Cincinnati's Joe Morgan hit what would 
have been the game-winning home run in the 11th inning. Evans caught it about 
four rows back in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the great catches in World Series history and it set up Carlton 
Fisk's famous foul-line home run that won the game an inning later. Evans also 
had a triple, double and five runs batted in that Series. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Mets beat the Red Sox in the Series. It was no fault of Dwight 
Evans. As usual, with the Red Sox, it was a seven-game donnybrook and 
overlooked, because the Mets won, was Evans' MVP performance. He hit two home 
runs, two doubles, batted .308 and drove in (count 'em) nine runs. 
</P>
<P>
Evans is on a ladder with every Red Sox star who ever lived. He has hit 350 
home runs. Only Williams, Yastrzemski and Jim Rice have hit more. (Only 38 
players in history have hit more.) He is third, behind Yaz and Ted, in doubles, 
extra-base hits, walks, games played. 
</P>
<P>
He has as much right to be Mr. Red Sox as anyone who ever played in that funny 
little lopsided ball park in the fens of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
You approach Dwight Evans on goals. Does he have priority goals? 
</P>
<P>
"You bet!" Evans shoots back. 
</P>
<P>
OK, what? 400 home runs? 2,500 hits? 500 doubles? 1,500 runs? 
</P>
<P>
Evans shakes his head. "A world championship," he says. "I want a world 
championship so bad. I can't tell you. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you realize in the last four World Series the Red Sox have played in, every 
one of them has gone seven games? Just a bounce here or there and it could be 
us, not them. Just once, I want it to be us. I want very badly to bring the 
world championship back to Boston." 
</P>
<P>
It's an ambition that might bring a look of surprise from some celebrated Red 
Sox of the past. But it might explain why Dwight Evans' bat has more hang time 
than a Ray Guy punt when he feels he gets only 2 1/2 strikes an at-bat. When 
you want to win it all, you put up with nothing.

IF LAKERS HAVE ONE, IT MAY BE PLAYING ONE-ON-ONE DEFENSE

<P>
Spontaneity seemingly has no place in Pat Riley's regimented practices, where 
every action must have a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Riley interrupted a half-court drill during the Lakers' first 
pre-playoff practice late last month, it was understood that he had something 
significant to say to his players. Riley spoke passionately and convincingly to 
his players about their perceived defensive weakness. He cited scouting reports 
obtained from obliging opponents, plus another report elicited from an 
independent scout, all noting that the way to beat the Lakers is to exploit 
their defensive matchups. 
</P>
<P>
Assured that the point had been made, Riley folded his practice notes into 
thirds, tucked them into the back pocket of his khakis and went back to silent 
observation. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a motivational tool," said Riley, when reminded of his short speech. 
"A lot of that was for attitude. We were building a challenge in them, like, 
'If that's what they think about us, then . . . ' I mean, I wanted them to know 
that other people don't think they can guard them." 
</P>
<P>
That evaluation, however, cannot be totally dismissed. There is some truth, it 
seems, in the assessment that one of the Lakers' few problem areas is 
individual defense -- as opposed to team defense, such as their effective 
half-court trap. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be a little realistic, because that's what other teams are saying," 
said Michael Cooper, the Lakers' defensive specialist. "We had lapses, sure. 
But it was a different intensity in the regular season." 
</P>
<P>
So far in the playoffs, however, the Lakers have proved those appraisals either 
inaccurate or obsolete. In sweeping the first two rounds, against Portland and 
Seattle, the Lakers have given up nearly six fewer points a game than during 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers, who credit their defensive resurgence to greater intensity and 
concerted effort, will face their biggest challenge yet starting Saturday, when 
they play the Phoenix Suns in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, led by quick point guard Kevin Johnson and high-scoring forward Tom 
Chambers, averaged 116.8 points against the Lakers during the regular season, 
when the teams split six games. And, so far in the playoffs, the Suns are 
averaging 122.8 points a game, more than any other playoff team. 
</P>
<P>
Though respectful of Phoenix's offensive capabilities, the Lakers say they are 
confident they can harness the Suns' powerful running game. If so, the Lakers 
will have to once again prove wrong the scouts who said they have trouble 
stopping open-court and isolation moves the Suns often use. 
</P>
<P>
"Those other teams that sent us reports, they always said the same thing," 
Riley said. "It was, 'Take it at them, beat them off the dribble. There's an 
opinion around that we don't have good individual defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"But, in this league, against the many offensive talents, there aren't many 
good individual (defensive) players. Everybody gets beat off the dribble 
sometimes. But you got to keep that to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
"(The scouts) got to look at something and ask, 'What can we attack?' Look at 
our starting lineup. Magic (Johnson) is a 6-9 guard and even though he is an 
excellent team defender -- probably the best team defender in the NBA -- he 
cannot really contain point guards. There's a physiological difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Byron (Scott) can guard and can contain point guards. James (Worthy) and A. C. 
(Green) are thought of as guys that aren't good defending out on the floor 
(away from the basket). And, then, Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Teams think they can break us down. So, we see a lot of isolation and putting 
the ball on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers already have faced such tactics against the Trail Blazers and the 
SuperSonics in their first two series and were hardly threatened. Through seven 
playoff games, opponents have made only 44% of their shots against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of tough individual and team defense, in the form of switches 
and traps, enabled the Lakers to hold Dale Ellis and Xavier McDaniel, Seattle's 
scoring threats, to 42% and 43% shooting, respectively. And, in the first 
round, Portland's Clyde Drexler made 49% of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased," Riley said. "We're doing a better job individually, cutting the 
(uncontested drives to the basket) down to a minimum. Once they apply 
themselves, our guys are capable of guarding people." 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, however, present matchup problems because they often play without a 
center. They also favor a fast-break offense -- "You can't really call it a 
passing game," Riley said -- and spread the court for Kevin Johnson in 
half-court situations. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is the Western Conference's version of Detroit's Isiah Thomas, but he 
may even be quicker and more of a scoring threat. In six games against the 
Lakers this season, he averaged 22.5 points and 16 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Probably drawing the assignment against Johnson will be Scott, with 
considerable relief by Cooper. Both talked as if it would be their toughest 
assignment in the playoffs, even if they end up playing Thomas and the Pistons 
again in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that he can shoot and drive presents a problem," Scott said. "You 
can't play him just one way. You can't say, 'I'll play him back and make him 
shoot the jumper,' because that's what he likes to do. You've got to get up on 
him and play him as tough as possible." 
</P>
<P>
And risk having Johnson simply drive around him for a layup or easy assist. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be scared of his quickness, because he might beat you anyway," Scott 
added. "Myself and Coop are more aware now what he likes to do and what he does 
best. We can't relax at all when we're on him. When you relax or straighten up, 
just for a second, he's gone." 
</P>
<P>
Even stopping Johnson, were that possible, would not ensure stopping the Suns. 
Chambers averaged 20.5 points against the Lakers and the Suns' other Johnson, 
sixth-man Eddie, averaged 22.4. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to stop two of their three threats," Cooper said. "That's the same 
line of attack (the Lakers used) against Seattle, where we had to stop two of 
the three -- McDaniel, Ellis or (Derrick) McKey -- in order to win. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we can beat these guys with two of them getting 30 and holding 
one down, and then having guys like (Dan) Majerle and (Tyron) Corbin come in 
and hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
If the Lakers manage to contain Johnson and the rest of the Suns, and advance 
to the championship series for the third straight season, maybe those scouting 
reports will have to be amended. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Laker players believed them much anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just looking at us in the regular season," Scott said of the scouts. 
"That's not the same. We've shown already that we're playing different. 
Everybody here plays stronger and more intense in the playoffs. But you'd have 
to say, definitely, this will be our toughest (defensive) test." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he has heard the criticism of the Laker defense before. "People 
have always said that about this club, that we're weak," he said. "Yet, we 
somehow always manage to pull it off. I don't think there's a weak link on any 
individual on this club. It's just a matter of asserting ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said that he, too, believes in the Lakers' defensive capabilities, that 
he just felt compelled to make his players aware of what others are saying. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted (the scouts) to be very critical, as well as telling us our good 
parts," Riley said. "There are a number of parts of our game that can be looked 
at critically." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, Laker players will eventually hear about them. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Guard Byron Scott aggravated his bruised right wrist Thursday in practice while 
trying to dunk over teammate Orlando Woolridge. Scott had the wrist taped by 
trainer Gary Vitti and continued practicing. . . . For the first time in eight 
seasons, Laker guard Michael Cooper was not voted onto either the all-defensive 
first or second team by NBA coaches. However, Laker power forward A.C. Green 
made the second team. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cooper: "There were a lot of good defensive players this year. It just 
gives me more incentive to play hard the rest of this season and next year. 
I've built a reputation on (defense). Not making it this year isn't going to 
make me or break me. But I've marked my consistency by it."

PINCAY BLAZES A SILVER STREAK TO TOP; 
</P>
<P>
JOCKEY WILL CELEBRATE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS FIRST VICTORY TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 17-year-old jockey was having trouble with his helmet. It was borrowed and 
it was too big. 
</P>
<P>
As he moved his horse to the lead at the head of the stretch, the helmet 
slipped down over his eyes. He tore it off, flinging it into the Panamanian 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Then he drove to the wire, his dark hair fluttering in the breeze, on his first 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 25 years and more than 7,000 winners later, Laffit Pincay Jr. remembers 
the exquisite feeling of that first victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget the feeling," Pincay said. "I was so excited I couldn't get 
to sleep that night. All the big races I've won since, I never had that same 
feeling again." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Pincay will celebrate the 25th anniversary of that first winning ride at 
Hollywood Park. After a quarter-century of endless dieting, intense competition 
and more than his share of personal tragedy, he stands at the pinnacle of his 
sport, with 7,152 winners -- only Bill Shoemaker has more -- and $141 million 
earned by his 32,676 mounts. 
</P>
<P>
But sometime today, Pincay might let his thoughts wander back to where it all 
began. 
</P>
<P>
It was the evening of May 19, 1964, in Panama City. That week, Marco Aurelio 
Robles had been elected president in what Time magazine called a "stunning 
upset." The defeated candidate, charismatic Arnulfo Arias, was crying foul. 
Tensions ran high. Business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
The election was the talk of the capital, but politics were the furthest thing 
from the mind of ambitious young Laffit Pincay. He was thinking about a horse 
named Huelen. 
</P>
<P>
"I had ridden him the week before, my first mount ever, when he was coming back 
from a long layoff," Pincay said. "He finished last, but he closed real strong. 
When he came back the next week, I liked my chances a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Huelen was a decent horse, perhaps a high-priced claimer by today's standards. 
But to Pincay he was a champion. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that he paid $58 to win that night. Forget that Pincay took home 
just $64 in prize money, kept $10 and gave the rest to his mother. Huelen freed 
Pincay from years of being little more than an indentured servant around the 
race track, a life of mucking stalls and walking horses after workouts. 
Suddenly, it was all worthwhile. He was a jockey. A winning jockey. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, Pincay was a star on the rise. He became Panama's leading 
rider, earning as much as $1,000 a week. He bought a white Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
And two years later, he was in the United States, under contract to owner Fred 
Hooper, and riding in Florida, Chicago and New York. In 1968, he chose 
California as home, to the everlasting gratitude of West Coast racing fans. In 
the words of one veteran race goer, "Pincay has never changed. He will never 
give you a sanitized ride." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the den of his new hilltop home in Glendale, Pincay is surrounded by 
25 years worth of irrefutable evidence, which includes five Eclipse Awards -- 
the first from 1971, the most recent dated 1985. No other jockey can match his 
day-in, day-out level of high performance over such a long period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Jockeys measure the success of their peers in terms of winning rides against 
the best competition. More specifically, they covet the meeting titles, those 
mini-seasons within the year that produce the champions of Santa Anita Park, 
Del Mar, Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay won his first major California title at Hollywood Park in 1968, when he 
was 21. Besides the reigning king, Shoemaker, his competition included Don 
Pierce, Jerry Lambert, Bill Mahorney and John Sellers, all regarded among the 
best in the business. 
</P>
<P>
This year at the Santa Anita Park winter meeting, the 42-year-old Pincay won 
his 33rd California championship, defeating the likes of Chris McCarron, Gary 
Stevens, Eddie Delahoussaye and Patrick Valenzuela. Even Pincay was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little surprised to be leading rider," he said. "But I'll tell you, 
there's no better feeling. And I don't care how hard people say it is to win a 
Breeders' Cup race or a Triple Crown race, winning the championship at a meet 
like Santa Anita is the hardest thing to do. You can never let up. Not for a 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Let up? Those closest to Pincay -- both friends and competitors -- maintain 
that Pincay is riding better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I think so," said trainer Eddie Gregson, for whom Pincay has ridden major 
stakes winners Super Diamond and Tsunami Slew. "He never seems to be satisfied 
with his own level of excellence." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tony Matos, Pincay's agent for the last eight years: "Laffit called me one 
night about 9 o'clock and said, 'Listen, I found two or three things I can do 
different, that can make me ride better. Watch me close tomorrow and tell me 
what you think,' " Matos said. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine that? So he won three races the next day. That's the trait of 
a true champion -- when you're already the greatest, and you're not satisfied 
until you find something that makes you do even better." 
</P>
<P>
Said McCarron: "That doesn't really surprise me. I remember Shoemaker saying 
something similar not long after I first came out here. I was surprised at the 
time, because I was hearing it from a guy who was 45 who I thought had already 
learned it all and forgotten more than the rest of us would ever know. That 
left an indelible imprint. This is the type of game that you never stop 
learning." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron, newly inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame -- Pincay was elected in 
1975 -- has been a keen observer of Pincay since he first saw the Panamanian 
ride in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started riding against him, the first words that came to mind 
were, 'No wonder!' " McCarron said. "No wonder this guy has won so many races 
and been leading rider for so many years. I could see right off the bat what 
kind of strength he had, what kind of know-how. 
</P>
<P>
"He leaves you with an immediate impression, whereas with Shoemaker, it's more, 
'How does this guy do it?' The reasons for Laffit's success are very obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"And yes, he has gotten better over the years," McCarron said. "There was a 
race just the other day, a maiden filly race, and he just left a lot of us in 
awe. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked beaten the whole way, but he just kept driving and persevering. He 
overcame the feelings of being on the second-best horse. Sure enough, he got 
the job done. It's the kind of thing he does time and time again. I still get a 
great feeling of satisfaction whenever I'm lucky enough to beat him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dan Smith, Del Mar's director of marketing, who has watched Pincay ride 
from the beginning of the jockey's California career: 
</P>
<P>
"He has a great capacity for knowing just how much horse he has under him, and 
he'll ride accordingly. He has such great instincts, and reactions and 
reflexes, he'll go inside or outside, depending on how much horse he thinks he 
has, and invariably he's right." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay can explain precisely why he has been so successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone might say a jockey is so good because he's got good hands," Pincay 
said. "Or they might say it's because he takes his horses back and makes one 
run, or because he's great out of the gate and always on the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you win races like that. But to me, the better shape you are in, the 
better you will do. Horses will run for you if you are fit. And it gets harder 
as you get older. Yes, I'm smarter now, but I'd rather feel like I did when I 
was in my 20s or 30s. There were horses back then that I could make win. I 
don't know if I could make them win now." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay knows every crease and ripple in his anatomy. By necessity, he has 
become obsessed with the discipline of losing weight without losing strength. 
In keeping his stripped weight at 115 pounds, he has gone through practically 
every diet fad. Friends have caught him contemplating a peanut in a Zen-like 
trance, willing the tiny morsel into a full-blown Thanksgiving dinner. 
</P>
<P>
For the last several years, Pincay has been successful with a precisely 
measured diet of fish, chicken, salad and vegetables. He keeps his muscles 
toned and his heart strong with 2 1/2 miles of race-walking every morning at a 
high school track. When he "cheats," he takes a bite of pastry or steak, chews 
it for the taste and spits it out. He loves to watch other people eat. 
</P>
<P>
"The times I get the most frustrated are when I'm doing everything right, and I 
still am having trouble losing weight," Pincay said. "I think about it all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
However, Pincay watchers insist that his obsession with weight has given him 
unique strength and focus. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised he's still riding so well," said Don Pierce, who retired 
from riding in 1985. "What does surprise me is that he's still riding at all, 
fighting his weight the way he does. I had to do the same thing, but just to 
keep my sanity, once in a while I had to let myself go. Laffit never slips." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kerlan, team physician for the Lakers and the Rams as well as medical 
supervisor for Hollywood Park, puts Pincay in a class by himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He has never broken under the stress of his program, which probably makes him 
the strongest jockey that I know," Kerlan said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a superb body -- tremendous musculature. He has so little subcutaneous 
fat that you can almost see through his skin to his muscles. It is unbelievable 
the muscle structure he has throughout his whole body -- arms, legs, back, 
neck, everything. He actually looks like a little linebacker." 
</P>
<P>
And because of that strength, said Kerlan, Pincay appears to be more in control 
of a horse than any other rider. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the only one who seems like he can force the issue, actually make the 
horse do what he wants him to do," Kerlan said. "He can hand ride and pump, 
often times not using his whip, pushing down on that horse's neck to get the 
job done. Sometimes I think the horse is surprised." 
</P>
<P>
When Pincay started riding in California, jockeys and officials also got a rude 
awakening. He was a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
"Laffit got a lot of suspensions in those first days," said Del Mar's Smith. 
"He was using some kind of big stick. He would hit these horses and they would 
stagger, then he'd switch and hit them the other way, and they'd stagger the 
other way. They'd stay hit for an eighth of a mile." 
</P>
<P>
Steward Pete Pedersen traces the younger Pincay's style back to his Panama 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days when he was suspended, he really took it personally," 
Pedersen said. "He came out of a school of riding where they were very, very 
aggressive. That's the way they survived. He was as aggressive as any, and he 
did pose concerns in his early years in California. The other riders had to 
take care of themselves -- that's what his philosophy amounted to. 
</P>
<P>
"A transition came over Pincay's riding several years ago. There was a time, 
when a rider bothered him on the first turn, Laffit would really wipe him out 
on the second turn. In recent years he's been a model, as far as not causing 
calculated interference. He is just as aggressive, trying just as hard to win, 
but he doesn't take that real advantage." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron has also noticed a change. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably a lot more easygoing now than when I first came out here," 
McCarron said. "Still, he's a very intense competitor, but he seems to be able 
to cope with the hard losses better than he used to. Not that he's turned into 
a good loser, but he's learned how to handle the disappointments a lot better. 
And that's another key to his ongoing success." 
</P>
<P>
The last five years have been full of achievements for Pincay, beginning with 
his first Kentucky Derby victory, in 1984 aboard Swale. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he had the richest single payday in thoroughbred racing history when 
he pushed and cajoled the weary Spend a Buck to victory in the Jersey Derby. 
Pincay earned 10% of the $2.6 million in purses and bonuses that day, and still 
considers it his best ride. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he won the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita on 
Skywalker, upsetting horse-of-the-year candidates Turkoman and Precisionist. 
</P>
<P>
On March 14, 1987, Pincay became the first jockey to ride seven winners in one 
day at Santa Anita. Then, last Nov. 9 at Hollywood Park, he joined Shoemaker as 
a winner of 7,000 races. No other riders have reached it. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay, however, is rarely aware of his statistics. He was surprised to learn 
that the 25th anniversary of his first victory was coming up. He prefers to 
concentrate on his weight and on his riding. 
</P>
<P>
However, the milestones of the last five years have coincided with some 
troubling times for Pincay. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay's wife, the former Linda Radkovich, committed suicide in January of 
1985. He has spent the last four years soothing the wounds and raising his two 
children, Lisa, 19, and Laffit III, 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I blamed myself for a long time after Linda died," Pincay said. "I thought, 'I 
should have seen it coming. I should have done something.' But there was really 
nothing I could do. I know that now." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Pincay had both a personal and family history of suicide attempts, of 
which her husband was painfully aware. But after her death, Pincay's guilt 
sometimes was debilitating. Despite his success on the track, Pincay would find 
himself brooding. Finally, the very real needs of his children pulled him back 
to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we'll never get over," Pincay said. "But it was time to go on. 
My daughter was a very big help. Very strong. We talked about it a lot. We had 
to remember their mother as someone who loved us all very much. But now she was 
gone and there was nothing we could do about it."

Actress Phyllis Davis has been Pincay's companion for the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
"Laffit has had to become both father and mother to his kids," she said. "It's 
not easy for him because he's got such a soft heart. He might ground one of 
them for a week, then change his mind the next day. But he knows he has to be 
firm." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay sold the Los Feliz home that he Linda had lived in. He busied himself 
with the renovation of the stylish new house that clings to a ridge in the 
hills above Glendale, complete with enclosed pool, observation deck, and a 
trophy room that looks like a wing in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to get out of that other house," Pincay said. "Too many bad memories. I 
want to keep only the good memories, and I can do that here." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay's personal life still is unsettled, however. After nearly 20 years with 
his business manager, Vincent Andrews -- during which time his mounts earned 
more than $125 million -- Pincay discovered that he was not nearly as wealthy 
as he thought he should be. In March, he sued. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court by attorney Neil 
Papiano, former counsel for Hollywood Park, Andrews' management company 
committed a breach of fiduciary responsibility when it allegedly put Pincay's 
money in limited partnerships that were designed more as tax shelters than 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Andrews, Vincent Andrews' brother and partner in the firm that 
represents several other leading jockeys, declined to comment on the specific 
allegations made in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The Andrews' attorney, Jim Hicks, said: "I think the Andrews brothers gave 
Laffit very good advice for 20 years. If there was a problem, I only wish he 
had come to us to work it out, rather than filing a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay also got a rude 41st birthday present in the form of a bill for more 
than $400,000 in back taxes based on disallowed shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I could retire right now, even if I wanted to," Pincay said. 
"I'm still straightening out a lot of things. Maybe it's better that I keep 
riding to take my mind off those problems. That's one thing I never do -- I 
don't take anything like that to the track with me." 
</P>
<P>
California racing without Pincay would seem strange. Although Shoemaker, who is 
retiring at the end of the year, always has been the recognized king of the 
colony, Pincay is the undisputed crown prince and quiet enforcer. 
</P>
<P>
"He sets the standard for the other riders," said steward Pedersen. "And he's a 
great force in the jocks' room, among the two or three greatest I've ever seen. 
I don't know of anyone who keeps better order without having to actually do 
anything. He just has to be there. Whatever he says, you know he means it. They 
don't mess with the gorilla."

The University of Kentucky basketball program will reportedly be placed on two 
years' probation, including one season of no postseason appearances, when the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. report on its alleged rules violations is 
released today, according to a television station. 
</P>
<P>
WTVQ in Lexington, Ky., quoted sources close to the investigation as saying 
that during the probation, the Wildcats would possibly also lose two 
scholarships, but there would be no ban on Kentucky games being televised. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Athletic Director C.M. Newton said the penalties could 
include up to two years' probation and a third year of sanctions, and 
university President David Roselle said the program is "going down the 
plumbing." 
</P>
<P>
Newton's comments came in a speech to the Louisville Rotary Club, but it was 
unclear whether he had seen the report beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gonna get through them, just like they did back in the '50s when they 
said Kentucky basketball was dead," he said. "We're going to enjoy the good 
times. The good times will be back." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rick Pitino, the New York Knicks' coach who is being considered for 
the Kentucky coaching vacancy, said he has not ruled out the possibility that 
he will take the job.

OKLAHOMA COACH CITES PROBLEMS WITH COLLEGE ATHLETES

Oklahoma football Coach Barry Switzer says he would be interested in joining 
the National Football League because of problems he's experienced trying to 
handle the college athletes of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaching collegiate football (in the 1970s), you didn't have the problems you 
do today," Switzer said during his radio show, which aired Thursday on the 
Oklahoma News Network. "Obviously, it was more fun than it is today because of 
all the problems." 
</P>
<P>
In December, the Oklahoma football team was placed on three years' probation by 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. for recruiting violations, and several 
Sooner players have had recent brushes with the law. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got the restrictions at NCAA. You've got the drug-alcohol abuse 
problems that didn't exist at the magnitude that they do today," Switzer said. 
"There's so many things that would make it much more enjoyable and easier to 
coach in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy still what I'm doing. There's only a few jobs in professional 
football. There's hundreds of college jobs and there's only 28 NFL jobs. Of 
those 28 NFL jobs, there's only a few really good jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Switzer said during the show taped Wednesday that he had an opportunity for a 
professional coaching job in the 1970s, but such a position would be more 
attractive than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I've got some friends that have gone on and accepted head coaching 
positions (in the pros)," Switzer said. "I would be more attuned today to 
entertain any opportunity than I have been in the past." 
</P>
<P>
What would it take to make him leave the Sooners? 
</P>
<P>
"I think, obviously, the job opportunity," he said. "You always listen. 
(Oklahoma basketball Coach) Billy Tubbs and I both have talked about the 
professional ranks and the opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Switzer said he liked the thought of disciplining players with financial 
penalties rather than unscheduled workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to worry about making a kid run stadium steps at 6 o'clock in 
the morning if he cuts a class or is late for a meeting," Switzer said. "(In 
the NFL), you just dock him 500 or a thousand bucks. It gets their attention. 
If they want to continue to do that. That's great."

Chinese authorities imposed near martial law in Beijing today to quell the 
biggest anti-government demonstrations since the 1949 Communist revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Motorized columns of troops, at least two immobilized by residents who 
</P>
<P>
surrounded the convoys, massed near the capital's center. But the students 
vowed to remain in Tian An Men Square to press their demands for democratic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Student leaders and Chinese journalists said they believe Communist Party 
leader Zhao Ziyang offered to resign from the Politburo over the crackdown, but 
this could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Television cameras panned through the Great Hall of the People where the 
martial law announcement was made, but there was no sign of Zhao, the leading 
reformer in the five-member Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown, announced by President Yang Shangkun, came just two days after 
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev left China after a four-day Sino-Soviet 
summit that was overshadowed by the million-strong demonstrations in and around 
Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Yang, China's figurehead chief of state, said Beijing had been reduced to an 
"anarchic situation" and that the normal work of government was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
His announcement coincided with the movement of thousands of troops into 
Beijing where the pro-democracy protests, including a student hunger strike, 
have drawn massive support. 
</P>
<P>
Yang was speaking at a meeting of Communist Party, government and military 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condition 'Increasingly Grave' 
</P>
<P>
Just before Yang's announcement, hard-line Premier Li Peng described the 
student-led protests that spread from Beijing to many of China's major cities 
as "increasingly grave." 
</P>
<P>
Student demonstrators in Tian An Men Square, the heart of the protests, jeered 
when Li's speech was relayed over loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
They drowned out the broadcast for several minutes by singing the 
"Internationale," the song of the world Communist movement. They then began 
chanting, "Li Peng, step down!" 
</P>
<P>
The students earlier had decided to end their seven-day hunger strike but tens 
of thousands of people remained in the square before dawn, many joining hands 
and vowing to sit down in nonviolent resistance when the troops arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Li accused a "tiny minority of agitators" of manipulating the protest movement 
and "using the hunger strikers as hostages to coerce the government into 
agreeing to their demands." 
</P>
<P>
This minority aims to destroy the socialist system, Li said. He accused them of 
forming illegal organizations and trying to create an anti-Communist opposition 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"They have damaged production and social order, and our country's international 
reputation," he said. "They have even launched attacks on Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, who has made great contributions to our reforms." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Particular Target of Protest 
</P>
<P>
The 84-year-old Deng, China's senior leader, has been a particular target of 
the anti-government demonstrators, who have called for his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
On Tian An Men Square, focus of vast demonstrations for democracy that 
disrupted the visit by Gorbachev and sparked sympathy marches across the 
country, the students vowed to remain until the government meets their demands, 
which include a dialogue on political reforms, press freedom and an end to 
officials' corruption. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight we have to stay here for the future of China," said a student from the 
central coastal city of Hangzhou. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were close to victory. Now I see it's far away," said another. 
</P>
<P>
They called on classmates to remain passive if troops tried to force them out. 
</P>
<P>
But one convoy of 100 army trucks carrying about 4,000 men was blocked in a 
western suburb by about 10,000 people chanting, "Don't let them through," and 
pasting pro-student posters on the trucks' sides as the young soldiers looked 
on impassively. 
</P>
<P>
The moves came at the end of a day in which the Beijing leadership began with a 
bid to persuade the students and their supporters to give up their protest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeals With Tears in Eyes 
</P>
<P>
Li and Zhao went to the huge square just before daybreak. Zhao, with tears in 
his eyes, appealed for reason. 
</P>
<P>
His call brought a partial response 12 hours later when the student leadership 
voted to call off a hunger strike by about 3,000 young people. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the fasters decided to continue and to stop taking liquids as well, 
according to an announcement on their public address system on the square.

ANAHEIM MAN, 18, IN CUSTODY AFTER HIGH-SPEED ORANGE FREEWAY CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old Anaheim man was in custody this morning and a second suspect was 
at large after the two allegedly stole a car and led police a high-speed chase 
on the Orange Freeway, where officers fired at a fleeing suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Brea Capt. Jim Oman said the incident began when two men robbed a Brea woman of 
her Acura Legend as she pulled out of her driveway at 9:30 p.m. Thursday. One 
of the men pulled her from the car, struck her in the face and then sped away 
in her car, while the other followed in a Nissan Maxima, Oman said. 
</P>
<P>
The two cars headed south on the Orange Freeway, speeding up to 100 m.p.h. 
(Story, Part II, Page 1.) The victim's husband followed them and overtook the 
Acura on the congested Lambert Road exit in Brea. There, the Acura driver 
jumped into the Nissan, and the husband got into his wife's Acura and continued 
the chase back on the freeway -- this time followed by police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The chase ended when the Nissan crashed into the highway's center divider near 
Yorba Linda Boulevard. Police shot Jay Le once in the left shoulder as he 
jumped from the Nissan and flashed what an officer thought was a gun, Oman 
said. Police later found a toy gun in the car. The officer's name is being 
withheld. 
</P>
<P>
A bullet also shattered the windshield of a car driven by a 19-year-old woman 
who was passing by the scene. She suffered minor injuries from broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
Le ran across the freeway and hopped a wall into the Homestead Apartments on 
Deerpark Drive. The other suspect ran across the freeway in the opposite 
direction and escaped. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of the complex directed police to a dumpster where Le was hiding. He 
was taken to St. Jude Hospital in Fullerton, where he is under guard, booked on 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, armed robbery 
and grand theft auto.

The jury said it rewarded "their efforts to develop international cooperation

Iran has asked the World Court to order the United States to pay compensation 
for the downing of an Iranian jetliner by a U.S. warship in July, 1988, the 
court's registry said today. 
</P>
<P>
In its application, Iran charged that Washington violated international 
conventions on the safety of civil aviation when the cruiser Vincennes shot 
down an Iranair Airbus A300 over the Gulf on July 3 last year, killing all 290 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Iran asked that the U.N.-sponsored court rule that the United States "is

1ST LADY'S FURY ON MITTERRAND VISIT DENIED

<P>
With this seaside town braced for a small-scale invasion, reports of First Lady 
fury over a visit by French President Francois Mitterrand brought a diplomatic 
denial today from White House officials. 
</P>
<P>
On Walker's Point, the 11-acre Bush family estate, Barbara Bush was spotted 
with broom and dustpan in hand on the eve of a 24-hour visit by Mitterrand, his 
wife, Daniele, and an army of aides, security agents and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the surface of that placid waterfront setting, however, were reports of 
anxiety over the Mitterrand visit. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Daily News reported that the First Lady was fed up with French 
demands on such particulars as beds and bathrooms for the Mitterrands, who 
arrive Saturday morning and will spend the night in the house of President 
Bush's mother, Dorothy Walker Bush, next to the main family residence on 
Walker's Point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife 'Bawled Me Out' 
</P>
<P>
Bush acknowledged the fray Thursday in Rochester, N.Y. While promoting his 
commitment to education with a visit to a high school, he confessed that his 
wife "bawled me out" over the disruption caused by the Mitterrand visit. 
</P>
<P>
In an additional sign of First Family sensitivity, the White House canceled a 
planned photo session inside the Bush residence Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The family feels their home is a private residence and should not be used for 
publicity purposes," said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.

The Bush Administration has decided to scrap the controversial "let it burn" 
policy at national parks for this year's forest fire season, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting officials in Washington and at Yellowstone National Park, which was 
devastated by wildfires last summer, the Washington Post said political 
concerns appear to have overridden scientific assessments for the short term. 
When the 1988 fires raged out of control for months, much of a dismayed 
American public criticized the government's burn policy although it was 
endorsed by experts. 
</P>
<P>
"Word has come from Washington that (this year) we are to fight every fire, 
including those caused by nature," Yellowstone spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said. 
"When the first lightning bolt torches the first tree this summer, we'll have a 
helicopter out there to attack."

NEW YORK POST TO SCALE BACK ITS SUNDAY GAMBLE

The New York Post's Sunday editions, which first appeared on newsstands just 11 
weeks ago, will be cut in size and price next month because of a lack of 
advertising revenue, executives of the newspaper announced. 
</P>
<P>
The Post will reduce the Sunday edition's price from $1 to 40 cents, the price 
of the daily paper, and will abandon several supplemental sections beginning 
June 4, the newspaper's president, Valerie Salembier, said. 
</P>
<P>
"The advertising support wasn't there for a million different reasons," 
Salembier said. 
</P>
<P>
No employees will be laid off despite the cuts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday edition made its debut March 5. At the time, media analysts called 
the venture a high-risk gamble that could determine the future of the 
188-year-old tabloid in the highly competitive metropolitan news market. 
</P>
<P>
The Post spent $25 million to launch the Sunday edition and undertook an 
aggressive campaign to attract more affluent readers and advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday edition's circulation hovered, however, at just over 300,000 after 
peaking at about 450,000 when it first hit newsstands, Salembier said. 
</P>
<P>
The revamped Sunday Post will cost the same and look similar to the paper's 
daily editions, she said, adding that the 40-cent price is expected to boost 
circulation "a couple hundred thousand, for sure." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of advertising support for the pull-out sections -- especially the 
absence of supermarket coupon supplements -- caused executives to reconsider 
their strategy for the Sunday edition, Salembier said.

Chevron said today it will re-route tankers around the Santa Barbara Channel in 
response to a request made by Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura). 
</P>
<P>
The congressman and Chevron made the announcement at a joint news conference 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron said the move will cost about $500,000 a year because tankers sailing 
up and down the coast will have to cover greater distances to avoid the 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that the public is tremendously concerned about tanker operations 
in light of recent events," said Thomas Moore, vice president of operations for 
Chevron Shipping Co. "We believe that re-routing our tankers can be done 
relatively easily." 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino on April 11 introduced a bill in the House banning Alaskan oil 
tankers from the channel unless they have a destination in the channel. He also 
sent letters to six oil companies asking that they voluntarily stop shipping 
oil through the channel. Chevron, he said, is the first company to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"Chevron deserves our appreciation for agreeing to our request," Lagomarsino 
said. He urged other companies to follow its example. 
</P>
<P>
"The channel is both a productive fishing ground and a productive oil-producing 
region. The islands themselves have been designated as a national park. . . . 
We should not risk our rich environmental resources to the damage of a possible 
accident when there are alternate routes available."

Japan's defense chief expressed shock today over efforts in the U.S. Congress 
to amend the FSX jet fighter agreement approved last month by President Bush 
and called on Bush to veto any changes adopted by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate attached amendments to the agreement that would require Japan 
to give the United States 40% of the production contracts on the plane and 
restrict Japanese use of U.S. technology. 
</P>
<P>
The FSX agreement is being debated in the House. Bush Administration officials 
said Thursday that putting new conditions on the agreement could result in 
Japan's breaking off the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be best if President Bush would veto any amendments," Defense Agency 
Director Kichiro Tazawa said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Tazawa said he was shocked that Congress even suggested changing the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan maintains continuity in observing international agreements," Tazawa 
said, implying that the United States does not. 
</P>
<P>
A Defense Agency spokesman said he could not comment on whether the amendments 
would cause Japan to break the agreement.

<P>
Britain's annual inflation rate rose to 8% in April from 7.9% in the previous 
month, boosted by higher rents and water charges, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.1 percentage point increase was more than economists had expected and 
increased expectations that prices would move even higher rather than peak at 
around 8% as Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson had forecast. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said its retail price index rose 1.8% in April to 114.3. 
The index stood at 112.3 in March and 105.8 in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Economists had expected an annual rate of 7.7% and a monthly gain of 1.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The government pushed up interest rates nine times to the current 13% from 7.5% 
last summer in an effort to control inflation. However, the resulting higher 
mortgage rates, which are included in the index, have had the effect of pushing 
up the annual inflation rate.

The Kentucky basketball program was put on probation for three years and banned 
from postseason competition for the next two years today for recruiting and 
academic rules violations that the NCAA said could have justified shutting down 
regular-season play entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Two Kentucky players, Chris Mills and Eric Manuel, also were declared 
ineligible for their part in the violations. Mills, the second-leading scorer 
last season, can never again play at Kentucky. Manuel, who sat out this past 
season after questions about his college-entrance exam, is ineligible at any 
NCAA institution. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky was banned from television appearances next season and limited to 
three scholarships each of the next two years. In addition, any player who 
transfers because of the sanctions cannot be replaced by a scholarship player. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky also must forfeit all money it received from the 1988 NCAA tournament 
because of Manuel's participation. 
</P>
<P>
The university may appeal the sanctions, but is not expected to. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Morgan, the NCAA's associate executive director in charge of enforcement, 
said the committee "very seriously considered" a ban on regular season play 
next year and perhaps the year after, as well as a ban on television for a 
second year. Other possible penalties that were not imposed included a ban on 
all scholarships and a ban on off-campus recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA report said the penalties were softened because the university 
cooperated with investigators and took steps to correct some of the ongoing 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Among the violations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former Assistant Coach Dwane Casey sent cash to Mills' father when the high 
school All-American was being recruited. The money was found in an opened 
air-express package in Los Angeles in April, 1988, triggering the investigation 
that culminated with today's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Manuel "committed academic fraud by cheating" on a college entrance 
examination and was allowed to compete during the 1987-88 season even though 
the school should have known he was ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Casey demonstrated a "knowing and willful" effort to violate NCAA 
regulations and provided false information to investigators about his role in 
rules violations. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA Committee on Infractions also cited a host of other, more minor 
violations such as providing improper trips, housing and inducements like free 
T-shirts to recruits. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're all a little bit relieved to see the NCAA investigation come to 
a conclusion," said Kentucky President David Roselle. "Our real objective from 
the very beginning was to save the basketball program." 
</P>
<P>
Former Athletics Director Cliff Hagan, a Kentucky basketball star in the 1950s, 
resigned in November. He was replaced by another former Wildcat, C. M. Newton, 
whose 30-year coaching career included stops at Alabama and Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Eddie Sutton and his entire staff also ended their four-year stay at 
Kentucky in the aftermath of the NCAA inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Newton has spent the last two months searching for a new head basketball coach, 
but has been stymied by concern among prospective applicants about the NCAA 
penalties.

The Italian Motorcycling Federation said today that the fines were levied by an

World champion Eddie Lawson and fellow Americans Kevin Schwantz, Freddie 
Spencer, Fred Merkel and Wayne Rainey were among the riders who refused to 
start in the race. They claimed that the Santa Monica track was left too 
slippery and dangerous after a sudden rainstorm.

The PGA Tour is proposing a PGA Tour Hall of Fame, a golf course-resort hotel 
complex and a headquarters for PGA Tour Productions Inc. in Jacksonville, if 
the city will provide $1.6 million over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
PGA Tour Commissioner Deane Beaman unveiled the plans Thursday before the Duval 
County Tourist Development Council. The council, which distributes proceeds of 
Duval County's 4% bed tax on hotel rooms, stopped short of committing to a 
four-year $200,000 annual grant sought by the tour, saying it needs more time 
to study the proposal. The plan is contingent on City Council approval of an 
identical four-year appropriation of $800,000 for a total of $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA Tour has never had a hall of fame, but there is a World Golf Hall of 
Fame in Pinehurst, N.C., operated by the PGA of America.

<TEXT>
<P>
All around the country, in growing numbers, people are closing their eyes, 
gritting their teeth, mortgaging their homes, cashing in their retirement 
accounts and taking the biggest crap shoot of their careers by starting their 
own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
And nowhere is the entrepreneurial urge more evident than in Orange County, 
where nearly 100 new businesses were begun each working day last year. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, in fact, has become a hotbed of small-business activity, a petri 
dish culture of cutting-edge capitalism. And the rich mix that fertilizes 
business development here is expected to produce bountiful growth for years to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a breeding ground for new business," said Chapman College economist 
James Doti. "We have the colleges and a core of high-technology firms and they 
throw off people who start their own businesses, and those businesses create 
the need for service businesses. And it goes on and on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Dominant Industry 
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 80,000 operating businesses in Orange County, 96% have 50 or 
fewer employees and 64% have no more than five workers. Those proportions 
aren't unusual, business statisticians say. Small firms make up the bulk of the 
business base of most communities. 
</P>
<P>
What is different about Orange County is that there is no big oil cartel or 
monolithic auto industry dominating the local economy, as in Houston or 
Detroit. Instead of a collection of similar concerns all feeding into and off 
of a single industry, Orange County's business base is made up of a little bit 
of just about everything. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government recognizes 970 different types of businesses, and at 
least 720 of them are present in Orange County. In most regional economies, the 
presence of even 500 different types of businesses would be remarkable, 
according to specialists like Terry Hill of the National Federation of 
Independent Business. 
</P>
<P>
It is this diversity that has helped the county's economy remain strong through 
several recessions in the last 2 decades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Post-Industrial Landscape 
</P>
<P>
And it is this diversity that economists and sociologists cite in 
characterizing Orange County as a leading example of a new post-industrial 
landscape, in which tens of thousands of small, constantly changing enterprises 
coalesce to deliver goods and services far more efficiently than America's 
aging industrial giants and corporate conglomerates ever could. 
</P>
<P>
Management guru Tom Peters, in a recent speech, called the Orange County area 
"the most exciting economy on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
And Alan J. Scott of UCLA, an economic geographer and urban analyst, cited 
Orange County as a model for "the new patterns of industrialization and 
urbanization that are now being laid down on the American economic landscape." 
</P>
<P>
Both said they find the county exciting because of its dynamic community of 
small businesses which, by necessity, are able to rapidly adapt to a changing 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Local business owners seem to agree with that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey of 522 small-business owners conducted for the The Times 
Orange County Edition by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates, 88% of the 
respondents rated the county good or excellent as a business location. 
</P>
<P>
But a vibrant economy like Orange County's is sure to experience its share of 
growing pains, and the Times Small Business Poll reflects a few rough spots in 
the local landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, the problems tend to be linked directly to the phenomenal growth 
and development -- Orange County's population has soared from 650,000 to 2.2 
million in the past 3 decades -- that has helped make the county such a fertile 
place for business formation. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic congestion and the inadequacy of the surface transportation system 
topped the list of troubles, with 46% of the survey respondents calling it a 
big problem for their businesses and 37% saying it is somewhat of a problem. 
</P>
<P>
The soaring cost of homes -- and the lack of sufficient housing to satisfy 
demand -- ranked second on the list of problems adversely affecting county 
businesses, followed by the cost of commercial land and rents, the cost of 
labor, the supply of labor, and difficulties in dealing with local government 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, 51% of the respondents said they expect to expand their 
facilities in the county over the next 5 years, while a whopping 86% said they 
expect to increase employment within the same period. 
</P>
<P>
But why is the small-business community so strong here? And what has made the 
county an incubator for innovative enterprises? 
</P>
<P>
Simply stated, the county has an infrastructure geared to support business, 
said Michael D. Ames, a professor of management at Cal State Fullerton and 
director of the university's Small Business Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Ames defined that infrastructure as "physical assets, plus people, plus 
mechanisms for improvement" and cited the planning of prezoned industrial parks 
in communities like Irvine as a major factor in the business boom that has 
given the county a $60-billion annual economy. 
</P>
<P>
The county also tends to attract people from higher socioeconomic strata, Ames 
said. That, in turn, has created a financial and educational base to support 
new businesses and a cadre of trained or easily trainable workers and managers 
to run them. 
</P>
<P>
Ames and other business specialists agree that the county has entered an era in 
which traffic congestion, the high cost of housing and the increasing labor 
shortages are eroding some of the area's attractiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"But we haven't done too shabbily so far," Ames said, "and we have the 
mechanisms for improvement to help address things like land costs. We have 
people who are clever in designing products people really want and in designing 
efficient ways to make them so we can squeeze more out of each square foot, 
often with fewer employees." 
</P>
<P>
While the infrastructure is important, the county's role as a business 
incubator is equally dependent on two factors that aren't man-made: climate and 
location. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial psychologist Michael Anthony, deputy director of the Orange County 
Business Development Center, said the county has prospered precisely because 
this isn't Council Bluffs, Iowa, or Mandan, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County began as a vacation spot, then became a choice living place for 
executives, and then they started bringing their businesses down from Los 
Angeles with them," Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
James G. Rourke, a partner in the law firm of Rourke &amp; Woodruff in Orange, 
has been in Orange County since 1956. "The semi-rural life style appealed to me 
then," he said, "and I have to admit that I didn't foresee that it wouldn't 
last long. But the trade-off has been the development of other amenities, so 
you don't have to go to Los Angeles for entertainment like you did 35 years 
ago. And without that growth, we wouldn't have the vibrant economy that makes 
this one of the most excellent places in the country to have a business." 
</P>
<P>
The county's position between Los Angeles and San Diego counties, with their 
stables of large aerospace and defense contractors, have also been of 
considerable importance in developing a healthy small-business community, said 
Frank Swain, author of the Small Business Administration's annual report on the 
state of small business in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The final ingredient is the presence a large number of educational 
institutions, including several 4-year colleges, eight community colleges and a 
major university. 
</P>
<P>
They have provided the basis for the latest wave of small-business formation: 
the electronics and medical and biomedical research firms that have helped turn 
the county into a leading technology center, said Chapman College's Doti. 
</P>
<P>
And that makes Doti sanguine about the future, despite the complaints about 
traffic congestion, air pollution, expensive housing and labor shortages. 
</P>
<P>
"This has become a high-priced area, and the higher wage rates that are needed 
argue against some specific types of firms being here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the county is attracting companies in the business services and 
high-technology areas," Doti said. "And these companies tend to offer higher 
pay and are highly specialized, so we get diversity and a lot of new employment 
of people who can afford to live here."

<TEXT>
<P>
Something has happened in the 33 years since William H. Whyte Jr. wrote "The 
Organization Man" and everyone wanted to work for a corporate giant like IBM. 
</P>
<P>
Whyte's paean to big business celebrated the millions of Americans who donned 
gray suits and "left home, spiritually as well as physically, to take the vows 
of organization." Their middle management values, he wrote, would "set the 
American temper" for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, in the intervening decades, those values seem to have lost their 
luster. In recent years, small-business owners and entrepreneurs have upstaged 
Whyte's exemplary executives as symbols of achievement in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
We've evolved from a view that big is beautiful to a belief that small means 
satisfaction, innovation, independence. And we have so romanticized the rewards 
of small business that we have often ignored the sacrifices of those people who 
have turned their backs on security and struck out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Endless Workweeks 
</P>
<P>
People like Peter Sloan, a lover of literature who found creative fulfillment 
by building a stationery business in Costa Mesa. Or Julie M. Caddy of Irvine, 
who endures endless workweeks and frequent harassment as she chalks up credits 
as an independent film producer. Or William C. Dennis, whose Laguna Hills print 
shop provided him with two heart attacks on the road to prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
But even a heart attack can be an acceptable trade-off for true contentment. 
"I've had a lot of benefits along the way," Dennis said. "I haven't had to 
listen to anybody telling me how to do something, someone in Toledo, Ohio." Or 
Tustin, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
Satisfaction, in fact, is widespread among Orange County's small-business 
operators. A hefty 97% of the 522 small-business owners who participated in a 
recent poll conducted for the Times Orange County Edition by Mark Baldassare 
&amp; Associates said they are pleased with their current business and careers. 
A majority of 53% found their current state of affairs "very" satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rewarded by Independence 
</P>
<P>
And the sense of freedom and pride felt by Dennis are sentiments that stoke the 
fires of small enterprise throughout Orange County: 81% of all participants in 
the Times Small Business Survey identified independence as a key reward of 
owning their own operations; 75% said building a business was a basic 
motivator. 
</P>
<P>
But the world of small business is not all roses and romance. To some skeptics, 
it represents a modern incarnation of the sweatshop environment that many of 
our forebears struggled to escape. Even to its devotees, small business often 
means long hours, lots of headaches and little remuneration for owners, and 
meager benefits, minimum wages and limited advancement for workers. 
</P>
<P>
So what makes this new breed of businessmen and businesswomen able to endure so 
much for rewards so ephemeral? 
</P>
<P>
Studies by the National Federation of Independent Business have found that 
small-business owners tend to be "Adrenalin addicts," said Terry Hill, 
spokesman for the group. "They have that feeling of control over their destiny 
that they don't get working for someone else." 
</P>
<P>
They're also optimists, said Ralph Sabin, a partner and emerging business 
specialist at the international accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney. 
"Otherwise, they'd never go it alone," he said. "They view the world as how 
they want it to be and fervently believe they can force circumstances to be as 
they perceive them. They may even be a little bit naive, but that's what allows 
them to take on the risks of having their own business." 
</P>
<P>
For the classic entrepreneur, the motivation to build a business is a creative 
urge more powerful than the lust for money. Of the participants in the Times 
Small Business Survey, only 57% identified financial rewards as a key 
motivator. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a desire to build something, to fill a need in the marketplace," said 
Arthur Perrone, vice chairman of the Geneva Cos. in Newport Beach, a national 
mergers and acquisitions firm specializing in private, mid-sized businesses. 
"It's the pride of having the best product that makes entrepreneurs tick." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Studies Put on Hold 
</P>
<P>
Peter Sloan, president and co-owner of South Coast Stationers in Costa Mesa, 
was working on a master's degree in English literature when he started his 
business. His plan had been to teach, not sell, to immerse himself in books, 
not balance sheets. But he had five children to put through college, and his 
studies were put on permanent hold. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years have passed, and South Coast has abandoned its original 
900-square-foot warehouse for new 25,000-square-foot quarters and increased its 
staff from two to 50. And through the years, Sloan and his partner, Glen 
Christensen, have crafted the kind of business for which they always wanted to 
work: One where workers are lifelong friends. Where employees and management 
spend their spare time together mountain climbing, skiing and camping. Where 
there's the time and money to give to and work for local charities. 
</P>
<P>
"Being from a literary background, I see a business as a form of canvas," Sloan 
said. "It's a form of artwork, a chance to be creative. You can make it up 
pretty much any way you want to." 
</P>
<P>
But there's a price to be paid: A full 60% of surveyed small-business owners 
said they work more than 45 hours every week; 15% work more than 60 hours per 
week, leaving them with precious little leisure time or energy. 
</P>
<P>
Four in 10 survey respondents said they have experienced health or stress 
problems because of their work. A third have run into financial troubles, and a 
quarter have had problems with their families or marriages because of 
commitments to the business. 
</P>
<P>
Julie M. Caddy, president and owner of JMC Video &amp; Film Production in 
Irvine, acknowledges that her workweek typically stretches to 60 hours, often 
over 7 days. She talks about the weeks on location without a day to herself, 
and the pride she's felt in watching her company grow and gain a reputation for 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
But she's reluctant to discuss the toll it takes. "Um, it definitely puts a 
hamper on your personal life," she said, delicately skirting the issue, 
pausing, then turning the conversation back to profits and prestige. 
</P>
<P>
"For anything good you have to make some sacrifices," she finally said of the 
life that has left her alone and, at times, vulnerable. "It's hard being in the 
business world. I'm single. People hit on you. It's hard to wear the tie and 
blue suit when you're a female." 
</P>
<P>
William C. Dennis is less coy. But at age 62 and with two heart attacks behind 
him, he knows that small business can bring big hassles. He is president and 
owner of Dennis Printers Inc. in Laguna Hills, a company started by his father 
and grandfather the year before Dennis' birth. Other than a brief stint as a 
box boy when he was 12, Dennis has worked for the family firm his entire life. 
His son, Larry, now runs the day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Printing was originally in Santa Ana on a site that a local charity 
wanted to acquire so it could expand its operations. That was in late 1977. 
Months went by. The charitable organization kept vacillating. The stress kept 
building. In early 1978, Dennis said, the group decided that it wanted the site 
-- immediately. Heart attack No. 1 struck. "A year later, I had my next one, 2 
months before we moved the business," Dennis said. "As the doctor said, it was 
specifically stress-related. It had to do with our work." 
</P>
<P>
But would Dennis have done it differently? Would he have fled small business 
for a secure office somewhere in a cozy corporate complex? Traded in his 
entrepreneur's spurs for the organization man's three-piece pinstripes? 
</P>
<P>
Like 97% of the small-business owners polled by The Times, Dennis' answer is a 
resounding "No." 
</P>
<P>
By thinking small, he said, "You're the master of your own destiny. You do it 
yourself, or you ask only one person. And the worst he could say is, 'Oh, Dad, 
that's a terrible idea.' "

DANA KARCHER, REFUGEE FROM BIG FIRM, BUILDS HIS OWN ENTERPRISE

<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Karcher, 36-year-old scion of one of Orange County's best-known family 
businesses, is a corporate refugee. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher is the son of Donald Karcher, president of the Carl's Jr. fast-food 
chain. Despite the obvious opportunities at Carl Karcher Enterprises in 
Anaheim, he decided at an early age he wanted to make it on his own. 
</P>
<P>
So he became a certified public accountant and joined an Orange County 
accounting firm. But it didn't provide the fulfillment he was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get out and get involved in the decision making and the 
operations," he said. "I wasn't being stimulated by looking at what others were 
doing. I wanted a hands-on career, and I figured it would take me 10 to 15 
years to get there staying with CPA firms." 
</P>
<P>
Karcher thought he could accelerate the process by leaving the world of 
accounting for the world of private business. He jumped when a fellow named 
Frank Feitz called his accounting firm and asked if anyone knew of a candidate 
to become chief financial officer of a small but growing company. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher joined Feitz' company, American Businessphones Inc., as vice president 
for finance in December, 1983. At the time, the Irvine business telephone 
systems firm had 100 employees and annual sales of $9 million. When he left in 
late 1987, it had 315 employees and was well on its way to posting sales of $30 
million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Wasn't Satisfying 
</P>
<P>
Karcher jumped ship because being on the financial side of a company still 
wasn't satisfying his desire for hands-on management and decision-making 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
So he cashed in his stock and options and went shopping for a business to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted something service-oriented," he said, "something that would satisfy 
my need to be able to build a business and look at it and say, 'I did that.' " 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing he ruled out was a fast-food restaurant. Karcher has 
nothing against that business, but he had intentionally passed up Karcher 
Enterprises. "I didn't want people to say that I was trading on family and 
connections," he said. "I wanted to do it on my own." 
</P>
<P>
A business broker brought him the deal that he and his wife, Jeanne, finally 
signed: a 6-year-old stationery and copy shop in Irvine in need of a little 
care and attention. 
</P>
<P>
Like many small-business owners -- especially those fleeing the corporate world 
-- the kind of business wasn't all that important to Karcher. He sees himself 
as a versatile manager, and what counts is the opportunity to build and operate 
a successful organization. 
</P>
<P>
"In the stationery and office supply business, like most businesses, what 
you're really selling is service and convenience," he said. "The big office 
clubs and warehouses compete on price, but we can offer personalized service 
that they can't." 
</P>
<P>
In the year since buying the store, the Karchers have seen revenue increase 
about 50%, he said. They are thinking about acquiring a second location. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher said his biggest mistake since going into business for himself was to 
push too hard to diversify. 
</P>
<P>
Eight months ago, the Karchers purchased a small office supplies 
distributorship, also in Irvine. The distributorship is losing money and 
sucking up a sizable portion of the profits from the stationery and copying 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't look at it hard enough." he said. "The price was right, so we closed 
the deal." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out the price was right because the business was suffering, and 
Karcher hasn't been able to turn it around in the ensuing 8 months. But he's 
confident he will. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, he said, is that he and his wife want to create something that 
will enable them and their four children to live a comfortable life, something 
that "will reflect well" on the Karcher name. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to make millions, and we have no plans to grow huge." he said. 
"We just want to do it ourselves."

<P>
So you think you're an entrepreneur? 
</P>
<P>
Well, if you own your own business, you most likely are, even if you don't 
quite match the popular perception of the entrepreneur as a quintessential 
risk-taking, reward-seeking, enterprising innovator. For while someone like 
computer maven Steven Jobs is without question an entrepreneur, not all 
entrepreneurs are like Jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Most, however, are small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the National Science Foundation shows that most of the innovations 
in American business and technology in the past 15 years have come from small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
And The Times Small Business Poll shows that 64% of all Orange County 
small-business owners consider themselves to be risk takers, with 7% 
characterizing their management style as "very risk-taking." 
</P>
<P>
But even if your business has succeeded with no risk to your health or wealth, 
and even if you wouldn't know an innovation from an innuendo, don't fret. 
</P>
<P>
Not all small-business owners are out to get rich or to take the world by 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
There are the mom-and-pop proprietors who want only to have a business that 
enables them to pay the bills and live a comfortable life. 
</P>
<P>
There are the middle managers who flee the corporate world to try their hand at 
calling all the shots and bearing all the risks. 
</P>
<P>
There are the ambitious immigrants who start a business because they lack the 
necessary language and cultural skills to assimilate into the mainstream work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
There are those lucky ones who have found in small business a way to pursue and 
pay for other, more consuming interests, such as skiing or sailing or 
collecting art or antiques. 
</P>
<P>
While small-business owners come in all psychological shapes and sizes, 
business specialists say most of them share certain common traits. 
</P>
<P>
"People who start small businesses are creative thinkers, risk takers, people 
who are willing to lay it on the line either because they are fed up with what 
they are doing or are convinced they have a good idea and can make it work," 
said Terry Hill, spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the people with a passion for what they're doing," said Arthur 
Perrone, vice chairman of the Geneva Cos. in Newport Beach. "It often costs 
them several families and part of their stomach, but they have that passion." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on this page and the next are profiles of Orange County proprietors 
who embody the many characteristics of small-business owners everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates 
of Irvine. For this survey, a mail questionnaire was sent March 24 to a random 
sample of small businesses. The survey sample was selected from the "Commercial 
and Industrial Directory" provided by the Orange County Chamber of Commerce. 
Surveys were addressed to the highest officer named for companies in Orange 
County with 50 or fewer employees. Before the sample was selected, branch 
offices and franchises were removed from the mailing list. By the close of the 
study on April 21, 522 surveys were returned. The distribution of responses 
closely reflects the company characteristics of the original mailing list and 
survey sample.

BIG OR SMALL FIRM? WORKER REWARDS DIFFER; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE, OTHER EXTRAS -- BUT LESS FLEXIBILITY -- COME WITH LARGER COMPANIES

<P>
Here's the scenario: You're looking for a job at a retail firm, and you have 
two offers, one from a small, mom-and-pop clothing store and another from a 
major chain. Which job do you take? 
</P>
<P>
If you want to work for higher wages, have medical coverage and a pension plan 
for your old age, your best bet might be to think big, as in Big Business. But 
if friendliness, flexibility and potential opportunity are high on your 
priority scale, less can indeed be more in Orange County's burgeoning 
small-business sector. 
</P>
<P>
But beware: While some at large corporations fret about perks like fitness 
programs, workers at small businesses often go without basic medical coverage. 
And outright worker abuse -- ranging from non-payment of wages to forced 
overtime -- is more prevalent at small companies. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that small-business owners necessarily take management training from 
Simon Legree. The major problem is profitability, a state of being that many 
small businesses find elusive. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the employee benefits you're talking about, you have to be a 
profitable company to offer them," said Frank Swain, chief counsel for advocacy 
at the U.S. Small Business Administration. "Small firms and new firms don't 
have adequate revenues and profits to offer employee benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder. The Orange County Business Development Center says that 72% of 
all new business starts will fail within their first three years. Nationally, 
88% of small-businesses start-ups fail to celebrate their third birthday, 
according to the Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not all sack cloth and ashes in the land of the entrepreneur. Small 
companies often offset low wages and limited benefits with increased 
flexibility in such things as work schedules. And federal studies show that the 
women and men hired by small businesses are getting breaks that are next to 
non-existent in larger firms. 
</P>
<P>
"By employing workers with little or no prior work experience, small firms 
improve the sustained employment prospects of these workers," says the 1987 
"State of Small Business: A Report of the President." 
</P>
<P>
But in more tangible areas such as health insurance, paid vacations, retirement 
programs and sick leave, small businesses are outclassed by their bigger 
counterparts. Consider the results of a nationwide study by the 
Washington-based Employee Benefits Research Institute: 
</P>
<P>
* Retirement programs are offered by 91% of companies with 100 or more workers, 
compared to only 43% of firms with fewer than 100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
* A full 99% of the larger firms give paid vacations, while only 81% of the 
smaller companies pay for such breaks. 
</P>
<P>
* Paid sick leave is a reality in 67% of large companies, but only 46% of 
smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
What does this mean for Orange County? Of the areas's approximately 80,000 
businesses, 96% have 50 or fewer workers. So benefits taken for granted by 
employees of, say, Rockwell International or Fluor Corp., are simply not an 
option for many county workers. 
</P>
<P>
And the smaller the business, the fewer benefits its workers tend to receive. 
</P>
<P>
Among participants in The Times Small Business Poll, 44% of firms with five or 
fewer workers offer no health insurance. In contrast, only 6% of firms with 26 
to 50 workers have no health care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
After paid vacations, health insurance is the benefit most demanded by workers, 
according to the SBA's Swain. And it's the one that presents perhaps the 
biggest dilemma for small business owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Small employers feel like they want to offer health insurance," Swain said. 
"Employees are increasingly demanding health insurance. But it's the benefit 
that's going up in cost the most." 
</P>
<P>
The eight full-time workers at Camelot Research Corp. in Anaheim are enjoying 
health insurance for the first time in the company's 5-year history. It took 
until 1989 for the company, which sells computerized foreclosure listings, to 
make enough money to cover the $1,000 monthly premium payments. 
</P>
<P>
"We started off not offering benefits at all in the beginning," Camelot owner 
Ronald M. Frumkin said. "Within the first 6 months, we started offering paid 
holidays. Then we also gave them a week's vacation. This is the first year 
we've offered health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
The altruistic side of Frumkin wanted to offer insurance as a way to "share the 
wealth" of his now-prosperous company. The pragmatic side realized that 
insurance is an important hiring and retention tool, even though he will pay 
dearly for it. The SBA estimates that employer health insurance costs are 
rising about 30% each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting employees is not the problem," Swain said. "It's finding the good 
ones, people who care about the quality of the job. . . . When I do find them, 
I do anything I can to keep them." 
</P>
<P>
Part-time labor is another issue that tends to separate small-business 
employment from work at larger firms. Part-time workers are generally paid less 
and denied benefits. At companies with fewer than 100 workers, nearly 20% of 
the labor pool works fewer than 20 hours, according to the SBA. At companies 
with 100 or more workers, only 8% are employed part time. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the paycheck. At companies with fewer than 100 workers, 40% of 
the work force earns less than $5 per hour, the SBA said, while only 19% makes 
$10 or more. At larger firms, about 20% of the workers make less than $5 per 
hour, while nearly 40% earn $10 or more. 
</P>
<P>
While big corporations have been criticized for workplace problems like the 
so-called glass ceiling -- an invisible barrier to promotion of women and 
minorities -- smaller companies are fraught with more fundamental worker 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
In the 12 months ended July 31, workers filed 153 complaints with the Orange 
County Human Relations Commission, which tracks such problems as unpaid wages, 
forced and unpaid overtime, poor working conditions and failure to provide 
mandated workers compensation and unemployment insurance. 
</P>
<P>
That number is triple the estimated 50 cases filed in 1985, the first year of 
the commission's concerted effort to reach local workers, educate them about 
their rights and intercede on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of businesses treat their workers so badly? It's impossible to 
generalize, said Barbara Considine, the Human Relations Commission's employment 
specialist. But the workers who have come to her have all been employed by 
small, marginal companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I never see someone come in here accusing Xerox or the Irvine Co.," Considine 
said. "I tend to get people who work for very small companies, businesses that 
are struggling themselves. . . . But that's no excuse. If you can't pay your 
workers, you shouldn't be in business." 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Martin Alanis and his cousin, Jose A. Escobedo, were promised $5 
an hour for remodeling and repairing homes as members of a four-man work team 
hired by a construction company. For four weeks, they worked primarily in Santa 
Ana repairing two homes, said Alanis, 18, who supports a wife and 4-month-old 
son in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
"He did pay us, but only once when he wrote a check to Jose," Alanis said. "But 
when Jose took it to the bank they later told him there were no funds to pay 
for it on the account it was written on." 
</P>
<P>
Alanis said the owner of the construction company owes him about $500 and owes 
Escobedo at least $700. In December, Alanis and Escobedo complained to the 
Human Relations Commission, and Considine contacted the owner. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to the employer, who admitted hiring them," she said. "He told me he 
was doing them a favor by teaching them a trade. He said, 'I'll pay them when I 
get the money, but I just don't have it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The telephones at the construction company have been disconnected, and the 
owner could not be reached for comment. Considine said she referred Alanis and 
Escobedo to the State Labor Commission to file a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
But not all small companies are borderline bankruptcies, and many make a great 
effort to do what they can for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Millsaps is vice president of national sales for Kanvas by Katin and will 
soon be co-owner. Millsaps admits that "being a small business makes it 
difficult to offer good benefits." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to ensure health insurance for the surf-wear company's seven 
workers, Kanvas by Katin joined an employee leasing firm, which pays the 
workers and covers their insurance needs for a fee, which is lower than Kanvas 
would have to pay for insurance alone. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, several of the firm's seamstresses work at home, and the company 
offers unpaid leave to allow for childbirth and continuing education. 
</P>
<P>
"They get exactly the same job they had before when they come back," Millsaps 
said. "We have a guy right now who took a year's leave of absence for school. 
He'll come back no worse off -- and possibly better, depending on how he does 
at school." 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Kanvas by Katin's special brand of flex time. 
</P>
<P>
"In the morning, the employees surf," said Millsaps, an inveterate surfer 
himself. "On Sunday, I made a corporate decision in the water off Surfside. I 
decided to open up an hour later, at 10 a.m. instead of 9 a.m. One of my 
employees was out surfing with me and was a real happy camper."

One day each month, Thomas Gaglio and a crew of fellow beauticians from the 
Thomas Jsalon in Newport Beach head to Orangewood Children's Foundation for a 
day of hair styling. The clients: abused and neglected children, 20 to 40 at a 
time. The bill: $00.00. 
</P>
<P>
It's a service that Orangewood might not get otherwise, said William G. 
Steiner, Orangewood's director. And for the recipients, it's not just a matter 
of money. "Many of these girls have been molested," Steiner said. "This is 
tremendous in increasing their self-esteem, just this one activity." 
</P>
<P>
A Thomas J cut normally costs about $35, and the value of the services the 
salon donates to Orangewood averages $12,600 per year. That's not a huge sum 
compared to the six-figure charitable contributions made by many big 
corporations. But it's a lot for Gaglio. 
</P>
<P>
Like many small-business owners, Gaglio's heart is bigger than his bank 
account. And any gift he gives or service he provides represents a bigger 
commitment than a similar donation from a big company. But he gives anyway. And 
he's not alone. 
</P>
<P>
From laboratory tests to loaves of bread, hair ribbons to auto repairs, lima 
beans to cold cash, donations from Orange County's small business community 
flow into the region's charitable organizations in a strong and steady stream. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$4.6 Million From Corporations 
</P>
<P>
"I think small businesses do give a lot," said Tom Hassell, vice president for 
resource development at the United Way of Orange County. "They give a lot at 
the neighborhood level. If you could do an accurate survey of all of the small 
businesses . . . I suspect you'd find most are giving of their dollars and 
their services, as well." 
</P>
<P>
But no one has ever done such a survey, said Nathan Weber, editor and publisher 
of Giving USA: The Annual Report on Overall Philanthropy. Total contributions 
of cash, products and services from the large corporations included in the 
report were estimated at $4.6 billion in 1987, the most recent year for which 
statistics are available. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their big-business counterparts, smaller firms are not equipped with 
multimillion-dollar charity budgets. In fact, in Orange County, 82% of all 
small businesses ultimately fail; many others have trouble meeting payroll and 
paying bills. 
</P>
<P>
"The poorer you are, the more difficult it is to give," Weber said. "That's 
naturally the case." 
</P>
<P>
Yet small businesses give, for reasons ranging from the philanthropic to the 
pragmatic. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Anderson, president of Anderson Asphalt Paving in Santa Ana, figures he 
donates between $5,000 and $6,000 each year to such groups as El Modena 
Community Center in Orange, Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana and Share Our 
Selves in Costa Mesa.

"It's not a great amount, but it's what we can do," Anderson said. "My favorite 
of anyone is SOS. I think that SOS does the real work that needs doing. They 
feed and clothe people." 
</P>
<P>
Gaglio, who was introduced to Orangewood through clients who support the 
foundation, said he gives of his time because foundation children bring him 
back to the real world. 
</P>
<P>
"In our industry, we get caught up in this fast-paced Orange County life 
style," said Gaglio, whose 12-year-old salon has 26 employees. "But being there 
at Orangewood, it's real. . . . This is something that feels incredible 
compared to charity balls and luncheons." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, fund-raising experts note that many companies donating their 
products are creating new markets by exposing more people to their goods and 
increasing their name recognition. Or they are able to clear out unwanted 
inventory that would otherwise be tossed in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Sun Glass Products, a Fullerton manufacturing firm, has donated 
about 7,000 hair ribbons, barrettes and curlers to the Southwest Community 
Center in Santa Ana over the past 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some merchandise that we wanted to get rid of," said Jessie Coffman, 
assistant manager. "We thought that giving it to a charity would be a fast way 
to do that. I thought this might help our cause and their cause."

Paul Kong owns Pain Dore, a French bakery that opened in 1982 on the edge of 
Little Saigon. Nearly six years later, the bakery started to make a small 
profit, and it's been in the black for about 18 months.

Free Laboratory Tests 
</P>
<P>
Kong spends 7 days a week at the retail store and nearby factory, churning out 
French rolls and baguettes for hotels, supermarkets and individual customers. 
And 7 days a week, a battered truck rolls up to the back door of Pain Dore at 
11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m., loads loaves and departs. 
</P>
<P>
This truck, however, doesn't head to the Holiday Inn or Man Wah market. Twice a 
week, the truck trundles over to Abrazar Elderly Assistance, a senior center in 
Westminster. On other days it makes trips to other agencies. Kong figures that 
he sends Abrazar alone more than 100-day-old loaves per day, worth about $100. 
</P>
<P>
"In place of throwing away, I give it to somebody who needs it," Kong says. "It 
makes me happy that someone who needs it and has nothing to eat has something. 
I can't sell all the bread. I prefer to give it to the people who need it." 
</P>

Jay R. Stern is another small-business operator who can't afford to make cash 
contributions. But the services he provides are just as valuable: an estimated 
$12,000 to $15,000 worth of free laboratory tests for Share Our Selves Free 
Medical Clinic in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Stern is a partner in Specialty Medical Laboratory, a clinical lab in Garden 
Grove that employs 28 full-time and part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, when the SOS clinic opened, Stern was asked to teach clinic 
workers how to draw patients' blood and do simple laboratory tasks. The clinic 
wanted to start its own lab, said acting director Vicki Mayster, but was 
overwhelmed by the job. So Stern taught a few clinic workers and then decided 
it would be better if he did the lab work himself. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, Specialty Medical does anywhere from three to a dozen lab tests, 
ranging from simple blood counts and throat cultures to complex tests for 
hormone and thyroid troubles and checks for exotic parasites. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't afford to give $12,000 a year," Stern said. "For us, it would be a 
lot of out-of-pocket cash. We were not galloping along when we started doing 
this. We are now breaking even." 
</P>
<P>
SOS sees about 1,000 patients every month, up to 20% of whom need laboratory 
tests as part of their diagnosis and care. 
</P>
<P>
And without Stern's help, Mayster said, "I don't think there's any way we could 
continue to see the number of people we see and offer them the kind of services 
we do." 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In late March -- after months of deliberation -- the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors adopted a growth-management plan designed to defuse one of the most 
divisive issues in years. 
</P>
<P>
Had it been up to the county's small-business owners, however, the plan might 
not have passed at all. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly half of the 522 participants in The Times Small-Business Survey said 
they opposed "having Orange County officials place stricter controls on local 
growth and development." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, most were willing to spare some change to deal with the consequences 
of growth: Nearly two in three supported a sales-tax increase to fund road 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
On other issues, poll respondents said the general outlook for small business 
is bright, expressed concern about inflation and interest rates and questioned 
the effectiveness of the government's efforts to keep illegal immigrants out of 
the work force. 
</P>
<P>
The growth-management plan, adopted at about the same time that the 
Small-Business Survey was sent to business owners, forbids developers to build 
houses, offices and other buildings unless they first pay to widen roads and 
otherwise offset the impact. 
</P>
<P>
Among survey participants -- who were asked about growth controls in general 
and not about the plan under consideration by the county -- 50% said they 
opposed imposing restrictions. Only 39% favored tighter controls. Another 11% 
checked the "don't know" box. 
</P>
<P>
Times pollster Mark Baldassare concluded that small-business owners, many of 
whom sell directly to the public, believe that controls would mean fewer 
customers for their restaurants, shops and service companies. 
</P>
<P>
In response to another poll question, for instance, 74% of the owners said 
population growth would benefit their businesses. Only 17% predicted a negative 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Those results are hardly surprising. Outside the building industry, it would be 
difficult to find a group more dependent on a growing local population. 
</P>
<P>
"I want growth left to the free enterprise system," said Kenneth E. Stevens, 
president of Irvine's $700,000-a-year All Care Services, which provides in-home 
care to the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the traffic any better than the next guy on the freeway, but I've 
seen communities where they restricted growth. You get a type of decay there," 
said Stevens, who described himself as a moderate Republican. 
</P>
<P>
That feeling is not unanimous, though. Ervin R. Cooley, for example, believes 
growth in the county has finally gotten out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not against a moderate amount of growth, but our public officials are not 
paying enough attention to how people are going to get in and out of our 
communities," said Cooley, president of Fountain Valley's SBI Inc., a 
$1.5-million-a-year microfilm company. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they're listening to the developers and not to us," said Cooley, a 
registered Democrat who said he often votes for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said he was not aware of the county's new growth management plan; 
Cooley said he was. 
</P>
<P>
On another public issue, small-business owners said voters should approve a 
proposed half-cent sales tax to pay for expanding freeways and roads. The poll 
found that 62% favor such a tax, 33% oppose it and 5% checked "don't know." 
</P>
<P>
A measure under consideration by county officials would increase the sales tax 
from 6 cents on the dollar to 6 1/2 cents and raise about $3 billion over 20 
years. But that's only if it gets on the ballot for a special November election 
and voters approve it. 
</P>
<P>
The county's builders strongly support the tax, since it would relieve them of 
some of the financial burden of building roads. 
</P>
<P>
It would also probably help defuse the local slow-growth movement by offsetting 
its most effective weapon, the increasingly frequent traffic jams that anger 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growthers defeated a similar tax measure at the polls in 1984. They called 
it a boondoggle designed to open up more of the county to developers. 
</P>
<P>
Some other recent polls also show voters in favor of a tax increase. But 
experts say that support may be soft and subject to shifts during a hard-fought 
political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara A. Ormand, manager of the Anaheim branch of Pasadena's $1.3-billion 
Community Bank, said the bank favors the tax. 
</P>
<P>
"If the congestion gets much worse, it's going to cause problems for our 
employees and our customers," Ormand said. "A tax on everybody seems the 
easiest and fairest way to get it." 
</P>
<P>
That is also the perspective of William P. Ficker, senior partner at the 
$2-million-a-year Newport Beach architectural firm of Ficker &amp; Ruffing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fairer than a gas tax, for example, because the number of people 
on the road are probably there in inverse proportion to their ability to pay a 
tax," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, affluent county residents often live close to their work and 
hence, use less gas, said Ficker, who described himself as a Republican. The 
less affluent often have to commute long distances from housing they can afford 
to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A sales tax could have the same effect, though. The poor tend to spend a 
proportionately larger share of their money than wealthier people on purchases 
of items subject to the sales tax. So they still could wind up bearing more of 
the road improvement burden. 
</P>
<P>
Fairness was also a chief concern of tax supporter Chuck Bearden, president of 
3-year-old Executive Horizons Inc., an Irvine placement firm that finds jobs 
for laid-off executives. 
</P>
<P>
"A sales tax spreads the burden around," said Bearden. "And it's a small price 
to pay compared to our big need for roads." 
</P>
<P>
All three respondents were aware to some degree of the growing debate over the 
county's 20-year transportation plan and the half-cent increase in the sales 
tax that is supposed to help fund it. 
</P>
<P>
The Small Business Survey questions were designed to elicit philosophical -- 
not highly specific -- answers. They do not pinpoint soft support or opposition 
and should not be considered the final word on attitudes toward these issues. 
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, surveyed small-business owners were guardedly 
optimistic, much like counterparts at larger companies who have participated in 
similar polls. 
</P>
<P>
When questioned about the general outlook for small businesses this year, 33% 
responded "excellent," 54% "good," 12% "fair" and only 1% "poor." 
</P>
<P>
On specific economic issues, 56% of respondents said inflation is likely to 
have a negative effect on their businesses this year, while 53% felt the same 
way about interest rate changes. 
</P>
<P>
Only 21% thought that the inflation outlook is favorable, and a mere 14% saw 
interest rates headed the right way. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. budget deficit is expected to have a negative effect on small business 
by 44% of survey participants, while only 4% saw positive movement on that 
issue. But a majority of 52% said the deficit was simply no big deal for 
businesses like theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite concern in some quarters about purchases of U.S. real estate and 
business ventures by foreigners, 49% of the poll participants said foreign 
investment in Orange County should have a positive effect on their firms. Only 
9% saw it as a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Survey respondents were skeptical, though, about the effectiveness of the 
federal government's recent immigration reform law, which imposed new sanctions 
against businesses that knowingly hire illegal immigrants.
