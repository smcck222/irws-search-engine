WALTON OBVIOUSLY HAS A LOT TO LEARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerome Walton's comments about teachers were those of an ignorant and foolish 
man. The fact that The Times chose to print them reflects not only a certain 
insensitivity on the part of your editors, but also the perception that 
teachers are underpaid because their jobs are easy and unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
The lopsided values of society can never be changed while so-called leading 
publications give any sort of credence to the comments of those whose only 
virtues lie in their physical skills.

How can Jerome Walton (Morning Briefing, May 13) compare a professional sport 
to teaching? Teaching involves management and appropriate response to more 
stimuli per minute than most other professions. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball players have some time to rest on the bench, but teachers, even at 
their break times, are making phone calls to parents or preparing for their 
class. 
</P>
<P>
The staff of Children's Choice/McDowell Elementary Campus in Laguna Niguel 
invite Mr. Walton to come and experience a day with teachers and students. 
</P>
<P>
With a lot of rest the night before, he may survive.

How convenient it must be for Gene Autry to have both his Western Heritage

Autry and Mike Port will have to decide when to make Winfield's transition from 
the Big A to a nice display case at the museum.

SHOCK OF LAKER FANS OVERCOME BY WONDER: WHERE TO PLACE BLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Riley certainly deserves credit for leading a post-Kareem team to 63 
victories in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
But Riley's accomplishments don't approach the outstanding job Larry Brown did 
with the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Brown took a perennial loser with only three holdovers and molded them into a 
poised, winning machine. 
</P>
<P>
With Magic, Worthy, Scott and the excellent backup cast that Jerry West has 
assembled, my grandmother could get the Lakers this far. And she wouldn't have 
to go to Italy for her wardrobe. She shops at Penney's.

SHOCK OF LAKER FANS OVERCOME BY WONDER: WHERE TO PLACE BLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How ironic that Pat Riley gets the NBA coach-of-the-year award right before his 
coaching (or lack thereof) contributed greatly to the Lakers' downfall against 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Example A: Games 1 and 3 are lost because Riley double-teams Kevin Johnson with 
the men who are guarding Tom Chambers and Jeff Hornacek. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Double-team Johnson with the man guarding Kurt Rambis. Riley finally 
does this in Game 5. What took him so long? 
</P>
<P>
Example B: Games 4 and 5 are lost because Riley has Byron Scott "guarding" 
Johnson instead of Cooper. With Cooper on Johnson in the fourth quarter, the 
Lakers take a five-point lead. Riley substitutes Scott and puts him on Johnson, 
who scores eight of the Suns' final 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a six-year season-ticket holder whose seats were just converted to Senate 
Seats next year with a raise in price from $14.50 to $60 per game. I'm more 
upset about Riley's defense than the 400% increase in ticket price.

THE 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' CAST PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is time to take a stand against the eroding of values, and the entertainment 
industry is perhaps the worst offender. Clay has a right to say what he feels, 
but I disagree with TV executives who allow him to reach a mammoth audience. 
</P>
<P>
Why is this country so eager to make itself look, in the eyes of the world, 
like bunch of foul-mouthed morons? Don't our politicians make us look bad 
enough?

THE 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' CAST PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every so often, some Midwestern housewife would get all huffy about the 
questionable taste of "Saturday Night Live," and that was understandable. But 
when the cast gets all huffy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nora Dunn, an "SNL" regular, refused to perform because controversial comedian 
Andrew Dice Clay was host. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Sinead O'Connor withdrew as a guest. What has happened to the cast's 
sense of humor and tolerance? 
</P>
<P>
I don't recall Garrett Morris protesting when Richard Pryor hosted, even though 
Pryor used the "n" word in his act. I don't recall Jane Curtin refusing to 
appear when Eric Idle hosted, even though Idle (in drag) made fun of women in 
Monty Python skits. 
</P>
<P>
And I don't recall anybody refusing to appear when Sam Kinison -- who blazed 
the trail down which Mr. Clay now merrily skips -- hosted the show. 
</P>
<P>
"SNL" used to be on TV comedy's cutting edge. But, if cast members are going to 
get bent out of shape over things like the material of the host, then that edge 
will end up about as sharp as an installment of "Donny and Marie."

<TEXT>
<P>
It amazes me how three eminent writers can contribute to the Opinion section 
(May 13) on federal taxes without once referring to government waste. They 
cover, quite thoroughly, the adversary positions being taken by both the 
Democratic and Republican representatives in Washington without alluding to the 
General Accounting Office (GAO) Financial Integrity Act report and the Grace 
Commission report of a few years ago on the needless spending. 
</P>
<P>
I am referring to: 
</P>
<P>
* "Between a Political Rock and an Economic Hard Place," by William Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
* Column Left, "Democrats Hold the Cards, but . . ." by Robert Kuttner. 
</P>
<P>
* Column Right, "White House Doublespeak on Taxes," by George F. Will. 
</P>
<P>
In his recent interview on CBS Evening News, the comptroller general estimated 
that the waste uncovered by the GAO report totaled $180 billion! That is enough 
government waste to eliminate the federal deficit. This is in complete 
agreement with the Grace Commission report. 
</P>
<P>
It is shocking that as Congress continues to raid the surplus from the Social 
Security Trust Fund and while many congressmen and other elected officials are 
calling for increases in taxes, the GAO report, which is a detailed road map 
for eliminating the deficit, remains untouched. It is a scandal that Congress 
has failed to enact the recommendations contained in this report. It should be 
kept in mind that the GAO is the investigating agency of the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Grace Commission report specifically warned Congress of the savings and 
loan crisis long before it occurred. If Congress had enacted this full report, 
the S&amp;L crisis would not only have been prevented, but would have 
eliminated the government waste responsible for the federal deficit. The GAO 
report now gives Congress a second chance to at least eliminate the waste 
responsible for the deficit.

COLUMBIA RIVER SURPLUS WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I first thought of the idea of bringing water to California from the Columbia 
River more than 40 years ago when I served as a Los Angeles City councilman. At 
that time I was given a tour of the California aqueduct by the Department of 
Water and Power. During that tour, a water engineer told me that our water 
supplies would one day be insufficient and that it was important to study new 
sources. The Columbia River, he said, was one possible source. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as we enter our fourth year of drought -- the worst in 400 years -- the 
words of that water engineer are ringing true. Water rationing has already 
started in many parts of our state and if this situation continues to worsen, 
our huge agriculture industry, upon which so many parts of this country depend, 
will be severely hit. 
</P>
<P>
The Columbia River each day dumps 90 billion gallons of fresh water into the 
Pacific Ocean. My proposal to divert just 3 billion gallons a day from that 
huge surplus, by way of aqueducts connecting the Columbia River to Shasta Lake 
and the Snake River to Lake Mead, would help to meet California's critical 
water needs without causing hardship to our neighbors in the Northwest. That 
small fraction of the Columbia's runoff would not endanger the fisheries, nor 
will it drain their water supplies. That small fraction will, however, help to 
save our agricultural regions and provide an estimated 20,000 jobs during the 
long-term construction of the aqueduct system, not just for Californians but 
for people throughout the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of diverting surplus water from the Columbia River is not a "weird 
notion" ("Wringing Out Weird Notions," editorial, May 10), but I remember 
people saying the same thing when I wanted to place emergency telephones on the 
freeways and when I wanted firefighters trained as paramedics in Los Angeles 
County. Those ideas were considered "far-fetched" when I first proposed them, 
but they save lives and are worth every battle I fought to make them a reality. 
I have always believed that "without vision, people perish." KENNETH HAHN

GREENBELT PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was reading the hilarious story about the homeowner who ignored several 
stop-work orders from the California Coastal Commission (May 11), went ahead 
with the construction of his 6,000-square-foot house and get this -- it gets 
funnier and funnier; then a preservation agency gave him $50,000 to help him 
pay $165,000 for 2.3-square acres of permanent greenbelt that will enhance his 
house. This fine citizen has "promised not to build on it." 
</P>
<P>
Under these terms he won't be penalized! 
</P>
<P>
This is a penalty? Anyone who can afford to spend at the very least $600,000 on 
construction costs and then receive more than 30% towards the purchase of 2.3 
acres of greenbelt that will only improve his property -- well, this man is a 
genius. He has been given a reward for ignoring the commission's stop orders. 
The punch line: "This sends a message out to people who violate the Coastal 
Act, that they have to play by the same rules as everybody else." What rubbish!

LIVING A NEIGHBORHOOD NIGHTMARE; 
</P>
<P>
SQUATTERS: LIVING NEXT DOOR TO AN ABANDONED HOUSE IS AN EYE-OPENING, 
SOUL-WRENCHING EXPERIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GORDON, Paul Gordon is a writer who has lived in his Hollywood 
neighborhood for more than 10 years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have led a sheltered life, and guarded. From this second-story room, up among 
the trees, images of postcard Hollywood -- the boulevard, the famous sign, 
mansions on the hills -- float in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Directly below is a flat bungalow surrounded by a tall wire fence. The house is 
boarded up, but not abandoned. The courtyard, hidden back from the street, is 
laid out like a stage. Its props are a shifting congregation of mattresses, 
piles of bottles and shoes, two shopping carts, a wheelchair twisted in a heap. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, from the safety of my room, I have watched this house, once 
the home of a good friend, become a "squat" for the city's homeless, a 
no-man's-land adrift inside a fence, the edge of civilization as I have known 
it. 
</P>
<P>
It was a descent of ordered stages. The owner sold the house to a developer; 
soon after came the tenants' eviction notice, a truck to move belongings, a few 
beers, a few goodbys. The doors were locked, the keys were left inside. But 
that evening I saw the front door hanging, handle smashed, off its hinges. A 
candle flickered on the mantle; there was a murmur of low, furtive voices. I 
stopped on the threshold, afraid to go inside. 
</P>
<P>
The police didn't hesitate. They marched through the rooms with a thorough, 
weary purpose. A few kids, red-eyed, were dragged out, then scattered into the 
night. In half an hour, they were back. In a week, the house was destroyed. In 
daylight, neighbors joined the pillage. Children rode their bicycles through 
the rooms, the fixtures were pried from the walls and carried off, the 
courtyard filled up with wire, pipes and broken glass. At night the street kids 
took over. 
</P>
<P>
Then one day, a truck with Sonora plates pulled up and a Mexican family moved 
into the house. The father and his two sons had the trespassers out in short 
order. The family began to fix up the place as best they could. The broken 
windows were boarded over, the trash in the courtyard was bagged up and carted 
away. 
</P>
<P>
They were friendly people. Still, there was a hesitation in the greetings we 
exchanged over the fence. In truth, they were squatters, too. But no one 
bothered them, and for the week or so they lived there, the house was clean and 
quiet. Then one morning, early, they were gone. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours the kids were back, but in a few days a new group, tougher and 
louder, took over. They were in turn replaced by a crew of veteran street 
people, crazed from years of homelessness. Then came the gangs. It was cave 
politics: The wild replaced the peaceable, the crazies pushed out the wild 
until, within a month, only the wildest and craziest remained. 
</P>
<P>
What went on inside the ruined rooms, I could only imagine. From my window, I 
saw enough: On the roof, gang bangers sunned themselves, their weapons close at 
hand; down in the courtyard, the house's dump and common toilet, the losers, 
too old or sick or spacey to fight their way inside, sprawled on filthy 
mattresses, drifting in lower limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the shelter and safety of the courtyard was preferable to the street. 
Every day a steady stream of newcomers camped inside the yard. Men and women, 
sometimes children, squatted in corners, cooked on fires fed with kindling from 
the house, or slept in the shade of a small poinsettia bush, still blooming 
brightly. 
</P>
<P>
Every night the smell of wine wafted across the fence. Shouts and cursing rose 
from the courtyard in contrast to the eerie stillness which enveloped the 
house. From the windows, gang members scanned the street with a casual posture 
that seemed to say we neighbors weren't worth mugging. 
</P>
<P>
What could be done? The owner, his luxury-apartment project mired in delays, 
claimed that securing the property was impossible. And from my city councilman 
I received only a copy of his note to the developer requesting that he clean up 
the garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd inside the fence grew larger, wilder. Once I counted 25 people 
rolling around inside the property. Sleep was impossible. At night I lay 
listening to the howls from the courtyard, so angry, so chaotic -- and so 
close. 
</P>
<P>
When a crisis flared -- a fight, or the sound of a gunshot -- I dialed 911. I 
did so with hesitation. Phoning the police was like calling in an air strike; 
you could never be sure with what force the impact would arrive, or where or 
when. Sometimes the cruisers would arrive in minutes, sometimes not at all. The 
cops themselves were often unpredictable. One time I saw an officer patiently 
help a youth fill his shopping cart and press some money into his hand, and 
once I stood behind the fence -- my fists clenched -- as a cop flung a drunken 
man head-first into a wall. But always, a few minutes after the cruisers had 
gone, the courtyard and then the house filled up again. 
</P>
<P>
By summer's end a natural evolution was taking its course. The bungalow was 
falling apart, its timbers sagging, roof torn away. The gang moved on; in the 
flatland of Hollywood, newer squats were opening up on every block. Eventually 
only three tired souls, a woman and two men, remained down in the courtyard. 
Amid the trash and stench, they slept all day, in dreadful quiet. It was as if 
the property, a carcass first set upon by wolves, had been abandoned to the 
worms. 
</P>
<P>
Finally a crew from the Department of Building and Safety arrived one day and 
boarded up the house -- ironically, now destined to be razed for a low-income 
project. A tall wire fence was strung along the property line. For a few days I 
found the fence ripped and torn in places, then the house was left alone, 
inhabited only by pigeons rustling in the eaves. 
</P>
<P>
From my room I still keep watch; I have become the house's caretaker. There is 
a hole in the back fence, small enough to crawl through, and when it rains 
enough to keep the dust down, I slip inside the courtyard to clear up what's 
left behind. There is the blackened fire pit, bottles sloshing with wine and 
cigarette butts, a blanket smeared with waste. I pick it up and place it in a 
bag, move on down the property line. A drop of rain falls on my wrist, that 
separates my house from this.

GERRYMANDERING IN CALIFORNIA AND MERITS OF PROPS. 118, 119 
</P>

<P>
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe ("Changing the Shape of Politics, in Homage to Gerry's 
Memory," Opinion, May 6) is wrong to suggest that reapportionment necessarily 
has to be a political process, or that today's battle over the two 
reapportionment initiatives on the June ballot, Propositions 118 and 119, boil 
down to a Republicans versus Democrats issue. 
</P>
<P>
She is also wrong when she says that the debate over fairness in redistricting 
is simply "smoke and mirrors" to mask partisan motives. These are the usual 
refrains either of long-time political observers who have grown cynical, or of 
partisan Democrats who are the chief beneficiaries of the current unfairness, 
and who seek to discount efforts to change it by characterizing their opponents 
as similarly motivated. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Californians have been without effective representative 
government for a decade. Millions of our state's voters have been 
disenfranchised by lines on a map. The Phil Burton-Jerry Brown gerrymander of 
1982 cemented into place districts that so favored incumbents of both parties 
that you stand more chance of removing someone from the Soviet Politburo than 
of mounting a successful electoral challenge in California. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does this make legislators less responsive to the voters, it rewards 
extremists in both parties because they only have to win their party primary in 
these lopsided districts, and not worry about appealing to the moderate center 
in the general election. The result is unresponsive, unrepresentative, bad 
government. 
</P>
<P>
It is also one reason that the initiative process has gone wild, because 
popular initiatives are one of the few ways around an imperial legislature. 
</P>
<P>
It does not have to be that way. Either Proposition 118 or Proposition 119 can 
help to promote more sensible districts that more accurately reflect voter 
sentiment, and that do not have as their chief goal the protection of 
incumbents. We will get better government in California if we promote 
competitive elections. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it true that all approaches are the same. Jeffe's article reports Rep. 
Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) as saying that the legislative process depends on 
who gets elected. But who gets elected, in turn, can be the result of fair and 
competitive elections, or of lines drawn on a map in a smoke-filled room. I 
would hate to see the day when "fairness" has no place in the political 
process. Propositions 118 and 119 are attempts to reintroduce it.

<P>
Probably one of the most important votes on the June 5 ballot will be 
Proposition 119. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote will stop the politicians from insulating themselves from the voters 
by drawing safe districts, will create a commission to draw fair boundaries for 
legislative districts, will give freedom-loving Californians an opportunity to 
vote out of office politicians with whom they disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 119 was written for the people for a change, not for the benefit of 
the politicians. For this reason you will find many politicians are working 
hard and putting a lot of money behind defeating it. 
</P>
<P>
It's time the voting public took control of our government. Let them know they 
are working for us.

Your editorial opposing Proposition 118 was right on target in pointing out 
that the measure really changes nothing in the ways incumbent politicians draw 
lines to ensure their own political survival ("Prop. 118: Chaos in Sacramento," 
May 12). 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being a reform, Proposition 118 is really the "incumbent protection 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
Under the two-thirds scheme, Democrat and Republican leaders would assure the 
preservation of incumbents and go further to reward and punish party members to 
maintain power for the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Remember also, that the current districts were approved by a two-thirds vote of 
the Legislature and could have been vetoed by the governor -- so what's new? 
</P>
<P>
It is time to put the public back in charge. Only the nonpartisan, independent 
commission approach in Proposition 119 puts citizens in a position to establish 
district lines for the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 119 is the best chance for fair redistricting for the 1990s. With 
the League of Women Voter's support, the voters may actually get the chance to 
pick their politicians rather than politicians picking their voters.

FACES . . . : ACTRESS OF CHINESE DESCENT RELISHES ROLES THAT BREAK THE COLOR 
BARRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three weeks ago, actress Lauren Tom -- the feisty, abusive dim sum waitress in 
Orion Pictures' black comedy, "Cadillac Man" -- was doing Jacobean tragedy in 
Chicago and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Now she lives in a guest house in Beverly Hills and is preparing for her first 
appearance on "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
"I spent the last eight years doing a lot of theater, and I started moving into 
really heavy theater, Jacobean and Greek tragedies," says the 
20-to-30-something Chicago native. "It's so heavy and gut-wrenching. And you 
have to project so far out into the theater. Now I'm more interested in doing 
things that are a little more naturalistic." 
</P>
<P>
In "Cadillac Man," she plays a Chinese immigrant who appears in three scenes. 
She based the role, including the accent, on her restaurant-owning grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
"My character is so aggressive and pushy and rude to her customers," Tom says. 
"But you have to understand what's behind it. She gets so involved with her 
customers' lives -- it's like family to her. And you know how you are to your 
family." 
</P>
<P>
In the theater, Tom, who is of Chinese descent, managed to break the color 
barrier that usually keeps nonwhites from "colorblind" or traditional roles. 
She won an Obie award for her portrayal of a hotel clerk from Ohio in the New 
York Shakespeare Festival's production of "American Notes," for example, and 
played for a year in "A Chorus Line" on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"I am American, third generation, and I like to play parts that could be 
anything, not just characters where I do (a Chinese) accent," Tom says. "In 
theater, it's much better. I think it's coming along a little slower in film 
and TV." 
</P>
<P>
After "Cadillac Man," Tom will appear at the Mark Taper, Too, in a performance 
art piece set to music composed by Jan Kaczmarek. SHARON BERNSTEIN

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: NOT A TYPICAL HISTORICAL ROMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mollie Aghadjian's new book, "Terms of Surrender" (Harlequin), is a historical 
romance set in Napoleonic France. 
</P>
<P>
But the story of a mysterious merchant trader whose business is threatened by 
Napoleon's incursions into Europe offers more than the typical historical 
romance, says the Mission Viejo author, who wrote her new book under the pen 
name Mollie Ashton. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of push against the edges of the genre," said Aghadjian, adding with a 
laugh: "Sometimes I get away with it; sometimes I don't." 
</P>
<P>
In writing historical romances, she said, "I generally make historical 
characters very much a part of the plot. Most historical romances don't. 
They'll talk about Napoleon's troops -- you can hear the cannons in the 
distance -- but that's about as much reference as you get to the period 
usually." 
</P>
<P>
In "Terms of Surrender," she said, "the hero of the story is actually very 
mysteriously and deeply connected with the Bonaparte family, and the Bonapartes 
are major characters in the story." 
</P>
<P>
"Terms of Surrender" is Aghadjian's ninth book. She also writes Silhouette 
romances under the pen name Moeth Allison. 
</P>
<P>
The English-born author, who has been in this country 30 years, does a lot of 
primary research for her historical romances in England. Although she has 
written contemporary romances, she said the historicals "seem to be my medium." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons is, though I'm an American politically, I don't have that 
sense in my bones of having grown up here," she said, "knowing what it's like 
to go to school here, the radio and early television and all those things that 
go to make up an American today."

BENSONHURST 'RINGLEADER' CLEARED OF MURDER CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The accused ringleader in the slaying of a black Brooklyn teen-ager by a white 
gang was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges Friday, just one day 
after a co-defendant in the case was convicted of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
A state Supreme Court jury cleared 19-year-old Keith Mondello of two counts of 
second-degree murder and two counts of manslaughter, but found him guilty of 
several lesser charges, including rioting, menacing, racial discrimination and 
criminal possession of a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Mondello's partial acquittal sparked pandemonium in the court as relatives and 
friends of the victim in the case shot to their feet and shouted their 
disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
"You're gonna get yours, you're gonna get yours!" one person screamed at 
Mondello as the verdict was read by forewoman Mimi Snowden. "He did it, he did 
it!" several others cried. Diane Hawkins, the mother of slain 16-year-old Yusuf 
Hawkins, sobbed and pounded her fists against her knees. 
</P>
<P>
At least two people were forcibly removed from the courtroom by security 
officers after their outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the aisle, members of the Mondello family hugged and 
kissed one another. "Thank God! Thank God! Jesus has risen!" Michael Mondello, 
the defendant's father, proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Brooklyn courthouse, hundreds of protesters who had waited on edge 
all day tore down police barricades around the building after the verdict was 
announced. They shouted "No justice, no peace!" One group of demonstrators ran 
around the courthouse square carrying a mock coffin of black-painted plywood. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Al Sharpton, an adviser to the Hawkins family, told the crowd near the 
courthouse, "We are not going to take this verdict lying down. . . . We intend 
to move this city like it's never been moved before." 
</P>
<P>
Police managed to keep the demonstrators contained, however, and there were no 
reports of serious injury or damage. There were reports of some overturned 
trash cans and at least one window was smashed. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, chanting "Yusuf! Yusuf!" also rocked some passing cars. But as the 
evening wore on their numbers dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
"This city's going to be tense, but I hope there's not going to be any 
violence," said one black spectator in the crowd outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
In a televised appearance, New York Mayor David N. Dinkins urged that the city 
remain calm and said that "anyone bent on destroying the city" would be 
prosecuted to the maximum extent possible. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was greeted on Mondello's street in Bensonhurst with smiles, 
honking car horns and cries of support from friends who surged into the 
streets. People hugged and couples cried tears of relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we are bubbling over," said Jim League, 37, standing outside the 
Mondello home. "There is justice for all. I feel like singing." 
</P>
<P>
Mondello's defense was grounded in his claims that he was provoked into 
protecting himself after an ex-girlfriend said she was inviting 25 blacks and 
Latinos to her 18th birthday party on the night Hawkins was slain. The 
ex-girlfriend, Gina Feliciano, allegedly told Mondello that the blacks and 
Latinos were going to beat him up. 
</P>
<P>
In a tragic coincidence, Hawkins and three friends arrived in the predominantly 
Italian-American Bensonhurst neighborhood to answer a used-car advertisement on 
the same night as Feliciano's party. They were mistaken for Feliciano's friends 
and attacked by a gang of 30 to 40 whites carrying baseball bats and at least 
one gun. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing melee, Hawkins was shot and killed. His murder fueled heated 
racial passions in New York and sparked a series of black-led protests and 
demonstrations, including a clash with police at the Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Mondello's co-defendant in the case, 19-year-old Joseph Fama, was 
found guilty of second-degree murder, described as murder with depraved 
indifference to human life, by a separate panel. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Mondello verdict was read Friday, Hawkins' father, Moses Stewart, 
said the earlier verdict against Fama did not ease his pain. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't come to me with this foolish rhetoric from any politician or anybody 
else about 'we love and forgive everybody,' because everybody is not loving and 
forgiving us," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation had run high that Mondello, who allegedly recruited the members of 
the gang of whites who attacked Hawkins and three companions, might similarly 
be convicted of murder or, at least, of the lesser charge of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Among other documents submitted as evidence in the case was Mondello's signed 
confession saying that he had been at the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument, Assistant Dist. Atty. Paul Burns said Mondello 
organized the whites who stalked the black youths, encircled Hawkins and left 
him dying on the street after he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Does one of these guys stick around to help Yusuf Hawkins?" Burns asked. "No. 
They all run. Like a mob they came, like a mob they left. Group courage masking 
individual cowardice." 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Stephen Murphy maintained that Mondello and the other 
whites did not intend to hurt Hawkins. He said the gunman acted independently. 
</P>
<P>
Twice during its 11 days of deliberations, the jury told state Supreme Court 
Justice Thaddeus Owens that it had reached an impasse. But on both occasions 
Owens told them to keep trying to reach a unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
Mondello broke out in tears and squeezed his attorney's leg as the verdict was 
read. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy told reporters that his client was very happy with the verdict. But, 
Murphy added: "When one man is dead and another in jail for murder . . . you 
can't have winners. There's nothing to rejoice about. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had little to say after the verdict was announced. James Kohler, 
the chief prosecutor in the case, said he was concerned that the verdict might 
be misunderstood by the public, noting that "Keith Mondello was not acquitted 
of all crimes. . . . (He) was found guilty of several crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Mondello was convicted of one count of rioting, three counts of unlawful 
imprisonment, three counts of menacing, four counts of racial discrimination 
and one count of criminal possession of a weapon -- a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
The unlawful imprisonment charges carry the heaviest penalties: a maximum of 12 
years in prison. Maximum penalties for the other charges range from three 
months to four years in prison and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Bail was revoked and Mondello was taken to jail in Brooklyn to await sentencing 
on June 11. His attorneys said they were uncertain whether an appeal would be 
filed on the lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
Six other defendants are scheduled to go on trial next month. Two are charged 
with second-degree murder in the case.

GERMANYS SIGN TREATY TO MERGE; 
</P>
<P>
UNIFICATION: THE HISTORIC PACT TO COMBINE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND MONETARY SYSTEMS 
GOES INTO EFFECT JULY 2. STILL AT ISSUE IS THE NEW NATION'S MILITARY STATUS.

<P>
East and West Germany signed a historic treaty Friday outlining the terms for 
reunification, hailing it as "the birth of a free and united Germany" after 45 
years of bitter and bloody division. 
</P>
<P>
The pact merging the two countries' economic, social and monetary systems goes 
into effect July 2 after its expected ratification in coming weeks by the 
respective parliaments of the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
A date must then be set for an election to choose a common government that will 
complete the process of making Germany a single nation once more. 
</P>
<P>
With financing basically agreed upon, the toughest issue still looming is that 
of military status for the new Germany. The Soviet Union opposes membership in 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in favor of neutrality, and has frozen 
its unilateral withdrawal of troops from East Germany until the question is 
resolved to Moscow's satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's decidedly low-key ceremony in the West German capital came 190 days 
after the Berlin Wall fell on a joyous November night that changed the face of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty is the first cornerstone in forming a united Germany under Article 
23 of the West German constitution, which allows "other parts of Germany" to 
join the Federal Republic. Covering issues ranging from pensions and health 
insurance to computer sabotage, it amounts to both a marriage license and a 
death warrant for the two Germanys that emerged from the defeat of the Nazi 
state in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
It marks "the actual realization of German unity" and makes the process now 
"irreversible," said East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, who along 
with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl witnessed the treaty's signing by 
finance ministers from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, taking the podium first to address the 50 guests from both governments, 
at one point used the emotionally charged word, vaterland, or "fatherland," to 
describe a united Germany, and spoke of a "new epoch in European history." 
</P>
<P>
"What we are today witnessing is the hour of birth of a free and united 
Germany," he said. "Before the eyes of the world, representatives of the freely 
elected governments of both sides of Germany testify to their desire, as one 
people, as one nation, to place their future in one free and democratic 
country." 
</P>
<P>
He praised the East Germans for their courage to change, and declared that "the 
time has come to an end when people in the middle of Germany are tortured and 
killed in Stalinist camps, in jails and penitentiaries, or when they lose their 
lives trying to overcome walls and barbed wire." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl appeared elated but tired after a one-day trip to Washington, where he 
briefed President Bush on the progress of German unity. Bush issued an emphatic 
statement after the meeting, saying he and Kohl agreed that once Germany is 
united, it should be a member of NATO and that the jurisdictional rights of the 
four victorious World War II powers, such as their authority over Berlin, 
should be ended. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for adopting free-market principles and scrapping its Communist, 
centrally planned economy, East Germany will receive massive financial aid and 
expert help from West Germany, which enjoys a robust economy and a much higher 
standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcast live on both East and West German television, the 25-minute ceremony 
in the Palais Schaumburg did not trigger any wild celebration reminiscent of 
those seen Nov. 9, when the Wall was opened. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kohl and De Maiziere, in their prepared statements, instead sought to 
reassure a public that has grown increasingly anxious about the financial and 
social impact of German unification. 
</P>
<P>
Although opinion polls still show that a clear majority of West Germany's 
estimated 62 million people and East Germany's 16 million favor the merger, 
many worry about the massive inflation, unemployment and tax increase that may 
result from it. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been able to put a firm price tag on the cost of unification, but it 
is expected to run into hundreds of billions of dollars, since 40 years of 
Stalinist dictatorship have left East Germany's economy, environment and 
industry in virtual ruins. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before signing the treaty, Bonn set up a $70-billion German Unity Fund 
to help with the reconstruction of East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Communication, transportation, utility and health care systems are in dire need 
of modernization. People routinely had to wait a decade or more for a poorly 
manufactured car or telephone under the oppressive Communist regime ousted 
during a bloodless revolution last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Former Communist leader Erich Honecker and his top lieutenants have been 
charged with corruption and misuse of power, but no trials have been scheduled 
and prosecutors have indicated that the men may be too old or sickly to defend 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
When the new treaty goes into effect July 2, East German marks will be replaced 
with the powerful deutschemark at a rate of 1 to 1 for wages, pensions and 
small savings, with almost everything else netting one West mark for every two 
East marks. All monetary affairs will fall under the control of the West German 
central bank, the Bundesbank. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany promises under the treaty to sell off state-owned property to help 
cover the reunification costs, a concession that De Maiziere's government 
reportedly was reluctant to make out of concern that wealthy Westerners will 
snap everything up. 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin instead had hoped for an agreement permitting long-term leases in 
place of outright property sales, but Kohl has stressed the need to give 
private investors incentive to pour money into East Germany, and sees such 
private investment playing a key role in reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere noted that the treaty represents "a compromise," and admitted that 
it cannot fulfill all East German dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"But no one will be worse off than before," he promised. 
</P>
<P>
The East German prime minister drew a burst of hearty applause from the small 
audience, including a beaming Kohl, when he said: "Us and Them, This Side and 
That Side, Westies and Easties -- these and similar terms will soon vanish from 
the vernacular." 
</P>
<P>
Westies and Easties are the slang terms East and West Germans use for one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Side by side, the two leaders seemed to almost physically symbolize the 
difference between their two homelands, with the hulking Kohl dwarfing the 
diminutive De Maiziere. Kohl grinned broadly throughout much of the ceremony 
and applauded loudly afterward; De Maiziere smiled nervously and leafed through 
papers in his lap. 
</P>
<P>
On the wall behind the podium hung a priceless tapestry called "Two Ships in a 
Storm." One was safely approaching shore while the other was aflame in the 
middle of the tempest. 
</P>
<P>
Once West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel and his East German counterpart, 
Walter Romberg, signed the documents with fountain pens at a Chippendale desk, 
the group moved outside to clink champagne glasses on the sun-drenched terrace. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters, Kohl nodded toward the river rushing past below him. 
</P>
<P>
"There flows the Rhine," he said. "It streams along its way, seeking the sea. 
Naturally you can stem its flow or make it detour, and that would create much 
trouble on the river banks. 
</P>
<P>
"But the water reaches the sea," he concluded. "And that's also how it is with 
the current of German history."

STATE STUDY FINDS NO LINK OF CANCER TO FARM AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

McFARLAND, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state investigation into whether children in California's agricultural 
heartland are more likely than others to develop childhood cancers has found no 
evidence that the mysteriously high cancer rates in towns like McFarland, 
Earlimart and Rosamond afflict the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health Services study released here Friday found that the 
overall cancer rate among children under 15 in the southern San Joaquin Valley 
was no different from that reported in Los Angeles County, the San Francisco 
Bay Area and in other regions of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year study also found that children in the valley's urban areas had 
higher cancer rates than those in its rural, agricultural areas -- a finding 
that seems to challenge the widespread suspicion that the McFarland cancer 
cluster is related to agricultural chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the region as a whole, we don't see rates like McFarland," said Dr. 
Lynn R. Goldman of the state health department. The childhood cancer rate in 
the tiny farming town has been found to be three times as high as for a town 
its size. 
</P>
<P>
The new findings may offer some reassurance to residents of the region, some of 
whom have feared an epidemic of pesticide-induced cancers. In recent years, 
McFarland had become a symbol of public fears about pesticide use, and an 
assortment of celebrities, politicians and others flocked there to express 
those fears. 
</P>
<P>
But the absence of a region-wide pattern of high cancer rates underscores the 
difficulty of ever identifying the causes of specific clusters. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of an assessment can only go so far," said Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, 
director of the health department, at a public hearing Friday in McFarland. 
"It's just the nature of the tools. They may not be able to tell us the answer 
to the question that the community wants to know." 
</P>
<P>
Unusually high rates of childhood cancer have turned up over the past few years 
in McFarland, Rosamond and Earlimart. McFarland and Earlimart are farm towns in 
Kern County and Tulare County, respectively; Rosamond is a desert community in 
southern Kern County long popular with smelters and junkmen dumping industrial 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, after investigations of water, soil and household chemicals in 
McFarland failed to turn up any obvious local cause of the cancers, the state 
health department decided to study a broader, four-county region to see whether 
the problem might be endemic to the region. 
</P>
<P>
The department found 402 cases of childhood cancers diagnosed between 1980 and 
1988 in Fresno, Kern, Kings and Tulare counties. About one-third of those were 
leukemia cases. Nearly one-fifth were brain cancers. The others included 
kidney, soft-tissue, bone and eye cancers. 
</P>
<P>
The overall rate was 12 to 13 new cases per 100,000 children each year, 
according to the draft report released Friday, which is typical of rates in 
other regions of the country. According to Kern County figures, McFarland has a 
childhood cancer rate of 36.7 cases per 100,000, while in Rosamond the rate is 
72 per 100,000. In Earlimart, the state has said there is an "excess" of 
childhood cancers. 
</P>
<P>
The state found no significant differences between the rates among Anglos and 
Latinos, and no significant differences among the four counties. 
</P>
<P>
They did, however, find slightly higher cancer rates among children in the 
cities of Fresno and Bakersfield. They found slightly lower rates in rural 
areas not used for farming. State officials said the rates in rural 
agricultural areas were about average. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, the pediatrician and toxicologist who headed the study, said the 
higher urban rates are typical of the country at large. The reason for the 
urban-rural difference is not known; some researchers suspect environmental 
influences, while others wonder whether urban cases are simply more often 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials warned, however, that there are limitations to their 
study: They had no information on the children's exposure to possible 
carcinogens, nor did they know the parents' occupations, whether children had 
lived elsewhere before diagnosis and whether other children became ill after 
moving away.

OFAQIM, Israel 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raisa Friedman arrived in Ofaqim, a depressed textile town amid the wheat 
fields of Israel's Negev region, with a suitcase and hopes for a new life far 
from her Soviet home. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to Ofaqim are rare. More than a few people have moved on for lack of 
work. But even so, Friedman's arrival took the town by surprise. According to 
local officials, no one from the Absorption Ministry, which is in charge of 
dispersing the huge wave of Soviet immigrants to homes throughout Israel, had 
bothered to call ahead to tell them that Friedman was coming. 
</P>
<P>
So, when the energetic 69-year-old woman arrived, there was no one to greet her 
and no place to house her. She was shunted from City Hall to a local housing 
agency and back again before it was decided to put her up in a home for the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to stay in Tel Aviv," Friedman told a visitor in her temporary 
cubicle, "but the ministry said there was no room there. Then they sent me 
here. Plenty of room, but no house." 
</P>
<P>
The Friedman case has become a cause celebre in the Israeli press as complaints 
are aired that the government is not prepared to deal smoothly with the 
newcomers. A surplus of rental units is shrinking, raising the possibility that 
new arrivals will have to be put up in tent cities. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has been brought on by the quickening influx of immigrants. More 
than 10,000 arrived in April alone; more than 30,000 have immigrated so far 
this year. About 12,000 arrived in all of 1989. Last weekend, Israel's Treasury 
Ministry estimated that 150,000 Soviets will settle in Israel during 1990. But 
the government has made budget plans for only 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a prolonged political crisis is complicating efforts to 
arrange housing, training and jobs for the newcomers. Acting Cabinet ministers 
have been preoccupied with back-room meetings to organize a new governing 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Jewish Agency, which raises money to help immigrants, predict 
that within six months there will be no rental housing available and that 
temporary shelter will have to be found. The government says 10,000 units are 
under construction and that 5,000 will be started in June. 
</P>
<P>
In the coastal town of Netanya, immigrants protested in the streets last week 
because they had to stand in long lines for everything from welfare checks to 
advice on schooling. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, charge that a direct-deposit 
plan for immigrant subsidy checks has been tied up in the Absorption Ministry 
for months. The ministry and the Jewish Agency have yet to agree on which banks 
to use. 
</P>
<P>
The snags come to light at a time when the government is preparing to ask world 
Jewry to increase donations for settling Soviet Jews in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Ofaqim had hoped to benefit from the influx of Soviet immigrants. It is a town 
that was created to house new immigrants in the 1950s, when Israel was trying 
to develop urban centers in the south and north, away from the popular coastal 
strip. 
</P>
<P>
The textile industry has been a mainstay of Ofaqim's economy, but in recent 
years competition from East Asia, and the inefficiency of government-owned 
operations, has forced several factories in the area to close. The population 
is now about 14,000, and unemployment is about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
So, it caused some embarrassment when the first immigrant to arrive, Raisa 
Friedman, ran into difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in the '50s, the government was better organized," said Avi Bitan, a 
spokesman for the city government. "They sent this woman out here like an 
astronaut. It was a complete surprise." 
</P>
<P>
An Absorption Ministry spokesman said authorities in Ofaqim were notified but 
failed to act. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman seems nonplussed by the uproar she has caused, and a little pleased. 
</P>
<P>
A widow, she left the Soviet Union two months ago. Ethnic tension was growing 
in her hometown, Tashkent, directed not only against Jews but against any 
"foreigners" in the region, including Russians. 
</P>
<P>
"There were rumors that there would be trouble," she said. "I did not want to 
wait."

PRESIDENT SALINAS PUSHES A NOVEL -- AND, FOR HIM, POLITICALLY DANGEROUS -- 
CONCEPT.

<TEXT>
<P>
The treasury secretary beams with pleasure over the subject. Business leaders 
are fuming, and the press has dubbed it nothing less than "terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
The government of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari actually has 
decided to collect income taxes. Really, seriously, no kidding, to collect 
taxes -- and to jail people who do not pay them. 
</P>
<P>
It is a rather novel idea in Mexico, where most writers, artists, athletes, 
doctors, lawyers and countless other professionals used to live tax-free. And 
where, in 1989, 70% of all legally registered businesses declared no profits on 
which they might be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
No more, says Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe. He notes that in 68 years of 
Mexican government before the Salinas administration, only two people were ever 
tried and convicted for tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
"That was immoral, totally immoral," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, 48 people were convicted of tax evasion last year alone. "We don't 
have any quotas, but we are serious about this," Aspe said. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, the issue is not making Aspe a popular man. He has been dubbed 
the male, Mexican version of Britain's Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
"Business has become a risk, with the fear of being persecuted and going to 
jail," Eduardo Garcia Suarez, president of the Concanaco business group, 
complained to La Jornada newspaper earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
For those in business and for citizens who did pay their taxes, the new law 
passed by Congress last December is lowering the amount of income tax they pay 
from 55% in 1988 to 35% by next year. The theory is that more people will pay 
taxes at a "reasonable" rate, one that is on a par with the United States and 
other industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
The new law eliminated exemptions that allowed self-employed professionals to 
avoid taxes, and it closed loopholes for businesses. And it simplified tax 
returns to make payment easier. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if the carrots do not work, there is always the stick. 
</P>
<P>
Aspe hails the tax audit as if it were some sort of invention -- which it was 
for the 1.2% of taxpayers audited in 1988, 4% audited last year and the 
estimated 10% who are to be audited this year. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the audits could be used politically to harass the government's 
enemies. The tax inspectors, they say, are overzealous agents who earn a 
percentage on what they collect. 
</P>
<P>
The public grumbling over taxes stems not only from the fact that people are 
not used to coughing up the dough, but from an apparent lack of confidence that 
they will get anything for their money in the way of government services. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes, writes political commentator Lorenzo Meyer, should serve three purposes: 
to pay for the government machinery, promote economic development and 
redistribute wealth. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, Meyer writes, none of those purposes is served. 
</P>
<P>
"Taxes have never been an effective instrument of equality," he says, noting, 
too, that the gross national product fell 12% from 1980 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
As for the government machinery, he writes, "The procurement and imparting of 
justice is in as critical state as the police. Public education . . . is 
terrible." 
</P>
<P>
So, asks Meyer, where is the money going? 
</P>
<P>
His answer: In 1988, 46% of the government's budget went to pay the interest on 
the internal and foreign debt. Public works, in contrast, accounted for 10% of 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Tax collection is politically risky because it hits the middle classes, the 
very political base that Salinas is trying to develop. But despite the press 
criticism, he has managed so far to avoid the kinds of demonstrations and 
violence that other countries have suffered over tax issues. 
</P>
<P>
And some taxpayers even support the policy. 
</P>
<P>
The old law "led the way for tax evasion," said Gustavo Prado, a partner in 
Price Waterhouse Gonzalez Vilchis. "Large businesses were window-dressed to 
look like small businesses. That is where you hear the screaming from now." 
</P>
<P>
Nightclub entertainer Olga Breeskin, one of several high-profile entertainers 
targeted by the Treasury Ministry, has agreed to pay more than $350,000 in back 
taxes.

SANDAG BACKS BROWN FIELD AS AIRPORT SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two years of study, the San Diego Assn. of Governments' staff recommended 
Friday that local officials pursue international approval of a regional airport 
at Brown Field on Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The report seemed to make Otay Mesa the first choice for San Diego, which is 
running out of room at Lindbergh Field. According to Sandag, the military is 
unlikely to give up Miramar Naval Air Station, the premier choice for a 
civilian airport. 
</P>
<P>
The $385,000 study urged the creation of a new fact-finding commission "because 
almost nothing is known" about Mexico's or the United States' position on the 
proposed airport. The commission would once and for all "determine whether or 
not Otay Mesa is an institutionally workable alternative," according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe that (Sandag) spent a half million dollars to come up with a 
report that calls for creation of another study," said San Diego City 
Councilman Bob Filner, whose district encompasses Otay Mesa. "It's a total 
waste of the taxpayers' money." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, local planners adopted an airport planning report that called for 
Lindbergh Field to serve as the city's main airport until at least 1995. In 
1981, work began on locating a new airport that would carry passengers in and 
out of San Diego in the 21st Century. Subsequent studies have looked at several 
options, but most proposals have focused on Miramar and Brown Field. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Sandag, the proposed airport could be built on U.S. land, but 
would require an international agreement with Mexico to use that country's air 
space. If San Diego were to share the airport with Mexico, the agreement would 
have to cover access roads and the binational management of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed commission would determine if there were international support for 
the proposed airport and which bilateral organizations would handle airport 
planning. The commission would be appointed by the mayor of San Diego, the 
chairman of the County Board of Supervisors and the chairman of the San Diego 
Unified Port District board of commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Councilman Ron Roberts, who supports construction of a 
commercial airport on Otay Mesa, and Councilman Bob Filner, who opposes the 
move, disagreed on the long-awaited report's value. 
</P>
<P>
Filner has recommended that planners abandon Miramar and Otay Mesa, which would 
be difficult to develop, and consider a massive airport in the desert that 
would be linked by a high-speed train, or an airport that would be built upon a 
platform in the ocean off San Diego. Sandag used "20th Century answers . . . 
(in a search for) a 21st Century solution," Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who was out of town on Friday, said during a telephone interview that 
Sandag did "a reasonable job of sorting out the issues and advancing an action 
plan. . . . They said (an Otay Mesa) airport can be done physically. Now let's 
find out if the Mexican government is interested." 
</P>
<P>
Although the report did call for the formation of another committee, its 
authors urged fast action because "there is a real sense of urgency regarding 
the development potential and the status of development on Otay Mesa." 
</P>
<P>
Filner on Friday complained that further study amounts to "another moratorium 
on Otay Mesa . . . which has already gone through 1 1/2 years of a moratorium. 
You can't keep this up indefinitely." 
</P>
<P>
Developers already have submitted plans for almost half of the industrially 
zoned land near Brown Field, as well as 10,000 new dwelling units on 1,800 
acres near the former Navy airport. State and city planning officials have 
halted those developments until the future of Brown Field is decided. 
</P>
<P>
Filner complained that Sandag ignored the short-term question of what can be 
done to expand Lindbergh's capacity to handle more flights and passengers. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts described the report as a far-sighted attempt to solve the 
longstanding problem of where to build an airport that would be able to handle 
40 million passengers by the middle of the next century. 
</P>
<P>
"We've talked about this for years," Roberts said. "But what's been needed is 
for somebody in authority to make a formal request of the Mexican government." 
The report, if adopted by Sandag's board, would "resolve that issue," Roberts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag's full board will vote on the recommendation at its board meeting next 
Friday.

The city is moving its Fourth of July celebrations to July 3 because of higher 
overtime rates in a new contract with police officers. The switch will save 
about $16,000 in police salaries and $4,000 in pay to other city workers, the 
city's chief administrative officer said.

2 DEAD, 43 INJURED IN TOUR BUS CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BIG PINE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two German tourists were killed and 43 others injured Friday when a tour bus 
heading from Las Vegas to Mammoth Lakes careened off a desert highway in the 
Owens Valley, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The bus was westbound on Highway 168, about four miles east of Big Pine, when 
the driver lost control on a downgrade and went off the road, CHP Sgt. Ray 
Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers arrived to find injured victims waiting dazed along the road, 
witnesses said. The injured were taken to Northern Inyo Hospital in Bishop, 
about 14 miles north of Big Pine. 
</P>
<P>
The bus is operated by Southwest Charter Co. of Phoenix, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the nation's second-worst bus accident occurred on a mountain canyon 
highway about 100 miles north of Friday's accident. That crash, which killed 21 
and injured 22 others, many of them residents of a Santa Monica retirement 
home, occurred when a Starline Sightseeing Tours bus veered off U.S. 395 and 
into the West Walker River.

By Jerry Gillam, Times Staff WriterMeasure Would Keep State Offices Open for 
Lunch Hour 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State agencies would have to remain open to serve the public during the lunch 
hour under a bill (AB 3167) by Assemblyman Jackie Speier (D-South San 
Francisco) that swept through the lower house on a 67-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Speier charged that scores of state offices from San Diego to Crescent City now 
shut down at high noon Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Answering machines are activated, doors are locked and public service takes a 
break," she said. "But the lunch hour is often the only time when working men 
and women are able to do business with the state. AB 3167 will put public 
service back into the state lunch hour." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation now advances to the Senate.

</P>
<P>
Jailhouse Snitches: Rejected on a 20-19 vote a bill (AB 3344) by Assemblyman

Bigger is not necessarily better when it comes to frog jumping. A gang of giant 
African superfrogs leaped and lunged into the second day of the 62nd annual 
Calaveras County Fair and Jumping Frog Jubilee Friday without coming close to 
breaking the distance record set by an ordinary American bullfrog. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't break the record and, yes, I'm disappointed," said Seattle animal 
importer Andy Koffman, who claims the frogs can cover more than 30 feet in a 
single bound. But Koffman remains optimistic that his African frogs will stop 
flopping and start hopping in time for Sunday's championship. Representatives 
from the Guinness Book of World Records will be on hand in the tiny Gold Rush 
town to watch the green giants try to smash the fair's record, set in 1986 by 
Rosie the Ribiter, a born-in-the-U.S.A. bullfrog that jumped 21 feet, 5 3/4 
inches.

MAIN WILLIAMS CHALLENGER FACES UPHILL BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: ADVANTAGES OF INCUMBENCY MAKE IT TOUGH ON BLAIR, ONE OF STRONGEST 
OPPONENTS THE VETERAN SUPERVISOR HAS FACED, TO CATCH UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With more than two decades in elective office, San Diego County Supervisor Leon 
Williams is, his major campaign opponent concedes, "close to an institution" in 
local politics. 
</P>
<P>
"The man's been around for 20 years or more -- give him that," said Willie 
Blair, a former aide to San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor who left City Hall to 
challenge Williams in the June 5 supervisorial primary. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think of San Diego politics, it seems like he's just always been 
there. To some people, he is practically an institution. And institutions don't 
change often or willingly. But, when the time is right, changes can and do 
occur. I think this is one of those times." 
</P>
<P>
As the three-candidate campaign enters its final two weeks, however, relatively 
few see Blair as the political wrecking ball capable of razing an institution. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although Blair is arguably the most credible challenger Williams has 
faced since early in his career, the consensus within political circles is that 
Williams, a 67-year-old former San Diego city councilman, will be reelected to 
a third four-year term. The third candidate in the 4th Supervisorial District 
contest is former San Diego City Councilman Mike Schaefer, a frequent 
unsuccessful candidate since leaving City Hall in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect this election to be over in June," Williams predicted confidently. If 
no candidate receives the 50%-plus majority necessary for outright election in 
the primary, the top two vote-getters will compete in a November runoff in the 
4th District, which covers much of the central and southern parts of the city 
of San Diego, stretching from Loma Portal north to Linda Vista, south to Logan 
Heights and the National City boundary and east to Encanto and East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Unopposed in his 1986 race and an easy winner in 1982, Williams has mounted an 
active, if low-key, campaign that plays off the substantial assets he brought 
to it, including the name-recognition and fund-raising advantages attendant to 
incumbency, as well as an endorsement list laced with business, civic and 
political luminaries. 
</P>
<P>
Able to take credit for a wide range of county programs, Williams also has 
sought to sidestep blame for the county's growing financial, law enforcement 
and other woes, arguing that, whatever the current problems, they are less 
severe than those that existed when he was first elected supervisor in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the early '80s, the words county in chaos constantly appeared in 
headlines," said Williams, who served on the City Council from 1969 to 1982, 
representing a district that largely overlaps his current one. "We still have 
serious problems, but many of them aren't of our making." 
</P>
<P>
Problems such as jail crowding, inadequate court space, deteriorating 
infrastructure and program cutbacks, Williams contends, are attributable 
primarily to state funding inequities -- the subject of several county lawsuits 
against the state -- and a growth rate that has outpaced services and the 
county's available financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
"This board has been very pro-active, but there's only so much you can do, so 
long as the county isn't receiving its fair share of dollars from Sacramento," 
said Williams, the board's chairman, a largely ceremonial job rotated yearly 
among the supervisors. "We've cut and trimmed and done just about everything we 
can to spend the dollars we do have more effectively. The key to doing more is 
winning those lawsuits. Anyone who says there's a simpler answer or that 
there's still fat to trim just doesn't know what he's talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Blair and Schaefer, however, argue that Williams must share responsibility for 
the fact that San Diego ranks next to last among the state's 58 counties in 
terms of per-capita funding from Sacramento -- a disparity that costs the 
county tens of millions of dollars annually -- as well as for the county's 
other troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"Leon likes to blame Sacramento or say, 'It didn't happen on my watch,' but 
that's too easy," said Blair, a 38-year-old Encanto resident who served as 
Mayor O'Connor's community outreach director for four years before leaving in 
February to become quality control manager of the Police Tow Operators Assn. 
"The problem may be in Sacramento, but it's caused by politicians in San Diego 
not doing their jobs. The real problem is that this county -- and this 
supervisor -- aren't respected in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Schaefer says: "Leon's the chairman of the Board of Supervisors. If 
you can't point the finger there, where can you point it?" 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to transform Williams' longevity in office into a liability, both 
challengers consistently underline the same theme -- "It's time for a change" 
-- in their public appearances. In Blair's case, that message is tinged with 
subtle attempts to exploit the 29-year age difference between himself and 
Williams, as evidenced by the frequency with which both he and his campaign 
aides use phrases such as contrast in energy levels and 20 years in office is a 
long time to draw distinctions between the two. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very aware of what's new and current -- there's nothing like a 
generational gap here," Williams said in an interview. However, although he 
professed to be unconcerned about Blair's tactic, he took care to have an aide 
later call a reporter to emphasize that he jogs and bicycles regularly. 
</P>
<P>
As highlights of his record, Williams points to his role in creating the county 
Human Relations Commission and the Commission on Children and Youth, his 
authorship of a tough no-smoking ordinance in unincorporated areas, 
reinstatement of proposed state cutbacks in indigent medical care programs, his 
service on a countywide agency that installed emergency call boxes on freeways, 
his advocacy of growth-management policies and his emphasis on funding 
preventive programs aimed at crime, delinquency and illness. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done a good job, the board's done a good job, and that's why there's no 
major issue, nothing to debate," said Williams, a former county welfare worker 
and sheriff's assistant who lives in Golden Hill. "Some of these frivolous 
things being brought up by my opponents show that." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, an anonymous survey in a monthly political newsletter then 
published by one of Williams' former top aides ranked him last in overall 
effectiveness among the five supervisors. Although Williams' defenders 
vigorously dispute that politically embarrassing finding, some concede that his 
soft-spoken, understated style and unpolished speaking skills have minimized 
recognition of his accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"By nature, Leon is not very forceful or combative," said the Rev. George 
Walker Smith, a politically prominent black minister. "Personally, I wish he 
had a little more fire in him that he could turn up every now and then to let 
us know he's alive. In the absence of that, a lot of people think he hasn't 
done anything. But it doesn't always take a soapbox to get things accomplished. 
In his quiet way, I think Leon has done a good job championing the issues that 
need championing." 
</P>
<P>
But Blair, characterizing Williams as a "hands-off supervisor who throws out an 
idea and then hopes it will take care of the problem by itself," faults the 
incumbent for problems ranging from a rash of recent jail escapes and service 
cutbacks to what he views as flawed minority contractor hiring policies and 
ineffective lobbying in Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Blair -- conceding the obvious -- acknowledges that Williams' high 
public profile creates daunting obstacles for any opponent. Acknowledging that 
he may have trouble reaching his $50,000 campaign budget goal, Blair said he 
expects to be outspent by Williams by a more than 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people feel it's time for a change, but very few are willing to lead 
that charge," said Blair, a former Navy lieutenant and a Vietnam veteran. 
"People who regularly do business with the county don't want to cross someone 
they might have to still work with." 
</P>
<P>
One of the major policy distinctions between Williams and Blair involves the 
future of the county jails, an issue symptomatic of both the county's law 
enforcement and financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
While Williams has proposed establishment of a county corrections department, 
arguing that such a move would both cut costs and enhance jail security, Blair 
-- questioning both claims -- favors allowing the Sheriff's Department to 
retain control of the jails. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking a public record, Blair, like many challengers, usually offers answers 
long on generalities and short on specifics in attempting to explain why his 
performance would be superior to that of the incumbent. In one typical remark, 
Blair, asked why he believes he could attract significantly more state funding 
when persistent county efforts toward that end have failed, says simply that he 
would "work harder, longer and with more creativity to make sure we don't keep 
coming back empty-handed." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, meanwhile, argues that the long-range solution to the county's 
financial problems may lie in an initiative that would evenly allocate state 
tax revenues on a per-capita basis statewide, with local-state disputes settled 
by an impartial arbiter. 
</P>
<P>
Running on the slogan "You know him, he knows you," Schaefer, a 52-year-old 
lawyer, has had difficulty dispelling the notion that he is little more than a 
potential spoiler in the race who perhaps could siphon off enough votes to 
either affect the outcome or at least force a fall runoff. 
</P>
<P>
A council member from 1965 to 1971, Schaefer has since lost more than a dozen 
races here and in two other states, including contests for mayor, city 
attorney, district attorney, judge, state Senate, Congress, State Board of 
Equalization, secretary of state in Nevada and the U.S. Senate in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Frequent legal problems also have kept Schaefer's name in the headlines over 
the past two decades, starting in 1970, when the then-councilman was indicted 
and later acquitted on bribery and conspiracy charges in the city's Yellow Cab 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Schaefer was jailed for six days in Los Angeles on 
contempt-of-court charges for failing to clean up a dilapidated apartment 
building he owned. Four years ago, his Los Angeles tenants won a $1.8-million 
settlement stemming from his neglect of repairs -- a judgment that prompted 
Schaefer to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws while 
he appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Although he hopes to be taken seriously in the race, Schaefer's half-joking 
explanation of how he believes voters will react to those controversies appears 
to undercut his intent. 
</P>
<P>
"Jails are a big issue here, and I'm the only candidate with firsthand 
experience with incarceration," Schaefer says. "I'm also the only one with any 
knowledge of bankruptcy laws, which, given the county's financial shape, also 
could be a plus."

MEXICO HAD OKD DEAL FOR DOCTOR, U.S. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN and HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top Mexican law enforcement officials initially agreed to an "under the table" 
deal to smuggle a Guadalajara doctor into the U.S. so he could face charges in 
the 1985 torture-murder of drug agent Enrique Camarena, according to documents 
filed Friday by federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
The April 2 kidnaping of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain by bounty hunters, who 
delivered him the next day to Drug Enforcement Administration agents in El 
Paso, has been denounced repeatedly by Mexican officials and has strained 
relations between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
But the new documents, giving the first detailed U.S. government account of the 
incident, suggest that Mexican Atty. Gen. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo -- one 
of the vocal critics of U.S. actions -- may have been a party to an earlier 
agreement to swap the doctor for a Mexican bank embezzlement suspect hiding in 
the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
In negotiations late last year in Los Angeles, representatives of the Mexican 
Federal Judicial Police asked that "the arrangement be 'under the table' 
between the governments" so it would not "upset" Mexican citizens, according to 
a legal brief and series of affidavits filed in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The brief, submitted in opposition to Alvarez's motion to dismiss charges 
against him, reports that the doctor actually was detained in Mexico, but the 
swap fell through when DEA officials refused to pay $50,000 in advance to the 
federales who promised to bring him to the U.S. Later, prosecutors state, 
informants advised the DEA that the doctor "had paid a bribe" to the federales 
and was released. 
</P>
<P>
Only after learning that Alvarez was free did a Los Angeles-based DEA 
operative, Antonio Garate Bustamante, arrange the successful abduction through 
contacts in Mexico, according to the documents. Garate, a former Mexican 
policeman who admitted working for drug traffickers at one point, was promised 
"a $50,000 reward" plus expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But Alvarez's lawyer, Robert K. Steinberg, dismissed as "an insult to the 
intelligence" the prosecution's claim that Mexico was going to cooperate in 
getting his client across the border. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney said he was "delighted," however, that the documents 
acknowledge that Garate arranged the abduction in close consultation with DEA 
agent Hector Berrellez, who heads the Los Angeles-based task force 
investigating Camarena's murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that Berrellez admits a reward," the defense attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
The DEA has long sought Alvarez, a gynecologist who allegedly revived Camarena 
during the torture sessions that led to his death so the agent could be 
questioned further about his knowledge of drug trafficking and official 
corruption in Mexico. But the Mexican government refuses to extradite its 
citizens for trial in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The outcry over the abduction began soon after the doctor was snatched from his 
office and flown to El Paso. One Mexican official called it "a sort of 
invasion" by the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
On May 2, U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh met privately in Santa Fe with his 
Mexican counterpart to explain the U.S. government's version of the incident. 
It was "not a cordial session," one source said, and afterward Alvarez del 
Castillo pledged to continue to prosecute those responsible for "the 
deprivation of liberty and kidnaping." 
</P>
<P>
The documents filed Friday maintain that discussions with Mexican officials 
concerning the doctor began last year after Garate started helping the DEA 
pursue additional leads in the Camarena killing, for which nine men already had 
been indicted by a Los Angeles grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
"In December, 1989, Garate was contacted telephonically by (Mexican judicial 
police) commandante Jorge Castillo del Rey, who sought to meet with Garate and 
representatives of the DEA in Los Angeles," the legal brief says. 
</P>
<P>
At the Dec. 13 meeting, the account continues, "Castillo del Rey advised that 
he was present in the United States with the full knowledge and authority of 
the attorney general of Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials were willing to give up Alvarez in order to get their hands 
on the banker believed hiding in California "because he was alleged to have 
stolen approximately $500 million from various politicians in Mexico," the 
brief states. 
</P>
<P>
The DEA reportedly agreed to find the Mexican fugitive and deport him as an 
illegal alien. 
</P>
<P>
Garate later continued negotiations by phone with Javier Orosco-Orosco, the 
chief of the judicial police fugitive detail in Mexico City. But he demanded 
"$50,000 in advance for an airplane and other expenses to transport 
Alvarez-Machain to the United States," according to the prosecution account. 
</P>
<P>
Four other Camarena defendants are on trial in federal court. Trial for Alvarez 
has been delayed by the defense motion to dismiss charges on the grounds of 
"outrageous government conduct."

SILBERMAN'S WORDS TURNED AGAINST HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego financier Richard T. Silberman embarked upon a deal to launder cash 
knowing full well that it had been portrayed as the profits of Colombian 
cocaine trafficking, federal prosecutors sought to prove Friday through dozens 
of secretly recorded tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Using his own words against him, prosecutors played dozens of the tapes on 
which Silberman is heard cryptically negotiating the first of two deals that 
are central to the case against him. Repeatedly, Silberman pleaded with the key 
FBI undercover agent in the case for even more business, according to the 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
The agent, Peter Ahearn, who posed as the representative of Colombian drug 
lords, testified, however, that, for all the essential tapes in the case, there 
is no tape of the first meeting at which that first deal was discussed. Ahearn 
said that a hidden recorder he wore to the meeting didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., 
sat impassively throughout a full day of the tapes and explanatory testimony by 
Ahearn. He showed no emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, is standing trial on seven counts stemming from allegations that 
he laundered $300,000 characterized by Ahearn -- who pretended to be Pete 
Carmassi, an agent of Colombian drug traffickers -- as narcotics profits. He 
was arrested in April, 1989, in a Mission Bay hotel room, purportedly while 
negotiating another deal. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Silberman could be sentenced to a maximum of 75 years in prison. 
Four other men were also indicted in the alleged money-laundering scheme. Two 
of the four have pleaded guilty over the past month, each to a single count, 
and one of those two, Jack Norman Myers, 44, a Malibu investment banker, is 
expected to testify against Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
The other two, reputed mobster Chris Petti, 63, of San Diego, and Darryl 
Nakatsuka, 43, of Los Angeles are scheduled to stand trial July 17. Petti 
attended as a spectator during most of Friday's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
In 31 audiotapes and one lengthy videotape backed up by comments from Ahearn, 
prosecutors began Friday, the first full day of testimony, to make their case 
against Silberman. Defense attorney James J. Brosnahan will get his chance at 
cross-examination after Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. is done with 
each witness. 
</P>
<P>
The first deal, according to Gorder, involved a swap of $100,000 for stock in a 
Silberman gold mining subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
It was first discussed at a Nov. 9, 1988, lunch meeting at the Stardust Hotel 
coffee shop in Mission Valley, where Petti introduced Silberman to Ahearn. Also 
in attendance at the meeting was government informer Robert Benjamin, who had 
introduced Ahearn to Petti. 
</P>
<P>
Ahearn testified that, though Silberman was interested in a $500,000 deal, his 
bosses insisted on a test run of $100,000. "At that time I specifically laid 
out the fact that the cash was from Colombian cocaine dealers," Ahearn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Petti broke in and told Dick it was the right thing to do," Ahearn said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Ahearn hid a tape recorder in a sock on his left ankle, he found when 
the meeting was over that the switch had gotten stuck at some point in the off 
position. The upshot, he said, was that the meeting produced no usable tape. 
</P>
<P>
At various times through the first deal, Ahearn testified, he reminded 
Silberman for whom he supposedly worked. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 12, Ahearn said in a call from a pay phone along a New Jersey highway 
that "all they know is, is, you know, all they know is the coke." On Nov. 23, 
according to a transcript of another call, it was "these Colombians they, they 
understand and they're trusting me with the money and that's not a problem, 
OK?" 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 2, Ahearn told Silberman in a phone call it's "something they go 
through with uh, the uh, the drug types, and that's the way it goes." According 
to a transcript of the call, Silberman said, "Let's . . . let's not even uh, 
use any of the words anymore, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
A few days before, on Nov. 30, Nakatsuka had swung the deal into motion by 
picking up $100,000 in cash from Ahearn at a Los Angeles hotel room. 
Prosecutors charge that Nakatsuka was acting at Silberman's direction. 
</P>
<P>
It was too risky to appear himself, Silberman told Ahearn in a phone call 
earlier in the day. "I mean, uh, you know, up and down this state I am so . . . 
visible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In that call, Silberman let Ahearn in on a code for the pickup. The couriers 
had been instructed to say they were "Baja." Ahearn, Silberman said, was to be 
"Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
In the same call, Silberman told Ahearn: "But, uh, you, you and I are in 
agreement that, uh, that basically what I, what I tell everybody is that, 
these, this money is coming from people who are in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "That's where all my stuff comes from. That's, you get it?" 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents secretly videotaped the scene in the hotel room when, that night, 
Nakatsuka picked up the cash. Long segments of the 25-minute tape -- about 
three minutes at one point -- are taken up with nothing but the sounds of 
shuffling bills and a picture of Nakatsuka, bent over a table in coat and tie, 
counting the money. 
</P>
<P>
Ahearn said he put the cash -- in $100 bills -- in a shoe box and wrapped it 
with a ribbon and bow, to make it look like a holiday gift. When Nakatsuka was 
done, the courier put the shoe box in a hotel laundry bag and took off, Ahearn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, through an another undercover FBI agent, Ahearn received a 
certificate saying he owned stock in Silberman's gold mining company. 
</P>
<P>
As for the money, it was broken into smaller sums and wired to Hong Kong, to a 
bank account controlled by Silberman, prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
The second of the two deals in the case involves a swap of $200,000 for U.S. 
Treasury bonds. Ahearn is expected to discuss that deal when testimony resumes 
Tuesday.

HOUSE ARREST; 
</P>
<P>
DREAM HOME THAT BECAME A NIGHTMARE MUST LOSE ITS TOP

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For more than two years, the unfinished house has created an air of mystery 
along suburban La Costa Avenue in Carlsbad, its sun-bleached frame looking like 
the weathered hull of a silent old ship run aground. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of a building boom that has seen an endless tide of new 
custom-built homes in this North County community, Denis Hobson's troubled 
little project has become an object of curiosity among locals and tourists 
alike -- slowing traffic on the busy street, sometimes even breaking the 
concentration of golfers at the adjacent La Costa resort. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to know what's going on with that house," said the 62-year-old 
Hobson in a sprightly British accent. "For some people, it's like a mystery 
that nags at them -- they just want to know why the blasted thing has sat there 
unfinished for so long. 
</P>
<P>
"We get letters and telephone calls from other people who think I'm in some 
sort of financial trouble and want to buy the place for a steal. Whatever the 
reason, people keep asking." 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, the hammers, drills and saws were silenced when a couple who 
lived next door claimed that the budding frame was blocking their high-priced 
view of Batiquitos Lagoon and the ocean beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a local architectural committee claimed that Hobson had varied from 
his construction plans, building a larger three-car garage and adding a story 
to the 3,500-square-foot project. 
</P>
<P>
The committee eventually obtained a court order to halt all building at the 
site, about 4 miles east of Interstate 5 until Hobson settled the matter in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, after losing thousands of dollars as the project sat idle, Hobson 
and his wife, Dorothy, learned they had lost the legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they say, without funds to wage an appeal, they must pay more than $65,000 
in attorney's fees for all parties in the case, plus $35,000 for a job the 
veteran North County home builder finds the most distasteful of all: 
</P>
<P>
This month, Hobson will begin dismantling the top part of the home -- being 
built for him and his wife -- to meet the architectural committee's standards 
and keep from blocking his neighbors' view. 
</P>
<P>
"They're making me take apart my own house piece by piece," said Hobson, whose 
Denbar Construction company has built more than 60 homes in the La Costa area 
in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could come up with money to appeal, I know I'd eventually win. But how 
long could I afford to go on? You'd think that, once you've gotten the city's 
blessing on a project, you'd be in the clear. I sure learned my lesson on that 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Hobson insists that his construction blueprints met city codes and even had the 
approval of the La Costa area's architectural committee, until the local group 
suddenly changed its mind at the neighbors' bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Mata, chief building inspector for the city of Carlsbad, agreed that the 
house met city codes, but said the architectural committee apparently had a 
legal right to set additional limits. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was OK as far as we were concerned," he said. "Unfortunately for 
Mr. Hobson, he was building next door to an eccentric guy who didn't like what 
he saw. And I guess he had every right to get a lawyer and go to court to stop 
it. The judge apparently agreed the builder was in the wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Mata said it is rare, however, for construction of a home to be halted in such 
advanced stages while disputes are settled in court. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Besecker, a member of the La Costa architectural committee, a board that 
enforces a code of loosely formed building restrictions in some areas of La 
Costa, said Hobson's unfinished house has elicited numerous calls from curious 
passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
"When we told them what was going on, many said, 'Gosh, that place certainly is 
an eyesore.' Some just shook their heads. The whole thing is regrettable," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Besecker said the committee has since begun disbanding and will leave future 
code enforcement to neighborhood groups. 
</P>
<P>
Waldemar and Caryl Brehm, who live next to the weathered wooden shell, are 
relieved that the board was around long enough to help halt what they call "a 
disastrous piece of construction work." 
</P>
<P>
"In New York, they've made builders lop off the top five or six floors of 
skyscrapers because of view and height problems," said Waldemar Brehm, an 
Encinitas orthodontist. "Actually, we were hoping they'd bulldoze the whole 
place down." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nerves have been rubbed nearly raw among the two neighbors in the 
area. The Hobsons, who have been living in another house several doors away, 
say they refuse to speak to the Brehms. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, there's no mystery here at all," said Caryl Brehm. "People always 
stopped to ask about the house and who was building it. We just told them it 
was the project of a maverick builder who thought he could get away with 
anything he pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"But we wouldn't let him. Frankly, we have no animosity toward the man. He just 
did a stupid thing." 
</P>
<P>
When the Hobsons finally move into their completed house, how will they get 
along with their new neighbors? 
</P>
<P>
"We may live next to them, but we'll never be neighbors," Dorothy Hobson said. 
"We just won't see them -- even if we see them. Know what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
And, although the mystery of La Costa Avenue's seemingly abandoned house will 
soon be solved, Denis Hobson says he's working hard to maintain his sense of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to laugh at all the questions that house has inspired," he said. 
"Once, while I was down at the golf course, following the Tournament of 
Champions there, the family of one of the leaders looks up at the house with 
his mouth open. 
</P>
<P>
" 'That house has been there like that for the last three tournaments. The poor 
guy must have run out of cash,' he said. I spoke up and said, 'That poor guy is 
me.' 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody laughed -- including me."

MYSTERY HOUSE: Since 1988, the shell of the unfinished house has signaled 
something of a suburban mystery in the hills of La Costa. Because of a view 
dispute, Dennis Hobson, above, couldn't touch his housing project for more than 
two years. After losing the resulting legal battle, an angry Hobson must now 
dismantle part of his house at his own cost. One thing's for sure -- now that 
the mystery is over, the neighborhood will never be the same.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL DISTRICT'S LEGAL FEES PUT AT $2 
MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The financially strapped Compton school district has spent nearly $2 million in 
legal fees the last four years, at least double what most other Los Angeles 
County districts spend, according to a report prepared this week by the 
district's financial staff. 
</P>
<P>
The district's Board of Trustees, facing a budget shortfall of at least $7 
million in the next school year, ordered the report. One law firm, Melanie E. 
Lomax and Associates of Los Angeles, received almost half the money the 
district spent on legal expenses, according to the report. She said the 
district was involved in a large number of lawsuits and has several 
construction projects under way that required legal work on contracts.

<P>
A 17-year-old boy was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life for killing another 
teen-ager in a drive-by shooting last year. 
</P>
<P>
DeShawn Stallsworth, who was 16 when he shot and killed Armando Bracamontes, 
16, in the head, was tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez recommended that Stallsworth begin serving 
his term with the California Youth Authority and be transferred to an adult 
prison when he turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gloria Michaels called the Aug. 8, 1989, murder on Wunderlin 
Avenue "an incredible, senseless and stupid killing." 
</P>
<P>
Michaels said Stallsworth had planned to rob a nearby house, but the occupants 
weren't home. He then saw a group of young people nearby, who included 
Bracamontes, staring at him. 
</P>
<P>
"They just looked at the defendant wrong," said the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Stallsworth shot repeatedly into the crowd, also wounding David Sanchez, 21, in 
the leg, said Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
Another teen-ager with Stallsworth during the shooting went on trial in 
February, but was acquitted by a jury.

<P>
A transient who stabbed a woman to death in front of her young daughters and 
killed a Hillcrest man 10 days earlier was sentenced Friday to 52 years to life 
in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Jon Kemp, 27, received the consecutive terms for the Nov. 28, 1988, 
murder of Gerilee (Jane) Bertrand, 34, and the Nov. 18, 1988, stabbing of 
Chester (Earl) Grandison, 38. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his jury trial last week, Kemp pleaded guilty to two counts of 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office had filed special circumstances allegations and 
was planning to seek the death penalty had Kemp been convicted of multiple 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Madruga said the pleas were accepted because 
Bertrand's daughters were frightened about testifying in court and reliving the 
trauma of witnessing their mother die. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by Superior Court Judge J. Richard Haden if he wished to speak, Kemp 
said: "I have nothing to say." 
</P>
<P>
At the sentencing was Bertrand's mother, who also was present when she was 
stabbed, and the two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Bertrand was stabbed after she and Kemp, who had been living with her in 
National City, argued over a radio. She told him she had called the police 
because of the disturbance he was causing, and he took out a knife and stabbed 
her in the heart. 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest, police discovered the key to Grandison's apartment complex 
gate in Kemp's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Grandison was stabbed 18 times and his nude body was found by his roommate. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp's bare footprints were also found in Grandison's bathroom.

<P>
Two thieves escaped with a total of $2,843 in separate bank robberies Friday, 
San Diego police reported. 
</P>
<P>
At about 12:20 p.m. a man entered Security Pacific Bank, in the 1200 block of 
3rd Avenue, and handed the teller a note that read, "This is a robbery, I want 
all your money," adding that he had a gun, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
He escaped with $1,393. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson described the thief as white, in his 40s, 5-foot-6, 150 pounds, with a 
light complexion. He was wearing a white baseball cap, white shirt, beige baggy 
pants and dark sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour later, an Imperial Savings branch, in the 2300 block of 5th 
Avenue, was robbed of $1,450, Robinson said. A man walked into the bank, leaned 
toward a teller and whispered, "This is a robbery, don't mess around, give me 
all your $50s and $100s," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The thief was described as black, in his early 30s, 5-foot-10, 200 pounds with 
a muscular build, mustache and short hair. He was wearing a light blue polo 
shirt, blue jeans and sun glasses.

DESERT LEOPARD COLONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike many other Russian immigrants to Southern California, the one who 
arrived in the Antelope Valley this week had to be hauled to America, growling 
and spitting in anger. 
</P>
<P>
The new resident is a rare Russian Amur leopard, a 14-month-old male who 
traveled from the Helsinki Zoo, where he was born, to the Exotic Feline 
Breeding Compound near Rosamond, a Kern County town west of Edwards Air Force 
Base. 
</P>
<P>
Since his arrival Thursday, the leopard, named Gigant, has been sulking in his 
quarters, trying to remain out of sight inside a small shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now he's pretty spooked," said Joseph Maynard, owner of the nonprofit, 
private zoo that has specialized in breeding big cats from zoos around the 
country for the past 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
The rare leopard's handlers predicted Friday that the trauma of the move will 
wear off. In about a year, a female leopard from the Rotterdam Zoo will join 
Gigant for breeding, part of a concerted effort to increase the population of 
Amur leopards worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists class the Amur leopard as a threatened subspecies, with only about 
80 of the animals in captivity and fewer than 100 in the wild, Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been established that the subspecies is in serious danger," he said. 
"We'd like to get a total of 250 reproductively viable animals in captivity 
worldwide by swapping them back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
Most wild Amur leopards live in a game reserve in the mountainous Amur River 
region near the Soviet-Manchurian border, Maynard said. Their numbers have been 
reduced by poaching and deforestation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gigant now weighs about 80 pounds. He will grow to about 160 pounds and seven 
feet in length. Three feet of that span consist of a long tail that aids the 
Amur leopard's balance in tree-top forays after prey. The subspecies is also 
known for its light yellow, very furry coat with black spots, Maynard said. The 
Amur leopard has a life span of 16 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley's desert climate and summer and winter temperature swings 
should not be a problem for the leopard because it is adaptable, experiencing 
both heat and cold in its native habitat, Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the high desert," he said. "If it were the southern deserts, now, the 
temperature would be a little extreme for them. . . . We don't foresee any 
problem, based on our experience with similar animals." 
</P>
<P>
The compound, which has been praised for its work by zoo officials around the 
country, is in the process of expanding the size of its animal habitats, 
Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
It has experienced occasional run-ins with state regulators over permit 
disputes and some cages that were deemed too small. 
</P>
<P>
The current population of about 40 animals encompasses 11 species, including 
tigers, bobcats, golden cats and leopards, Maynard said.

Five charges involving three additional victims were filed Friday against an 
Immigration and Naturalization Service agent who earlier this week was charged 
with abducting and raping an illegal immigrant after threatening to deport her. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office charged James Edward Riley 
with one count of rape, two counts of kidnaping and one count each of false 
imprisonment and assault by a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old agent pleaded not guilty to the charges before Van Nuys 
Municipal Court Commissioner Rebecca Omens-Rochman on Friday. At the request of 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard F. Walmark, the commissioner ordered Riley held 
without bail pending a May 25 preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Riley already faces one count each of kidnap, rape and rape under color of law, 
meaning he used his position as a federal agent to commit the crime, for 
allegedly attacking a 24-year-old Sepulveda woman on April 11. He pleaded not 
guilty to those charges on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Riley was arrested at 4:30 a.m. May 12 at his Reseda apartment after a 
monthlong investigation that began after the woman reported to police that he 
had abducted and raped her in his Reseda apartment. The woman said she was then 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The new charges stem from assaults dating to September, police say. In each 
case, Riley allegedly approached a Latina on the street while he was off-duty 
but driving his federal car. Police said that Riley, who is bilingual, showed 
his INS badge and placed the woman under arrest after determining that she had 
no green card or legal status for being in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The first attack allegedly occurred on Sept. 15. Riley is accused of kidnaping 
a 31-year-old woman from a Pacoima street and raping her in his car, Walmark 
said. The link to Riley came to light as police went through reports looking 
for similar crimes, said James A. Baker, chief filing deputy in the Van Nuys 
branch of the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The other two victims were traced from clues found in Riley's apartment, Baker 
said. The women were contacted by police and implicated Riley in the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The charges of false imprisonment and assault by a police officer stem from a 
Jan. 9 incident in which Riley allegedly grabbed a 19-year-old woman in 
Pacoima. The woman reported that Riley told her: "I want a date or you'll be 
deported," Baker said. The woman slapped the man's face and fled, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Another victim, a 20-year-old woman, told authorities that Riley grabbed her on 
a Van Nuys street corner in February, told her she was under arrest and 
handcuffed her. He drove her around in his car for several hours before 
releasing her without having assaulted her, Baker said. The incident resulted 
in a kidnaping charge against Riley. 
</P>
<P>
During the attacks, Riley variously identified himself as an INS agent, a 
customs agent or an undercover police officer, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, an INS agent since November, 1987, was assigned to the INS Employee 
Sanctions Unit, which primarily audits records of companies to make sure they 
are not employing illegal aliens, police said. 
</P>
<P>
It was "not within his job description to stop and question persons on the 
street," Baker added. 
</P>
<P>
Riley is on leave while federal authorities investigate him. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was prompted April 12 when the Sepulveda woman made a rape 
report several hours after she said the suspect had freed her. She has been the 
only victim to voluntarily come forward to authorities and at times during the 
investigation was reluctant to fully cooperate because of fear she would be 
deported. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Friday described the latest charges as the result of only the "first 
wave" of the investigation. Detectives were looking for other victims and 
looking through property seized from Riley for clues to identifying possible 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of names and phone numbers to try to follow up on," Lt. Dennis 
Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Police expressed frustration in attempting to locate and deal with victims 
because it is believed that Riley preyed only on Latinas who were illegally in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that women who come forward will not be turned over to immigration 
authorities even if they are in this country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because you are not a citizen doesn't mean you can't be a victim," 
Detective Mel Arnold said. "We are not concerned with anybody's resident 
status. We are only concerned with whether somebody has been a victim of this 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that pledge, detectives suspect that fear of authorities, including 
possible belief that the announcement is a trap, has kept some possible victims 
from contacting police.

Five charges ranging from kidnaping to rape were filed Friday against an 
Immigration and Naturalization Service agent who earlier this week was charged 
with abducting and raping an illegal immigrant after threatening to deport her. 
</P>
<P>
The new charges involved three additional alleged victims who are also believed 
to have been assaulted or kidnaped by INS Agent James Edward Riley.

SIX ESCAPE FROM JUVENILE HALL AFTER CAR SMASHES LOCKED GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six teen-agers, all accused of violent crimes, escaped from the Los Angeles 
County Central Juvenile Hall Friday morning after a stolen car rammed a locked 
emergency fire gate, creating an opening. 
</P>
<P>
The youths then ran through the opening and leaped into a second vehicle, which 
sped away. 
</P>
<P>
They abandoned the first car. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the escaped youths were being held on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Five of them lived together in the same unit," said Michael Brown, assistant 
superintendent of the facility on Eastlake Avenue in Lincoln Heights. "It's 
obvious this is something that was planned." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said another youth escaped from the complex about six weeks ago by 
climbing through a vent. But he said the gate-ramming was the first time such a 
dramatic breakout had occurred there. 
</P>
<P>
None of the youths or the drivers of the two cars had been captured by Friday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 9:30 a.m. near the facility's school, Brown said. 
Three of the youths were outside taking part in a physical education class and 
the other three ran from nearby classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The four youths who are accused of murder are Joseph Van Matthews, 17; Alvino 
Martinez, 18; Hugo Stewart Roman, 18, and a 17-year-old who was not named 
because of his age. Van Matthews faced prosecution as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Javier Camacho, 18, is accused of kidnapping and rape. 
</P>
<P>
Another 17-year-old, who also was not named, had been arrested after being 
released from the California Youth Authority, where he had been serving a 
sentence for assault with a deadly weapon.

MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO BLINDING WOMAN WITH ACID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hacienda Heights man pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of throwing 
corrosive acid in the face of a Glendale woman last July, blinding and 
disfiguring her. 
</P>
<P>
Emad Fawzi Kalta, 20, was arraigned in Glendale Municipal Court on charges of 
aggravated mayhem, mayhem resulting in great bodily injury and assault with a 
caustic chemical. He is being held without bail in Los Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Kalta could be sentenced to life in prison without possibility of 
parole, said Deputy Dist. Atty. David Dahle. A preliminary hearing was 
scheduled for May 31. 
</P>
<P>
Kalta was arrested by Glendale police Thursday in Hacienda Heights. Authorities 
declined to say how long they have considered Kalta a suspect or why it took so 
long to make an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Dahle said he is not sure of the motive in the attack but said it may have been 
an act of vengeance triggered by a dispute between members of the victim's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police report, Kalta approached Shushan Eloyan, 23, from behind 
as she walked down a sidewalk in the 100 block of Adams Street in Glendale and 
asked her for the time. In front of other pedestrians on the sidewalk, he threw 
a jar of acid in her face as she turned toward him, the police report said. Her 
eyes remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, Eloyan said she recognized her assailant as a friend of 
her stepbrother. However, she said she did not know his name. She said family 
relations have been strained since her mother and stepfather were divorced in 
1988. A restraining order prohibiting the stepfather from contacting or 
visiting Eloyan or her mother was issued in Burbank Superior Court last May. 
</P>
<P>
Dahle, who filed the charges Wednesday, said police were investigating whether 
others, including Eloyan's family members, may have been involved in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"We suspect there's a link," Dahle said. "There's got to be a reason for this 
kind of attack. It's usually an act of vengeance." Eloyan, a refugee from 
Soviet Armenia who was attending Glendale Community College at the time of the 
attack, has since undergone several skin-graft operations and will have eye 
surgery in June in the hope of regaining some sight, she said.

LAW PROFESSOR KEITH W. BLINN IS DEAD AT 72 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith W. Blinn, a law professor and former general counsel and senior vice 
president of the Continental Oil Co., died Tuesday of coronary and vascular 
disease after open-heart surgery at the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
Blinn, who was a law professor at the University of California at Irvine at the 
time of his death, divided his time between Irvine and Coronado, where he was 
on the board of directors of the Coronado Shores Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Hutchinson, Kan., Blinn attended University of Kansas and Washington 
and Lee University. He was a graduate of the Marquette University Law School 
and received a doctorate from Yale Law School. 
</P>
<P>
He began working for Continental Oil in New York and Stamford, Conn., in the 
1950s and later became a director of the company. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970's, he retired from Continental and moved to Houston, where he 
taught law at the University of Houston. He also taught at the Universities of 
Washington, North Dakota, Idaho and at the California Western School of Law in 
San Diego. He had homes in Coronado and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
In his career, Blinn was also counsel to the National Labor Relations Board and 
Tennessee Valley Authority, and was a consultant to the World Bank as well as 
other national and international business organizations. 
</P>
<P>
He was also a published author whose most recent book, "Legal and Ethical 
Concepts in Engineering," was used as a textbook in engineering and law 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Blinn is survived by his wife, Ellen; two sons who are lawyers, John of Ft. 
Worth, Tex. and David of Orange Count; a sister, Virginia Miller of Hutchinson, 
Kan., and four grandchildren.

MONEY: THE ART OF THE MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First the facts and, then, the two inevitable questions: This week the two most 
expensive paintings in history -- Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" 
and Pierre Auguste Renoir's "At the Moulin de la Galette" -- were sold at 
auction for $82.5 million and $78.1 million respectively to Japanese paper and 
real estate magnate Ryoei Saito. The Renoir, considered by some the finest 
painting the artist ever made, has been in American hands since 1929. The Van 
Gogh, though privately owned, has hung in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
So, now to the first of the questions: Are those paintings really worth all 
that? After all, works by Paul Cezanne, a painter of greater art historical 
significance than Van Gogh, currently are valued at much less. Well, yes, but . 
. . As the critic Robert Hughes has observed, when art becomes a commodity -- 
which it unfortunately is when it hits the auction block -- it is one whose 
only index of value is the desire of individuals to own it. A particular desire 
raised to the level of fetish, which is a fairly accurate description of the 
Japanese fixation on Van Gogh and, to a somewhat lesser extent, on the 
Impressionists, is powerful indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Saito obviously was aflame with such desire. As he told Japanese reporters 
in Tokyo Friday, "I borrowed the money from the bank, and I will continue to do 
it to buy good art when it becomes available." 
</P>
<P>
Others among his cash-rich countrymen obviously share his obsession. In fact, 
last year, Japan imported $1.87 billion worth of art. That's a lot, even at 
today's prices. 
</P>
<P>
And so now to the other question: Are more of the masterpieces currently 
hanging in the United States likely to make their way to Japan? Yes, but that 
affirmative answer is alarming only if America persists in its neglect of its 
artistic patrimony. Just as brash, culturally ambitious Americans once scoured 
Europe for paintings and sculpture to carry home, so prosperous Japanese are 
doing much the same here now. In fairness, it has been a two-way trade. One of 
the finest collections of Japanese painting in the world currently occupies its 
own wing in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
What has changed is the American tax code, and our great public museums are 
losers because of it. Formerly paintings such as those sold this week might 
well have been donated to public collections by owners able to deduct their 
market value from their tax liability. Today, such donors only can deduct the 
amount they paid for the work. That virtually guarantees that such collectors 
will send their art to the auction block rather than to our museums. Restoring 
the full deduction would be the best sort of investment -- one that will pay 
rich dividends for generations to come.

<P>
OVERVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Democratic primary race in state Senate District 22 pits political newcomer 
William Graysen, the lawyer who defended Zsa Zsa Gabor, against longtime 
Westside lawmaker Herschel Rosenthal. Rosenthal has close ties to the so-called 
Berman-Waxman machine named for Reps. Howard L. Berman, (D-Panorama City) and 
Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles). Graysen is a maverick running a grass-roots 
campaign, and who admits he rarely answers political questionnaires because he 
prefers speaking directly to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Contenders 
</P>
<P>
William Graysen, 37, a Democrat, has been a criminal defense lawyer for 11 
years with the downtown Los Angeles firm of Graysen &amp; Kaplan. This is his 
first bid for public office. Graysen received his undergraduate degree in 
political science from UCLA and his law degree from the University of West Los 
Angeles School of Law. He and his wife, Susan, a psychologist, have two 
children, Elizabeth, 12, and Broc, 10. They live in Cheviot Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Herschel Rosenthal, 72, is a West Los Angeles Democrat who has served in the 
state Senate since 1982. Before that, he was an assemblyman for eight years. He 
is chairman of the Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee, and chairman 
of the Joint Committee on Energy Regulation and the Environment. A Boyle 
Heights native, Rosenthal attended the UCLA School of Engineering. He entered 
politics 35 years ago as a Los Angeles city commissioner for the Community 
Redevelopment Agency. He and his wife, Pat, have two grown children. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Michael Schrager and Peace and Freedom candidate Margery Hinds are 
unopposed in their primaries. Their names will appear on the general election 
ballot in November. 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaire 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates in contested primary races and 
were returned this month. Answers have been edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Under recently introduced legislation, state sales taxes would be raised 
0.25% for 10 years to help finance school construction. Do you favor an 
increase in sales taxes to underwrite new school construction? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. An initiative measure on the June ballot would raise taxes on gasoline sales 
by nine cents a gallon to finance highway projects. Do you support the concept 
of higher gas taxes to underwrite road construction? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: No. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the idea of breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School 
District into smaller districts? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: No. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Undecided. Needs more examination. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Under current law, the state Legislature is responsible for redrawing state 
legislative and congressional district boundaries. Do you believe this system 
should be changed? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: Yes. The governor, Assembly speaker, president pro tem of the Senate 
and chief justice should each choose three citizens, for a committee of 12, to 
draw districts. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. Essentially, the so-called reforms move the process one step 
further away from the people. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the so-called "Big Green" ballot initiative, which would 
eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase out pesticides 
known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all new 
developments? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the state should require private employers to subsidize 
day-care services for employees who request them? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: No. The state ought to provide day care on a sliding scale, supported 
by the general tax base. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes, for businesses with more than 25 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the state's efforts to build prisons in Lancaster and East 
Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Left unanswered. This prison would already be built if not for the 
governor's bowing to developer interests in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 112 on the June ballot would ban speaking fees and limit gifts 
to state legislators while creating a commission that could pave the way for 
higher legislative salaries. Do you support this ballot initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: Yes. Conflict of interest in the Legislature must be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. In the Legislature, I argued for separating the salary issue 
from the ban and gift limits. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support Gov. Deukmejian's proposed constitutional changes that would 
require state prison inmates to work in privately sponsored industries to pay 
for their incarceration? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Left unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present system of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: No. The demand for drugs should be lessened by education and improved 
social conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. All of the above, with an infusion of money for early education 
and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you consider the possibility of decriminalizing the use of drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: No. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support raising sales or other taxes to finance anti-drug law 
enforcement efforts and/or anti-drug education programs? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, by how much? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: Yes. One percent to start; more later if effective. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Not a sales tax. Certain kinds of taxes would be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support full or partial 
</P>
<P>
public funding of political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: No. It would unfairly favor powerful candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. People should have the ability to decide which candidates get 
their money. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit foreign individuals 
and corporations from owning land in California. Do you support this? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: No. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Rising property values in the Santa Monica Mountains have made it more 
difficult for state and federal parks agencies to buy land for public use. Land 
prices have escalated in part because local officials have allowed developers 
to build more houses than provided for under zoning laws. To keep property 
prices more affordable to parks agencies, should governments in Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties refuse such so-called "up-zoning?" 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: Yes. The great beauty of the Santa Monica Mountains must be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. The mountains are a non-renewable natural resource which should 
be preserved for the public and not compromised for the wealthy few. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you willing to publicly release your tax returns and those of your 
spouse before the election? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: No. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A development project called Porter Ranch would create 3,395 residential 
units and nearly 6 million square feet of commercial office space in the 
Chatsworth hills. Opponents say it is too big. Proponents say it represents 
orderly growth. Do you support the project at this size? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: No. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support limits on the number of terms state legislators can serve? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, how long should they be? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit the spraying of 
pesticides on private property without the written consent of the owner. Do you 
support this measure? 
</P>
<P>
Graysen: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes.

TATU BREAKS SILENCE -- AND SOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For 208 minutes and 54 seconds, the Sockers had been holding their breaths. It 
had been that long since Tatu had scored a goal against them. 
</P>
<P>
Tatu is the leading scorer in the MISL. The Sockers knew it was only a matter 
of time. 
</P>
<P>
The time came Friday night. There was 6:49 remaining in the third quarter, and 
Socker forward Wes Wade had the ball. His pass was intercepted by midfielder 
Mark Karpun, who advanced the ball and shot. Goalie Victor Nogueira deflected 
it to his right, and Tatu stood waiting. Bang. 
</P>
<P>
He scored again 57 seconds later to push his team toward a 4-1 victory before 
9,003 in the San Diego Sports Arena. The Sidekicks now have a 2-1 advantage in 
the best-of-seven Western Division finals. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent goals by midfielder Kevin Smith and defender Troy Snyder helped 
finish off the Sockers, who have only lost three games in San Diego to the 
Sidekicks in 21-game series history. 
</P>
<P>
So Tatu was a happy camper. This melted away a lot of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"When you create opportunities, and you try to score, and you don't, you say 
'What's happened to me? What's gone wrong?' " he said. "I was getting my shots. 
The four or five games they shot me down I averaged eight or 10 shots." 
</P>
<P>
But someone was always in the way. Not this time. Defender Cacho let Tatu shoot 
past him down the left sideline on his second goal, and he scored the first 
after Wade's errant pass. Still, the difference this time was that he finished 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
"He broke out of his shell tonight," Socker defender Ralph Black said. "You 
can't keep him down for too long." 
</P>
<P>
And the Sockers continue to wait for midfielder Branko Segota. He was pointless 
again Friday and now has just one assist in this series. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman has taken note. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept saying to Branko, 'Come on, you're very quiet,' " Newman said. "He 
didn't seem to be able to raise his game. Maybe I ought to play more aggressive 
players." 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, the Sockers were aggressive up until the third quarter. In fact, 
both teams were. Neither managed to score in the first half, thanks mostly to 
outstanding goalkeeping by Joe Papaleo of the Sidekicks and Nogueira. 
</P>
<P>
Tatu unleashed two line drives midway through the first quarter that Nogueira 
tipped away with a dive to the right and a dive to the left. 
</P>
<P>
Papaleo took his best dive a few minutes later, foiling a shot from just 
outside the goal mouth by forward Rod Castro, who redirected a pass from 
forward Paul Wright with his heel. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams failed on first-quarter power plays. The Sidekicks tried first 
following an intentional hand-ball penalty on defender Ralph Black. The Sockers 
got their opportunity when Doc Lawson was whistled for tripping Cacho. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the Sockers problems was an injury to midfielder Waad Hirmez, who 
left in the second quarter with a hamstring strain and did not return for the 
second half. He will be evaluated today and is questionable for the remainder 
of the series. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers opened the scoring in the third quarter when midfielder Brian Quinn 
took a short pass from midfielder Jacques Ladouceur on the dead run and sent it 
into the right corner. Soon after, Tatu broke his dubious string and then added 
an exclamation point. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers are now in a difficult position. The teams meet Sunday and Tuesday 
in San Diego before going back to Dallas. If the Sockers don't take both home 
games, they will need to sweep in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
What concerns Newman most is his team's intensity level, or lack thereof. 
</P>
<P>
"Disappointed," he said. "There wasn't that spark there tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City defeated Baltimore, 3-2, in Game 3 of the Eastern Division finals 
at Kansas City. Dale Mitchell scored the game-winner 29 seconds into overtime. 
Baltimore leads the series three games to one . . . About 30 minutes before the 
game, somebody discovered that the playing carpet had been placed down 
incorrectly at the west end of the arena. This caused the red line to be 
situated too close to the goal. Twenty volunteers were rounded up, and the 
carpet was pulled, reversed and placed down correctly. . . . Sidekicks defender 
Richard Chinapoo (left calf) and forward Steve Kinsey (left hamstring) did not 
make the trip. Chinapoo, who finished third on the team in scoring during the 
regular season with 33 points, has not played in the playoffs. Kinsey was 
injured in Game 2.

LUGINBILL, SDSU SUED BY EX-PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A former San Diego State football player is suing the school and Coach Al 
Luginbill over what he says was a broken promise to award him a partial 
athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing will be held Monday in San Diego Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Spinello, a linebacker from Mission Viejo High School, says Luginbill 
reneged in February, 1989, on an oral agreement to award him a $2,000 
scholarship. Spinello, who had five tackles as a freshman reserve in 1988, left 
the team and withdrew from SDSU shortly thereafter. He later enrolled at Orange 
Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, Spinello is due unspecified damages for breach of 
contract, fraud and emotional distress. He also is seeking punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Lam, the lawyer representing SDSU and Luginbill, said she could not 
comment. Luginbill was out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Spinello said the promise of a scholarship was 
made by Mike Nelson, a former assistant coach (mistakenly referred to as head 
coach in the suit), when he was recruiting Spinello in the spring of 1988. 
Spinello said he was told that he could become part of the team's "12th-man 
scholarship," a program for players not offered athletic scholarships at the 
time of enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Spinello said he was told by Nelson that he would receive a $2,000 scholarship 
if he enrolled in the fall semester of 1988 at his own expense and completed a 
three-unit course, not in physical education, in the intersession period 
between the fall and spring semesters or in summer school. 
</P>
<P>
The scholarship would be renewable based on successful participation in 
football, plus specific academic considerations. There also was the possibility 
the award could be increased to a full scholarship, which is worth about $4,000 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in January, says the school and Luginbill went back on the 
agreement after Denny Stolz was fired as coach in November, 1988, and replaced 
by Luginbill, a former associate athletic director at the school. Luginbill did 
not retain Nelson, who is now a football assistant at Stanford and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says Luginbill at first "fraudulently represented" to Spinello that no 
scholarship money was owed him and no money was available, but that he later 
told Spinello's parents that he would award their son the $2,000 if he 
completed the intersession course. 
</P>
<P>
Spinello completed the course in January, 1989, and presented Luginbill with 
proof of its completion in February, 1989, according to court records. The suit 
says Luginbill then refused to award Spinello the $2,000, telling him there was 
no money available. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says that despite his statements there was no money available, 
Luginbill acknowledged the existence of the "12th-man" program by awarding 
scholarship money to another player in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that Luginbill's actions were "despicable and done 
intentionally with the intent to harass and annoy" Spinello. 
</P>
<P>
Spinello could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Margaret M. Cahill, said 
she could not comment.

BURNS WINS BY 2 STROKES; CSUN 3RD

Bob Burns of Cal State Northridge held on Friday to post a two-stroke victory 
in the NCAA Division II golf championships at Loxahatchee Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, who opened a six-stroke lead after Thursday's play, was the only player 
to match par on the 6,850-yard, Jack Nicklaus-designed course, earning medalist 
honors at 288 after a final-round three-over-par 75 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates were not as fortunate. The Matadors shot a closing 300 for 1,198 
and slipped from a second-place tie to third in the 17-team field. As expected, 
Florida Southern rolled to its fifth title in the past 10 years, posting a 
one-under 287 for 1,170 and a 26-stroke victory. 
</P>
<P>
All five Florida Southern players placed among the top 10. Columbus College of 
Georgia, the 1989 champion, closed fast with a 294 and took second at 1,196. 
</P>
<P>
Diego Ventureira, a native of Buenos Aires, shot 70 and finished second, two 
strokes behind Burns at 290. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it would be difficult to get the (team) victory," said Northridge 
Coach Jim Bracken, "but it's disappointing that we didn't stay in second place. 
. . . Our guys played hard all week, and our hats are off to Florida Southern." 
</P>
<P>
Burns' victory was the third in Northridge's history. Corky Bassler shared the 
title with Mike Spang of Portland State in 1969 and Vic Wilk won outright in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which won Division II team titles in 1969, 1973 and 1974, will play 
in Division I next season. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, who missed only 10 greens in 72 holes, did not make a birdie Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't scrambling," the junior from Granada Hills said. "I just didn't make 
any putts. I heard at the 16th green that I had a three-shot lead and I just 
tried to par in." 
</P>
<P>
Other results for Northridge on Friday: Sang Hyun, 73-303; Jeff Sanday, 79-304; 
and Corby Segal and Wayne Merich, each 76-312.

TOP-SEEDED POLY FALLS IN 12 INNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taft High scored six unearned runs, including one in the top of the 12th 
inning, to shock top-seeded Poly, 7-6, in the first round Friday of the City 
Section 4-A Division baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Poly, which originally was scheduled to play North Hollywood before a 
last-minute switch by City officials, finished 22-4. 
</P>
<P>
"It was North Hollywood when we left the meeting last week. It was set," Poly 
Coach Jerry Cord said. "I found out Thursday we were playing Taft." 
</P>
<P>
Brett Reisner led off the 12th for Taft (12-14-1) with a single against Raul 
Torres (5-2). Reisner stole second, was sacrificed to third by John Erganian 
and scored when Roy Lozano bobbled Carey Wilbur's grounder for an error. 
</P>
<P>
Poly, which rallied for three runs in the bottom of the seventh to tie the 
score, 6-6, was retired in order in the bottom of the 12th by Benji Belfield 
(5-1), who allowed three hits and one run over the final 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unreal. It was nuts, absolute craziness," Taft assistant Coach Steve 
Singer said.

LOSS TO UC DAVIS BACKS NORTHRIDGE AGAINST THE WALL -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge baseball team isn't where it wants to be. But based on 
past performance, the Matadors just might be where they need to be. 
</P>
<P>
After a 13-5 drubbing at the hands of UC Davis on Friday afternoon at Matador 
Field, Northridge is a loss away from elimination in the NCAA Division II West 
regional. 
</P>
<P>
This scenario should sound at least remotely familiar. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, with its back to the wall, CSUN delivered three consecutive 
wins over Cal State Los Angeles to earn a share of the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. title and an automatic playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Matadors need only to win two, the first of which will have to 
come against UC Riverside when the double-elimination regional resumes today at 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside (38-16) scored three runs in the bottom of the ninth to nip Davis, 
12-11, in Friday's first game. 
</P>
<P>
Today's game will mark the sixth meeting of the season between the Matadors and 
Highlanders, who shared the CCAA championship, and Northridge (34-21) has won 
the past three. 
</P>
<P>
A Riverside victory today would end Northridge's season. But if CSUN wins, 
Riverside and Davis will play 45 minutes after the conclusion of today's first 
game, with the winner meeting Northridge in the regional title game Sunday at 1 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Should CSUN beat Riverside in today's first game, all three teams would have 
1-1 records. Northridge would receive a bye in the second game by virtue of its 
victory in a three-way coin toss Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to look at a silver lining, we only have to win two games now 
instead of three," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh-ranked Davis (29-25), co-champion of the Northern California Athletic 
Conference, pounded CSUN starter Craig Clayton for 11 hits, including three 
each by Warren Buck and Jai Khanna. 
</P>
<P>
Buck hit his fourth home run of the season in the fifth inning and doubled in 
another run when Davis blew the game open with six runs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Khanna made a couple of nifty plays at third base in addition to reaching base 
in all four plate appearances. He had three singles, scored three runs, and 
walked in the seventh to force in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge had 12 hits, including three by Clayton, but the Matadors didn't get 
to starter Dave Swartz until it was too late. Davis led, 13-1, by the time CSUN 
scored four times in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Swartz (7-3), a hefty 6-foot-3 right-hander, finally was relieved by Kevin 
Grindy with two out in the eighth. Grindy struck out the last four batters. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton and CSUN reliever Todd Denhart were both hit hard in the seventh, but 
the Matadors might have found a stopper in their third pitcher, freshman John 
Bushart, should there be a next time against the Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
Bushart, a lanky left-hander, retired the last four batters in order, striking 
out three. The Aggies have had trouble scoring against left-handers all season 
but had no such trouble against the five right-handers they faced Friday, 
collecting 27 hits in two games. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside's winning run against Davis scored on a throwing error by second 
baseman Bobby Rounsaville. The Highlanders did all their scoring with two out. 
</P>
<P>
Logan Ostrander trimmed Davis' lead to 11-10 with a double down the left-field 
line that scored Matt Davis and moved Pete Weber to third. 
</P>
<P>
With Scott Hayward, a senior from Notre Dame High, up next, Andrew Craig came 
on in relief of Davis starter Rudy Taub. Craig got two quick strikes, but 
Hayward grounded the next pitch to the right of Rounsaville, who made a 
backhanded stop but felt he had no play at first base. 
</P>
<P>
Weber scored from third to tie the score, 11-11, and Ostrander came sprinting 
around third, hoping to score if Rounsaville threw to first. When the second 
baseman held onto the ball, Ostrander paused momentarily, then broke for the 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
Rounsaville's throw reached the plate in plenty of time for the out, but it was 
far above the head of catcher Steve Klaus and went to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside would have needed more than three runs in the final inning had it not 
been for a controversial call in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
With runners at first and second and no one out, Mark Saugstad of UCR hit a 
line drive that Rounsaville couldn't handle on the fly. He knocked it down, 
though, and threw to second to get a force out. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chad Townsend, the runner who had been on second, froze, thinking 
that the ball was going to be caught. When it wasn't and the force was recorded 
at second, Townsend returned to the base instead of trying for third. Jim 
Reiley, the Davis shortstop, tagged Townsend, then threw to first, completing 
what he thought was a rather unorthodox triple play. 
</P>
<P>
But the play faked out the umpires. Neither Bob Billinger at first nor Gil 
Perez at second saw Reiley make the tag. And while they were trying to 
determine what had happened on that end of the play, neither saw the throw to 
first beat Saugstad. Instead of turning a triple play, Davis was credited with 
only one out and Riverside went on to score five runs in the inning, opening a 
7-1 lead.

WESTLAKE AWAKENS IN TIME TO AVOID 1ST-ROUND UPSET

Westlake High's stingy pitching, consistent defense, and pesky hitting were but 
a memory to the Warriors for the better part of their Southern Section 5-A 
Division playoff game against Mira Costa on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But, as they seemingly have done all year when their backs are pinned against a 
dugout, the Warriors (26-1) came up with the key ingredients in time to hand 
Mira Costa (13-14) a 6-5 loss in a first-round game. Westlake will meet 
Torrance, a 10-7 winner over Edison, on Tuesday at a site to be determined by a 
coin flip today. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, which looked like anything but the top-seeded team, trailed, 4-1, 
after three innings. Its defense -- which committed seven errors -- offered 
little support for ace Mike Eby and the Warrior offense struggled with Jason 
Garner's slow curve. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sloppy. Very, very sloppy," Coach Rich Herrera said. "We played worse 
than we've played all season." 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, who nervously stalked the third-base foul line and vehemently argued 
with umpires, was spared his sanity by a frenzied Westlake comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake tied the score, 4-4, in the fifth on Greg Hess' solo home run, his 
seventh. Todd Preston, who entered the game with a .190 batting average, drove 
in the go-ahead run with a ground-rule double in the sixth. The final run, 
which proved to be the difference, scored on a pickoff attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fortunate to keep coming back," Herrera said. "When you're down, 4-1, 
a lot of things run through your mind." 
</P>
<P>
Herrera's thoughts were churning from the start, when Mira Costa -- the No. 3 
team from the Ocean League -- scored three times in the first two innings. 
Preston committed errors on the game's first two ground balls, which led to two 
unearned runs in the first. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa added a run in the second on Cody Beason's second homer of the 
season. Westlake countered with a run in the second on Rick Wolters' 
run-scoring double, and Mira Costa extended its lead to 4-1 on Bobby 
Dominguez's RBI grounder in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Eby (10-0), a senior left-hander who entered the game with a 1.37 earned-run 
average, allowed only five hits but walked six. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike didn't pitch well at all, and he knows that," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake cut its deficit to 4-3 with two runs in the fourth on Wolters' 
run-scoring double and an error that allowed Wolters to score. Wolters, a 
senior second baseman, also saved a run in the fourth when he backhanded a 
ground ball headed for center field and recorded a force out at second. 
</P>
<P>
After Hess led off the fifth with his game-tying homer, Westlake -- which blew 
a bases-loaded, no-out situation in the inning -- scored twice in the sixth. 
Mike Lieberthal doubled, Hess was intentionally walked, and Preston followed 
with a ground-rule double off the hill in right field. On Dave Monheim's 
groundout, Mira Costa first baseman Shawn Wright attempted to throw Preston out 
as he rounded second and Hess scored from third. 
</P>
<P>
Eby pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the sixth. In the seventh, a walk and 
an error put the tying runs on with none out. Beason hit a double-play grounder 
to Falsken at short, but Wolters' relay bounced past Hess at first and allowed 
Dominguez to score. Hess retrieved the ball and nabbed Beason in a rundown for 
the second out, and Eby struck out Jeff Diussa to end the game.

BIRMINGHAM STOPS SYLMAR IN MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shadows crept across Ramirez Field at Birmingham High on Friday as afternoon 
turned to early evening, and early evening turned to dusk. 
</P>
<P>
And still the teams played. Birmingham and Sylmar waged a war of wills in a 
first-round City Section 4-A Division playoff game that spanned nine innings 
and more than 4 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Birmingham third baseman Ruben Flores, with no out and the bases 
loaded in the bottom of the ninth, unexpectedly dropped a squeeze bunt on an 
0-2 pitch from sophomore Jimmy Lemos (2-1). As the ball rolled to the right of 
the mound, Bob Bookatz scored from third base to record the game's 27th and 
final run and give the Braves a 14-13 win. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm elated," Birmingham Coach Wayne Sink said, dripping wet from an impromptu 
ice-water shower, courtesy of his players. "What can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
He was elated because his team came back from a 12-5, fifth-inning deficit with 
three runs in the fifth and five in the sixth. Elated because junior Noah 
Kirshbaum (3-0), in only his third pitching appearance of the year, held 
Sylmar's big bats to six hits and two runs in 6 2/3 innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
And elated because Birmingham's season -- at 19-6-1 the best in Sink's 13-year 
tenure -- will continue Wednesday in the quarterfinals at El Camino Real, which 
defeated North Hollywood on Friday, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm numb," Sylmar Coach Gary Donatella said. "I'm drained." 
</P>
<P>
Drained because his players had come back from a 4-0 deficit with a nine-run 
second, only to lose. Drained because Sylmar (16-10), trailing, 13-12, in the 
seventh inning, tied the score on a bases-loaded walk to James Encinas that 
forced extra innings, only to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's the playoffs," Donatella said. "Kids rise to the occasion." 
</P>
<P>
Kirshbaum bailed himself out in the seventh, shutting down Sylmar after he 
walked in the tying run with the bases full. 
</P>
<P>
"I was freaked," Kirshbaum admitted. "I was scared, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the inning, he induced Dereck Ornelas (three hits, three runs) into 
a force out with none out and runners at first and second. 
</P>
<P>
After London Woodfin singled to load the bases, Kirshbaum walked Encinas to tie 
the score but then retired Ben Soliz and Pat Garcia on weak grounders to end 
the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Flores led Birmingham with a game-high four runs batted in, and Bookatz, who 
scored the winning run after he tripled to lead off the ninth, had three hits 
and scored three runs. Danny Larson had two hits and three runs, and Mike 
Malkin added two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Woodfin had three hits and three RBIs to lead Sylmar.

SOUTHERN SECTION TRACK CHAMPIONSHIPS;

<P>
RIO MESA STICKS TO SCHEDULE IN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rio Mesa High girls' track team was given a schedule of events that 
differed slightly from those that other teams followed in Friday's Southern 
Section 3-A Division track and field championships. 
</P>
<P>
"On the schedule that (Coach Brian FitzGerald) gave us it said, '10:30, run 4 x 
400 relay; 10:35, celebrate,' " sprinter Marion Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
And things went according to plan for the Spartans, who dominated the team 
scoring in easily winning their first division title since 1979. After 14 
events, Rio Mesa has 63 points and Estancia is second with 31. The triple jump, 
the 15th event, will be concluded Tuesday, but none of the top three teams have 
an athlete competing in that event. 
</P>
<P>
"We got points where we didn't expect to get points," said FitzGerald, 
referring to freshman Tiffany Marra's fifth-place finish in the 1,600 and a 
fourth-place effort by Danielle Tanner in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
"We were confident," FitzGerald added. "The girls have been talking about 
getting (championship) rings. This is a big deal for them." 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa won four events, with Jones taking two. In the 100 and 200 meters, 
Jones dashed to the lead immediately and never looked back, cruising to 
victories in 11.79 and 24.02 seconds. She also anchored a winning 400 relay 
team and contributed a 54.1-second anchor to Rio Mesa's second-place effort in 
the 1,600-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
Alycia Burnham was another individual winner, taking the 100 low hurdles in 
14.66. Nikki Johnson of Esperanza was the runner-up in 15.08. Burnham was also 
second in the long jump at 17 feet 9 1/4 inches and sixth (47.92) in the 300 
low hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's Derek Kite was a wire-to-wire winner in the 4-A 1,600, running 
4:15.20. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd try and psyche them out today," said Kite, who ran the 400 in 
59.8 and the 800 in 2:04.3 en route to a 3:09.6 split at 1,200. "I've never 
gone that fast my first three laps. My last lap I looked back 'cause I was just 
dying." 
</P>
<P>
Hoover senior Creighton Harris was second in 4:17.02. 
</P>
<P>
Kite and Harris qualified for next week's Masters' meet, in which they will 
battle Coley Candaele of Carpinteria and Arroyo Grande's Louie Quintana. 
</P>
<P>
Candaele shadowed Agoura's Bryan Dameworth through three laps (3:04.2) before 
surging to the front with 250 meters remaining to win his third consecutive 1-A 
title in a nation-leading 4:06.58. Quintana captured his second consecutive 2-A 
title in 4:07.20. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth later outdistanced Fillmore's Jorge Barajas to win his fourth 
consecutive 1-A 3,200 title in 9:05.61. Crespi hurdler Ryan Kieling lowered his 
previous best in winning the 2-A 110 highs in 14.66. Kieling, the Del Rey 
champion, also won the 330 hurdles in 39.03. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura's Deena Drossin successfully defended titles in the girls' 1,600 and 
3,200. In the 1,600, Drossin ran a personal- and region-best 4:58.73. Sophomore 
Nikki Shaw of Fillmore, the former region leader at 4:59.07, was second in 
5:01.91. Drossin timed 10:52.16 to easily win the 3,200 over Fillmore's 
Maribella Aparicio (11:15.11).

CITY 3-A VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
MONROE MAKES SHORT WORK OF VERDUGO HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took the Monroe High boys' volleyball team only one hour to capture its 
first City Section 3-A Division title, a 15-3, 15-9, 15-12 victory over Verdugo 
Hills on Friday at Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
The surprisingly easy win brought tears to the eyes of Monroe Coach Linda 
Gayton, who started the program four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been ready for this match for two weeks," Gayton said while clutching 
her first championship trophy in 20 years of coaching. "The boys told me at the 
beginning of the season that this would be their year. I guess they knew what 
they were saying." 
</P>
<P>
The victory capped an unbeaten season for the Vikings, who finished 17-0 and 
lost only one game in the playoffs. Verdugo Hills, playing in its first City 
volleyball championship in more than a decade, finished 16-1. 
</P>
<P>
The teams had split a pair of pool matches earlier this season in the Venice 
tournament, but the Dons offered little resistance Friday. Monroe's dominating 
front line of seniors Brad Packer (6-foot-4), Matt Johnson (6-1) and Pierre 
Masequesmay (6-0) kept Verdugo Hills off balance. 
</P>
<P>
Masequesmay finished with 11 kills, 11 digs and five blocks. Packer added seven 
kills and six blocks, and Johnson had seven kills. Pierre's cousin, outside 
hitter Jean Masequesmay, finished with 10 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly thought winning the City title would take more than this," Pierre 
said. "They fought us hard, but we just had control of all three games. This 
has to be our best match of the season. I know we were prepared coming in." 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo Hills not only lacked height, the Dons had a manpower crisis. Verdugo 
Hills has no player taller than 5-10, carries eight players on the varsity and 
was further slowed when outside hitter Dale Domingo was forced to play despite 
an injured ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't make any excuses," Coach Dino Stirpe said. "We were really off, and 
their net game was really on. This is really disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe jumped to a 7-1 lead and cruised to a first-game win. The Vikings broke 
an 8-8 tie in the second game, scoring seven of the next eight points. The Dons 
took their first lead in the third game but were unable to hold on to their 
10-9 advantage.

POWAY, GROSSMONT, MIDWAY SEEDED FIRST IN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Poway High, Grossmont and Midway Baptist received the top seedings in the 3-A, 
2-A and 1-A divisions of the San Diego Section playoffs beginning next week. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-ranked Poway entered the week tied for second in the Palomar League with 
Rancho Buena Vista, but victories over Fallbrook Wednesday and Rancho Buena 
Vista Friday combined with Mt. Carmel's loss to Vista Friday gave the Titans 
(19-6-1) the league title and the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont, The Times' No. 1-ranked team throughout the season, was an easy 
choice for the top spot in the 2-A. Grossmont is 25-2 and won the Grossmont 2-A 
League with an 8-0 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Midway Baptist, the champions of the Citrus League, finished 19-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro Conference led all leagues with five teams. The Palomar, Grossmont 
3-A and Avocado leagues each had four, and every other league had three. 
</P>
<P>
Every team selected in the 3-A and 2-A divisions had winning records on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Of 26 3-A teams, 16 had winning records. Vista, which was not selected, was 
hoping to sneak in on the strength of an 11-15-1 record and recent decisions 
over Orange Glen and Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Hilltop, which had to forfeit 17 victories earlier in the week, was seeded 
eighth, the second highest of the five Metro teams. Officially, Hilltop is 
2-24. 
</P>
<P>
Like the 3-A, the 2-A had 16 of 27 teams with winning records. El Camino, which 
finished 12-12, was not selected. 
</P>

BONITA VISTA'S BAUER COMPLETES TRANSITION WITH TITLE

It was 2 1/2 years ago that Julianne Bauer burned out on gymnastics. Though an 
Elite competitor, she had not reached her peak. But she had reached her boiling 
point. 
</P>
<P>
She quit. 
</P>
<P>
She did nothing for two months, then took the first steps toward becoming a 
cheerleader at Bonita Vista High School. But Brigitte Elfman, a friend from her 
days with Aztec Gymnastics, convinced her to try her hand at diving. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be some hand. On Friday, Bauer turned in the third-highest 
11-dive score in finals history to win the San Diego Section girls' 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
She impressed judges to the tune of 434.50 points, third only to Monte Vista's 
Kristen Walls (450.80 in 1989) and Santana's Eileen Maul (436.95 in 1987). 
</P>
<P>
Bauer, a 5-foot senior, was the first of two Bonita Vista athletes to win 
titles. Junior Chris Chapman overcame favored Jonathon Gale of Poway on his 
eighth dive and beat him by nearly seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman won with 401.50 points. Gale scored 393.70, and third-place Troy 
Velasco scored 359.65. 
</P>
<P>
As she did the judges, Bauer impressed opponents, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I love watching her dive," Mt. Carmel's Kelly Manion said. "I think she 
basically had it when she came here. She even missed her reverse 1 1/2 and was 
still way ahead of everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Manion took third with 382.60 points. Grossmont's Juli Walls, trying to keep 
the section title in the family after her sister won in 1988 and '89, was a 
distant second (390.45). 
</P>
<P>
Elfman, who invited Bauer to try diving, finished sixth with 359.45 points. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer, who will attend South Carolina on a diving scholarship in the fall, said 
she's a fast learner, and that allowed her to reach the pinnacle of high school 
diving -- and to do so dominantly -- with just 2 1/2 years of practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a good listener, so I hear," Bauer said. "And I make changes." 
</P>
<P>
Her coach, Dive San Diego's Tom Scotty, said the mental toughness Bauer had 
acquired allowed her to train as diligently as she had during her 10-year 
gymnastics career. And many of the moves are the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Once she learned how to use the diving board, she took off," Scotty said. "She 
really bought into the program, the conditioning, the things that have allowed 
her to learn and come around so fast."

The way his team has played this season, Coach John King had every reason to be 
confident before his Crawford team won the San Diego Section high school 
badminton final Thursday at the Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Crawford was 16-0, had disposed of La Jolla, 14-3, in the semifinals 
and was facing No. 3 Serra, a team it had routed, 12-5, in the 1990 season 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't matter to King, who could only remember how Crawford put up the 
same 16-0 record the previous year and lost to Hoover, 11-6, in the 
championship match. Crawford had earlier beaten Hoover, 9-8. 
</P>
<P>
So when Serra jumped out to easy victories in the boys' and girls' No. 1 
singles matches and was tied, 4-4, at the halfway point, King was a little 
worried. Then Crawford swept three mixed doubles matches and won four of six in 
boys' and girls' doubles, ending any doubts he might have had with an 11-6 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little concerned when it was 4-4," King said. "But we have so much 
depth, I was still confident. The key for us was our No. 1 and 2 guys came back 
and won their mixed matches. They didn't let down; they came back." 
</P>
<P>
Khuong Thai lost to Serra's Steve Hashimoto, 15-9, 15-5, in the boys' No. 1 
singles match but later teamed with San Chan to defeat Richard Cruz and Salina 
Siao, 15-9, 15-7, at No. 2 mixed doubles. The victory put Crawford ahead, 5-4, 
and it never trailed after that. 
</P>
<P>
Section Volleyball 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded San Pasqual (2-A) and San Dieguito (3-A) advanced to the San Diego 
Section semifinals with victories over Mission Bay and Mar Vista. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual (14-1) struggled but defeated Mission Bay, 13-15, 15-4, 15-6, 8-15, 
15-6. Robb Foley led San Pasqual with 17 kills and Bruce Williams added 15. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito (14-0) defeated Mar Vista, 15-3, 15-12, 15-1, behind Eric 
Sullivan's 19 kills. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln, University of San Diego High and University City also advanced to the 
semifinals in the 2-A. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines upset No. 4 Mira Mesa, 16-14, 16-14, 15-9, to reach the 3-A 
semifinals along with Southwest and Mt. Carmel. DANA HADDAD

MANDELA VISITS LIBYA, THANKS KADAFI FOR HELPING TRAIN ANC

<TEXT>
<P>
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, saying, "We consider ourselves 
comrades in arms," thanked Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi on Friday for 
military training he gave ANC fighters and condemned the 1986 U.S. air raids on 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 cheering students greeted Mandela when he arrived in Tripoli from 
Algiers as part of an African tour he is taking with his wife, Winnie. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-apartheid leader was whisked to Kadafi's Bedouin tent residence inside 
the heavily armed Azizya barracks in Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
"You have given military training to South Africans who wanted to obtain their 
liberation through armed struggle," Mandela said after embracing Kadafi outside 
his tent. "In our situation, as in other countries, an armed struggle is one of 
the most effective ways for fighting for political change in our country. 
</P>
<P>
"Your readiness to provide us with the facilities of forming an army of 
liberation indicated your commitment to the fight for peace and human rights in 
the world," Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats say Libyan officials regard Mandela's visit as a triumphant symbol of 
Libyan policy that will considerably boost Tripoli's prestige in the African 
world. 
</P>
<P>
On the way to the meeting with Kadafi, Libyan officials stopped and showed 
Mandela the ruins of Kadafi's former residence, bombed by the United States on 
April 15, 1986, in retaliation for terrorist attacks allegedly sponsored by the 
Libyan strongman. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela insisted on seeing every room in the building, which was littered with 
bomb shrapnel and wreckage from a downed U.S. Air Force plane.

CONTRAS SUSPEND PACT TO GIVE UP ARMS; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: REBELS SAY CHAMORRO IS NOT FULFILLING HER OBLIGATION TO GUARANTEE 
THEIR SECURITY.

<P>
A Nicaraguan Contra leader said Friday that the rebels are indefinitely 
suspending an accord to give up their arms, saying President Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro's government is not living up to its side of the pact. 
</P>
<P>
"We announce that we are indefinitely suspending the disarmament and 
demobilization of Nicaraguan Resistance troops," said a statement signed by 
rebel military commander Israel Galeano. 
</P>
<P>
Under the two-week-old agreement, the rebel forces were to be fully disarmed by 
June 10. Since the agreement was reached, about 1,000 of about 14,000 rebels 
have surrendered their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate official response to the Contra statement, released in 
Managua. The statement said the rebels would not resume disarming until they 
are convinced that Chamorro can guarantee the economic and physical security of 
the insurgents who hand over their arms. They also made the resumption of 
disarmament conditional upon the government's overcoming "the current climate 
of social uncertainty and instability," which the rebels said was brought on by 
the leftist Sandinista opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of Friday's statement was not clear. Rebels interviewed last week 
said the disarmament process is voluntary, but some said they would not 
"volunteer" to go home unless ordered to do so by their commanders. 
</P>
<P>
But in some of the seven rural cease-fire zones where the Contras have now 
gathered, high-ranking rebel officers have disarmed, encouraging many foot 
soldiers to do so. U.N. officials overseeing the process said it thus could 
have taken on a momentum of its own. 
</P>
<P>
The Contra statement, coming two days after Chamorro made major concessions to 
Sandinista-led labor unions to settle a weeklong public employees strike, 
appeared to be an attempt to press her to define the rural zones as something 
like colonies for the disarmed rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The government agreed to establish such colonies, and to make them 
demilitarized zones, in exchange for the rebel leaders' agreement two weeks ago 
to start disarming their troops. The agreement called for a definition of those 
zones by May 31, but rebel leaders apparently want the government to move more 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Galeano has said that most rebels, once disarmed, want to live in their own 
colonies, so they can feel better protected from the Sandinista-led army and 
police. Such an arrangement would give the rebel commander political power 
after his army is dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
However, a visit last week to two of the cease-fire zones found little outward 
enthusiasm for the idea. Most of the rebels interviewed said they want to 
return to their native villages, although many were reluctant to do so until 
the fate of other former rebels is clearer.

NICARAGUA: 'MY COUNTRY IS BANKRUPT,' SHE PLEADS IN A LETTER TO BUSH. MEANWHILE, 
THE SANDINISTAS SHOW THAT THEY STILL WIELD POWER.

<P>
Three weeks ago, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro assumed the presidency on a 
promise to reconcile this war-divided nation and revive its prostrate economy. 
That task, one of her advisers said, required three immediate conditions: a 
disarmament pact, labor peace and emergency cash. 
</P>
<P>
But after her early apparent success in persuading the Contras to start handing 
over their rifles, her vision has been darkened by the country's most 
disruptive strike in 11 years and frustrated by the delay of $320 million in 
promised American aid. 
</P>
<P>
"My country is bankrupt," Chamorro pleaded in a letter to President Bush a week 
ago as Sandinista unions began shutting down government ministries, banks, air 
and bus transport, phone lines and schools. She asked Bush for a $40-million 
stopgap loan "to avoid a critical situation that may be looming" while Congress 
debates his Nicaraguan aid proposal. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, after Bush replied that he could not legally provide the loan, 
Chamorro's government backed away from its threat to fire the strikers, 
withdrew the riot police and met most of the union's demands for wage hikes and 
job security. 
</P>
<P>
The labor accord, which ended the weeklong strike Thursday, confirmed a central 
fact of life in post-revolutionary Nicaragua: Without massive foreign aid to 
jump-start the economy, the cost of social peace for Chamorro's center-right 
administration is an unofficial tax allowing the Sandinistas, through 
negotiations, to shape many of her policies. 
</P>
<P>
"After the elections the (Chamorro) government thought it had all the power," 
said Father Cesar Jerez, president of Managua's Jesuit-run Central American 
University. "But that power turned out to be more formal than substantive. The 
Sandinistas showed that nobody can govern this country without taking them 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista unions representing 50,000 public employees who struck won a 100% 
wage increase to offset Chamorro's first currency devaluation. They won the 
right to take part in drafting the procedures for implementing a civil service 
law that Chamorro had wanted to modify unilaterally so that she could fire some 
senior Sandinista holdovers. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement is unlikely to give her beleaguered government much relief. 
Sandinista leaders, including former President Daniel Ortega, are demanding a 
withdrawal of two other decrees that would undermine cherished revolutionary 
programs by returning some expropriated farmlands and industries to private 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
After losing the Feb. 25 election, Ortega vowed that his Sandinistas would 
"govern from below" as a legal opposition. They are well equipped to do so. 
They dominate the army, the police, the Supreme Court and have well-organized 
support among trade unions, farmers and students. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging some of that power, Chamorro's advisers signed a March 27 
transition agreement to leave the army's Sandinista officer corps intact. Gen. 
Humberto Ortega, the defeated president's brother, was kept as chief of the 
army under a mandate to reduce its numbers after the Contras disarm. But the 
deal caused an uproar in Chamorro's 14-party coalition, bringing pressure on 
her to act forcefully on other fronts. 
</P>
<P>
Said one adviser: "It created an image that this government was weak, that the 
Sandinistas were still running things. We had to strike hard." 
</P>
<P>
What angered Chamorro and prompted her to attack, the aide said, was the 
discovery, as she took office, that the departing Sandinistas had stripped the 
state of millions of dollars in assets -- vehicles, real estate, cattle, radio 
stations -- and had left just $3 million in the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, Chamorro's majority in the new National Assembly repealed an amnesty 
that the Sandinistas had passed in their lame-duck days to immunize themselves 
from corruption charges. Then she issued a decree "suspending" a civil service 
law that had made it impossible to fire many of those blamed for the looting. 
</P>
<P>
In the poisoned political climate, Chamorro was branded a dictator -- compared 
to the late Anastasio Somoza -- for bypassing the Assembly. Her decree set off 
the public employees' strike May 10. 
</P>
<P>
The strike was pushed by a radical Sandinista faction that declared war on a 
"bourgeois counterrevolution." Chamorro's hardened stance moved Daniel Ortega, 
who had shown interest in a smooth transition, to rally behind their demands. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sandinistas knew they had to strike now, before the recovery comes," said 
Louis Sanchez Sancho, a leader of Chamorro's forces in the Assembly. "When 
people see McDonald's hamburger stands popping up all over, that kind of thing, 
support for the revolution is going to collapse. People are going to forget 
about ideological slogans." 
</P>
<P>
That view makes Congress' delay of Bush's Nicaraguan aid package, sent to 
Congress on March 13, all the more frustrating for the new government. The bill 
for aid to both Nicaragua and Panama is festooned with unrelated spending 
amendments and bogged down in legislative maneuvering. Nicaragua's share of the 
$720 million was supposed to sustain its economy in the crucial 100 days before 
the first grain harvest stabilizes food prices. Instead, inflation is running 
at 70% this month. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of image do the Americans want here?" an incredulous government 
minister asked in an interview. "Why was it easier for them to give the Contras 
hundreds of millions of dollars for their war than to help a democratic 
government make peace?" 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Mayorga, the Central Bank president, said the strike cost $10 million 
and "two valuable weeks" in his economic recovery plan. He said Nicaragua will 
seek help from the Conference of Donors, a group of industrialized, mostly 
European nations that meets June 6 in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Chastened by the strike, he admitted that the government had failed to open 
"communications channels" with the Sandinista unionists before cutting the 
cordoba's value in half, ending bus fare subsidies and raising utility rates. 
</P>
<P>
"If we continue on the path toward peace and understanding," he said after 
negotiating the strike settlement, "we are certain to lift up Nicaragua, 
although it will require more effort than it would have if we had international 
aid." 
</P>
<P>
But while Mayorga joined some labor officials in announcing the settlement at a 
press conference, and in calling it the model for conciliation, strike leader 
Jose Angel Bermudez was speaking in triumph to a crowded union hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go to the press conference because I have nothing to conciliate with 
those exploiters who try to trample the rights of the working class!" Bermudez 
shouted. "This was not our first great battle, and it will not be our last. . . 
. It should have swept away any doubt about the capacity of the revolutionary 
people."

Three skinheads, wearing masks to conceal their identities, were charged in 
court Friday with desecrating about 100 graves at a Roman Catholic cemetery and 
trying to make it appear that Jews committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the three wanted people to believe the vandalism Wednesday night in 
Nantes was committed in revenge for the gruesome desecration last week at a 
Jewish cemetery in Carpentras. 
</P>
<P>
A corpse there was dug up and impaled on an umbrella handle. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspects apparently decided to carry out the desecration to 
protest the detention of right-wing extremists during the investigation of the 
Carpentras incident. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who did not enter pleas, face sentences of up to two years if 
convicted on the charges of vandalism and provoking racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
Legal sources described them as skinheads -- youths whose close-cropped hair is 
an emblem of extreme right-wing views. The sources said they had admitted 
desecrating the cemetery to whip up anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing possible reprisals against the youths or their families, police 
outfitted them with masks for their appearance at Nantes' courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
As of late Friday, the Carpentras case remained unsolved. The government said 
it was considering posting a reward, a step rarely taken in France.

The Soyuz spacecraft that took two Soviet cosmonauts to the space station Mir 
last February was damaged slightly during takeoff and is scheduled to be 
repaired before the cosmonauts can return to Earth, U.S. experts said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The experts stressed that the damage does not appear to threaten the cosmonauts 
or their mission. 
</P>
<P>
Although American space officials have known about the damage to the Soyuz 
craft since February, the knowledge did not become public until Soviet 
cosmonaut Alexander Serebrov, visiting the United States, revealed it in an 
interview with the trade journal Aviation Week and Space Technology. The 
magazine's edition dated May 21 was published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, pieces of insulation on the outside of the Soyuz 
craft tore loose and are now blocking sensors that are used for aligning the 
craft for re-entry. But the craft has adequate backup sensors to perform the 
re-entry, according to James Oberg, an American expert who has written a number 
of books about the Soviet space program. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no reason to doubt that their ship is flyable as it is," 
Oberg said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that the cosmonauts are preparing to make repairs before their 
scheduled Aug. 2 return to Earth, as soon as a resupply vehicle takes them an 
extendable ladder that will allow them to reach the damaged area. 
</P>
<P>
The insulation is used to keep the Soyuz from growing too cold when its power 
is turned down for long periods while it is docked to Mir. According to former 
U.S. astronaut John Fabian, who was briefed in Washington by Serebrov, the 
Soyuz is now much colder than normal and Soviet officials fear that the cold 
will cause water to condense in and damage the vehicle's electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet ground controllers have ordered the two cosmonauts aboard Mir, Anatoly 
Soloyev and Alexander Baladin, to reposition the space station so that the 
Soyuz receives more sunlight in an effort to keep it warm. 
</P>
<P>
The cosmonauts cannot simply climb into their spacesuits and fix the pieces of 
insulation batting, Serebrov said, because there are no handholds on the side 
of the Soyuz to which they can anchor themselves. Handholds are placed over the 
surface of the space station, but not on Soyuz because such protuberances on 
the craft's otherwise streamlined surface would overheat from the friction of 
the Earth's atmosphere and interfere with re-entry. 
</P>
<P>
Without such handholds, Oberg said, "it takes an astonishing amount of effort 
simply to maintain your position" in a weightless environment. 
</P>
<P>
The ladder is being sent to the cosmonauts in a regularly scheduled robotic 
resupply craft that is due to be launched at the beginning of June. Holding 
onto the ladder, the cosmonauts will be able either to reattach the loose ends 
of the fiber batting or simply to cut them free. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the cosmonauts are apparently not going to use their new jet 
backpacks, successfully demonstrated in February, for the repair. 
</P>
<P>
"They were boasting that it would allow them to inspect and perform maintenance 
anywhere on the space station," Oberg said. "Now they are not going to use it. 
I find that curious." 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that water could get into the Soyuz craft's electronics system 
is disturbing, Oberg said. "But before they unhook the ship for re-entry, they 
simply turn everything on and check it out," he said, telling why there is 
little threat to safety. "If it's not working, they simply send up a spare 
(Soyuz) ship. They have one, and have a program to do that." 
</P>
<P>
That program, called Rescue Soyuz, has a cadre of cosmonauts who could fly up 
to Mir, pick up the two cosmonauts and return them safely to Earth, he said. 
Oberg said there is no indication that Soviet officials have taken steps to 
activate Rescue Soyuz.

NEGOTIATORS HINT AT NEW LEASES FOR U.S. BASES;

PHILIPPINES: TALKS ARE EXPECTED TO FOCUS ON FURTHER USE OF THE FACILITIES IN 
EXCHANGE FOR INCREASED ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID.

<P>
Ending a week of often rancorous talks, U.S. and Philippine negotiators agreed 
Friday to new negotiations on the future of six American military bases in the 
Philippines, setting the stage for a renewed U.S. military presence in the 
western Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, the negotiators agreed only to a "discussion" of a "new relationship" 
between Manila and Washington, including political, economic and military 
matters. But U.S. officials said privately that the talks will focus primarily 
on creating a new security agreement, including possible new leases for the 
giant U.S. bases here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a euphemism," one official said of the "discussion" ahead. "It's a 
diplomatic term to cover what we got -- new negotiations on the bases." 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the United States offered to increase military, medical and food 
aid to the Philippines. The arrangement appeared a face-saving maneuver for 
both sides since much of the assistance is already promised or in the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The facilities at issue are the Pentagon's two largest overseas installations, 
Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, plus four smaller facilities. Although 
cuts are now under way, the United States has 14,745 military personnel, 1,355 
civilian Department of Defense employees and 20,268 dependents stationed at or 
near the bases. 
</P>
<P>
No date was set for the next round of talks, but they are expected to begin 
within a month. President Bush's special negotiator, Richard L. Armitage, who 
will lead the talks, left for Tokyo after closing ceremonies in the heavily 
guarded Central Bank complex. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 anti-U.S. demonstrators were arrested during the week, which 
began with the shooting death of two Air Force enlisted men outside Clark. In 
Angeles, near Clark, Lt. Col. Julius Yarcia, the regional military commander, 
said Friday that his troops had arrested three alleged Communist guerrillas, 
one of whom may be involved in the killing of the two Americans, airmen John H. 
Raven, 19, of Delta Junction, Alaska, and James C. Green, 20, of Craig, Colo. 
The three were arrested late Thursday after a gun battle with troops in a 
village on the outskirts of Angeles, about 50 miles north of Manila, said 
Yarcia. 
</P>
<P>
In Manila early Friday, two rifle grenades were fired from a taxi at the Thomas 
Jefferson Cultural Center, run by the U.S. Information Service, but there was 
little damage and no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. diplomats here were notified this week that they are now entitled to 15% 
additional "danger pay" for working in the Philippines. Danger pay is also 
given to U.S. diplomats in Colombia, Peru, El Salvador, Afghanistan and 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators apparently resolved the longstanding dispute over compensation 
for the bases. Philippine Foreign Minister Raul S. Manglapus had contended that 
his government is owed $222.5 million from the current 1988 agreement. The U.S. 
negotiators acknowledged that Congress has yet to appropriate $96 million of 
the two-year $962 million agreement, but refused to concede any shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators agreed to establish monitoring teams to deal with the 
assistance package, and the United States agreed to seek excess military 
equipment for the Philippines from bases in Western Europe, provide excess 
medical equipment from Veterans Administration hospitals in the United States, 
arrange Export-Import Bank loans and send increased food and medical aid to 
this impoverished nation of 60 million. 
</P>
<P>
"All these add up to the satisfaction of our $222.58-million shortfall bid," 
Manglapus said in the closing ceremonies. U.S. officials declined to put a 
dollar figure on the package. 
</P>
<P>
But officials privately conceded that creative accounting on both sides helped 
solve the impasse. About $6 million in excess U.S. hospital equipment was 
delivered earlier this week, for example, and a $500-million Export-Import Bank 
loan package announced in Washington this week will cover the Philippines, 
Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand. In addition, a Philippine spokesman said 
$22.5 million in already delivered food aid had been "overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
Armitage repeatedly expressed "disappointment and frustration" at the tone of 
the talks, and said Philippine criticism was "direct and pointed." 
</P>
<P>
"I must admit with a sense of disappointment that the issue of compensation so 
dominated our time during these talks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saying U.S. support for democracy is more important than aid, Armitage asked, 
"Of what value are these facilities to the Philippines? If the answer is 
expressed only in monetary terms, the American military presence cannot be 
sustained." 
</P>
<P>
Armitage appeared to direct his comments at Philippine nationalists, who 
consider the bases a vestige of the U.S. colonial period, from 1898 to 1946, 
and have pressed President Corazon Aquino to remove or sharply reduce the 
military presence. The issue is highly volatile here, and is subject to endless 
public debate. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his tough talk, officials said Armitage is pleased with the compromise. 
The Pentagon considers the bases vital to protecting sea lanes in the Far East, 
to projecting air and sea power in the Western Pacific, and to act as a 
stabilizing balance in the region.

uprising in Kwangju. 
</P>
<P>
The rally itself was peaceful, but students and other protesters in groups 
ranging up to 10,000 confronted police afterward, throwing gasoline bombs and 
stones. 
</P>
<P>
Riot police broke up the protests. Although police reported arrests and 
injuries, they gave no details.

The demonstrators demanded the punishment of those responsible for the Kwangju 
affair, and called for the downfall of President Roh Tae Woo and his ruling 
Democratic Liberal Party.

SENATE LEADER URGES BUSH NOT TO RENEW CHINA'S TRADE BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Citing continuing political repression in China, Senate Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell (D-Me.) urged President Bush on Friday not to seek an extension of 
China's most-favored-nation trade benefits when they come up for renewal early 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
In a biting attack on the Bush Administration's policy toward China, delivered 
on the Senate floor, Mitchell asserted, "It's time to abandon this failed 
policy, not to embellish it with new concessions." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell also strongly criticized China for allegedly trying to bargain for the 
release of Fang Lizhi, the dissident who took refuge inside the U.S. Embassy in 
Beijing shortly after the government crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in 
Tian An Men Square last June. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's remarks demonstrated that Bush may find it difficult to persuade 
Congress to approve an extension of trade benefits to China. Moreover, they 
served notice that the Democratic leadership may use the debate on China's 
trade benefits as a vehicle for a new round of attacks on the Administration's 
policy of seeking reconciliation with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
A country with most-favored-nation trade status can export its goods to this 
country under the lowest available tariff rates. China has enjoyed the status 
for a decade, and Bush must notify Congress by June 3 whether he plans to 
extend the trade benefits for another year. 
</P>
<P>
The President insisted this week that he had not yet decided what to do. There 
have been indications that he and other Administration officials favor 
continuing the benefits, but want to delay taking a public position to keep 
China off balance and, perhaps, to extract further concessions from the Chinese 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's statement aroused concern among those officials and business groups 
that favor extending China's trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not good," said Roger W. Sullivan, president of the U.S.-China Business 
Council, which represents American companies doing business with China. "There 
are some congressmen who say, 'We don't care about this issue. We're going to 
look at what the leadership wants.' " 
</P>
<P>
However, several congressional sources said they do not believe that there is 
enough support on Capitol Hill to revoke China's trade benefits if the 
Administration decides to support an extension. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the votes are there," said one Democratic staff aide. "We might 
have the votes to pass a bill to revoke MFN, but not enough votes to override a 
filibuster or to override a presidential veto." 
</P>
<P>
A veto override would require a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress. 
Last January, after Bush vetoed a bill permitting Chinese students to remain in 
this country, the House voted to override, but the effort failed in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mitchell cited China's surveillance of dissidents, its campaign 
of mandatory political indoctrination, its persecution of religious groups and 
new restrictions on overseas study as evidence of continuing political 
repression inside China. 
</P>
<P>
"The hope for freedom in China is as remote today as it was 10 months ago," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell also complained that China has set an increasing series of conditions 
that the United States must meet before Fang is permitted to leave the U.S. 
Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only is a written confession of guilt by Fang being demanded, but other 
conditions have been set for our nation to meet," he said.

AIDS PATIENTS TO GET MORE EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS 
</P>

Nearly a year after the idea was proposed, the Department of Health and Human 
Services announced Friday that it intends to implement a "parallel track" 
program to give people with AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses access to 
experimental drugs still in the earliest stages of research. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the department said that it will consider expanding the program to 
include drugs for other life-threatening conditions. 
</P>
<P>
HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said the parallel track policy statement will 
be published for public comment in the Federal Register on Monday, typically 
the first step in the process of putting a new federal program into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, thousands of AIDS activists and their supporters are expected 
to demonstrate on the grounds of the National Institutes of Health near 
Washington to demand an acceleration of AIDS research activities by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The parallel track idea has been praised both by mainstream AIDS organizations 
and by more radical AIDS activists. Nevertheless, many of these groups have 
grown increasingly critical of the government, accusing it of dragging its feet 
in putting the program into effect. 
</P>
<P>
"How come it has taken so long? And isn't it interesting that the bureaucracy 
moves on the eve of a big demonstration?" said Tom Sheridan, director of public 
policy of the AIDS Action Council, a coalition of 500 community-based AIDS 
service organizations. "It isn't until there is a crisis mode that we find 
ourselves getting federal leadership." 
</P>
<P>
The parallel track plan, proposed last June by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of 
AIDS research activities for the National Institutes of Health, would make 
promising new drugs available to AIDS patients at the same time that formal 
studies of the drugs are scheduled to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"We are proposing this initiative because of its potential for prolonging, 
perhaps even saving, lives," Dr. James O. Mason, assistant secretary for 
health, said in a statement. "It is an appropriate step to take at this time." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal will remain open for public comment for 60 days before being made 
final. The program could not begin until late summer at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the delay in starting the program, the Food and Drug Administration has 
on several occasions used existing mechanisms to make experimental drugs 
available to the desperately ill, including AIDS patients. Recently, it 
approved expanded patient access to an AIDS drug, DDI, under its "Treatment 
IND" designation, which allows use of a drug under certain circumstances for 
compassionate reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers and others in the scientific community have expressed concern 
that the parallel track program and other avenues of expanded access could 
jeopardize formal clinical studies unless they are carefully structured and 
monitored. Although they often take years, formal trials long have been 
regarded as the only way to answer important scientific questions about 
experimental drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Mason emphasized that the parallel track mechanism "is not a substitute for 
properly conducted and controlled clinical trials." 
</P>
<P>
He said the department believed "we have built sufficient safeguards into 
parallel track to ensure that it neither compromises the drug approval and 
clinical trials process nor delays the speedy delivery of promising 
investigational agents from the laboratory to the bedside."

<P>
With a pistol strapped to his side, Paul Andrews gently throttled up the engine 
on his flat-bottomed boat and cruised down the ribbon of open space between the 
trees. The trouble was, only days earlier this had been the road to his house. 
</P>
<P>
Then the floods came, spilling the Trinity River out of its banks. The water 
roiled around trees and houses and over roads. One estimate Friday was that the 
Lake Livingston Dam, just to the north of here, was dumping 100,800 cubic feet 
per second, only slightly less than roars over Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
At least 2,000 homes below the dam are expected to be damaged or destroyed 
before the flooding is over. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lots of houses that are underneath already," said Andrews, who carries 
a pistol and a shotgun in case he happens upon looters while checking on his 
own house, undamaged because it is built on pilings. 
</P>
<P>
The great flood of 1990 is not just isolated to this small bit of East Texas 
river. It has inundated millions of acres of land, mostly in Texas, Oklahoma, 
Arkansas and Louisiana, and in some of those places it has been the worst 
flooding ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
There also has been other flooding through the heart of the nation, from 
Michigan to the Gulf Coast and as far east as New York state. 
</P>
<P>
At least 12 people have died as a result of the flooding. Millions of dollars 
worth of crops have been destroyed and thousands of cattle have had to be moved 
to higher ground in the last two weeks. While the misery of people living along 
rivers has already been acute, there is still more to come, with some 
speculation that the Trinity will be at flood level through the rest of the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
The unknown at the moment is how much more rain will fall in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"That area is going to be vulnerable for at least three weeks," said Scott 
Kroczynski, a hydrometeorologist with the National Weather Service in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters have known for a long time that this flooding was coming. The 
conditions in this part of the country were ripe for a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"It was setting itself up through late summer and early spring," said 
Kroczynski. "It had the highest potential in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Storms kept raking across the same places. The earth was soaked and the rivers 
were already high. Then, two weeks ago, the rains began falling in North Texas, 
Oklahoma and Arkansas. The people down here saw that in the news and knew that 
trouble was on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Little Rock was the first to weather a flood surge of the Arkansas River. In 
the days since then, thousands of people have been in a holding pattern, 
waiting to see what happens to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
One of those was Sue Edmondson, who was just back from having a look at her 
home, which was only inches away from having water slosh on to her floors. She 
had spent the days before the flood moving things either out of the house or up 
on blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"My ice box is on blocks," she said. "I have to get on a chair to open my 
freezer." 
</P>
<P>
She was also angry with the managers of the dam, saying they knew there was 
going to be flooding, but did not release any water in advance of the rushing 
flood. 
</P>
<P>
"It might have flooded, but it wouldn't have gotten our homes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The flood has brought with it tragedy and also its share of ingenuity, along 
with a great many snakes that are clearly upset about the flooding. 
</P>
<P>
There was the Louisiana couple that committed suicide, apparently because the 
floodwaters dealt them another in a long string of blows to their farm. 
</P>
<P>
But there was also Howard Pipkins, the man who refused to quit. Pipkins, whose 
newly built home was located near the Trinity River, did something no one else 
attempted when he heard the flood was coming: He began to dig. He built a 
six-foot levee around his home and, as of Friday, the homemade dam was holding. 
</P>
<P>
"If it doesn't work, I'll just look like the biggest fool around here," Pipkins 
told reporters earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was Walter (Skeet) Rogers in Powhatan, La. For the last several 
days he has been moving his crop. The crop, however, was alligators and he had 
to move 4,000 of them to escape the advancing floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Hardin, Andrews guided his boat past his own home and on to that of his 
neighbor, LeRoy Myers. That house, too, had been spared because it had been 
built on stilts. Andrews quickly walked up the stairs, turned on a radio inside 
and returned to the boat. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that will discourage someone from trying to get in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews pointed to a spot not far away and said it was where the high-water 
bridge crossed the bayou. There was nothing there but water.

The Army will not force a gay man expelled from the Reserve Officers' Training 
Corps to repay a $25,000 scholarship, but it denied his request to be 
commissioned and serve in the military, his lawyer said Friday. The Army said 
its decision was based "solely on the merits and circumstances of this 
particular case."

When Yale psychiatrist James P. Comer started trying out his educational ideas 
in two of New Haven's most troubled inner-city schools in 1968, initial signs 
were not encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and administrators began the experiment with high hopes, but soon were 
squabbling over apparent failures. Parents grew so angry that they planned a 
protest march. And in the classrooms, children were confused and 
uncontrollable. 
</P>
<P>
But 15 years later, students in these two elementary schools, which had 
previously ranked at the very bottom of New Haven's 33 schools, were showing 
the third and fourth highest achievement levels, and their attendance rates 
were the city's best. What seems to have made the difference is the solid link 
that had been forged between home and school -- the most important forces in a 
student's life. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the method that has become known as the "Comer process" is standard 
procedure in New Haven schools, and has been adopted since 1984 by more than 70 
schools in nine systems. Last January, the Rockefeller Foundation pledged $15 
million over five years to expand Comer's program. 
</P>
<P>
His idea sounds simple enough: Get parents, teachers and administrators to 
agree on a set of goals, and how to work toward them. Comer also establishes a 
mental health team of social workers, counselors, school nurses and others to 
deal with the social and emotional problems that children bring to school. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all this is," Comer says. "This is common sense." 
</P>
<P>
While Comer's process is not the cure for all the ills of urban schools, those 
who have tried it say it is one of their best hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a big difference in our school climate. The kids seem to walk a little 
taller," said Jan Stocklinski, supervisor of the Comer Process for Prince 
George's County in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting calls from all over," she added. "Last week, we got a call from 
Arizona asking us to bring a parent and teacher out there." Stocklinski 
recently met with a team of officials from San Diego's Valencia Park Elementary 
School, the first school on the West Coast to adopt the Comer process. More 
than half of its 1,200 students come from families on welfare, and the school 
has suffered from a lack of parent involvement and high teacher turnover. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Richard Cansdale said he expects to have the program in place by next 
year, and adds: "I'm convinced it's going to help." 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how hard we were working, it just wasn't meeting the needs of the 
kids," said Patricia Carpio, principal of a Denver elementary school that is 
studying the Comer approach. " . . . We found out you can't do what needs to be 
done in the school. It needs to be a shared responsibility and you don't get 
people to share responsibility if you don't give them a voice in what you are 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
But as Comer learned in those early, difficult years in the New Haven school 
system, schools must first bridge the gap between what a child experiences at 
home and what is expected in class. Particularly in disadvantaged homes, 
parents -- who often did not do well in school -- are likely to feel disengaged 
and hostile toward the school. When their children fail, it further increases 
their alienation. 
</P>
<P>
The 1960s were a time when other educational experts were touting open 
classrooms and less formality, but Comer put more structure into running a 
school. 
</P>
<P>
He set up in each school a "governance team" led by the principal, and 
including the elected representatives of parents, teachers, professional staff, 
and, in some cases, custodians. Its job was identifying the school's needs, 
coming up with a plan to meet them and measuring the progress. The components 
of the plan may range from improving vocabulary skills, to boosting attendance, 
to organizing social events that will draw parents to the school. 
</P>
<P>
Belinda Brown acknowledges that she was "very hostile" when she first visited 
her son's third-grade classroom in Benton Harbor, Mich., to see why he was 
complaining. The teacher invited Brown to work with one particularly disruptive 
child who had fallen behind in math, reading and spelling. Now, the 30-year-old 
mother of three is on the school system payroll, working part-time at minimum 
wage -- such positions being a standard feature in the Comer process. 
</P>
<P>
Brown says the Comer process has given her "a burden to get other parents 
involved, because I see what happens when they don't." 
</P>
<P>
Mistrust and cynicism can exist on both sides, particularly in troubled schools 
that have been buffeted by one reform fad after another. "There were some 
schoolhouse people, I think, who were afraid that parents would take over 
everything. . . . There were parents who believed this would be a passing 
thing," Stocklinski said. 
</P>
<P>
In the economically depressed Benton Harbor area, the Comer process has had 
mixed reviews and produced uneven progress on achievement tests. 
</P>
<P>
"If you looked at it generically as a school improvement plan, used all the 
components, followed the guidelines, it's almost foolproof," the official said. 
"But you generally have not had a strong commitment on the part of the 
principals. For a lot of people, it's a pain." 
</P>
<P>
In some school districts, resistance has been so strong that Comer's 
consultants have opted not to even try the program because they knew it would 
fail, said James Boger, coordinator of the Comer program at the Yale Child 
Study Center. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said he has seen a marked rise in interest in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"People are beginning to understand . . . that a student will not achieve 
unless he or she is in a warm and caring environment," Boger said. "Schools are 
beginning to understand and appreciate that parents are the primary teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Comer draws many of his ideas on child development from his own experiences 
growing up in East Chicago, Ind., during the 1930s and 1940s. He recalls 
attending an integrated school with three other black youngsters, all of whom 
had similar backgrounds and abilities. One ended up in jail, another died of 
alcoholism and a third lived much of his life in mental institutions. Comer was 
graduated from medical school. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did my life turn out better?" he has written. "I think it was largely 
because my parents, unlike those of my friends, gave me the social skills and 
confidence that enabled me to take advantage of educational opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, he says, the disadvantages that black children face today are even 
larger. Most of the politically popular approaches to school reform in recent 
years have emphasized test scores, basic skills and teacher credentials -- 
strategies that have been criticized for their failure to reach the poor and 
minority children of inner-city schools. Comer, who is associate dean of the 
Yale medical school and a child development expert, says that is because they 
miss the basic problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We have focused on academic content and teaching methods, rather than growth 
and development," he says. Where children in the traditional supportive homes 
of earlier generations were prepared for what would be expected of them in 
school, the youngsters growing up in poor, single-parent homes "go to school 
and present themselves differently." 
</P>
<P>
To deal with these differences, Comer added another component to school 
management -- a team that focuses on mental health. This group meets weekly to 
discuss problems and assigns one of its members to work with students who need 
help.

CANDIDATES ARE PICKING UP THE PACE ON TELEVISION

<P>
A new television commercial produced by state Sen. John Seymour's campaign for 
lieutenant governor implies that the Anaheim Republican wrote two laws that 
actually never have been enacted. 
</P>
<P>
And as the primary election campaign neared its final three weeks, candidates 
in two other statewide races -- for attorney general and treasurer -- also 
unveiled more about their television advertising strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour's ad describes him as the "author of some of California's toughest 
laws." Among the examples mentioned are "the death penalty for drug kingpins" 
and "deportation of illegal aliens who commit felony drug crimes." 
</P>
<P>
The senator did introduce legislation to require the death penalty or life in 
prison for those convicted of providing drugs to someone who dies as a result 
of using them. But the bill failed passage in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour also has sponsored a bill to allow the deportation of illegal aliens 
who are convicted of a felony. That measure is pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The ad drew quick criticism from the campaign of Seymour's Republican primary 
opponent, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
"This fits a pattern of misstatements that John has carried on throughout the 
campaign," said Eric Rose, Bergeson's campaign coordinator. "When it comes to 
remembering his own record, he has political Alzheimer's disease." 
</P>
<P>
But Seymour said he believed the ad provided an accurate description of his 
record even if it was not technically correct. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, if we were going to dot the I's and cross the Ts, we should 
have said I was the author of some of California's toughest laws -- and bills," 
he said. "We should have added two more words." 
</P>
<P>
In the race for attorney general, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner on 
Monday will begin airing an ad that is negative toward slumlords, polluters and 
other criminals -- but ignores his Democratic primary opponent, San Francisco 
Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The Reiner spot consists of a tight close-up of the prosecutor's face as he 
delivers a monologue worthy of an old-time Hollywood flick about a crusading 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout my career," Reiner says, "I have always tried to speak my mind. And 
I haven't been afraid to rock the boat." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner boasts about jailing slumlords and corporate polluters and offending 
"downtown politicians." He claims to have the highest felony conviction rate in 
the history of the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner is correct when he states that he has locked up slumlords and polluters. 
</P>
<P>
It is also true that his actions have offended some people. Four years ago, for 
example, he was censured by the State Bar for violating conflict-of-interest 
rules while he served as Los Angeles city attorney. In that case, Reiner 
publicly criticized members of a secret Los Angeles Police Department 
intelligence unit while defending the city in a lawsuit alleging illegal spying 
by the unit. 
</P>
<P>
As for the conviction rate, Reiner's office points to Los Angeles County 
district attorney annual reports dating back to 1952 showing that the rate 
first exceeded 90% in 1985, the year Reiner took office. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner campaign manager Sam Singer said the campaign will spend $500,000 on TV 
advertising but that no decision has yet been made on whether to prepare a 
second spot. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Dann, campaign manager for Smith, said that he will not disclose his 
camp's plans until an ad has actually hit the airwaves. "The problem is, I 
don't want to let (Reiner) know where we are and what we are doing," said Dann. 
"We have a limited amount of resources and we have to make them last." 
</P>
<P>
In the treasurer's race, Republican Angela M. (Bay) Buchanan said Friday that 
television advertisements that began running in Los Angeles and San Diego this 
week will begin showing in Northern California on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan, a former U.S. treasurer, uses the commercial to slam her opponent, 
incumbent Thomas W. Hayes, for accepting $250,000 in contributions from Wall 
Street investment firms. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan said she will have enough money to continue television advertising 
until the June 5 primary election. She refused to disclose how much she will be 
able to spend. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who was appointed treasurer by Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, still 
has not run any television spots and is keeping his plans secret.

1 KILLED, 46 INJURED AS TOUR BUS OVERTURNS

A tour bus carrying European tourists from Las Vegas to Mammoth Lakes 
overturned on a two-lane highway east of this small eastern Sierra town Friday, 
killing one passenger and injuring 46 others, the California Highway Patrol 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said the Southwest Charter Co. bus was traveling at an unknown speed on 
a slight downhill grade along Highway 168, a road that traverses the White 
Mountains, when it rolled once after the driver failed to negotiate a sharp 
turn. The bus came to rest on its wheel about 4 1/2 miles east of here. 
</P>
<P>
One passenger, identified as Marguerite Finat, 60, was pronounced dead at the 
scene. Earlier CHP reports that two passengers had died were incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
The injured were taken to Bishop's small Northern Inyo Hospital, where hospital 
Administrator Herman Spencer said six of the passengers were in critical 
condition with internal injuries and broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Sgt. Ray Dixon said the bus was traveling in third gear, when the driver, 
identified as Juan Garcia, 30, of Phoenix, attempted to shift into a lower gear 
but found he couldn't and hit the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said that when the brakes failed to slow the bus enough as it approached 
a sharp curve the driver turned into the bank on the right side, then lost 
control as the bus slanted across the road to the left and rolled. 
</P>
<P>
When help arrived, most of the dust-covered passengers were sitting beside the 
road, many with blood on their faces. Others wandered around the crash scene 
seemingly in a daze. 
</P>
<P>
At the hospital in Bishop, Spencer estimated that about a third of the 
passengers suffered scrapes, bumps and bruises; another third were treated for 
moderate injuries. 
</P>
<P>
He said 46 patients arrived at the hospital within an hour to an hour and a 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital attendants encountered a language problem immediately. Many of the 
passengers -- including Germans, French, Belgians and Austrians -- were unable 
to speak English. Volunteers from the community were recruited to help the 
staff, Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest limitation is that we only have a 32-bed hospital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The overflow patients or those with injuries that could not be treated in 
Bishop were scheduled for transfer to other hospitals in Mammoth Lakes and in 
Reno. 
</P>
<P>
After treatment, some of the patients were driven by police to Bishop 
Auditorium to wait for arrangements to be made for overnight accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
In Phoenix, a spokesperson for Southwest Charter Co., said the company is "very 
concerned" about the accident and the owner, Mark Pike, made immediate 
arrangements to fly to Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's accident was the second deadly bus crash in the eastern Sierra in four 
years. Twenty-one elderly Southern California residents were killed north of 
Bridgeport in May, 1986, when a gamblers' special returning from Reno careened 
into an icy, swollen river. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty other passengers were injured.

DEMPSEY GIVES DODGERS POWER; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: CATCHER HITS TWO HOME RUNS IN 4-2 VICTORY OVER PHILLIES. JAY HOWELL 
GETS FIRST SAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Never one to rest on his milestones, Rick Dempsey put his four-decade career in 
perspective earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like four decades since I've started back-to-back games," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It may not seem that way for long. In only his fourth start of the season 
Friday, the backup catcher forced the Dodgers to give this old man one more 
good look. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey pulled a surprise by hitting a home run in the third inning, and then 
hit another one in the fifth, leading the Dodgers over the Phillies, 4-2, 
before 34,274 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But this game not only featured something old, it had something new -- the 
first appearance by reliever Jay Howell who had been out since April 21 after 
undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
In sealing the Dodgers' fourth consecutive victory, a season-high streak, 
Howell gave up only one hit in the final two innings. He earned his first save 
of the season in protecting the win for Tim Belcher, who struggled but still 
allowed just two runs in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
How big was this night for Howell? He actually showed emotion afterward, 
forcefully slapping his bare hand against his glove. It was a feeling he rarely 
revealed even last year while setting a Dodger record with 28 saves. 
</P>
<P>
But if anything could have overshadowed Howell's return it was Dempsey, 40, who 
had his most powerful offensive game in four years, and it may have earned him 
a back-to-back start. Usually, he starts only against left-handed pitchers, and 
tonight's Phillie starting pitcher, Dennis Cook, is a left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Dempsey hit two homers in one game was April 10, 1986, when he 
did it for Baltimore against Texas. The homer, his first two of the season, 
also equaled half of his total home run output last year. His two RBIs were 
also his first of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the homers did not win the game. His first homer, off Phillies' 
starter and loser Bruce Ruffin, gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead in the third 
inning. After Belcher allowed two Phillies' runs in the fourth, Dempsey's 
second homer tied it in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger got the go-ahead run later in the fifth, after they loaded the bases 
on an infield single, a Belcher bunt that was allowed to stop on the first-base 
foul line by first baseman Ricky Jordan, and an intentional walk to Eddie 
Murray. Kal Daniels followed with a grounder to the first baseman to score the 
go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers added another run in the sixth inning on more Phillies' foibles in 
the sixth. Mike Sharperson singled to center, stole second and took third on 
catcher Steve Lake's passed ball. He then scored when Lake threw a blown 
suicide squeeze bunt attempt by Alfredo Griffin through Dickie Thon's legs at 
third base, allowing the trapped Sharperson to trot home. 
</P>
<P>
All of which made Tim Belcher very happy. Belcher entered having lost three of 
his last four starts, and with a 4.25 ERA. And he didn't appear to be much 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
True, he allowed just a couple of runs on six hits. But of his 115 pitches, 
nearly half, 50, were balls. He did not seem to throw the ball hard when he 
tried, and often appeared to attack hitters with breaking balls. 
</P>
<P>
After allowing a walk in the first inning, and a single in the second inning, 
he made a complete mess of the fourth inning, in which the Phillies took their 
brief 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, Jordan doubled to left. Belcher then walked John Kruk. A low 
pitch that Dempsey mishandled moved the runners to second and third. Charlie 
Hayes' groundout scored one run, and Thon's single scored another run. Belcher 
then loaded the bases on a Lake single and a walk to Ruffin. Only a fly-ball 
out to left field by Len Dykstra saved him. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffin, attempting a comeback this season after three poor years, is struggling 
again. He entered at 2-3 with a 4.43 ERA, and didn't look much better in this 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 22 hitters the left-hander faced, 11 hit the ball in the air and hard. 
In his 4 2/3 innings, he allowed three runs on six hits and was fortunate to be 
trailing only 3-2 when he departed. 
</P>
<P>
After ending each of his last three major league seasons with an ERA of above 
4.00, Ruffin has a 4.63 ERA and 15 unintentional walks against only 14 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The trade that sent Willie Randolph to Oakland for Stan Javier continued to 
have clubhouse reverberations Friday when outfielder Jose Gonzalez said he 
might ask to be traded. Gonzalez said he is upset because Javier's addition 
seems to mean he is no longer wanted or needed here. "What am I doing here?" 
Gonzalez asked. "They keep moving everybody around, but I'm not going anywhere. 
It's like they are writing my name on the wall saying, 'Forget about him.' I 
hope things get better for me, or maybe I should ask for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Monty Basgall, former Dodger coach known for helping players such as Bill 
Russell and Davey Lopes switch positions, flew in from his Sierra Vista, Ariz., 
home. He will be with the team for three days, taking special notice of Juan 
Samuel, who earlier this week returned to second base after a 16-month hiatus 
in center field. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders say that when Kirk Gibson gets angry with himself in the batting cage, 
he is getting close to returning. If that is the case, Gibson is very close. He 
barked at himself several times Friday during another impressive 15-minute 
batting practice.

MISTER FRISKY GETS A CHANCE TO PROVE SELF; 
</P>
<P>
PREAKNESS: HE WILL TRY TO BOUNCE BACK FROM FLOP IN DERBY.

<P>
His jockey, Gary Stevens, calls him "the old Mister Frisky." His trainer, Laz 
Barrera, refers to him as "the real Mister Frisky." 
</P>
<P>
By any name, he is the horse who had won all 16 of his races, taking the 
longest winning streak ever into the Kentucky Derby, and then finished eighth, 
beaten by 19 1/4 lengths, as the favorite at Churchill Downs two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky became Mister Flunky. But in today's 115th Preakness at Pimlico, 
Mister Frisky will not have as much to beat as he did in Louisville, but 
Unbridled and Summer Squall, the first two finishers in the Derby, are part of 
the nine-horse field. Unbridled is 7-5, Summer Squall 2-1 and Mister Frisky 3-1 
on the morning line. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall bled slightly from the nostrils for about four or five minutes 
after galloping Friday, causing concern about whether he can bounce back from 
his effort in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall has had a bleeding problem since late February, when he bled 
freely during a workout at Gulfstream Park in Florida. He is treated with 
Lasix, a diuretic given to bleeders and a medication approved in all major 
racing states except New York. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Howard, Summer Squall's trainer, said the colt also had bled slightly 
before the Blue Grass Stakes, a Keeneland race that he won on a muddy track 
April 14, when Land Rush and Unbridled ran second and third, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"This should be no problem," Howard said. "He's bled the day before a big race 
before, and he's still run good. This is just one of the things that I've been 
dealing with." 
</P>
<P>
Some labeled the Kentucky Derby a two-horse race, which turned into an 
oversimplification when the first three horses under the wire -- Unbridled, 
Summer Squall and Pleasant Tap -- were 10-1, 2-1 and 40-1. The Preakness is 
being called a three-horse race, a label that should stick. With the losses of 
Pleasant Tap and Champagneforashley because of injuries Thursday, the rest of 
the field is a mishmash that includes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A horse who hasn't won a race in more than four months, Land Rush. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another that has never won a stake, Kentucky Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The sixth-place finisher in the Santa Anita Derby, Music Prospector. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three local entries that wouldn't be running if a long van ride had been 
required -- Baron de Vaux, Fighting Notion and J.R.'s Horizon. 
</P>
<P>
While Stevens and Barrera have regained their confidence after watching Mister 
Frisky train on the Pimlico track, Carl Nafzger, the trainer of Unbridled, is 
not walking around like the man who has the only shot at the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
"We might even be the third betting choice by the time they run the race," 
Nafzger said. "One race doesn't make a horse." 
</P>
<P>
Barrera, who won the Preakness with Affirmed in 1978 en route to the Triple 
Crown, sees today's race setting up differently than the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"There won't be as much speed as there was in Kentucky," Barrera said. "I think 
my horse can lay second or third. He's going to show that he's the real Mister 
Frisky. You know they say that there are horses for courses, and I think this 
horse will like this track, not like it was in Kentucky." 
</P>
<P>
In the Derby, Mister Frisky was a factor for three-quarters of a mile but 
abruptly dropped out of contention on the far turn. Stevens thought that Mister 
Frisky wasn't getting hold of the Churchill Downs surface. 
</P>
<P>
"He had shown the same problem in a workout there," Stevens said. "They cut up 
the track two races before the Derby, and that made it the same as it had been 
for the work. Down the backstretch, the track was getting away from him, and he 
was using all of his energy before he had to." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens worked Mister Frisky five furlongs in a sharp :59 2/5 last Sunday. "He 
seemed like the old Mister Frisky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled was 14 lengths off the pace, ahead of only three horses, in the early 
part of the Derby. Horses that come from that far out of it seldom win the 
Preakness, because Pimlico has such sharp turns, and the 1 3/16-mile distance 
is 110 yards shorter than the Derby. Eddie Gregson, who trained Gato Del Sol, 
winner of the 1982 Derby, didn't even run his colt in the Preakness, because he 
was certain the horse stood little chance. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking about the way the race sets up, Nafzger is not encouraged. "If either 
Summer Squall (with Pat Day riding) or Mister Frisky loops up there on the 
front end by themselves, we don't catch them," Nafzger said. "If we do, he's a 
super horse, because they are good horses. This is a nightmare, it's not a 
worry." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
If Mister Frisky wins the Preakness, his victory will be compared to Snow 
Chief's in 1986. Snow Chief also won the Santa Anita Derby, ran 11th in the 
Kentucky Derby and rebounded to take the Preakness. . . . Nancy Heil, who will 
saddle Fighting Notion, is only the third woman to train a horse in the 
Preakness. The others were Judith Zouck, whose Samoyed finished sixth in 1980, 
and Judy Johnson, whose Sir Beau was seventh in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
The last second-place finisher in the Kentucky Derby to win the Preakness was 
Forward Pass in 1968. Forward Pass eventually became the Derby winner after 
Dancer's Image, first across the line, was disqualified for testing positive 
for an illegal medication. . . . The weather at Pimlico today is expected to be 
clear, with temperatures in the 80s. . . . Summer Squall is the only 
Kentucky-bred in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Pimlico will hold a $350,000 race for sprinters, the six-furlong Frank J. De 
Francis Memorial Dash, on Aug. 18, the first anniversary of the death of De 
Francis, 62, who is credited with reviving Maryland racing. Joe De Francis, 
Frank's son, now runs the Pimlico and Laurel tracks. . . . The race might 
attract Housebuster and Safely Kept. Housebuster will start in either the 
Metropolitan Mile -- against Easy Goer -- at Belmont Park May 8, or in the Riva 
Ridge on Belmont Stakes day June 9.

MELVIN DURSLAG: IF OTHER CITIES DO IT, WHY NOT L.A.? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If you are following events on planet jock, you doubtless are aware that a new 
stadium is being built on the South Side of Chicago to shelter the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
A dome is under construction in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis has voted funds for a football stadium to serve as home for an NFL 
team the city aims to capture. 
</P>
<P>
And Cleveland has just come in with a vote to build a complex that would serve 
the baseball Indians outdoors and the basketball Cavaliers under a roof. 
</P>
<P>
You know, of course, that Chicago, Cleveland, Atlanta and St. Louis have no 
homeless. They have no problems with education, no problems with public works, 
no problems with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Such problems are peculiar only to Los Angeles, where it doesn't seem possible 
to get a new stadium airborne. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, Los Angeles doesn't even build the Coliseum. When voters reject 
the project, local newspaper publishers get a bond floated to finance the 
edifice. It is a sterling effort until the publishers handed over management of 
the stadium to the city, county and state, forming a body called the Coliseum 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
That is like handing over the British Museum to Larry, Curly and Moe. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Los Angeles tries to build a baseball stadium with the idea of 
bagging a major league team. This venture fails, too. 
</P>
<P>
The city finally give land to the Dodgers, who built the stadium with their own 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Tapping the old scalp, the Coliseum Commission then underwrites bonds to build 
the indoor Sports Arena, to be paid off, for the most part, from revenues from 
basketball and hockey tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The only trouble is, the Commission ticks off the guy controlling pro 
basketball and hockey, and he moves his teams to a stadium he builds in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Now stuck with the bond obligation, the Coliseum earmarks money from its 
football tenants to pay off the Sports Arena, except the principal tenant, the 
Rams, moves to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
When a pro replacement, the Raiders, arrives, a college tenant, UCLA, moves to 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
So now we sit down for a review. We have a pro football team called Los Angeles 
in Anaheim, another in the Coliseum. We have a college football team in the 
Coliseum, another in Pasadena. We have a college basketball team in Westwood 
and another at the Sports Arena. We have a pro basketball team at the Sports 
Arena and another at Inglewood, where we also have a hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
And the baseball team occupies Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven facilities doing the work of maybe four," a cost efficiency expert 
gasps. "With better management, Nicaragua went broke." 
</P>
<P>
Now 67 years old and visibly dated, the Coliseum needs replacing, but it won't 
come off because a cry is heard that the historic beauty of that monument must 
not be defaced. 
</P>
<P>
And, guarding the ramparts of public welfare, political knights awaken our 
conscience to the plight of the homeless, even though the issue is not related 
to a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Money raised for a stadium is calculated to come back. If a stadium weren't 
built, that money would not go to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
There is still another point to which Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta and St. Louis 
give thought. Those who aren't homeless outnumber overwhelmingly those who are. 
Lives of everyday people must go on, and so must those of their children. 
</P>
<P>
Forming the backbone of any society, they have something coming from the pot 
into which they ante. 
</P>
<P>
And a sports stadium is a cultural accommodation, as is a music center, an 
opera house, a museum or a zoo. Indulging any of the foregoing, one needn't be 
made to shoulder the guilt. 
</P>
<P>
A few years back, Cleveland voted down a stadium, linked to an excise property 
tax. The new proposition, financed jointly by private and public funds, is tied 
to a sin tax, specifically, on cigarettes and booze. 
</P>
<P>
Minneapolis helped bankroll its Metrodome with a tax on tippling, touching off 
a bitter fight that even went to court. 
</P>
<P>
Drinkers argued that it was illegal to tax them when they had no interest in 
baseball or football. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball and football fans countered they had no interest in drinking, but were 
made to pay for all the problems drinkers create, including a need for 
hospitals to dry them out. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, baseball and football fans prevailed, proving the ideal society is 
one in which there is something for everyone.

STANLEY CUP: JARI KURRI HAS HAT TRICK IN 7-2 VICTORY TO BECOME LEADING 
POSTSEASON GOAL SCORER. HE ALSO TIES SINGLE-GAME RECORD FOR A FINAL WITH FIVE 
POINTS.

<P>
This time, it didn't take six periods. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't even take three. 
</P>
<P>
The Stanley Cup finals segued from one of its more memorable games to one of 
its more forgettable Friday night at Boston Garden as the Edmonton Oilers, led 
by Jari Kurri's record-setting hat trick and five points, defeated the Boston 
Bruins, 7-2, in Game 2 of the best-of-seven series. Edmonton had won the opener 
Tuesday night in triple overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Games 3 and 4 will be played Sunday and Tuesday in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers blew Friday's game open with four second-period goals and coasted 
through the final 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
While this game may not rate high in NHL history, it has to rate at the top in 
the Kurri chronicles. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did he score three goals. Not only did his five points tie a Stanley 
Cup final mark. 
</P>
<P>
But Kurri also broke a tie with former teammate Wayne Gretzky to become the 
league's leading postseason goal scorer. 
</P>
<P>
And he did it all on his 30th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Kurri's wife, Tiina, had filled his hotel room in the afternoon with so many 
balloons that Kurri complained, "I couldn't move." 
</P>
<P>
That certainly wasn't his problem Friday night before a sellout crowd of 
14,448. 
</P>
<P>
Kurri began the night tied with Gretzky at 89 playoff goals each. 
</P>
<P>
Then came: 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 90 in the first period. Camped to the right of the net, Kurri 
redirected a shot by Esa Tikkanen for a goal to give the Oilers a 2-0 lead 
after Adam Graves' earlier score. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 91 in the second period. It broke a 2-2 tie after goals by Boston's Ray 
Bourque and Greg Hawgood. Kurri took a pass from Tikkanen and fired from the 
top of the right circle, the puck dribbling through goalie Andy Moog's pads. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 92 in the final period on a power play long after the issue had been 
all but finalized. 
</P>
<P>
Kurri, of course, was thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of those days," he said, "that I'm going to remember the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
But he also took time in the packed locker room to praise the man he had 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the guy," said Kurri of Gretzky, with whom he played for eight seasons 
before Gretzky was traded to the Kings. "When he left, I realized I had to 
change. He was the best playmaker in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"Gretz did a lot for me. I'm just happy to be up there with those guys. But you 
never know with Gretz. Next year, he might pass me." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he and Gretzky had talked about the record, Kurri replied: "He's a 
busy man. He's on vacation. I'm a busy man. I'm here. But I'm sure he's happy 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
Kurri may soon be on vacation as well if this series continues to go as it has. 
</P>
<P>
He may have been in the spotlight Friday, but Edmonton goalie Bill Ranford was 
again on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
Ranford, who played all 115 minutes and 13 seconds in Game 1 and stopped 50 of 
52 shots, stopped 25 of 27 Friday, keeping his team in the game when it could 
have easily slipped away early. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were outshot, 10-2, in the first period but scored on each of those 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
When Kurri broke the 2-2 tie with Edmonton's third goal, it came on the Oilers' 
fourth shot. 
</P>
<P>
Exit Moog. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Boston backup goalie Reggie Lemelin. 
</P>
<P>
Exit Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers scored three more goals -- by Craig Simpson, Tikkanen and Joe Murphy 
-- in less than four minutes to all but settle the issue. 
</P>
<P>
And that doesn't include a penalty shot missed by Petr Klima. Given an open net 
when he faked out Lemelin, Klima fanned on his swing. The shot had been awarded 
when Lemelin threw his stick at the puck. 
</P>
<P>
"As incredible as Game 1 was," Boston Coach Mike Milbury said, "this one was 
equally incredible. For us to look up at the 30-minute mark and be behind was 
virtually unthinkable. We dominated every facet of the game with the obvious 
exception that Andy wasn't sharp." 
</P>
<P>
Kurri took the puck away from defenseman Don Sweeney to set up Edmonton's 
fourth goal. 
</P>
<P>
"We blew our composure when it was 3-2," Milbury said. "Understandably, our 
guys, as much as we tried to settle them down, felt they had to get it back 
immediately, and I lost them at that point. We started to make foolish 
mistakes, turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of being a tight-checking team, we became a team that was trying to 
create too much, manufacturing plays at the offensive blue line when they 
weren't there. We tried to handle the puck far too often and, as a result, 
turnovers came about. Edmonton is the best team in the league at capitalizing 
on turnovers. We blew our composure." 
</P>
<P>
Which gave Kurri the perfect way to blow out his birthday candles. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Cup Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jari Kurri became the sixth player to score five points in a Stanley Cup final. 
The most recent was Toe Blake for the Montreal Canadiens against the Chicago 
Blackhawks in 1944. . . . Boston's Dave Poulin left the game after only 49 
seconds, following a hit by Mark Messier, and never returned. Poulin suffered a 
mild knee sprain.

ABBOTT MAKES MOST OF HIS SECOND CHANCE; 
</P>

AFTER FINLEY FALLS ON WET STREET.

<P>
One small misstep by Chuck Finley gave Jim Abbott an opportunity to take a 
giant step toward redemption. 
</P>
<P>
Finley's fall on a wet street in Toronto Friday left the Angels' scheduled 
starter with a sprained right ankle and Manager Doug Rader and pitching coach 
Marcel Lachemann with three possible substitutes. Abbott had started Wednesday 
but threw only 47 pitches in 1 1/3 innings before exiting, little enough work 
to make him a stronger candidate than Willie Fraser or Scott Bailes and big 
enough an embarrassment to make him embrace an unexpected second chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Lach came up and said to me, 'We might have to have you in the pen,' but I 
said, 'I can start if you need me,' " said Abbott, who had seen Finley fall but 
didn't know the extent of the mishap. "He mulled it over and said, 'Go ahead.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Once out there, Abbott never looked back. He pitched 6 2/3 innings, striking 
out a season-high five and earning a 4-2 victory before a sellout crowd of 
49,339 at the SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
"You hate to see anybody get hurt, and I'm glad it's not serious, but for me, 
I'd have had to think about (Wednesday's loss) until my next start," said 
Abbott, who won for the first time since May 1 and improved to 2-3. "Coming 
back from such a bad game, maybe this was a blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to go out with a little more specific game plan, to get strike 
one, and if I didn't get it, to fight for it on the next pitch. When I walked 
the lead-off guy, I thought maybe for a little bit, 'Here we go again,' but 
that's what I have to battle and not let that throw my concentration off and 
just throw strikes." 
</P>
<P>
After such a poor performance, he said, "I had nothing to lose." His teammates 
were determined that he would not lose, rewarding him with strong support that 
resulted in the Angels' third victory in their past nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Hill doubled and scored during the Angels' three-run third inning and 
hit a home run in the fourth off Dave Stieb (5-2). It was Hill's first home run 
since Aug. 28, 1988, when he was with the Chicago White Sox. He played 
flawlessly at second base and was involved in four double plays turned by the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"The way Abbie pitched was really a boost," Hill said. "Abbie threw great. He 
moved the ball in and out and had a lot of movement on his fastball. It seemed 
like every time he needed a ground ball, he got it." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays, who have lost four consecutive games and have fallen 2 1/2 games 
behind the AL East-leading Brewers, scored in the seventh inning on a two-run 
home run by catcher Pat Borders. Toronto recorded only two fly-ball outs 
against Abbott and three against sinkerball specialist Mark Eichhorn, who 
gained as much satisfaction from saving the game for Abbott as he did in 
defeating his former Toronto teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw great and I was going to do my best to preserve this one," said 
Eichhorn, who was credited with his sixth save in seven opportunities. "I was 
pretty anxious when I went out there. I wanted to keep the ball on the ground 
because they've got so much power. Make one mistake and they'll take you out of 
the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
A misstep took Finley out of Friday's game. But Abbott took a huge step forward 
in regaining lost confidence. "When a starter gets knocked out early, he can 
brood because he's got to wait to get back out there, but a reliever might get 
a chance the next day," Lachemann said. "In that sense, it did work out good. 
We're not tickled about what happened, and we're glad Chuck's injury isn't 
serious, but it may all work out for the best." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Finley, who suffered a sprained right ankle when he fell on a 
rain-slickened step Friday, was told to rest for several days. X-rays showed no 
serious damage and the swelling subsided by Friday night. The Angels probably 
will recall a pitcher from triple-A Edmonton if Finley doesn't recover by his 
next scheduled start Wednesday, and if Friday's start takes a toll on Jim 
Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
"It started raining real hard and we were dodging under the overhang," said 
Finley, who, as a left-hander strides onto his right foot during his delivery. 
"We went down three steps and the last was maybe a half-step. I was going along 
and the next thing I know, I'm on my back and I see skyscrapers and white teeth 
in Bert Blyleven's ugly old face." 
</P>
<P>
Finley has sprained the ankle twice before in similar circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Anderson's third-inning ground out produced his first RBI of the season. 
It scored Donnie Hill, who had doubled and taken third on a fielding error by 
left fielder George Bell. . . . Kirk McCaskill and his wife, Dana, became 
parents of their first child Thursday when 10-pound, 9-ounce Riley Nicholas was 
born at 6 p.m. Mother, father and son are doing well. "He came out a kid, not a 
baby," said McCaskill, who remained in California for the birth and rejoined 
the club Friday. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill is scheduled to pitch today after missing a turn because of stiffness 
in his right elbow. . . . Dante Bichette wasn't in the lineup Friday, only the 
second game he didn't start. "Dante needs a rest. He's been out there virtually 
the whole season," Manager Doug Rader said. "It's going to be very difficult 
juggling people around. Dante has the ability to be an everyday player. Whether 
he will be in literally every day, play 150, 155 games, remains to be seen." 
Only Chili Davis and Wally Joyner have started every game. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield singled in his starting debut and made one unofficial error. "In 
the hotel I called the bellboy and said, 'This is Dave Winfield of the New York 
Yankees,' and he said, 'What?' " Winfield said. "I said, 'Oh, the California 
Angels.' I have to get used to that." 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dick Schofield (strained hamstring since March 27) jogged at 
half-speed in California for the first time. . . . Bob McClure (sore left 
elbow) hasn't improved since throwing last Sunday and will be examined when the 
Angels return home.

A measure that would allow Illinois universities to pay student-athletes and 
would regulate athletic associations' investigations of college sports programs 
passed its first hurdle in the Illinois House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, universities could decide to pay student athletes a stipend of 
up to $250 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was sent to the Illinois Senate on a 71-37 vote. However, it would 
not apply to the current NCAA investigation of the University of Illinois 
basketball program and would only take effect if five other nearby states 
enacted similar laws.

THIS LEFT-HANDER IS UNDER THE GUN; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASEBALL: MAJOR LEAGUE SCOUTS ARE EAGER TO GET A READING ON UCLA'S DAVE 
ZANCANARO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are times when it looks as though a military platoon has been assigned to 
Jackie Robinson Stadium. Actually, they are units of major league baseball 
scouts, all with speed guns drawn and pointed through the backstop at UCLA 
pitcher Dave Zancanaro. 
</P>
<P>
Zancanaro's weapon? A 90-m.p.h. fastball and a change-up that tails away. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, it has been more like a stampede. The scouts, who have spent hours 
waiting for this hot prospect to pitch, will draw their guns during a game and 
run over to the bullpen to clock Zancanaro's warmup pitches. They take what 
they can get. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I would be playing center field, or (designated hitter), and the coach 
would have me warm up to relieve," Zancanaro said. "The scouts would follow me 
down to the bullpen and point those guns at me, and I just look at my pitching 
coach and shake my head. It's kind of a comedy thing. But it's flattering that 
all these scouts are here to see me." 
</P>
<P>
This is crunch time for Zancanaro, and it has little to do with UCLA's final 
examinations. As a junior, he is expected by baseball experts to be one of the 
first 10 players picked in major league baseball's amateur draft June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the scouts, though, it hasn't been easy to catch this 
left-hander's pitching act. Instead, they have seen him run down fly balls, 
hit, and, to their dismay, risk injury when he dives headfirst into a base. 
</P>
<P>
"It make the scouts cringe," said his father, also Dave Zancanaro. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the season, the Bruins had an abundance of pitching talent, so 
Zancanaro was a reliever. The plan was to use him in the outfield and then have 
him relieve in the seventh or eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, it worked. For example, in a game March 6 against Cal State 
Fullerton, Zancanaro started in center field, went three for five with five 
runs batted in, and pitched the last three innings, earning the victory. He has 
started 17 games as the designated hitter and 11 in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"At one game against Cal, UCLA was ahead, 7-5, when Cal started rallying," said 
his father. "David was playing center field, and UCLA had a pitcher warming up 
in the bullpen. Time out was called to change pitchers, and (Coach Gary) Adams 
had David warm up in the outfield with the right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
"When Cal scored a run to close within 7-6, David was brought in from center to 
pitch. They have done that a few other times and it was beginning to get a 
little trying and tough on David. So he was about to go to the coaches when 
they came and told him they weren't going to use him that way anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Simply, Zancanaro was tired. Realistically, because of injuries, Adams needed 
him as a starter. Since March 11, Zancanaro has been a regular in the rotation, 
and has raised his record to 10-5 with five saves and a 2.98 earned-run 
average. Moreover, he is still used as a designated hitter against right-handed 
pitchers, and has a .257 batting average with three home runs and 20 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
But Zancanaro has always been an all-around athlete. His father talks about how 
former Dodger left fielder Dusty Baker, who attended the same high school as 
Zancanaro -- Del Campo in Fair Oaks near Sacramento -- would run track before 
he played baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"So on an off-day, David decided to do that too, and he ran in a track meet," 
Zancanaro Sr. said. "He won four events -- the 100, 200, long jump and anchored 
the 400 relay." 
</P>
<P>
And in a prep baseball tournament after Zancanaro's senior year, he got 15 
hits, breaking the record of 11 held by major leaguers Steve Sax and Ricky 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Zancanaro wasn't drafted then, but he says he wouldn't have been ready anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to turn pro now, but then I just wasn't mature enough," he said. "I 
would like to pitch, and that's what the scouts are looking at me for. I like 
to start because it's like you have control of the game. But I like to relieve, 
also. And a few scouts have asked me if I would be interested in playing the 
outfield. I just want to play." 
</P>
<P>
Scouts turned their attention to Zancanaro after last summer when his team, the 
Auburn Cardinals of the Stan Musial League, won the West Regional and finished 
second in the league's championship series. Zancanaro hit three home runs in 
the regional, and was named most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Then, during UCLA's fall league, the scouts began to show up, and have never 
stopped. At one game, 10 members of the Dodger organization showed up. 
</P>
<P>
The irony of this is that scouts say they have been told by their clubs not to 
tout their prospects to the media because it makes it more difficult and more 
expensive for clubs to sign the player. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Zancanaro said the attention affected him a little. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't feel the pressure now," he said. "(Scouts) are only here because 
of what I have done in the past, and nothing will change that. I figure I'll 
just try my best and keep doing what I always have done." 
</P>
<P>
And the agents? 
</P>
<P>
"There's really nothing to talk to agents about yet and it's illegal to have 
one while you are playing college ball," Zancanaro said. "Besides, my dad can 
handle this. What's an agent going to get me at first, $5,000 more? It's not 
certain yet that I'll be drafted in the first round anyway. That's something we 
won't know until it happens." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Zancanaro has set his sights on UCLA making the NCAA tournament and 
the College World Series. Going into this weekend's final nonconference series 
against Nevada Las Vegas, the Bruins were 37-23. Zancanaro is scheduled to 
start today. 
</P>
<P>
Should the Bruins not make it to the College World Series, Zancanaro says he 
and his roommate, catcher Paul Ellis, will be home on June 4. Ellis leads the 
nation in home runs and is also considered a top prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be in bed," Zancanaro said, "just waiting for that phone to ring."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year after winning the city's first Stanley Cup title in 1989, the Calgary 
Flames were stunned in the first round of the playoffs to the Kings. The defeat 
ruined a season in which Calgary posted the second-best regular-season record 
in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
It prompted the firing of Coach Terry Crisp. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven days later, Friday, Doug Risebrough, already Calgary's assistant general 
manager, was given the additional duty of coaching the team. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp was criticized because he couldn't command his players' respect, but 
defenseman Al MacInnis said Risebrough won't have that problem. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question he's going to demand a lot," MacInnis said. "I respected 
him as a player, I respected him as a teammate. He was certainly one of the 
guys I looked up to when I broke into the league. I think a lot of guys are 
going to be looking forward to having him as a head coach." 
</P>
<P>
"A coach has to be himself and he can't be anything else but that," Risebrough 
said. "Certainly there's an evolution. I have not coached behind the bench. I 
have to find myself in a lot of ways. There's growth there and I'm willing to 
grow." 
</P>
<P>
Risebrough, 36, was a hard-nosed player for 14 seasons, nine with Montreal 
during which the Canadiens won four consecutive Stanley Cups. He was traded to 
Calgary before the 1982-83 season and remained with the club for five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
After retiring in 1987, he became an assistant under Crisp and last summer was 
named assistant to Fletcher. He will retain that job while coaching the team 
under a three-year contract approved on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an important day for me," Risebrough said.

Ryne Sandberg's record streak of 123 games without an error ended Friday night 
with a wild throw against the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg, the Chicago Cubs' Gold Glove second baseman, fielded a deflected 
ground ball by Eric Anthony in the fourth inning but threw wide of first 
baseman Mark Grace. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg successfully handled 582 consecutive chances without an error. His 
last error had come June 20 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Sandberg's streak 
set a major league record for infielders, excluding first basemen.

UPSET BY YANKEES' ROLE IN DEAL, ANGELS CONSIDER TAKING ACTION

The last word on the Dave Winfield trade has yet to be said. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are exploring avenues of redress against the New York Yankees for 
attempting to obstruct the deal, which was agreed upon last Friday but not 
settled until late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels were angered by New York's premature announcement, as well as 
attempts by Yankee principal owner George Steinbrenner to persuade the Angels 
to accept Roberto Kelly or Alvaro Espinoza as compensation for Mike Witt after 
Winfield challenged the Yankees' right to trade him. Steinbrenner also declared 
that he was not in favor of the deal made by his "baseball people." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are expected to file a formal grievance in the next few days. 
General Manager Mike Port hinted at the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard of things in the past being handled through the league or the 
commissioner's office -- if one were so inclined," Port said Friday from his 
Anaheim Stadium office. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to confirm the nature of the Yankees' efforts to restructure the deal, 
Port replied: "I would not be at liberty to comment. If I said yes, I could 
prejudice some things. If I said no, it might have impact on some things. I 
have to cut a wide swath." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Winfield agreed to a three-year contract extension potentially 
worth $9.1 million. He grounded out as a pinch-hitter Thursday during a 6-3 
loss to the Brewers in Milwaukee and was in the starting lineup for the first 
time Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Port reiterated his praise for the conduct of Winfield and Winfield's agent, 
Jeff Klein, in the days leading to the agreement, again conspicuously omitting 
the Yankees from that citation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Angels have no problem whatsoever with Dave Winfield or Jeff Klein," he 
said. "They were both forthright, businesslike and logical in the course of our 
negotiations. . . . The trade is over. Everything is properly consummated and 
so forth. We continue in our delight at having Dave Winfield with the Angels. 
Beyond that, well, one never knows."

Vietnam's Communist leaders, fast losing friends and funds as their socialist 
allies defect to capitalism, gave founding father Ho Chi Minh a loving but 
austere salute. The mood in Hanoi was somber as only a few foreign dignitaries 
attended a ceremony for the centenary of "Uncle Ho."

Myanmar's military government turned down a request by Rep. Stephen J. Solarz 
(D-N.Y.) to observe next week's parliamentary elections, saying he had made 
malicious attacks on the authorities and encouraged unrest. Solarz had asked to 
be allowed to visit polling booths and to meet Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the 
opposition National League for Democracy. She has been under house arrest since 
last July and is banned from taking part in the May 27 election.

</P>
<P>
Ricky Irby Sr., 29, could face the death penalty. Lake County Associate Judge 
Harry Hartel, who presided over a two-week, non-jury trial in Waukegan, Ill., 
set a sentencing hearing for June 29. Irby and the child's mother, Sheila 
Smith, were both charged in the death of Quinten Irby, who was 3 months old 
when he was force-fed sulfuric acid May 31, 1984. The infant lived for 27

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TV: A WITNESS FOR THE EXECUTION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executions on television? 
</P>
<P>
San Quentin says no. But logic demands it. 
</P>
<P>
No one, not even a condemned person, should be required to die in front of a TV 
camera. To die in relative privacy, beyond the view of the multitudes, should 
be a basic right accorded to everyone, no matter his or her crime. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is simply no good reason to continue forbidding televised 
executions in California when permission is given by the person to be executed. 
This has nothing to do with being for or against capital punishment. It has 
everything to do with good sense. 
</P>
<P>
As veteran reporter Rollin Post of KRON-TV in San Francisco notes about 
executions: "They're being done at the will of the public, they're being paid 
for by the public and they're public punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Logically, then, the public has the right to see them. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the death penalty should want to see executions carried out 
instead of keeping them hidden as if they were a source of shame instead of an 
expression of the public will. Moreover, those who believe that executions 
deter murder should not object to giving them the widest possible public 
exposure through TV. If they are right about deterrence, more exposure would 
lead to fewer murders. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, executions have already been televised, in a manner of speaking. An 
especially vivid example was the powerful depiction of a man dying in a gas 
chamber on Thursday night's episode of "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
As KCOP Channel 13 news director Jeff Wald notes, however: "Often times you see 
this simulated on entertainment programs, but this (TV at an execution) would 
be the reality of what's taking place." 
</P>
<P>
The issue is especially relevant in California these days, where polls show 
that a sizable majority of citizens favors the death penalty and where the 
capital-punishment bandwagon is crowded with gubernatorial candidates eager to 
demonstrate their toughness on violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
The televised-execution bandwagon is being driven by public-TV station KQED in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Every other facet of the justice system in California is open to cameras," 
said KQED public affairs director Michael Schwarz. "In what context can the 
state have a right to tell us we can't cover this?" 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added: "If we're prepared to say this is public policy, to say we 
support the death penalty, then we should be prepared to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
It was KQED whose March 15 request to videotape the scheduled execution of 
convicted killer Robert Alton Harris was rejected by San Quentin prison 
officials without explanation. As it turned out, Harris won a stay that at 
least for now is keeping him from the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Then on May 10, KQED filed suit in U.S. District Court, asking that Gov. 
Deukmejian and San Quentin Warden Daniel B. Vasquez be required to rescind 
present policy on press coverage of executions on grounds that it's 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that executions be witnessed by specific officials in 
addition to at least 12 "reputable citizens." By tradition, at least 14 members 
of the news media have been allowed to attend each execution, and in 
California's last execution in 1967, reporters were allowed to sketch and take 
notes while witnessing the death of Aaron Mitchell from outside the gas 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
In February, however, San Quentin said it would prohibit witnesses from taking 
notes, sketching or using recording equipment and cameras. 
</P>
<P>
And then KQED got the word specifically about TV cameras. Why the TV ban? "To 
ensure the security and integrity of the ritual," explained San Quentin 
spokesman Vernell Crittendon. 
</P>
<P>
Come again? 
</P>
<P>
Just how the "security" and "integrity" of a public execution can be affected 
by the presence of a TV camera, or notebooks, sketch pads, recorders and still 
cameras for that matter, is a bit fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
TV would be intrusive? Hardly. Some of today's TV gear is very unobtrusive, and 
experience shows that cameras in the courtroom are as unnoticed as pieces of 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
And what's to intrude upon, anyway? The decorum of the event? The TV camera 
would turn a tasteful gassing into a circus? 
</P>
<P>
Quite the contrary. Frequently criticized for sanitizing life, TV in this 
instance would perform a service by showing unsoftened reality, a reality 
endorsed by the public. 
</P>
<P>
"It can take 10 to 15 minutes for someone to die," said Peter Shaplen, the KRON 
news producer who was assigned to plan coverage at the prison leading up to the 
execution of Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Shaplen opposes televising actual executions, though. "I've covered death in 
places like El Salvador," he said. "But those were combatants. In the case of 
an execution, it can appear to be barbaric." 
</P>
<P>
It is what it is. 
</P>
<P>
Media critic Ben Bagdikian winces at the thought. "The idea of television at an 
execution is morbid, and I think it's horrible," said Bagdikian, a professor in 
the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley and a foe of capital 
punishment. "I think television has an insatiable appetite for spectacle and 
physical melodrama, and this is the ultimate one." 
</P>
<P>
KQED would create no spectacle or drama that doesn't already exist, Schwarz 
promises. "The camera operator would have orders not to move the camera. It 
would act as a neutral witness, bringing the event directly to the viewer. It 
would see what your eye would see from the witness room, no more or no less. 
And we would put this on late at night and precede it with a warning." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Schwarz emphasizes: "We're not taking a position on the death 
penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Schwarz also destroys the "executions-are-too-gruesome-for-TV" argument. "Does 
that mean we shouldn't have covered the Vietnam War, that we shouldn't have 
shown young soldiers getting their brains blown out on the front lines, or the 
murders of John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy? Why are these images more palatable 
than an execution?" 
</P>
<P>
Bagdikian fears that, instead of increasing sensitivity, televised executions 
in most cases would desensitize the public and "enforce the idea that an eye 
for an eye is what criminal justice should really be about." As for televised 
executions being a deterrent, he argues: "In England they used to hang and 
flail citizens publicly, and all it did was increase savagery." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is San Francisco Examiner reporter Larry Hatfield, assigned by 
his paper to be an official media witness to the Harris execution. It would 
have been deja vu for him. 
</P>
<P>
As a student journalist at the University of Iowa nearly 30 years ago, Hatfield 
was a media witness at Iowa's last execution, the hanging of Charles Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"It took 17 minutes before he was declared officially dead, and it's something 
I'll never forget," he said. "I heard two sounds. One was the door itself 
falling, which was a loud crack -- and about as loud was the crack of the guy's 
neck. It made me opposed to capital punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Hatfield is ambivalent about televising executions. "Everyone ought to know 
it's the people of California who are killing people and not some unseen prison 
warden," he said. "On the other hand, if it's on television, it will be like 
everything else on television, accepted and not quite real." 
</P>
<P>
Real or unreal, however, the public has a right -- perhaps even an obligation 
-- to watch it. And TV is the way to bring it to them.

1 MAN, 2 PAINTINGS: $160.6 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retired Japanese industrialist Ryoei Saito spent $160.6 million on art this 
week and now lays claim to the two most expensive paintings in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The 74-year-old Saito, chairman emeritus of Japan's second-largest paper 
company, on Tuesday paid $82.5 million at Christie's for Vincent van Gogh's 
melancholy "Portrait of Dr. Gachet." 
</P>
<P>
He followed that with Thursday's purchase at Sotheby's of Pierre Auguste 
Renoir's shimmering "Au Moulin de la Galette" for $78.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The final price eclipsed the pre-sale estimate of $40 million to $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
After the Van Gogh purchase, Saito said it had cost $33 million more than he 
expected, but that obviously did not deter him from pursuing the Renoir. He 
reportedly told his representative at the auctions that no price was too high 
to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"They are world-class, wonderful works," he said of his new purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Saito said the paintings will probably spend several years locked up in a 
storeroom before being put on public display -- perhaps in New York's 
Metropolitan Museum, or in a small museum in his home prefecture. 
</P>
<P>
While Saito is casual now about spending millions in a single stroke, he 
resigned the presidency of the Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co. eight years ago 
to take personal responsibility for its sagging fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1980s, the business had revived sufficiently to allow Saito to move 
into collecting circles again. But he says he owns only a few artworks, 
including a Chagall and an Andrew Wyeth painting.

STATE ARTS GROUP REPORTEDLY WITHDRAWS NEA PROPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An association of state arts councils that floated a controversial plan to 
split up the National Endowment for the Arts and hand over most of its money to 
state art agencies distanced itself from the plan Friday, with top officials 
reportedly telling arts supporters the proposal had been "withdrawn." 
</P>
<P>
The executive director of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, 
Jonathan Katz, was reportedly away from the organization's Washington 
headquarters on Friday, and most of Katz's top aides were said to be 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
But it was learned that a telephone conference call involving the group's 
five-member executive committee ended late Thursday with a consensus that the 
controversial plan should be withdrawn from consideration and that the group is 
officially opposed to a legislative proposal based on it that was made 
Wednesday by two Republican congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
The national assembly is one of 17 arts groups that are scheduled to 
participate in meeting starting Tuesday on Capitol Hill to try to develop a 
consensus solution to the NEA's political difficulties. Distancing itself from 
the controversial plan to break up the agency -- or abandoning the effort 
completely -- had been urged on the assembly by key arts supporters for the 
last several days. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo -- obtained by reporters last week -- that represented itself as 
summarizing the national assembly's position, the organization's board 
advocated shifting 60% of all NEA money to state arts councils -- triple the 
proportion now sent to them. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal could radically alter the system of public arts funding throughout 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Gordon, director of the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, said the 
national assembly executive committee concluded that it was inappropriate to 
propose any formula to reapportion the NEA budget. "To even discuss that 
percentage is to accept the fact that the endowment would have to be changed," 
said Gordon, an executive committee member. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any discussion of percentage would be inappropriate. This is a very 
sensitive subject and it's one we are all very concerned about. I think there 
has been too much misunderstanding and misinterpretation already." 
</P>
<P>
Reps. Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) and Tom Coleman (R-Mo.) proposed that the NEA's 
$171.5 million budget be split up exactly as proposed in the national assembly 
formula -- with restrictions on the kinds of art NEA can support. The GOP plan 
was almost identical to the national assembly proposal described in a 
memorandum last week written by written by Mary Hayes, director of the New York 
State Council on the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday morning, the national assembly appeared to be taking pains to 
distance itself from the plan originally attributed to it. Gordon said the Hays 
memo that created the controversy misstated decisions made by the national 
assembly board and characterized as a proposal for legislative consideration a 
discussion that had been far more general, less final and less specific. 
</P>
<P>
"The board of NASAA did not make a proposal," said Gordon. "We firmly believe 
that a strong and healthy NEA is what's best for the arts. The language of the 
memo perhaps does not fully convey the context of the discussion. There is a 
considerable amount of misinterpretation, even in that memo."

POP BEAT / SOUND &amp; VISION: PLAYBOY'S 'HOT ROCKS': NOT-READY-FOR-MTV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you thought MTV was sexist, brace yourself. 
</P>
<P>
The Playboy Channel has stepped forward with a show that makes MTV look almost 
prudish. It's "Playboy's Hot Rocks" -- a new, hourlong program spotlighting 
uncensored, not-ready-for-MTV music videos, complete with partial or 
full-frontal nudity, as seen usually only over on that naughty continent of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Bee Gees, for example, got plenty of publicity on "Entertainment Tonight" 
recently by feigning surprise that their steamy "Body Guard" video had been 
turned down for airplay on MTV, VH-1 and other Victorian outlets. 
</P>
<P>
But the curious can catch that clip and others like it on "Hot Rocks," complete 
with titillating comments between songs from the va-va-voom veejay, Miss March, 
Deborah Driggs. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere, which aired several times this month, also includes uncensored 
Quincy Jones, Alice Cooper and 2 Live Crew; a look at musical sex-meister Barry 
White; and an "exclusive" interview with male-bimbo rocker Tim Karr. Scheduled 
guests for the second episode, airing June 2: the Red Hot Chili Peppers. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Playboy Channel can clearly get more explicit in what it shows, the 
pervasive attitude in many of the rap and rock videos routinely shown on MTV 
differs little. This month's edition of Sound &amp; Vision -- where current pop 
clips are rated on a 0-100 scale -- takes a voyeuristic peek into the pop video 
bedroom, and finds only one "adult"-themed clip that also has an adult point of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
VID PICK OF THE MONTH: 
</P>
<P>
The The's "Kingdom of Rain." (Director: Tim Pope.) Like several other clips in 
this lot, "Rain" sports a bewigged blond woman in a bedroom, but there's a 
universe of difference in how it moodily delineates the complexities of emotion 
in a long-standing, free-falling love affair. While Angst-ridden singer Matt 
Johnson gazes into his well-furnished fish tank, his neglected lover sits at 
his feet, making faces that disturbingly alternate between fake-seductiveness 
and all-out rage. Remarkably rich and potently cinematic, this video -- which 
has been airing for many months -- is notable now for another reason: Johnson's 
unseen duet partner, representing the female point of view, is the 
suddenly-a-superstar Sinead O'Connor. 93 
</P>
<P>
GAMMA RAY ROT: 
</P>
<P>
Billy Idol's "Cradle of Love." (D: David Fincher.) An all-out reverse rape 
fantasy. Shy guy gets mauled by gorgeous woman crawling around on all fours 
(shades of the devil-doll in "Trilogy of Terror"!); after she's had her way 
with him, her real date for the evening knocks on the door. 18 
</P>
<P>
Heart's "All I Wanna Do is Make Love to You." (D: Andy Morahan.) Yet another 
insatiable woman courteously picks up a pretty-boy hitchhiker (which decade is 
this?) and takes him to a motel for one night of sin. Ann Wilson as the distaff 
Brando in a "Last Tango" reversal? Hardly. Danger disregarded, this is played 
up for all the phony romanticism it's worth. (By the way, yes, they're still 
electronically "squeezing" poor Wilson into a size 9.) 7 
</P>
<P>
Alice Cooper's "Poison (uncensored)." (D: Nigel Dick.) On MTV you get bondage 
and death by poisoning; on the Playboy Channel you get all that and breasts 
too. But never in the same takes as the women's pouty faces. This suggests 
different models were used for the body shots, but it's indicative of the 
extent to which guys like Cooper separate women's heads from their torsos. 5 
</P>
<P>
2 Live Crew's "Me So Horny." (D: Tass Sheik.) Him so sexist. Luke Skyywalker -- 
er, Luther Campbell -- is "a dog in heat," and to prove it, he lifts his leg as 
if to urinate on the camera and, by extension, us. Self-satisfied as a recently 
relieved cocker spaniel, Campbell reclines in bed, reminding a young woman (who 
looks appropriately depressed) that he made her the sex-toy she is today. He 
also mocks her parents' naivete and boasts that he'll soon dump her. Obscenity 
trials aside, any man who could invest so much braggadocio in the using and 
discarding of women is already in a jail -- of his own making. 0

at the site along the Rose Parade route, but the faculty and many of the 
remaining students will switch to the college's Big Sandy, Tex., campus in the 
fall.

<P>
Tkach, who has led the church and college since the 1986 death of 
founder-President Herbert W. Armstrong, announced last December that the 
campuses would be merged because of the anticipated expense of seeking 
educational accreditation for the schools in two states. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials originally said that extension courses might be offered at the 
Pasadena campus in the next school year, but a spokesman said this week that 
the plan was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
After Aug. 1, various departments and support services of the Worldwide Church 
of God and Ambassador Foundation, which have occupied only 7 acres of the 
40-acre complex, will begin moving into the vacated college facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The church, regarded by mainstream Christianity as sectarian in many beliefs 
and relatively authoritarian in style, has 95,000 members in 120 countries. It 
is best known publicly for its Plain Truth magazine, its syndicated television 
program, "The World Tomorrow," and its concert series at Ambassador Auditorium 
in Pasadena.

NCC CONDEMNS COLUMBUS' 'INVASION' OF NEW WORLD

<P>
The National Council of Churches, ending a three-day meeting here Friday, voted 
to condemn Christopher Columbus' "invasion" of the New World in 1492. 
</P>
<P>
A celebration is "not an appropriate observation of this anniversary," the 
council's governing board, representing 32 denominations with 42 million 
members, said. The resolution, approved after more than two hours of debate, 
cites "genocide, slavery, 'ecocide' and exploitation of the wealth of the land" 
as the bitter fruit inherited by "the descendants of the survivors of the . . . 
invasion." 
</P>
<P>
"The church, with few exceptions, accompanied and legitimized this 
exploitation," the council added. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, "A Faithful Response to the 500th Anniversary of the Arrival of 
Christopher Columbus," was proposed by the Rev. George Tinker, an Osage Indian 
who teaches at the Illif School of Theology in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing Columbus really discovered was that he was lost," Tinker said. 
"American people have so digested the myth of American history that they have 
lost sight of the truth -- the pain of so many people who live on the 
continent." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution is intended to influence next year's official yearlong 
celebrations marking the 500th anniversary of Columbus' fleet reaching the 
Caribbean islands. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt by Episcopal Bishop David Reed of Louisville, Ky., to soften the 
resolution failed. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of us find it hard to state that this is not a time for celebration," 
Reed told the 220 board members. "There have been so many things over the past 
500 years to thank God for." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph D'Andrea, the vice consul of Italy in Pittsburgh, said he understood the 
intent of the resolution but thought the anniversary should celebrate "the 
spirit of America" and its accomplishments rather than dwell on the landing's 
negative effects. 
</P>
<P>
But the church council noted that "theological justifications for destroying 
native religious beliefs while forcing conversion to European forms of 
Christianity demanded a submission from the newly converted that facilitated 
their total conquest."

KEITA: A MEDITATIVE AFRICAN ALTERNATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Salif Keita's impressive local debut before a capacity audience at the Music 
Machine on Thursday struck another blow against the notion that all African 
music sounds alike. 
</P>
<P>
But the Paris-based singer, an albino descendant of the 13th-Century warrior 
king who founded the West African nation of Mali, did more than just add a new 
regional twist. 
</P>
<P>
The devilishly intricate arrangements and cross-melodies delivered by Keita and 
his superb 10-piece backing band in two one-hour sets ran counter to the 
buoyant groove aesthetic characteristic of much African music. 
</P>
<P>
A devotional, meditative flavor pervaded the performance, one reinforced by 
Keita's habit of starting most of the songs with his hands clasped in front of 
him as if praying. His astonishing voice didn't lessen the effect -- Keita 
frequently started his vocal phrases with a pure, piercing high note before 
spiraling down with Islamic-influenced melodies. 
</P>
<P>
Keita's hybrid blending African roots with sophisticated European pop enabled 
the balafon (an African marimba) to co-exist harmoniously with electric 
keyboards. It was demanding but rewarding music -- no surprise that Miles Davis 
and Carlos Santana are reputedly big fans -- and Keita's performance 
demonstrated he's clearly opening up new dimensions to African music. DON

POLITICALLY CORRECT, POLITELY PUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Integrity may be the most discussed of rock 'n' roll virtues, and may be also 
the hardest to find. To Bruce Springsteen, integrity may mean the fortitude to 
play four-hour shows; to Metallica, uncompromising music. To Public Enemy it 
may mean freedom of speech. All these artists, though, work within the 
established system, plying their art for massive multinational corporations 
whose goals are almost certainly not their own. On the profit-loss sheet, 
integrity is just another public relations expense. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Country Club on Wednesday, a rock 'n' roll Diogenes could have found 
an honest band. 
</P>
<P>
Fugazi, a Washington post-punk band made up from the shards of the legendary 
hard-core band Minor Threat, is politically correct to an excruciating degree. 
They run their own record company; they refuse to play a show or sell an album 
that costs more than $6 (the Country Club charged less than half its usual 
admission); they don't eat meat, drink nor take drugs, sing sexist or racist 
lyrics, nor perform at clubs that exclude minors. 
</P>
<P>
When the fire marshals showed up Wednesday, Fugazi encouraged the mostly punk 
audience to find seats -- and the audience did. When they felt the show was 
over, they stopped playing, and the audience understood that the institution of 
encores was probably politically incorrect too. Punk rage, we're used to; punk 
politeness is something new. 
</P>
<P>
All this integrity would go to waste if Fugazi didn't rock, but they did, in a 
way similar to the first wave of British post-punk groups -- PiL, Gang of Four, 
Magazine -- without being at all derivative, as if they'd found the funk, dub 
and Beefheart influences all on their own. They seem very real. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Minor Threat singer Ian McKaye, who with the possible exception of Henry 
Rollins is the best frontman in American punk, coiled ferally on stage, his 
voice escaping him as if only with great effort. The sound was full and clean, 
scrubbed-up, drony funk with hooks. The greatest-band-in-the-world of the week.

40% OF BIG S&amp;LS FALL SHY OF CAPITAL STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From American Banker 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 40% of the country's 300 largest thrifts failed to meet minimum 
regulatory capital requirements at the end of last year, according to a survey 
by American Banker, the trade paper. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say this means the thrift industry is still a long way from returning 
to health. 
</P>
<P>
"The rich will get richer and everyone is scheduled for euthanasia -- with 
pain," said Richard Pratt, chairman of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Capital and a 
former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 239 of the top 300 thrifts at the end of 1989 were 
members of the Savings Assn. Insurance Fund. Almost half these institutions did 
not have the minimum of $3 of "core capital" for every $100 of assets, as 
required by federal regulations. In fact, 62 had negative core capital. A 
thrift's capital is the cash it must have to serve as a cushion for any 
problems. It is normally measured as a percentage of its total loan portfolio 
and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
The survey included 61 thrifts that were members of the Bank Insurance Fund. 
Virtually all of them had capital ratios exceeding 3%. The Bank Insurance Fund 
historically has mandated tougher capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"It is safe to predict more seizures the remainder of the year," said industry 
expert John Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 2,878 Savings Assn.-insured thrifts in the country, about 600 more will 
disappear over the next few years, predicted Henry Peltz, thrift analyst at 
Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be very difficult for these undercapitalized thrifts to meet 
the capital guidelines," he said. "The opportunity to raise capital in the 
public markets is extremely limited." 
</P>
<P>
Although many thrifts are restructuring and struggling to meet the new capital 
rules, Peltz noted, "The capital requirements are only going to get stiffer 
between now and 1994." 
</P>
<P>
For some thrifts, it is already too late. Thirty-five of the top 300 thrifts 
have been seized by regulators and are wards of the Resolution Trust Corp., a 
federal agency created to dispose of assets of thrifts taken over by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that total deposits of the top 300 thrifts fell 1.9% last 
year, while their assets declined 6.4%. Peltz says shedding assets was 
"difficult in this market because others are also downsizing, so the prices you 
get for assets are not good." 
</P>
<P>
The core capital ratios in the survey ranged from a high of 22.1% for Citicorp 
Savings Bank of Washington, D.C., to a negative 122% for Sandia Federal Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. of Albuquerque, N.M. Sandia Federal was seized by federal 
regulators early last year. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp Savings of Washington is one of four thrifts owned by Citicorp, the 
nation's largest banking company. Citicorp's Illinois and Florida thrifts had 
core capital ratios of 15.6% and 13.8% respectively, ranking them second and 
third in this category. 
</P>
<P>
Great American Bank, San Diego, typifies the problems faced by many of the 
undercapitalized thrifts. After a $263.4-million loss in 1989, Great American 
lost an additional $1.2 million in the first quarter of this year. Most of the 
losses were caused by problem loans in Texas and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's capital plan calls for it to raise $350 million in new 
capital. Analysts say its chances of doing so are slim. The company is shopping 
for a merger partner or a cash infusion and is trying to shed assets, including 
its real estate development company. 
</P>
<P>
Assets at California Federal Bank dropped about $2.6 billion in 1989. The Los 
Angeles thrift last year sold more than $900 million in mortgage-backed 
securities, its credit card portfolio and its headquarters building. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said these moves were an attempt to raise additional capital, while 
also shrinking assets to fit CalFed's capital base. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Los Angeles undertook a major financial 
restructuring in 1989 to strengthen capital. The company eliminated $242 
million of goodwill and exchanged debt for equity. It also lopped off $1.6 
billion from its loan portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The American Banker core capital ratio uses total assets instead of tangible 
assets, which are total assets minus deferrals and intangible assets. For most 
of the thrifts listed, the American Banker ratio will be 0.05 to 0.15 
percentage points lower than the ratio calculated by the Office of Thrift 
Supervision.

PIC 'N' SAVE, FIGHTING TAKEOVER, PUTS ITSELF ON BLOCK; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: SKEPTICAL ANALYSTS SAY THE EFFORT APPEARS HALF-HEARTED AND MAY BE 
JUST AN EFFORT TO PERSUADE SHAREHOLDERS THAT IT IS MOVING TO BOOST THE STOCK 
PRICE. 
</P>

<P>
Pic 'N' Save officials, trying to blunt a persistent takeover threat, on Friday 
launched what some analysts called a half-hearted effort to sell the company. 
</P>
<P>
The close-out retail chain said it asked its investment bankers to contact 
prospective buyers. At the same time, Pic 'N' Save maintained that few buyers 
would be able to pay a fair price for the company because takeover financing 
for retail chains has dried up. 
</P>
<P>
Pic 'N' Save also said it would open its confidential financial records to 
bidders only if they agree to a long list of restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that, rather than really trying to find a buyer, company 
officials seem more interested in persuading shareholders that they are trying 
their best to strengthen Pic 'N' Save's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to maintain control of the company, and this is the way to do it," 
said Marcy Koory, an analyst with Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Polian in Omaha, 
Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Koory said it appears that Girard Partners, an investment group led by La Jolla 
financier David H. Batchelder, is gaining in its effort to unseat Pic 'N' 
Save's board. Girard is seeking consent from shareholders to form a new 
five-member Pic 'N' Save board dominated by Batchelder and his partners. The 
group says it would buy Pic 'N' Save itself or auction it off to another 
bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Girard has disclosed acquiring 6.7% of Pic 'N' Save's stock, and on Monday the 
investment group said that it won the support of a key ally, Bill M. Thomas. A 
former executive vice president of Dominguez-based Pic 'N' Save, Thomas is 
believed to be its biggest individual shareholder, with 4% of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder declined to comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis B. Merrifield III, chairman and chief executive of Pic 'N' Save, promised 
that the company would make "an aggressive" effort to find a buyer. But he 
asserted in an interview that there is little prospect that Girard or another 
buyout specialist could come up with the financing to pay a fair price. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he said, the best prospect to acquire Pic 'N' Save at an attractive 
price would be a financially strong "strategic" buyer such as another big 
retail chain or a firm in a related line of business. 
</P>
<P>
Merrifield said that since Girard announced its initial investment in Pic 'N' 
Save on April 11, "we have not received to date a single expression of interest 
from any other party" about a buyout. 
</P>
<P>
He said the restrictions on access to the company's confidential data are 
intended to avoid opening bidding "to speculators who would buy (Pic 'N' Save 
shares) at the cheapest possible price." 
</P>
<P>
"Girard Partners' objective," he said, "is not to pay a full and fair price." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Pic 'N' Save would require anyone who reviews its records 
to avoid acquiring any more of the company's stock for three years unless it 
does so with an all-cash offer or the consent of its outside directors. 
Investors also would be barred from waging a proxy fight for the company. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to put a roadblock up for Girard Partners," said Sarah Stack, 
an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But an analyst for one of the company's biggest institutional investors called 
Friday's announcement a "positive step." It signals that management "is aware" 
of the disenchantment among many shareholders, said Betty Keppel of the 
Wisconsin Investment Board. 
</P>
<P>
Pic 'N' Save's stock climbed in heavy over-the-counter trading Friday. It 
closed at $13.875, up 87.5 cents, but traded as high as $14.375 while 1.65 
million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
The company has 190 stores in 12 states that specialize in close-out and other 
discount merchandise.

STRAPPED, PAN AM WANTS TO UNLOAD NORTHEAST SHUTTLE; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE PROFITABLE LINE SHOULD BRING $300 MILLION. DONALD TRUMP IS 
CONSIDERING THE SALE OF HIS SHUTTLE AS WELL.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cash-starved Pan Am Corp., parent of Pan American World Airways, on Friday put 
its profitable Northeast shuttle up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle, an airline within an airline that flies New York-Washington and 
New York-Boston routes, is said to be worth about $300 million. It is just the 
latest in a long series of assets that Pan Am, once a proud symbol of the 
United States overseas, has been forced to sell or consider selling in order to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
The airline company has retained the New York investment house of Kidder, 
Peabody &amp; Co. to help in the sale of the shuttle, which is Pan Am's only 
profitable operation. 
</P>
<P>
A Pan Am filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said the 
company is determined to pursue the "possible sale of, or other commercial 
transaction involving, the Pan Am shuttle." 
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the company is contemplating the action, along with 
other asset sales, "to provide additional liquidity to support operations of 
its principal subsidiary, Pan American World Airways." 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am also reiterated in the SEC filing that it believes it must merge with 
another airline in order to remain viable. "In the longer term, the corporation 
believes that Pan Am must be part of a larger network in order to add traffic 
to support its route structure and must obtain financial resources to support 
its operation. Management . . . continues to explore possible opportunities to 
address these objectives." 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am's attempt to buy Northwest Airlines failed last year. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, which has about $90 million in cash, said earlier this week that its 
cash position had been halved in the first quarter of 1990. Although it had 
major losses in the quarter, Pan Am expects gains during the busy transatlantic 
travel season this summer. Last year, travelers avoided Pan American in droves 
after the terrorist bombing and crash of Pan Am Flight 103 at Lockerbie, 
Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle announcement creates an interesting situation. There are two 
competing shuttle services in the Northeast, Pan Am's and the Trump Shuttle, 
which New York financier Donald J. Trump bought last year from bankrupt Eastern 
Airlines for $365 million. Pan Am has about 53% of the market on the routes. 
While the shuttle operations are profitable, the business is not growing. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, who is also believed to be in need of cash, said two weeks ago that he 
would sell the shuttle if he could get the right price. He said in an interview 
at the time that he would consider about $600 million a fair price, which 
airline observers said is much higher than he is likely to get. 
</P>
<P>
But with both shuttle operations on the auction block, the value of each will 
decline, airline analysts said. "Whoever has an interest in buying a shuttle 
operation," said Hans J. Plickert, an analyst with the Transportation Group, an 
affiliate of the Paine Webber brokerage, "has a golden opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the Pan Am Shuttle would not include any of the leased airplanes 
Pan Am uses on the routes. All that a buyer would get for its money would be 
airport gates and landing slots. Pan Am has also been trying to sell its 
intra-German service, which operates shuttle-type flights between a number of 
German cities and West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Pan Am sold its New York headquarters building, a hotel chain and its 
valuable Pacific routes.

SHEARSON EXPECTED TO SPLIT INTO PAIR OF OPERATING UNITS;

<P>
Shearson Lehman Hutton, charting a new course after bruising losses and 
management turmoil, is expected soon to create separate units for its principal 
businesses of investment banking and retail brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
The investment firm, a unit of American Express, may give the new retail 
brokerage division the Shearson name, people close to the firm said Friday. The 
new investment banking division may be called Lehman Bros., after the respected 
investment house acquired by Shearson in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization is intended to bring the divisions closer to their 
clientele, and, analysts say, to further distance the firm from travails that 
began after the 1987 stock market crash. The move is also a further repudiation 
of Shearson's 1980s strategy of fast growth and diversification. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson reported nearly $1 billion in losses in the first quarter, including a 
$630-million charge to restructure operations. It has recently closed 67 branch 
offices and cut its work force by about 2,000, to roughly 33,500. In Southern 
California, Shearson merged branches in Pasadena, San Diego and La Jolla into 
other branches in those cities. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization, made public in a Wall Street research report this week, may 
not be announced for two or three weeks, and is still subject to change, a 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
The new divisions will report to a new holding company, which will probably be 
called Shearson Lehman Holdings Inc. or SLH Holdings Inc. Shearson's Boston Co. 
money-management unit will report to the holding company. 
</P>
<P>
The new investment banking unit, which will also include trading operations, is 
likely to be headed by Sherman R. Lewis Jr., current head of investment 
banking, and Richard S. Fuld Jr., head of "capital markets" operations. These 
operations include many employees from the old Lehman Bros. firm. 
</P>
<P>
The new brokerage unit is likely to remain under the leadership of Hardwick 
Simmons and Joseph J. Plumeri II. 
</P>
<P>
With the reorganization, Shearson would more closely reflect the organization 
of parent American Express, which is decentralized and divided according to 
lines of business. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization would further obscure Shearson's ties to E.F. Hutton, the 
once-high-flying retail brokerage that Shearson absorbed in early 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Some on Wall Street are speculating that American Express is tidying up 
Shearson with plans to sell it. But this week an American Express spokesman 
denied the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
While the reorganization again highlights the firm's transformation, it would 
be a relatively minor change compared to others Shearson has made recently. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to staff cutbacks, Shearson this year replaced chief executive 
Peter A. Cohen with Howard L. Clark Jr., a former American Express official. 
American Express, which owns 61% of Shearson, recently agreed to buy the 
remaining shares. And the diversified financial services company has been 
compelled to inject another $1 billion in capital into Shearson. 
</P>
<P>
Michael L. Goldstein, an analyst with the Sanford C. Bernstein investment firm 
in New York, said he looked favorably on the reorganization plan, asserting 
that history has shown that building big brokerage operations does not bring 
economies of scale. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein said reviving the Lehman Bros. name "could have some positive 
impact."

EIGHT INTERESTED IN COLUMBIA PORTFOLIO; 
</P>
<P>
JUNK BONDS: IN A SEPARATE ANNOUNCEMENT, THE TROUBLED S&amp;L SAYS IT IS BEING 
INVESTIGATED BY THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION.

<P>
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan, struggling to survive amid the recent plunge in 
its junk bonds, has narrowed to eight the potential buyers of its troubled 
high-yield portfolio, sources close to the thrift said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Beverly Hills-based thrift disclosed in a public filing that 
the federal Office of Thrift Supervision is conducting an investigation that 
"parallels" a probe of Columbia being conducted by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office. Columbia said the investigation is 
being done "from a thrift regulatory standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
The parties interested in buying Columbia's junk bonds generally include groups 
of investors, the sources said. Interested investors include the New York 
banking firm Bankers Trust, the wealthy Pritzker family of Chicago and General 
Electric Capital, the Stamford, Conn.-based finance arm of General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia, whose collection of junk bonds and certain preferred stock was worth 
$2.9 billion on March 31, declined to comment Friday. So did its former chief 
executive, Thomas Spiegel, who is helping to sell the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives for General Electric Capital and Bankers Trust also declined 
comment. Pritzker representatives could not reached. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia was the largest investor among savings and loans in risky junk bonds, 
which pay holders high interest to compensate for additional risk. Last year's 
thrift bailout bill required Columbia and other S&amp;Ls to sell their bonds 
within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past year Columbia's junk bonds have fallen by some $1 billion in 
value because of recession fears, financial problems suffered by issuers and 
other factors. As a result, Columbia has posted heavy losses, is now insolvent 
and risks seizure by regulators unless it can unload the junk bonds and bolster 
its capital position. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia disclosed in March that its entire portfolio was for sale. Investor 
interest is said to have picked up in recent weeks because the junk bond market 
has recovered somewhat. Whether regulators approve any sale, however, depends 
largely on how the deal is financed, something Columbia alluded to in a recent 
public filing with the thrift regulatory agency. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia has said it would finance any transaction, thus allowing buyers to put 
up less cash. Regulators, however, are said to be adamant that Columbia 
demonstrate that any such financing deal carry no risk of default. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the OTS investigation, Columbia said it is "in the very early 
stages." It also said the probe "relates to certain expenses and activities of 
former association officers." 
</P>
<P>
SEC investigators and prosecutors are known to be looking at whether Drexel 
Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street firm that collapsed earlier this year, and 
Michael Milken, its former junk-bond financier, improperly induced thrift 
officers into buying certain junk bond issues. They also are said to be 
interested in business dealings between Milken and Columbia executives. 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, Columbia paid $4 million in bonuses to senior 
executives last year desite losing $591.1 million. In addition, Spiegel, who 
left Columbia Dec. 31, paid back $600,000 of his 1988 compensation last 
November after regulators complained that it was excessive. Sources said, 
however, that the investigation does not center on the bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
OTS officials declined to comment on the investigation.

NBC Merges Production, Distribution Units: National Broadcasting Co. has merged 
its in-house production arm, NBC Productions, with its international program 
distribution unit, NBC International. The combination more typically reflects 
the structure of other production/distribution companies, said Executive Vice 
President John Agoglia, and would give each unit better access to the other's 
resources. NBC-P produces shows such as "Hardball," "Shannon's Deal" and 
"Mancuso, FBI."

BANKS TIGHTEN CREDIT RULES FOR SMALLER FIRMS; 
</P>
<P>
LOANS: A NEW SURVEY BACKS UP COMPLAINTS BY SMALL-BUSINESS OWNERS WHO SAY 
BORROWING MONEY IS GETTING TOUGHER.

A majority of large banks surveyed in May reported that they had tightened 
their standards for loans to small and medium-sized businesses in the first 
four months of this year, the Federal Reserve said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of 60 large banks surveyed nationally said they had made credit 
policies more stringent, with one in 10 reporting they had tightened 
considerably, the regulatory agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John LaFalce (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Small Business Committee, 
said the survey was the first hard evidence backing up complaints of a credit 
crunch from small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
He summoned regulators from the central bank, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to a June 6 hearing "to 
start exploring the extent of the problem and its ramifications." 
</P>
<P>
Regulators had told LaFalce's panel April 25 that they were unable to confirm 
that a lending squeeze had spread beyond the real estate industry. However, 
business owners, particularly from New England, said long-established sources 
of credit were drying up. 
</P>
<P>
"The survey indicates that the anecdotal information we were given at our 
hearing has a real basis in fact," LaFalce said. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last week, after a meeting between the three top federal banking 
regulators and the nation's largest bank trade association, Federal Reserve 
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan had said evidence of the credit crunch was "quite 
limited." 
</P>
<P>
But, seeking to prevent the squeeze from snowballing, Greenspan stressed in 
private remarks to officials of the American Bankers Assn. that bankers should 
continue to make sound loans. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's survey, lending officers said the primary reason for tightening 
lending policy was "a less favorable economic outlook." Second, was a 
deterioration in the performance of loans the bank had made previously. 
Pressure from regulators was also mentioned frequently. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to tightening standards for which loan applicants qualify, more 
than half the banks reported making the terms of loans they did make to 
medium-sized businesses more stringent, including requiring more collateral. 
</P>
<P>
About 30% said they had reduced the size of credit lines to middle-market 
firms. Also, on balance, banks reported a slightly wider spread between the 
interest rate they were charging businesses for loans and the banks own cost of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The 60 banks surveyed hold slightly less than a third of commercial banking's 
$2.9 trillion in assets.

GREAT AMERICAN WON'T SIGN UP CIRONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thrift regulator James M. Cirona, offered the chief executive job at troubled 
Great American Bank last week, won't be taking the position. 
</P>
<P>
Cirona, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, expressed 
strong interest in the Great American job, but he and the thrift's board could 
not agree on terms of an employment contract, sources close to the negotiations 
said Friday. Directors at San Diego-based Great American considered as 
excessive Cirona's compensation demands, totaling up to $1 million a year, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Cirona, 58, sought financial guarantees from Great American should the 
capital-weakened thrift be taken over by regulators. He also wanted 600,000 
shares of Great American stock, worth $1.125 million at current prices, and a 
lifetime pension of $250,000 for each year after his retirement, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Cirona, formerly the Western region's top S&amp;L regulator, nor Great 
American Bank officials would comment on Cirona's withdrawal from consideration 
for the job. Cirona's decision was outlined in a Federal Home Loan Bank staff 
bulletin dated Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Cirona's withdrawal left unclear whom Great American may try to hire to fill 
the chief executive slot now held by Gordon C. Luce, who is also chairman. 
Great American considered offering the job to its general counsel, Marc 
Sandstrom, and to board member and former Senior Vice President Thomas F. 
Carter, before deciding upon Cirona, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Luce had planned to announce his retirement at Great American's 
annual shareholders meeting on May 24, but that he may delay that announcement 
if no successor is decided upon by then. Luce, who turns age 65 in November, 
was unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring Cirona was designed to give Great American credibility with the federal 
Office of Thrift Supervision. Until the OTS was created last August, its 
examiners worked directly for Cirona. Now, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San 
Francisco's chief function is to supply credit to mortgage lenders in its 11th 
District, which includes California, Nevada and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Great American Bank needs that credibility given that it is operating under 
intense OTS scrutiny. Unless it can drastically shrink assets, raise $350 
million in outside capital or find a buyer for all or part of its assets by 
year-end, Great American may be seized. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy 1989 losses left Great American with a severely weakened capital 
position. Its so-called tangible capital of $128 million as of March 30 is 
about half the minimum amount required by regulators. Tangible capital is one 
measure of a thrift's financial cushion against losses. 
</P>
<P>
A look at Great American's first-quarter 1990 results released earlier this 
weak showed that its loan problems continue to deteriorate by several measures. 
The S&amp;L also disclosed that it is involved in a dispute with the OTS that 
could result in asset writedowns of up to $65 million in the second quarter, if 
the agency prevails. 
</P>
<P>
Cirona was also seen as an attractive hire because he has extensive experience 
running troubled thrifts. Before being named in 1983 to the Federal Home Loan 
Bank of San Francisco, the largest of the 12 regional home loan banks, Cirona 
was chief executive of the $2.6-billion First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 
of Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
That thrift was created through the consolidation of several troubled thrifts 
and received financial aid from the now-defunct Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corp.

DEVELOPMENT, TRANSPLANTS ARE KILLING OFF VALLEY OAKS; 
</P>
<P>
ENDANGERED SPECIES: THE MAJESTIC TREES THAT GAVE THOUSAND OAKS ITS NAME ARE 
SLOWLY DISAPPEARING FROM THE VENTURA COUNTY LANDSCAPE. 
</P>

<P>
The great valley oak trees, which inspired the name of Thousand Oaks and for 
centuries dotted the countryside from Ojai to Simi Valley, are slowly becoming 
a rarity in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 80 years, many of the trees in the county, like those in other 
parts of the state, have not been regenerating. Some of the valley oaks, 
unprotected in many areas of the county, have been chopped down to make way for 
development and clear ranchland. And still others, dug up and transplanted so 
housing tracts could be built, are dying. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, scientists say, the majestic tree with its broad head, gnarled branches 
and lobed leaves, could be gone within the next century. The valley oaks, one 
of 15 oak species in the state, already is on the California Native Plant 
Society's "watch list." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no official statistics available, officials estimate that 
hundreds of the oaks are being lost or destroyed each year in Ventura County. 
As a result, researchers say, it is again time for government officials to take 
a serious look at the problem, which county planners are in the process of 
doing. The live oak -- a smaller, evergreen tree whose leaves are more pointed 
-- outnumbers the disappearing valley oak 3-to-1 in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County officials are designing a measure to protect all types of oak 
trees. The proposal is expected to come before the Board of Supervisors in 
July. Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Ojai and Moorpark already have ordinances 
protecting the oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that people might stop to think that these trees are becoming extinct 
is a red flag," said Tim Scott, an oak tree specialist with the University of 
California, Riverside's Cooperative Extension Program. "Now more than ever we 
have to make decisions on how we are going to protect the oaks. If we wait much 
longer, it will become a moot point and the oaks will be gone." 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, a state task force was formed to find out why the valley 
oaks had stopped regenerating. But the answers remained elusive. 
</P>
<P>
So little is known about the oaks and their problems that there still is not a 
clear consensus as to why the acorns that drop from the wild valley oaks -- as 
well as the blue oak found in the central and northern portions of the state 
and the mesa oak found in western San Diego County -- are failing to grow into 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
The drought, cattle and other animals eating the tree sprouts and rapid 
development on wild oak savannas may be part of the problem, said William 
Tietje, an oak tree expert with the UC Cooperative Extension program in San 
Luis Obispo. But, he said, researchers still are searching for more answers. 
</P>
<P>
There is no plague, no Dutch elm disease, no other sickness on which to blame 
the decline. 
</P>
<P>
Although a myriad of questions remain, experts say one thing is certain: 
Communities must find ways to preserve the remaining trees, which is not always 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
Battle lines often have been drawn between landowners and preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
When the idea of adopting an oak tree ordinance first surfaced in Ventura 
County nine years ago, ranchers argued that they have the right to do as they 
pleased with the trees on their land. As a result, the proposal was scaled back 
to include only the areas around the county's lakes, said Marsha Campiglio, a 
Ventura County planner. 
</P>
<P>
This time county planners, hoping to avoid opposition before the issue comes 
before the Board of Supervisors this summer, decided to exclude ranch and 
farmland from their proposed ordinance, Campiglio said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some ranchers preserve their oaks, partially because the beautiful old 
trees could someday increase the value of the land for a subdivision, the oaks 
reduce the productivity of rangeland by depleating grazing areas. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ed Elmendorf, the urban forester for the city of Thousand Oaks, 
the city goes to great lengths to protect its trees. But sometimes compromises 
must be made. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission approved a project that will 
allow a developer to build an apartment complex near about 20 oak trees in the 
last remaining oak area in the central part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The action sparked outrage from residents in the surrounding area, who felt the 
land should have been turned into a park. 
</P>
<P>
Although it would have been nice to leave the area open, Elmendorf said, 
"people have the right to develop their land." 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors was faced with a similar dilemma two 
years ago when developer David H. Murdock requested permission to build luxury 
houses on an area with scores of live and valley oaks at Lake Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors approved the development but asked Murdock to transplant the 
oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, more and more cities in the county are looking at asking developers 
to move the oaks -- which costs about $15,000 per tree -- if they are in the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the oak experts statewide are watching the Lake Sherwood 
development very carefully. 
</P>
<P>
So far, about 1,000 trees -- almost all live oaks -- have been transplanted, 
said John Mote, an arborist with Valley Crest Tree Co., which was hired to move 
the trees at Lake Sherwood. So far, about eight of the live oaks have died. And 
of the 10 valley oaks transplanted, five have died, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you are dealing with Mother Nature, there are certain risks involved," 
Mote said.

LIFE'S GIVEN HIM LEMONS AS HEAD OF CITRUS DYNASTY;

AGRICULTURE: ALAN TEAGUE RUNS HIS FAMILY'S MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS IN 
SANTA PAULA.

The patriarchs of television's dynasties have nothing on Alan Teague. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in a lemon grove in cowboy boots and blue jeans, he is the real-life 
head of one of Ventura County's pre-eminent families, one that helped found and 
nurture area lemon farming into a multimillion-dollar industry more than a 
century ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been around a long time," Teague, 52, said of his clan. The Teague 
dynasty, which began growing lemons in the late 1800s, has always been at the 
helm of Limoneira Co., the largest lemon-growing company in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Following in his forefathers' footsteps, Teague is chairman of the board of 
directors of Limoneira, a $20-million-a-year corporation. 
</P>
<P>
The company packs 18,000 tons of lemons a year out of a 4,000-acre ranch in 
Santa Paula. Because of Limoneira, Ventura County has squeezed success out of 
lemon production and is counted as the largest lemon-producing county in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Teague also heads the family's farming and oil operations and, of course, more 
lemon groves. The family companies also grow alfalfa, avocados and grapes on 
holdings that stretch from Ventura County to Tulare and Monterey counties. 
</P>
<P>
Teague doesn't care to discuss his personal fortune, a trait shared with other 
wealthy ranchers. "One thing about ranching, you never ask how many acres a 
person has and how many cattle they have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Teague said he was not initially groomed for the life of a gentleman rancher. 
In his earlier years, he had a fast-track political career that led him to a 
City Council seat at age 28 and the mayor's office in Santa Paula at 32. 
</P>
<P>
He was widely considered to be the heir apparent to the congressional seat once 
held by his father, the late Charles McKevett Teague. 
</P>
<P>
But the Santa Paula rancher, who feels more comfortable in boots and jeans than 
business suits, withdrew from politics to concentrate on agriculture and 
business. He still pursues what he loves the most: his horses and his ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Oxnard and raised on a horse ranch in Ojai, he graduated with a degree 
in business administration from the University of Arizona but had no plans to 
go into the family business, the Teague-McKevett Assn. 
</P>
<P>
After his graduation, he wound up working in the company's packinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started, one of my first jobs was 'swamping,' hauling full lemon 
boxes to the packinghouses," which meant lifting 40-pound crates to a truck, 
Alan Teague said. "I don't miss it a bit." 
</P>
<P>
For many years, Alan Teague said, he kept the company books by hand until he 
became president and general manager, posts he still holds. When his uncle 
Milton Teague died in 1986, he was considered to be the only family member in 
line to manage the business. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Teague has a friendly relationship with his workers, who call him by his 
first name and know him by the modest Chevrolet van he drives to the 
Teague-McKevett ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Standing at just over 6 feet tall, Alan Teague vaguely resembles actor John 
Wayne, with a drawl and a love for horses to match. But this imposing figure 
casts a regular-guy image. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably has . . . one tie, but he probably has more than one pair of 
boots," said Santa Paula Councilman Les Maland, a former mayor who lives on a 
street named after the Teagues. "He's not part of the jet set." 
</P>
<P>
But Alan Teague belongs to an exclusive riding club, the Rancheros Visitadores. 
The group's yearly outings in Santa Barbara are attended by some of the 
wealthiest growers, businessmen and politicians, including former President 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Better known to fellow riders as a cowboy rancher, Alan Teague "can ride on a 
horse all day," fellow horseman Jim Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have ridden with Alan Teague in the Rancheros Visitadores equestrian 
club and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department posse think the lemon grower 
is most comfortable in a saddle, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
When members of the riding club gather each year in Solvang, Alan Teague always 
brings the lemons for the bar, Clark added. 
</P>
<P>
The Teague-McKevett ranch includes the one-story house at Rancho La Cuesta, 
where Alan Teague keeps his horses. Among them is his favorite, Benny, a black 
quarter horse that actually belongs to his wife, Rebecca. 
</P>
<P>
His low-key approach to life contrasts with the lifestyles of his forefathers, 
who include a U.S. congressman, a South American adventurer and the founder of 
the citrus cooperative that eventually became Sunkist. 
</P>
<P>
W. L. Hardison, who founded the Limoneira Co., turned over the management of 
the ranch to his grandnephew Charles Collins Teague when he decided to travel 
to Peru. 
</P>
<P>
It was Charles Collins Teague who proved that irrigated land in the Santa Clara 
Valley could produce the most bountiful crop in the county. C. C. Teague also 
pioneered cooperative marketing for citrus growers, heading the California 
Fruit Growers Exchange, now known as Sunkist Growers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Teague's father, Charles McKevett Teague, served as a lawmaker in 
Washington for more than two decades before he died. He was succeeded by Rep. 
Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura). 
</P>
<P>
Alan Teague's position allowed him to tap the pockets of the county's 
wealthiest ranchers when he established the Ventura County Community 
Foundation, which funds scholarships and a wide range of community programs. 
</P>
<P>
He manages his affairs from a modest Teague-McKevett office off Santa Paula's 
10th Street. The office is decorated with lemon-packing labels from the old 
Teague-McKevett Assn. packinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the power of the older farm families is waning. Large corporate and 
foreign-owned operations have moved into the citrus industry. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's lemon-growing families no longer hold most of the financial 
power in the county, but they are still a dominant presence in agriculture, 
said Dave Kleine, who heads the agriculture department at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
"While they may not represent the majority of the money, their leadership 
impacts the way agriculture is going," Kleine said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Teague family has kept its holdings, "there are fewer and fewer 
farm families today," Alan Teague said. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the family business is branching out in its investments. 
One project financed through the McKevett Jones Corp. is a 69-unit housing 
development in Santa Paula Canyon. And Teague McKevett Co. is now interested in 
developing land east of the city, Santa Paula city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Teague said that times are harder for farm families but denied that the 
company will sell out while he is at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had no desire to liquidate, nor have we had any desire to sell our 
properties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he identifies strongly with the family business and that it is 
hard for him to imagine doing anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been fortunate. Just look around you: I'm living in Santa Paula, I enjoy 
what I do," Alan Teague said. "If you don't call that good fortune, I don't 
know what you would call good fortune."

Visitors to the California Strawberry Festival in Oxnard have already reserved 
every hotel room in the city and are expected to generate more than $1.8 
million this weekend, according to the Oxnard Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Varley, executive director of the bureau, said the festival is expected 
to attract about 80,000 people, 48,000 of whom will be out-of-town visitors. 
Last year, the festival attracted about 60,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The city has more than 1,000 hotel rooms, which have already been reserved for 
the festival, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three weeks, the bureau has received a daily average of 45 phone 
calls from out-of-towners, he said. Most of the callers ask for directions to 
the festival and about special hotel packages, Varley said. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation to the festival, which will be held at Channel Islands Harbor, 
will include shuttle buses from the festival's main parking locations at Oxnard 
College, the Ventura County Government Center and the naval base at Port 
Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
Three transportation boats will run regularly from the Casa Serina Hotel at 
Peninsula Park. 
</P>
<P>
During the annual two-day event, traffic will be blocked off at Harbor 
Boulevard from Costa de Oro to Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The festival will kick off Saturday with 2- and 10-kilometer races at 8 a.m., 
starting at the naval base. At 11 a.m. on the Strawberry Stage, local beauties 
will vie for the titles of "Outstanding Strawberry Blonde," "Junior Strawberry 
Blonde" and "Teen Strawberry Blonde." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the numerous musical groups appearing, more than 175 artists 
from six states will offer handmade arts and crafts in booths and stands 
throughout the festival grounds. 
</P>
<P>
At 1 p.m. Saturday, waiters and waitresses will test their skills in the 
Waiter's Race, in which competitors race for a finish line while balancing 
drinks on a tray. 
</P>
<P>
Big eaters will get their chance to compete in the strawberry shortcake eating 
contests at 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $4 for adults and $2 for children and senior citizens.

SPACE AVAILABLE IN OLD COURT BUILDING

<TEXT>
<P>
With construction of a new Courthouse under way, the Municipal Court building 
on Cochran Street in Simi Valley will soon be available for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
The city is accepting proposals from government and nonprofit groups until June 
15 for alternate uses of about half of the 8,000-square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
The new Courthouse should be completed in November, and space in the Cochran 
Street building will be available after that, said Bob Heitzman, the city's 
deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley Police Department, located next door to the Courthouse, plans 
to use about half the building for office space. The move will "allow us to 
expand our Police Department a little bit," Heitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
The areas still available for use include the courtroom and other office space. 
</P>
<P>
Although no proposals have been submitted yet, Heitzman said, several agencies 
have shown an interest in the space. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Historical Society and Mental Health Department and the Red Cross 
are among those interested in acquiring the office space. Heitzman said a 
performing arts facility has also been proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county is not requiring that groups pay rent for the facility, 
Heitzman said, the amount of rent a group offers to pay will be one of the 
city's considerations in choosing who will occupy the space. KIM KASH

COUNCIL CONSIDERS PAPER RECYCLING

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Paula City Council is considering adopting a recycling program for 
wastepaper generated by its city government offices. 
</P>
<P>
According to Public Works Director Norm Wilkinson, most office waste is 
high-quality paper, including that used in copying machines, computer printers, 
memo pads and fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson said a good market exists for recycled quality paper. 
</P>
<P>
The Recycle All Paper Program has already been adopted by Ventura County. If 
the Santa Paula council approves the program, each workstation in Santa Paula's 
City Hall would be supplied with a box to hold paper waste, which would be 
collected separately from other refuse. A private recycling company, Golden 
State Fiber, would empty a dumpster reserved for the paper on a monthly basis. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson said compliance with new state laws instructing cities to reduce 
waste was the primary motivation for recommending the program for adoption by 
the council. The city would receive about $25 per ton of recycled high-quality 
paper. JANET BERGAMO

GROUP GETS GO-AHEAD FOR ELY RECALL PETITION; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE DISTRICT: THE 12 SIMI AND MOORPARK RESIDENTS HAVE 160 DAYS TO GATHER 
9,900 SIGNATURES.

A citizens group that has demanded the resignation of Tom Ely, a trustee of the 
Ventura County Community College District, was given the green light Friday to 
start collecting signatures for a petition to recall him, county officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The group's petition, along with Ely's response, was approved and certified by 
the Elections Division of the county clerk's office Friday afternoon, said 
Jenny Harrison, elections services coordinator for the county. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens group last week demanded that Ely resign immediately or face the 
possibility of being recalled. The group cited "fiscal irresponsibility and 
unprofessional conduct" in regard to his "excessive travel expenses" as the 
main reason for the demand. Faculty leaders at each of Ventura County's three 
colleges have also called for Ely's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, who could not be reached for comment Friday, has said he will not resign. 
</P>
<P>
The group, made up of 12 Simi Valley and Moorpark residents, has 160 days to 
gather 15% of the signatures of the 66,000 registered voters in the 4th 
District, according to election officials. If the signatures are collected in 
time, the college Board of Trustees would be required to call a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Paras, an organizer of the group, said members planned to start 
collecting signatures this morning. 
</P>
<P>
For the recall to be on the November ballot, 9,900 signatures would have to be 
collected by June 15, said Ruth Schepler, director of the Elections Division. 
Otherwise, the board would not be able to call a special election until next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Ely filed a one-page response to the recall notice with the Elections Division 
on Thursday, Schepler said. 
</P>
<P>
"You've elected me three times. I've always been prudent with your money," Ely 
wrote in his response. "For 11 years, I've been the only board member to donate 
time unselfishly, to represent you in Sacramento, Washington, D.C., or wherever 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"My efforts have benefited my constituents. Naturally, my expenses have been 
higher than other board members," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has been the subject of controversy since it was disclosed in March that he 
had run up large gambling debts and had used his district telephone to call 
casinos in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
A district audit of his financial records has led to a criminal investigation 
by the district attorney's office involving the possible misuse of several 
thousand dollars in district funds. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has said that the audit is flawed and that he has not violated the 
district's travel policy.

GWALTNEY FRUSTRATES HIMSELF, LOS ALAMITOS WITH NO-HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At times, Jim Gwaltney struggled with his control. At other times, he was 
visibly frustrated with the umpiring. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, throughout most of Friday's 5-A playoff game, Gwaltney labored and 
fussed, nibbled at the corners and scratched for outs. But in the end, it was 
well worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Gwaltney got the Ocean View High School baseball team off to a good start in 
the playoffs. He ended up with a no-hitter and the Seahawks defeated Los 
Alamitos, 4-0, in a first-round game at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't have my best stuff when I went out there," said Gwaltney, a 
senior left-hander. "My control wasn't good and I didn't think I was getting 
many calls. I finally had to get mad at myself." 
</P>
<P>
Gwaltney walked three through the first three innings, including two in the 
second. In the fifth, he stalked off the mound after what he thought was a bad 
call on a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
After pacing behind the mound for 30 seconds, Gwaltney went back to work. He 
retired eight of the last nine batters. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim kind of bowed his neck there in the fifth," Ocean View Coach Steve Barrett 
said. "At that point, I knew Los Alamitos wasn't going to hit him." 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins had only one baserunner over the final three innings. Todd 
Gragnano walked with one out in the sixth, but Gwaltney got Tony Napolitano to 
hit into a double play to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The closest Los Alamitos came to a hit was in the seventh, when Tyler Cashman 
hit a hard ground ball wide of first base. But first baseman Eric Schaff made a 
diving stop and threw to Gwaltney, who was covering, to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric really saved me," said Gwaltney, who struck out five. "When the ball was 
hit, I thought, 'There goes the no-hitter.' But he made a great play and I got 
over to first as fast as I could. I wasn't going to let anything spoil it 
then." 
</P>
<P>
Gwaltney (8-3), who had a 1.59 earned-run average entering the game, allowed 
only two balls to be hit out of the infield. The Griffins had 20 ground-ball 
outs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's our game when Jim's pitching," Barrett said. "He just rolls the ball to 
our infielders and let's them do the work." 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks (20-7) didn't have a lot of success at the plate themselves. They 
got only four hits off Gragnano (4-5), who also walked eight. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Curtis Bruce led the way with two hits. He singled in the first 
run in the third inning. In the fifth, he doubled and later scored on a wild 
pitch to give the Seahawks a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Jones broke the game open in the sixth with a two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat ended Mike Gibson's coaching career at Los Alamitos. Gibson resigned 
Wednesday for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been nice to get at least one more win before retiring . . . or 
at least a hit," Gibson said.

Edison High School Coach Paul Harrell knew his team was facing a good-hitting 
team in the first round of the 5-A baseball playoffs. But he never figured to 
be down by seven runs after the first inning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance, which came in with a .333 team batting average, sent 12 men to the 
plate in the first and went on to a 10-7 victory over Edison at Torrance Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew there would be a lot of scoring going on," Harrell said. "But you can't 
spot a team like Torrance seven runs. It's awfully tough to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Edison's Donnie Smith (5-2) hit the first batter he faced, then walked the next 
three. Then Torrance's Kendall brothers -- sons of former big league catcher 
Fred Kendall -- jumped on reliever Phil Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore catcher Jason Kendall greeted Jensen with a two-run single and an 
error on the play allowed a third run to score. Then older brother Mike lifted 
a towering home run to left to give Torrance a 6-0 lead with no outs. The final 
run in the inning was unearned. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (18-8) cut the deficit to 7-4 with five singles off senior right-hander 
Mike Kendall (9-3) in the second and third. But Torrance scored three more runs 
in the fourth, highlighted by Ruben Montoya's third hit of the game, a two-run 
single. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers scored three times in the seventh on run-scoring hits by Bryan 
Higgins, Steve Thobe and Rocky Balch. 
</P>
<P>
Balch's two-out double off the left-field wall put Edison runners on second and 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Antone Williamson Torrance's regular third baseman, came in to pitch and struck 
out Josh Gingrich on four pitches -- the last one a fastball on the outside 
corner for called strike three -- to end the game and record his second save. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance (19-8), tri-champion of the Bay League, will play Westlake (26-1), the 
No. 2 team in the nation in USA Today's Top 25, in the second round Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In other 5-A games: 
</P>
<P>
Katella 7, Royal 2 -- Traveling two hours from Anaheim to Simi Valley didn't 
disturb the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
Katella's Dennis Briggs led off the game with a home run, knocking a 
three-and-one pitch over the 390-foot mark in center field for his second homer 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We enjoy going on the road because we have the chance to take advantage of the 
smaller fields," Katella Coach Tim McMenamin said. "We play in a park with a 
415-foot center field." 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Eric Boyd also enjoyed the Highlander park, smacking a two-run home 
run over the right-field fence in the fourth, scoring Briggs, who was three for 
four. Boyd's homer, his second, gave Katella a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Allen (8-3) pitched five innings, allowing six hits and four walks with 
three strikeouts. Chris Drummond, who is 7-1 with six saves, allowed one hit 
over the final two innings. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei 5, Fontana 2 -- Doug DeJardin had two hits and scored twice, Lionel 
Hastings had two hits, scored twice and had one RBI and Cale Carter had two 
hits and three RBIs to lead host Mater Dei. Carter's two-out single in the 
first inning gave Mater Dei (19-8) a 2-0 lead. Sean Sutton (7-4) pitched a 
seven-hitter, struck out seven and walked one for Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 6, Beverly Hills 4 -- Rich Hills and Jason Hodges each had two hits 
and two RBIs to lead Esperanza (20-6). Shade Summers (8-0) pitched 3 1/3 relief 
innings for the victory and Dan Redington got fifth save in pitching the last 1 
2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Marina 4, Hacienda Heights Wilson 2 -- Marina scored three runs in the third 
inning on Mark Newfield's RBI single and Nick Valencia's two-run single to win 
at Wilson (23-5). David Schultz had a RBI single in the first inning and scored 
in the third for Marina (13-12-2). LISA GRALL

CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edison High School didn't seem to be in too much of a rush to beat Corona del 
Mar in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 4-A boys' volleyball 
tournament Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
But once the Chargers got going, they rolled to a 9-15, 15-9, 16-14, 15-8 
victory over the Sea Kings at the Corona del Mar gym. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (16-1) won their 12th consecutive match by rallying from early 
deficits in the final three games. They advance to Friday night's semifinals 
against Santa Barbara. Corona del Mar ended the season at 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it was," Edison Coach Brian Rofer said. "We came out slow 
and fundamentally we just fell apart. It was an off-night for us. 
</P>
<P>
"Corona del Mar came out and did everything well. I think we were surprised. I 
think we overlooked Corona del Mar." 
</P>
<P>
Edison, ranked second in 4-A behind Mira Costa, appeared to work out its 
problems in the third game, fighting back from game point, 14-13. A block by 
Karl Van Reusen, a kill by sophomore Joe McCarthy and a hitting error by Corona 
del Mar's Carter Reese gave the Chargers a 16-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a great shot at it," Corona del Mar Coach Charlie Brande said. "But 
there were a couple of times where we didn't go after them. We had them game 
point in the third game and we hit it out a couple of times." 
</P>
<P>
Edison trailed, 5-3, early in the fourth game. But a 9-0 Edison run, keyed by 
six Corona del Mar hitting errors and two ace serves by Steve Snyder, sealed 
the match. Snyder also finished with 15 kills. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve's jump serve was on for the last game," Rofer said. "Our serving was bad 
most of the match, but he came in and ran up some points." 
</P>
<P>
Brande said his players "lost a lot of composure" in the last game. 
</P>
<P>
"After they pulled the third game out," he said, "I knew it would be tough to 
come back." 
</P>
<P>
Van Reusen typified Edison's early problems. He had only one kill in the first 
game and struggled with his jump serve, but had 13 kills by the end of the 
match. Edison had 14 service errors in the match, including eight in the first 
two games. 
</P>
<P>
"Our serving was off," Rofer said, "and we live and die by the serve. 
</P>
<P>
"Karl came out a little too pumped up. They (players) had to calm themselves 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Brande said his game plan was to hit at Van Reusen, a 6-foot-5 middle blocker 
who has signed with Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Daryl Ayers had 12 kills and McCarthy and Jason Curry added 11 each for Edison. 
Sophomore Doug Hesse had 18 kills, Clark Brogger nine and Reese eight for 
Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
In another 4-A quarterfinal match: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara 3, Woodbridge 1 -- Woodbridge (16-3) had trouble getting the ball 
past Santa Barbara's middle blockers and lost, 15-11, 15-3, 15-17, 15-11. 
Nathaniel Haugh had 19 kills and Scott Seymour added 16 for host Woodbridge 
(16-3). 
</P>
<P>
In a 2-A quarterfinal match: 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Country 3, Santa Margarita 0 -- Rick Phillips had 15 kills and Kevin 
Sathre added 13 to lead Canyon (15-1) to a 15-8, 15-11, 15-12 victory over 
Santa Margarita (16-5).

TITANS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ERRORS TO EDGE LONG BEACH

<TEXT>
<P>
Joy Tiner's bases-loaded, bloop single in the top of the eighth inning gave the 
Cal State Fullerton softball team a 3-2 victory over Cal State Long Beach 
Friday night in the first game of a best-of-three NCAA regional series. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will meet again at 1 today at Fullerton, and a second game will 
follow if necessary. The regional winner earns a berth in the College World 
Series, which begins Wednesday in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of about 400 at Titan Field saw Fullerton (45-21) take advantage of two 
49er errors in the eighth. Carey Hess reached first on pitcher Mary 
Letourneau's fielding error, and Mich DeBree reached when first baseman Kellie 
Kane mishandled her bunt. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans loaded the bases when Kane's throw to third on Charlotte Wiley's 
bunt wasn't in time to force Hess. Long Beach reliever Ruby Flores came on to 
get Missy Coombes to line to left field for the first out, but Tiner, who also 
had an RBI single in the fourth, placed a soft single over shortstop Kim 
Kostyk's head for the game-winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton pitcher Ann Van Dortrecht, who improved to 29-10, retired the 49ers 
(45-17) in the eighth with the help of an outstanding defensive play by 
shortstop Wiley. Lisa Pedersen's hard grounder caromed off Van Dortrecht's 
glove and toward Wiley, who made a bare-handed grab and fired to first in time 
for the second out. 
</P>
<P>
Steffani Everett, who had three hits for Long Beach, singled to center, but Gia 
Wilkerson popped to short to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been tough games all year between the two of us, and this was just 
another one," said Fullerton Coach Judi Garman, whose Titans had lost four of 
five games to the 49ers, all by one run. "It's nice to win the first game of 
the series, because now the pressure is on Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, ranked fifth in the nation, scored once in the fourth when Wiley 
singled to left and advanced to second when the ball got past left fielder 
Wilkerson. Wiley reached third on a groundout and scored on Tiner's single to 
right. 
</P>
<P>
But the fourth-ranked 49ers came back in the bottom of the fourth, scoring 
twice to take a 2-1 lead. Wilkerson singled and scored on Carrie Smith's 
double, and Smith scored when Titan left fielder Buffy Sanchez couldn't handle 
Heather Illsley's low liner. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton tied the score in the sixth, when Hess doubled, was sacrificed to 
third and scored on Wiley's single to center.

UC IRVINE SWEEPS WEST VIRGINIA IN SINGLES

<P>
On one court, Trevor Kronemann was making like a steamroller, flattening a West 
Virginia player who was ranked seven notches above him. 
</P>
<P>
Five courts away, Coach Greg Patton was coaxing and soothing his freshman, 
Randy Ivey, who spent last year leading Woodbridge High School to a Southern 
Section tennis championship. Ivey spent Friday using his big serve for UC 
Irvine in a first-round victory in the NCAA championships at the Grand 
Champions resort. 
</P>
<P>
Ivey was the only Irvine player to lose a set, but he pulled out his match by 
surviving a tiebreaker in the second set and winning the third as the Anteaters 
swept West Virginia in singles, 6-0, ending the match without playing doubles, 
and setting up a match with top-ranked and undefeated Tennessee at noon today. 
</P>
<P>
There will be an extra edge to the Tennessee match for Kronemann, who will be 
facing the team coached by his first coach, Mike DePalmer, who gave him the 
first tennis lesson of his life when Kronemann was a 7-year-old living in 
Bradenton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of respect for him," said Kronemann, who said he will work on his 
game with DePalmer for a month after he finishes playing at Irvine. "But when 
it comes down to it, we're 1-0 (in the NCAA tournament) and they're 0-0." 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann, ranked 20th, took the first set Friday from 13th-ranked Joby Foley 
of West Virginia, 6-2, but let the second get interesting before winning, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
But while Irvine's other players played their matches, much of Patton's 
attention was on Ivey. 
</P>
<P>
Patton had spent days fretting over who to play at No. 6 -- Ivey or Mike 
Saunders, a senior and a team leader who has won the past two Big West 
Conference titles at No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
He chose Ivey, in part because of the match-up with West Virginia's Mark 
Booras. Ivey lost the first set, 3-6, and as the match developed, it seemed as 
if his match might be a critical one in deciding whether Irvine would be forced 
to begin doubles play. 
</P>
<P>
Booras' big serve forced Ivey to back off early in the match. But, after 
forcing a third set, Ivey won by breaking Booras for a 3-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Randy came through with flying colors," Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 6 match seemed so critical, but there was irony in the way it ended. 
Ivey was threatening to break in the 10th game of the third set when a cheer 
went up two courts away, where Irvine's Mike Roberts had just beaten Patric 
Westoo, 6-3, 6-3, giving Irvine its fifth singles victory, all it needed to 
clinch. 
</P>
<P>
Ivey, his contribution no longer even necessary, hung in to break Booras and 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"After it was over, it just released a lot of tension," Ivey said. "I could 
just play for fun instead of all that pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's other victories were at No. 2, where 33rd-ranked Richard Lubner beat 
35th-ranked Paul Mancini, 6-3, 6-1; No. 3, where Shige Kanroji defeated Ron 
Mercer, 6-3, 6-2, and No. 5, where Carsten Hoffman defeated Brad Kelly, 6-4, 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the best matches we've played this year," Patton said. "The Tank 
(Kronemann) leads the force, and you feel it all the way down at the No. 6 
court. Once you know he's doing well, it affects all these guys."

WHO WANTS 'IDEA' PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Chalon Smith's play reviews continue to be as entertaining and insightful 
as a train wreck. A case in point is Smith's review of "Love, Sex and the IRS," 
a play produced early this year by Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse (" 'Love , Sex 
and the IRS' Makes For a Taxing Evening," Calendar, Jan. 24). 
</P>
<P>
Smith savaged the play because it was devoid of "ideas" -- still more evidence 
that Smith has no business whatsoever reviewing community theater. Any 
community theater that served its audience a steady diet of Smith's cherished 
"idea" plays would go belly-up in no time. As a longtime member of Anaheim's 
community theater, the Ana Modjeska Players, I remember -- all too well -- the 
last "idea" play we presented: "The Physicist" by Friedrich Duerrenmatt. I 
believe the play averaged five customers per performance, counting walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
Inasmuch as a major priority of community theater is to offer roles for novice 
as well as experienced local thespians, there's not much chance of staging a 
polished production of a serious, thought-provoking drama such as "Children of 
a Lesser God," which requires precision acting to be effective. "Harmless" 
comedies, as Smith calls them, provide a much better training ground for 
fledgling actors while amusing audiences that don't expect Broadway-level 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Smith, please don't try to single-handedly change the face of community 
theater to suit your tastes. Community theater audiences want to be 
entertained, not instructed. If they want provocative drama, they'll usually 
pay a bit more and attend such theaters as South Coast Repertory, Alternative 
Repertory Theatre, Way Off Broadway Playhouse and those of local colleges and 
universities -- all of which do an excellent job of presenting "idea" plays. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, it's a good thing for the masters such as Shakespeare and Moliere, 
who occasionally wrote "harmless, non-idea" comedies, that Mark Chalon Smith 
wasn't around to put them straight.

The confluence of the Garden Grove (22), Santa Ana (5) and Orange (57) freeways 
is the busiest traffic interchange in Orange County, carrying, on average, 
nearly a half-million cars per day. That's a 50% increase since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Although it ranks at the bottom of the list of 10 most heavily used 
interchanges in the county, the notorious El Toro "Y," where the San Diego and 
Santa Ana freeways meet, has had the largest increase in average daily traffic 
load during the '80s, 86%. In fact, of the 10 busiest intersections in the 
county, the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways are most often one of the arteries 
involved.

Fewer than 10 county residents out of a hundred are satisfied with the freeway 
system -- the continuation of a trend that has been in place for three years. 
So widespread is this dissatisfaction that a small majority (51%) believes more 
lanes will not do the job now, that new freeways are the answer to our traffic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, in 1982, a third of Orange Countians were satisfied with 
the freeways and only one-quarter thought we needed new ones. In any case, 
there has always been at least a two-thirds majority of the opinion that we 
need either more lanes or completely new freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Regional differences highlight the shades of opinion regarding freeways, with 
those living in the southern and western sections of the county most in favor 
of new freeways. Commuters of all stripes are convinced of the need for new 
freeways, with at least half in all groups holding that view. Perceptions as to 
what extent commuter traffic is a problem color views on this issue, but even 
those who say they have no problems making their daily run to work are ready to 
agree our freeway system is inadequate.

<TEXT>
<P>
Don't be fooled by an $82.5-million Van Gogh or a $78.1-million Renoir. The art 
market isn't rising as fast as it was a couple of years ago. Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
As a two-week round of contemporary, modern and Impressionist art auctions drew 
to a close on Friday, results were sharply mixed. 
</P>
<P>
The auctions had brought unprecedented prices -- $82.5 million for Vincent van 
Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" and $78.1 million for Pierre Auguste Renoir's 
"Au Moulin de la Galette," easily shattering the record set in 1987 for Van 
Gogh's "Irises" -- but two of five major sales fell below the auction houses' 
low estimates and about a third of the works failed to sell in three of these 
highly publicized auctions. While the five big evening sales set 50 artists' 
records, highly valued works by Clyfford Still and Willem de Kooning failed to 
attract buyers. 
</P>
<P>
After several years of rapid escalation, the auction scene cooled a bit last 
November and controversy over Sotheby's highly leveraged sale of "Irises" to 
Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond had led to charges that auction prices were 
artificially inflated. Bond sold the painting to the J. Paul Getty Museum for 
an undisclosed sum after his financial empire tumbled and he couldn't pay off 
his $27-million loan from Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
When the spring auctions opened last week, the settlement of the Bond affair 
had cleared the air, but it was anybody's guess as to whether the market could 
sustain another bullish season. At first the answer was no. Lackluster auctions 
of contemporary art last week indicated that the market was leveling off -- if 
not taking a nose dive -- after a period of runaway record prices. 
</P>
<P>
This week when big-ticket auctions of Impressionist and modern art began, 
Christie's spectacular $82.5-million sale of Van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. 
Gachet" didn't hide the fact that 24 of the 81 lots didn't sell and that 22 
others brought less than their low estimates. Without "Dr. Gachet" and a Van 
Gogh self-portrait that brought $26.4 million, the auction would have been 
perceived as a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
At Christie's Tuesday sale, Edouard Manet's "The Bench," estimated at $20 
million to $25 million, sold for $16.5 million; and Piet Mondrian's "Tableau 
Losangique II" ("Diamond-Shaped Painting II"), estimated at $12 million to $16 
million, sold for $8.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The signals appeared to be clear: Unless they are dealing with unquestionably 
great or popular works of art, sellers must lower their expectations and 
auction houses must estimate prices more cautiously in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But this consensus broke down on Wednesday and Thursday when Sotheby's held two 
sales that lived up to the auction house's rosiest predictions, "Hey, this is 
like the good old days," one collector said on Wednesday night, when works by 
Kurt Schwitters routinely doubled presale valuations and collages by Enrico 
Prampolini, a little known Italian artist, commanded up to eight times their 
high estimates in an auction of the Lydia Winston Malbin collection of modern 
art. 
</P>
<P>
The Malbin auction totaled almost $75 million, just shy of Sotheby's most 
optimistic estimate, and sold all but two of the 93 lots offered. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Sotheby's $78.1-million sale of "Au Moulin de la Galette" soared 
above the pack of 70 works, but several highly valued items outstripped their 
estimates. Among the successes was Wassily Kandinsky's "Fugue," which was 
estimated at $10 million to $15 million and sold for $20.9 million The 
$286-million auction upset the $270-million record for an Impressionist 
auction, set last November at Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
"The art market is very solid. We've been saying it and saying it and saying 
it, but we keep reading other things in the press," said Sotheby's chairman 
John L. Marion after the Thursday auction. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of both Christie's and Sotheby's have consistently argued that the 
market is robust, but last week they admitted that the market couldn't continue 
its recent trajectory. A leveling-off period was welcome and "very healthy," 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here? Several things. One is what the auction houses call 
"selectivity," meaning that buyers will pay almost anything for what they 
really want, but they will no longer snatch up every third-rate Renoir that 
goes on the block. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Malbin sale, sophisticated collectors eagerly vied for 
Italian Futurist works and other modern pieces that hadn't been on the market 
for years and carried the cachet of Lydia Winston Malbin, a perspicacious 
collector who was the daughter of architect Albert Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
Another development is that the contemporary market, which has risen abruptly 
over the last decade, seems due for a stronger correction than the better 
established Impressionist and modern art market. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's first contemporary art sale, in 1978, for example, brought $574,850 
for 70 works. Exactly 10 years later, in May of 1988, Christie's auction of 63 
contemporary lots totaled $19.8 million. The figures continued to rise: $37 
million for 86 works in November, 1988, and $62 million for 93 works in 
November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But this month, when 26 contemporary works went unsold at Christie's, 51 lots 
brought only $40 million, with several works selling below -- or at the low end 
of -- their estimates. At Christie's May 7 sale, "1949-A No. 1" by Clyfford 
Still, estimated at $3.5 million to $4.5 million, did not sell. Still's 
"1955-D," estimated at $3 million to $5 million, sold for $1.1 million. Roy 
Lichtenstein's "Kiss II," estimated at $5 million to $7 million, sold for $5.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's contemporary sales took an even bigger plunge, from a total of $98 
million for 68 works in November, 1989, to $56 million for 55 works this month. 
At Sotheby's May 8 sale, Willem de Kooning's "Woman as Landscape," estimated at 
$9 million to $12 million, did not sell. "Palisade," also by de Kooning, 
estimated at $8 million to $10 million, sold for $7.15 million. Richard 
Diebenkorn's "Girl and Striped Chair," estimated at $1.5 million to $2 million, 
sold for $880,000. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the average price for contemporary work in one of these big-ticket auctions 
remains high, around $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
Not as pricey as Impressionist and modern art, however. The average price of an 
Impressionist or modern work at these New York auctions has escalated steadily 
from around $1 million in 1988 to nearly $5 million.

TUTU TO VISIT DISNEYLAND TODAY AT CHILD'S URGING

<P>
Acting on a grandchild's request, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu will be 
making an unscheduled stop today at Disneyland, where he and his party of 17 
plan to tour the world-famous amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
The South African cleric, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of the struggle 
against apartheid, had planned a weeklong series of speeches and sermons in 
Orange and Los Angeles counties. But on Thursday an aide told Disneyland 
officials that Tutu's party -- and especially his 3-year-old grandson, Xabiso 
Tutu -- wanted to visit the park. 
</P>
<P>
The aide did not specify what attractions the little boy wanted to see, but, 
according to Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth, the aide did make one request: "The 
Rev. Tutu wants the little boy to have the time of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, Xabiso, Tutu's wife, Leah, daughters Mpho Tutu, Thandi Tutu and Naomi 
Tutu as well as family friends and Episcopal Church officials are expected to 
arrive at the park's main gate at 12:30 p.m. They will sign the VIP guest book, 
meet Mickey Mouse and spend part of the day touring Fantasyland, which offers a 
carousel as well as attractions based on fairy-tales. 
</P>
<P>
At Tutu's request, most of the nearly six-hour visit will be private -- away 
from reporters and photographers, Roth said, so the archbishop and his 
17-member entourage "can be like everyone else when they're in the park." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite like everyone else, he conceded. As guests of Disneyland, 
Bishop Tutu and his party will not have to pay the admission of $25.50 for 
adults, $20.50 for children ages 3 to 11. Also, the Tutu group will be treated 
to lunch and probably escorted to the front of all lines. 
</P>
<P>
Also arriving at the park this morning will be another dignitary -- Zhu 
Quizhen, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, and his wife. An official 
of the People's Republic of China Consulate in Los Angeles said the couple, who 
live in Washington, would spend the entire day at Disneyland. They also will 
get VIP treatment -- a free and very private tour, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu is making his first visit to Orange County with his trip to Disneyland, 
but he plans to return here Monday at 7:30 p.m. when he speaks at Santa Ana 
High School. That visit is being hosted by the Episcopal Church of the Messiah 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
He is also scheduled to deliver two sermons in Pasadena on Sunday and will 
appear at Cal State Long Beach on Monday before his arrival in Santa Ana. Tutu 
also has appearances scheduled at Caltech in Pasadena and at UCLA on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his anti-apartheid 
efforts, is expected to discuss the recent dramatic turn of events in South 
Africa, including the release of African National Congress leader Nelson 
Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu and Zhu are the latest in a long line of luminaries who have visited 
Disneyland in the past 30 years. Park records show there have been cosmonauts 
and astronauts, princesses and prime ministers, presidents and would-be 
presidents -- not to mention a couple of kings. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every famous visitor has taken in the Matterhorn roller coaster and 
several other rides, he said. But there have been exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Japanese) Emperor Hirohito was here in October, 1975, for a very brief 
time, he spent the majority of his time watching our bicentennial parade," Roth 
said. Roth noted that a child of about 7 or 8 got into the VIP seating area and 
climbed into the Emperor's lap, and Hirohito "treated him as if he were his own 
child," letting him stay through the rest of the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Each time a celebrity comes to Disneyland, "I think we're honored," Roth said. 
"It's a feather in our cap. It says what this place is all about . . . that 
people want to see a real piece of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
When Tutu returns to Orange County on Monday, the program at Santa Ana High 
School will also include an appearance by the Saint Joseph's Ballet Company, 
accompanied by the Biola University Gospel Choir. 
</P>
<P>
Parishioners from the program's organizer, the Episcopal Church of the Messiah, 
were granted the first opportunity to buy tickets for the speech. They and 
other local leaders and residents snapped up the 1,500 available tickets within 
10 days and are "very excited" about the visit, said Leonora Will, an organizer 
of the event. 
</P>
<P>
"The Anglican Church in South Africa has played an important role in the 
struggle," Will said. "We're very proud and excited that he's coming." 
</P>
<P>
While Tutu's Monday visit to Orange County is expected to be peaceful, Will 
noted that "there are security concerns wherever the archbishop goes because he 
and his family have received death threats in the past." She added that 
organizers of the visit have taken security measures that are required by the 
county and that Santa Ana police will be on hand, but no unusual security 
arrangements are planned. 
</P>
<P>
At Disneyland, Roth declined to comment on the park's security plans for today.

MAYS ATTACKED FOR SITE OF HIS FUND-RAISER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays came under attack Friday for using the home of a city 
planning commissioner as the site of a political fund-raiser attended by about 
80 people, including a major developer with a project scheduled to come before 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Rival Assembly candidate Peter von Elten, who the day before was criticized by 
Mays for participating in a political dinner with South County developers, 
charged that the mayor caused a conflict of interest for the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Mays, however, said no law was violated and that Planning Commissioner Kenneth 
Bourguignon's only involvement was the use of his house. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Fair Political Practices Commission in Sacramento said 
she could not comment directly on the matter since state law is not precise on 
the use of an appointed official's house for a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Biddle, president of the citizens' group Huntington Beach Tomorrow, 
said he believes it is unethical for planning commissioners to be put into 
fund-raising roles in which they have contact with developers who might come 
before them. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was a $150-a-couple event for Mays on Thursday night at Bourguignon's 
Huntington Harbour home. Guests included Jonathan Chodos, developer-coordinator 
for the controversial Pierside Village commercial project, which still must win 
Planning Commission approval. 
</P>
<P>
The Bourguignon event was held the same day that Mays accused von Elten of 
trying to tap South County developers for donations at a dinner arranged by two 
Orange County Planning Commission members. (On Friday, the commissioners were 
chastised by members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors for appearing to 
use their positions to support a political candidate.) 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten and Mays are among five candidates competing for the Republican 
nomination for the 58th Assembly District, which includes Huntington Beach, 
Seal Beach and parts of Long Beach and Los Alamitos. Other candidates in the 
June 5 election are Long Beach physician Seymour Alban and Long Beach City 
Council members Jan Hall and Jeffrey A. Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
In reaction to von Elten's dinner, Mays had said he was concerned about the 
Assembly race "being funded by special interests. . . . It appears to me the 
(county) Planning Commission is putting the squeeze on developers." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, von Elten responded: "Tom Mays is the biggest hypocrite I've ever 
encountered." 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten also charged that the Bourguignon event was a "developer shakedown" 
and "was nothing more than political extortion in its lowest form. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The only difference between his (Mays') event and mine is that I didn't get 
any money from the one held for me." 
</P>
<P>
Mays, however, said that von Elten's event involved two commissioners in 
directly soliciting developers for funds. By contrast, said Mays, Bourguignon's 
only involvement was that he allowed his home to be used as the fund-raising 
site. 
</P>
<P>
"The event was held by CORPAC, the Conservative Republican Political Action 
Committee," Mays said. "Ken was only loaning his house." 
</P>
<P>
Bourguignon on Friday said that he saw no conflict in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"It cost me a couple of thousand (to host the event), and it came out of my 
pocket, and I got nothing back," he said. Bourguignon agreed that "it's 
possible" that some projects pushed by someone at his party will come before 
the city Planning Commission. "If that happens, I just won't vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chodos, the Pierside Village developer, said in an interview Friday that he 
attended the fund-raiser as a guest -- that someone else bought his ticket. He 
said he did not feel pressured to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"I support Tom Mays because he's been a good mayor and has a record of 
supporting redevelopment" downtown, Chodos said. "Tom has already taken a 
public stand as being in support of Pierside Restaurants," the new name for 
Pierside Village. 
</P>
<P>
"At no point was I approached for funds," Chodos said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach City Councilman Jim Silva also attended the Mays fund-raiser. 
In an interview Friday, Silva said that other than the ticket for admission, 
developers were not asked to contribute to Mays. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten, in a press release Friday, charged that Mays has been involved in "a 
four-year history of shaking down developers, oil companies and businesses and 
then casting a vote on their behalf. . . . He's doing the same thing that 
resulted in the FBI sting operation in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Mays replied: "Von Elten is attempting to rub off some of his sleaze factor on 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Mays said he has not used any pressure tactics to solicit campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't strong-armed anybody," he said.

SCENIC ROAD KEY TO SAVING HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: LAND CONSERVANCY GROUP PUSHES CROWDED CARBON CANYON ROAD FOR SPECIAL 
DESIGNATION

Carbon Canyon Road meanders through some of the most beautiful scenery in 
Orange County -- lush, oak-filled canyons, open meadows and year-round mountain 
streams. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, bucolic as it is, this seven-mile stretch of rural beauty has not been 
designated a scenic highway, as have parts of Ortega Highway and the Angeles 
Crest Highway in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Now an environmental group calling itself the Chino Hills Land Conservancy is 
trying to change all that, working with a Pomona legislator to have the road 
placed on the state scenic highway list. 
</P>
<P>
The effort is more than a simple attempt to have blue scenic highway markers 
placed on the road. David Miller, the group's president, said the surrounding 
Chino Hills are threatened by development and that designating Carbon Canyon 
Road as a scenic highway would help preserve the area. 
</P>
<P>
The hills, with crests ranging from 1,300 feet to 1,800 feet, form a natural 
barrier between the mild coastal plains of Orange County and the arid, warm 
inland valleys. And they serve as a haven to deer, mountain lions, coyotes and 
other forms of animal and plant life. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole future of the hills is at stake," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
A scenic highway designation helps protect a road from junkyards, billboards, 
high-rise buildings and anything else that could detract from the surrounding 
scenery, said Laura Johnson, scenic highway coordinator for the California 
Department of Transportation (Caltrans). 
</P>
<P>
To have the highway designated as scenic, Johnson said, local governing bodies 
must first pass ordinances to restrict development and force developers to use 
building materials that blend into the local scenery and preserve existing 
streams and creeks. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to keep the corridor looking as attractive as possible," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Chino Hills Land Conservancy, a nonprofit group with about 25 
members, sent a letter to Assemblyman Charles W. Bader (R-Pomona) last month 
asking him to sponsor legislation that would make the road eligible for the 
scenic highways list. 
</P>
<P>
Bader said he was willing to meet with conservancy members to discuss their 
request but added that his main concern is doing something to relieve the 
traffic congestion in the Chino Hills, where Carbon Canyon Road is the only 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
"The transportation problems there are atrocious," Bader said. "The traffic (on 
Carbon Canyon Road) is backed up for miles. It is clear that the planning has 
been inadequate for the number of houses built in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Once a road is deemed eligible for scenic highway status -- and it can be done 
only through state legislation -- local governing bodies must then pass the 
protective ordinances. With that done, a final decision on the matter is left 
in the hands of Caltrans' Departmental Transportation Advisory Committee. The 
entire process can take months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at Lambert Road in Brea, Carbon Canyon Road winds past a patch of 
working oil wells before entering a landscape so rural and pristine that it 
could have been etched on canvas. Carbon Canyon Regional Park, with its small 
lake, is located off to one side of the road while horses and cattle graze on 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
The road follows Carbon Canyon Creek, which runs year-round from springs and 
ground water, through steep canyons. Waist-high mustard plants dot the 
hillsides, and mule deer can occasionally be seen in the area. The canyon is 
filled with stands of California live oak and walnut trees. Turkey vultures 
soar in quest of prey. 
</P>
<P>
At the San Bernardino County line, the road enters the quaint community of 
Sleepy Hollow, a 1920s-era village once inhabited by Prohibition bootleggers. 
It is here that Miller and several other Chino Hills conservancy members live. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Sleepy Hollow, the road takes a breathtaking "S" curve as it 
begins to descend into Chino, with its development pushing into the Chino 
Hills. Although the view is still scenic, new housing developments abound and a 
more suburban atmosphere prevails. The road ends at Chino Hills Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
The encroachment of development is what prompted Miller and his group to try 
and preserve the road. 
</P>
<P>
Under San Bernardino County's Chino Hills specific plan, 25,000 housing units 
are planned for the eastern side of the hills. Riverside County is also pushing 
in from the east, while the city of Diamond Bar is building up from the west in 
Los Angeles County. In Orange County, Yorba Linda is crawling up one side of 
the hills, while Brea city officials -- whose sphere of influence extends all 
the way to the San Bernardino County line -- are studying a plan to develop 
toward Carbon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
And, with the explosive growth of San Bernardino and Riverside counties, new 
roads are being contemplated for the hills. Public agencies on both sides of 
the hills have been struggling with ways to relieve traffic congestion from the 
Riverside Freeway and Carbon Canyon Road -- the two main routes between Orange 
County and the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
Between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays, the road is one long parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The only alternative to the congestion is to carve another highway through the 
Chino Hills, Bader, environmentalists and county planners agree. 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been some talk of widening Carbon Canyon Road, that has not 
been seriously considered because of the logistic and political problems in 
widening through places such as Sleepy Hollow, where homes nestle alongside the 
roadway, said Robert Peterson, manager of transportation planning for Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be virtually destroyed by a widening of the highway," said Ron 
Nadeau, a Sleepy Hollow resident who is vice president of the Chino Hills 
conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, planners from Orange, Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties are 
considering three other routes through the Chino Hills. The most controversial 
calls for a six-lane highway to run through Soquel Canyon south of Carbon 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Schlotterbeck, head of a group called Hills for Everyone, said the 
highway would cut through a part of the 10,000-acre Chino Hills State Park, 
which her group fought to have opened in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Another new road would run through Tonner Canyon north of Carbon Canyon Road, 
cutting through a portion of the Firestone Boy Scout Reservation in Orange and 
Los Angeles counties. Boy Scout officials have expressed dismay with the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Schlotterbeck's option -- and one being considered by county planners -- is for 
a road to run along the ridge of Tonner Canyon. She said her group wants to 
make sure the Chino Hills remain a wildlife haven. 
</P>
<P>
"We call this our treasure island in a sea of urbanization," Schlotterbeck 
said. "Once you're in there, you don't know there are people on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
While the three routes are being studied, residents hope that preserving Carbon 
Canyon Road will be only the first step toward protecting other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole reason for preserving Carbon Canyon Road," Miller said as he hiked 
through the lushly carpeted canyon bottom this past week, "is to preserve the 
scenery out here."

SUPERVISORS BLAST COMMISSIONERS' AID TO CANDIDATE

<P>
Two Orange County supervisors expressed outrage Friday over the actions of two 
planning commissioners who reportedly solicited funds for an Assembly candidate 
by hosting a dinner with representatives of South County developers who have 
projects before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have grave views about my planning or airport commissioner using their 
county titles to solicit campaign funds on behalf of an Assembly candidate or 
any candidate," Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said. "I don't think they would do 
it, but if they did we would sit down and have a very stern talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, The Times quoted several people who attended the dinner as saying 
that Planning Commission Chairman Stephen Nordeck and fellow Commissioner Roger 
Slates encouraged the developers to contribute to 58th Assembly District 
candidate Peter von Elten. The dinner took place at Nordeck's Trabuco Oaks 
Steak House and was attended by about 15 people. 
</P>
<P>
Nordeck, who strongly denied that he solicited any contributions or had any 
role in the dinner, was appointed to the commission last year by Supervisor 
Gaddi H. Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Slates, who has declined to comment, served on the commission from 1972 to 1975 
and was appointed last year by Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
In his first public comment on the dinner, von Elten confirmed that he was 
introduced to guests at the affair as a friend of Nordeck and Slates, and that 
he went to the dinner in hopes of raising campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to get some people to contribute," von Elten said. "Roger said, 'Do 
you mind if we put a little dinner together?' He said he had no idea how much 
money we were looking at. He said he would make the introductions and I could 
take it from there." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder reacted on Friday, saying, "This is the '90s; this isn't the 70s 
anymore. . . . It was one of the things I cautioned (Slates) about. . . . 
They've really tightened up on laws having to do with avoiding the appearance 
of any wrongdoing or anything illegal in trying to take advantage of a public 
office." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder said she questioned Slates about the dinner when contacted earlier this 
week by the Times and was disturbed by discrepancies between his account and 
those of others quoted in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave me a completely different story from what's in the newspaper," Wieder 
said. "I'm going to talk to Roger and get to the bottom of this." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said he spoke by phone on Friday with Nordeck, who is out of town, and 
that Nordeck maintained that he spent the evening working at the restaurant and 
did not participate in the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to chat with Steve when he gets back to get more perspective," 
Vasquez said. "I would reserve judgment until then." 
</P>
<P>
Both von Elten and his campaign manager Dave Ellis said they do not remember 
the names of all who attended the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten also said no per-plate price had been set, and that neither he nor 
Ellis know for certain who paid for the affair, which he described as modest. 
</P>
<P>
"I assumed someone paid for it," von Elten said. "It was steak and French 
fries, not veal and caviar." 
</P>
<P>
State law bars members of public commissions or boards from soliciting campaign 
contributions of $250 or more from individuals who have matters pending before 
them, according to a spokeswoman for the California Fair Political Practices 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests at the dinner, according to interviews with several of those 
present, were Kevin A. Canning and Irwin R. Schatzman, both representatives of 
Arvida Corp. In addition to the Coto de Caza subdivision near Trabuco Canyon, 
Arvida is planning the Rolling Hills residential development near San Clemente. 
Expansion plans for Coto de Caza are pending before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the dinner, according to others present, was Lyle A. Overby, a 
prominent lobbyist who represents the Santa Margarita Co. The firm is proposing 
the Las Flores residential development, east of Mission Viejo. The project is 
expected to go before the planning commission in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Overby has declined to comment on the dinner or to confirm his presence there. 
Schatzman and Canning acknowledged that they attended. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Wooden, a 15-year planning commissioner most recently appointed by 
Stanton, said reports of the dinner at Nordeck's restaurant raise serious 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never have a fund-raiser," Wooden said. "Even if I had a friend who 
wanted a fund-raiser I would have to turn him down."

<P>
The City Council stepped carefully around enforcement of a dog-curbing 
ordinance this week, vetoing the use of police to enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the council instructed city staff to develop an education program 
aimed at making dog owners more responsible for where their pets relieve 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The council acted on complaints from residents who use Lake Mission Viejo, who 
claimed that dog owners are not cleaning up after their pets. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Christian W. Keena agreed, saying that he has seen similar incidents by 
the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Dog owners allow their animals to "just do it, and then they walk away," he 
said. "These people have no feeling for their fellow citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Citizens who violate the city dog-curbing law could be fined $100, City Atty. 
Scott Field said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Joseph, assistant city manager, said he would have a program ready by 
summer aimed at educating dog owners. FRANK MESSINA

<P>
The American Education League awarded more than $3,000 to area high school 
students this week for their winning entries in the 20th annual Patriotic 
Slogan Contest. 
</P>
<P>
John Leicht, a graduating senior at El Dorado High School in Placentia, won the 
$650 first prize for his slogan "America -- Where Freedom Is Job 1." 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Higuera of El Toro High School won second place and $450 for her slogan, 
"Strong Defense -- Forget Dollars, Think Sense." 
</P>
<P>
Third place and $300 was awarded to Scott Fitzpatrick from Canyon High in 
Anaheim for his slogan, "Freedom -- The Universal Language," and Gary Grebey 
won fourth place and $250 for his slogan, "A Country That Prays Together Stays 
Together." 
</P>
<P>
Monica Che of Cypress High won fifth place and $200 for her entry of "If at 
First You Don't Succeed, Try Free Enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 students from 65 schools participated in the contest. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that this contest is a great opportunity for kids to express 
themselves and their feelings about this country," said Edward Rankin, 
executive director of the foundation. "The top winning slogans have been 
printed on red, white and blue paper for distribution in our foundation's 
announcements." 
</P>
<P>
The Patriotic Slogan contest was started by Walter Knott, founder of Knott's 
Berry Farm, in 1971. ALLISON SAMUELS

LOCAL CHP OFFICER GETS MEDAL OF VALOR

<P>
An Orange County California Highway Patrol officer who pulled a Seal Beach 
police officer from a burning squad car has been awarded the Medal of Valor, 
California's highest honor for its employees. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Michael Bernardin, assigned to the CHP's Westminster office, was one of 
six CHP officers given the award in a Sacramento ceremony on Friday, CHP 
spokesman Sam Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
The other recipients are state traffic officers Robert Welch, assigned to the 
Fresno area; Jeffrey Jones, the Indio area; Matthew Causie, the Ventura area; 
Javier Rocha, the San Francisco area; and John Meaders, the Verdugo Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
The Medal of Valor is given for an extraordinary act of heroism by a state 
employee, undertaken at great risk in an effort to save human life. 
</P>
<P>
Since the medal was first awarded, in 1959, it has gone to 67 members of the 
California Highway Patrol, including those honored today. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardin earned the honor for bravery during an Aug. 23, 1988, traffic 
accident involving an unidentified Seal Beach police officer. 
</P>
<P>
When Bernardin arrived at the scene, he found the unconscious officer trapped 
inside his burning squad car. Bernardin tried to douse the flames with a fire 
extinguisher but, after that attempt, he enlisted the help of two citizens to 
try to pull the victim out of the burning vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the screams of witnesses trying to warn him stay away from the intense 
heat, Bernardin cut the seat belt loose and dragged the officer to safety. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 seconds later, the police car was engulfed in flames. 
</P>
<P>
The Seal Beach officer later died from massive head injuries. Bernardin 
suffered minor smoke inhalation, but had no lasting injuries. JAMES M. GOMEZ

WEEKLY NEWSPAPER TO MAKE COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Beach News, a downtown weekly newspaper that suspended 
publication last month for the first time in its 85-year history, is expected 
to return to full circulation May 25 with a new look, Publisher Jack Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by new financial backing, the News will reappear as a full-sized 
broadsheet newspaper, abandoning the tabloid format it had adopted in recent 
years, Kelly said. He declined to disclose who is financing the paper's 
revival, saying he is still working out details of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Because of mounting debts and aging newsroom equipment, the News was on the 
edge of folding after failing to publish its scheduled April 6 issue. Recent 
editions each Friday have consisted of irregularly distributed two- or 
four-page sheets devoid of any staff-generated copy. Kelly said he produced the 
sheets only because of advertising obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said he hopes the changes will enable him to expand the News staff and 
circulation and improve editorial quality. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on various phases of a new business program, to see what we can 
do to achieve the goals that we've set," said Kelly, who bought the paper in 
September after serving on the Huntington Beach City Council between 1980 and 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper was founded in 1905, four years before the city was 
incorporated, by prominent businessman Ed Hoag. The News was purchased three 
years later by Minnie and Louis Paul Hart, who during the next decade 
transformed the publication into a vehicle for Progressive Party politics. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief ownership by James Conrad, James Farqahar bought the paper in 
1922, beginning a six-decade long ownership by the Farqahar family. Under 
Farqahar and his son, George, the News blossomed amid the city's oil boom, 
expanding into several sections by the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Its size and influence waned during the 1960s, however, mainly because of the 
ascent of larger, regional daily newspapers, local historian Barbara Milkovich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dandy paper until the last 10 or 15 years," Milkovich said. JOHN

CITY MAY HELP FUND GRAD NIGHT PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday night is scheduled to vote on a proposal to give 
$1,000 each to four city high schools to help fund their drug- and alcohol-free 
grad night parties. 
</P>
<P>
Grad night celebrations are held at high schools on the evenings of high school 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
The all-night parties, staged by parents, are designed to keep the new 
graduates from driving back and forth to numerous private parties, many of 
which might offer alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol has praised grad night events, saying they have 
helped reduce fatal accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Grace Winchell asked the city staff to look into the possibility 
of the city making a donation to grad night events. Winchell made her motion 
after Trudee Christensen, co-chairwoman of the Huntington Beach High parents' 
committee for grad night, spoke to the council last month. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Marina and Huntington Beach High, the other two regular high 
schools in the city are Ocean View and Edison High. All four have grad night 
events. BILL BILLITER

PLANNERS URGE MORE TREES, FEWER LAWNS

<P>
Deciding that they want less grass and more trees, city planners have 
recommended the adoption of an ordinance aimed at environmentally sensitive 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission decision, made Thursday, follows the release of a study 
showing that mowing, mulching and fertilizing turf grass ultimately hurts the 
environment more than the greenery's production of oxygen helps it. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will now take up the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The city's landscape planners say there are simply more water-efficient and 
environmentally sensitive ways to landscape the city than the way it is done 
now. To install and maintain just one acre of landscape each year, Irvine uses 
four acre-feet of water, enough for eight average families over a 12-month 
period. Studies show that 250 to 300 pounds of fertilizer and 102 gallons of 
gasoline for lawn mowers are also needed to maintain that single acre. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier draft of the ordinance detailed which plants could be grown and how 
much water might be used. Tim Kirkham, Irvine's landscape architect, said the 
new draft is not as specific. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that by spending additional time on the (specifics) that we will be 
able to build greater consensus," Kirkham said. "It's not backing off on the 
concept of the ordinance or the standards or guidelines. It needs another round 
of discussions before it's ready." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkham estimated that the specifics, contained in a manual, would be presented 
to the Planning Commission, possibly in three to four months. DANICA KIRKA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS APPROVE 9.4% WAGE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Tustin Educators Assn. approved a three-year contract on Friday by a margin 
of more than 2 to 1, union President Joyce Rohrbaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, to be considered Monday by the Tustin Unified School District 
board, was reached after more than 10 months of bitter contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
It gives the district's 430 teachers and counselors a 9.4% average salary 
increase retroactive to July 1, 1989, and guarantees that none will receive a 
raise of less than 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Increases for the second and third years of the contract would depend on state 
funds that the district receives for each student. The agreement stipulates, 
however, that if the average teacher's salary in Tustin is not in the top five 
of the 12 unified school districts in the county, salary levels would be 
increased by up to 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrbaugh said she expects that the teachers will resume participation in 
extracurricular activities and will again assign homework, which some had been 
boycotting to protest delays in the contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
But she said that many of the teachers are unhappy with the contract because 
they think there are inequities in its structure, and she said she doubts that 
it will raise morale. 
</P>
<P>
"Only when the teachers are made to feel important will the morale improve," 
Rohrbaugh said. SHANNON SANDS

2 ARTS GROUPS BETTER THEIR SCORES IN GRANT EVALUATIONS 
</P>

<P>
Two Orange County arts groups received higher ratings than last year, and four 
others lost no ground during annual evaluations Friday for California Arts 
Council grants. 
</P>
<P>
An advisory panel measured organizational as well as artistic strength using a 
four-point scale. It gave the Pacific Chorale, Pacific Symphony, Opera Pacific 
and Garden Grove Symphony ranks of 4-, 3, 3 and 2+, respectively, the same each 
received last year. The Master Chorale of Orange County went from 3 to 4-, and 
the South Coast Symphony went from 3- to 3. 
</P>
<P>
Arts council officials say the correlation between rankings and actual grants 
will depend on the size of the arts council budget, which will be determined 
this summer. In past years, grants have been awarded to groups with ranks of 3- 
and above. 
</P>
<P>
Panel members included John Alexander, artistic director of the Pacific 
Chorale. He left the room when his group was discussed, however. 
</P>
<P>
In talking about Opera Pacific late Thursday, Patricia Mitchell, deputy general 
director of the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, praised artistic director David 
DiChiera for "trying to move the repertory into a more serious direction with 
more emphasis on grand opera and less on musical theater." 
</P>
<P>
(Opera Pacific administrative director Patrick Flynn, observing the panel 
meeting, said the company's 1991 season could be its first with no musical at 
all. He explained that the troupe wants to "broaden its operatic repertory" and 
that there are few musicals available. There will be an announcement on the 
choices in a few weeks, Flynn said.) 
</P>
<P>
Opera Pacific received $41,880 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Panelists praised Pacific Symphony's performances and its "high standards," but 
they said they are concerned about the 11-year-old orchestra's accumulated 
deficit of $711,271 (its budget is $4.7 million). 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, with a new music director in place, they can get on with the 
business of reducing this deficit," said Berkeley pianist Rae Imamura. Carl St. 
Clair was hired in February, ending a two-year search to replace founding music 
director Keith Clark. St. Clair will assume the post in October. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra received $39,319 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tere Romo, manager of the arts council Organizational Support Program, noted 
that while the boards of both the orchestra and opera company grew over the 
past year, the number of minorities on those boards did not. Board diversity 
has been a major arts council concern and a criterion for awarding grants. 
</P>
<P>
Panelists applauded, though, the increase in the number of minority artists 
hired by the opera (from 482 to 511) and Pacific Symphony's programming of a 
work by Jose Pablo Moncayo, a major Latino composer. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the orchestra and opera troupe will each be given another ranking for 
community outreach, and that will affect their overall scores. Further, all 
rankings are subject to approval by the full council late this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The two chorales, the South Coast Symphony and the Garden Grove Symphony were 
discussed earlier in the week.

MAN GETS 26-YEAR TERM IN TEEN-AGE SEX CASE 
</P>

<P>
An Anaheim man who was facing up to 113 years in prison on sex charges pleaded 
guilty Friday to all 107 counts in exchange for a 26-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis S. Hirt, 34, was accused of having sex with two teen-age girls he 
promised to make rich in pornographic movies, a cult follower who was convinced 
he was a channel for dead spirits, and his stepdaughter. 
</P>
<P>
The stepdaughter was 13 when the first of the acts occurred, the cult follower 
was 15, and the other two were 16 and 17. 
</P>
<P>
The 107 counts included sodomy, oral copulation, forced sex, fraud and 
conspiracy. A co-defendant, 19-year-old Timothy Byrd of Anaheim, had already 
pleaded guilty to helping procure the oldest girl for Hirt and having sex with 
her. He was placed on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Police searched Hirt's house last year after the stepdaughter's mother filed a 
complaint. Police said they found videotaped evidence of him engaged in sex 
with other young girls. 
</P>
<P>
Hirt, who lived on a disability pension because of a bad back, allegedly spent 
much of his time at the beach trying to persuade young women to have sex with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"He told (the two girls seen in the videotape) that he could make them millions 
as porno queens, but first they had to give him a private screen test," 
prosecutor Harper said. "These are poor girls; they fell for it." 
</P>
<P>
With the 15-year-old cult follower, Harper said, it was a matter of playing on 
her weakness. 
</P>
<P>
"He convinced her that the dead spirits wanted her to have sex with him," 
Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
Tandy Jackson of San Francisco, the father of the girl whose mother married 
Hirt, said he is not happy with the plea agreement because it won't keep Hirt 
behind bars long enough. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's ever free, I tell you, I'll just waste him; that's how angry I am," 
Jackson said. "My daughter is just destroyed by this. She will never trust 
anyone again." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Harper said she could understand the father's concern, but that if a 
sentence is reasonable -- 26 years is a stronger sentence than the standard for 
first-degree murder, which is 25 to life -- it's better to accept a guilty plea 
so the victims will not have to go through a trial. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was formally issued Friday by Superior Court Judge Donald A. 
McCartin.

EX-SDSU PLAYER SUES SCHOOL, COACH;

FOOTBALL: MIKE SPINELLO, FROM MISSION VIEJO HIGH, CLAIMS SAN DIEGO STATE COACH 
AL LUGINBILL RENEGED ON SCHOLARSHIP OFFER.

<P>
A former San Diego State football player is suing the school and Coach Al 
Luginbill over what he says was a broken promise to award him a partial 
athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing will be held Monday in San Diego Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Spinello, a linebacker from Mission Viejo High School, has charged that 
Luginbill reneged in February, 1989, on an oral agreement to award him a $2,000 
scholarship. Spinello, who had five tackles as a freshman reserve in 1988, left 
the team and withdrew from SDSU shortly thereafter. He later enrolled at Orange 
Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, Spinello is due unspecified damages for breach of 
contract, fraud and emotional distress. He also is seeking punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Lam, the lawyer representing SDSU and Luginbill, said she could not 
comment. Luginbill was out of town and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Spinello said the promise of a scholarship was 
made by Mike Nelson, a former assistant coach (mistakenly referred to as head 
coach in the suit), when he was recruiting Spinello in the spring of 1988. 
Spinello said he was told by Nelson that he would receive a $2,000 scholarship 
if he enrolled in the fall semester of 1988 at his own expense and completed a 
three-unit course, not in physical education, in the intersession period 
between the fall and spring semesters or in summer school. 
</P>
<P>
The scholarship would be renewable based on successful participation in 
football, plus specific academic considerations. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in January, charges that the school and Luginbill went back on 
the agreement after Denny Stolz was fired as coach in November, 1988, and 
replaced by Luginbill, a former associate athletic director at the school. 
Luginbill did not retain Nelson, who is now a Stanford football assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Spinello could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Margaret Cahill, said 
she could not comment.

AUSTRALIAN PUTS CITIZENS, EL CAMINO BANKS UP FOR SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Pratt, the Australian industrialist who once planned on turning his 
holdings in two Orange County banks into a $1-billion banking chain along the 
Southern California coast, has instead put the banks up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Six to 10 institutions, including Wells Fargo Bank, are negotiating for the 
acquisition of Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa and El Camino Bank in Anaheim, two 
of the larger and well-operated banks in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We are carrying on detailed discussions with a short list of buyers," said 
Eugene Schutt, president of the banks' holding company, Citizens Holdings in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"But we don't expect that we will be reaching a final agreement with any party 
for a number of weeks, and we don't expect a transaction to be closed before 
December." 
</P>
<P>
Schutt would not identify the prospective buyers, but other sources at the 
banks confirmed that Wells Fargo and the New York leveraged buyout firm of 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. are among the interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to comment on possible acquisitions, 
while officials at KKR could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a sale of the holding company has upset top managers at the 
banks, who fear they would be laid off if the banks were sold to a major 
financial institution such as Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is we hope it doesn't happen," said Stanley Pawlowski, El Camino's 
chairman. While Pawlowski could easily retire, other managers were planning on 
staying longer. Richard Helstrom, for instance, was hired as president only 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens Bank Chairman Paige V. Simpson, who was the architect of Citizens 
Holdings' growth plan, speculated that top executives would stay if KKR or 
another investor purchased the bank as part of a strategy to build a larger 
banking enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt had planned to acquire separately operated small banks from Long Beach to 
the Mexican border and create a banking company with $1 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
"Our overwhelming preference is for a new owner to carry on the same strategic 
plan we started," Schutt said. Under one prospective deal, he said, Pratt would 
remain a minority owner in the banking company. 
</P>
<P>
Schutt said Citizens Holdings, owned through a maze of companies in a trust for 
Pratt's three children, is one of the Pratt family's diversified investment 
holdings. Schutt said Pratt's decision to sell the banks was made for 
investment purposes.

"As an investor, we have a right to sell at an appropriate moment," said 
Schutt, who oversees both Pratt family investments here and the Pratt Group 
corrugated-paper production facilities in this country. "The value in the banks 
is rock solid, and we have had a share in making them larger, stronger and more 
valuable. We've been good shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Together, the banks had $269 million in assets at the end of December and 
earned a combined $4.7 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason why the Pratt family decided to sell the banks is because most 
of its investments are located in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Schutt, who was with Pratt's merchant bank in Hong Kong, came to Orange County 
to head Citizens Holdings four years ago when Pratt acquired Citizens Bank for 
about $12 million. Two years ago, the company launched its aggressive growth 
effort by buying El Camino for $17.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But two other deals that same year -- for Eldorado Bank in Tustin and for 
Rancho Santa Fe National Bank in San Diego County -- fell apart when new 
federal regulations on bank holding companies made it economically unfeasible 
to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the Pratt Group acquired 200,000 acres of timberland, a plywood mill 
and a paper mill near Macon, Ga. It sold the timberland and plywood mill to 
concentrate on recycling paper products to make corrugated containers. It 
recently built a paper mill in Indiana devoted strictly to recycling paper.

Patty Mickey is not one to take no for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
Her Costa Mesa PMA Design Group had created an unusual stair rail design for 
Lee West's elegantly appointed condominium on the Lido Peninsula. Several 
carpenters said it couldn't be done, but interior designer Mickey persisted. 
</P>
<P>
What was it about the design that made carpenters reluctant to try? 
</P>
<P>
The wooden handrail had unusual curves and no corner support post at the top 
where the rail was to curve up as if doubling back on itself. Instead, the 
handrail's curving shape would provide the support. 
</P>
<P>
Double beveled glass panels that had to be individually measured and cut were 
to be used instead of balusters. Mini-lights were to be installed at the bottom 
of the panels and a bridge repeating these materials was to connect the 
upstairs landing with the master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Then Mickey found master cabinetmaker Tres Converse of Laguna Beach. Even 
Converse was reluctant at first, but rather than being stumped, he welcomed the 
project as a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
To create the handrail, he had to do forms and layouts for the exact curvature 
and then create it on site by heating, bending, clamping and laminating 
together thin strips of white oak. The result "really comes off like a piece of 
sculpture," Mickey says. 
</P>
<P>
Why go to all this trouble for a stairway? 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible what a strong statement a stairway and its design make in a 
home," says Veronica Lorman, a Newport Beach interior designer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a really powerful piece of architecture and really sets the tone or helps 
to set the tone for the interior design," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is important that (a stairway) blend with everything else that 
you're doing in terms of finishes and details with the windows and the moldings 
and baseboards," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
Several things need to be considered when designing a staircase, according to 
Andrea Holte Hymer of Hymer Design Group in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Important considerations are: the shape of the staircase, whether it is to be 
simple or intricate in design, selection of materials, traffic patterns, 
whether a staircase should be solid or made so that it is open and provides a 
view of the rooms beyond and whether it should be dramatic or blend passively 
into the background. 
</P>
<P>
Materials selection, Hymer says, is based on a house's interior and exterior 
style. Materials can be weed, brick, glass, plaster or drywall and metals such 
as wrought iron or aluminum dipped or painted with faux finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Hymer worked with homeowner Nadine Tardie to create a charming stairway for her 
custom Victorian in Orange. Though Tardie jokingly refers to the stairway as "a 
plain Jane," it really sets the tone for her home because it's the first thing 
you see when you come in the door. Tardie decided on the style of the stairway 
after looking at a parts catalogue for stairs. 
</P>
<P>
The handrail and the treds are oak. A wool carpet with a burgundy background 
and a ribbon and flower motif in mauves and gray blues runs up the center of 
the steps. The delicate-looking turned balusters are painted white and an 
adjoining wall is painted a rose color. 
</P>
<P>
The stairs run straight up to a landing and then make a 180-degree turn up to 
the second floor, where a matching railing runs parallel to the stairs. Tardie 
says the treds, railing and carpet totaled about $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Stairways are such an important design element, according to Lorman, that 
remodeling an existing stairway can give an older home a whole new look. She 
recently completed a project in a 1960s-era condominium in Corona del Mar that 
she says was quite unattractive when she started. 
</P>
<P>
The existing stairway had treds that were painted dark brown and had a carpet 
runner. There was a metal structure to hold the handrail, which was a 
rectangular piece of wood painted brown. And there was an odd open space under 
the stairs that served no purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Lorman set out to change this dated look. She had the odd space enclosed for 
storage and had a carpenter create a simple new rail system using molding 
pieces instead of stock handrail parts. "Once you find the molding, you can put 
it together to create this shape as opposed to having to mill something that 
would have the kind of detail that's in this," she says. 
</P>
<P>
This neoclassical design features a whitewashed oak handrail atop a series of 
groupings of three square posts followed by a small separation before repeating 
the grouping. The posts are painted white and the handrail matches flooring in 
the entry. The stairs are now covered with a soft gray carpet. "It just turned 
out so well," says Lorman. "It made the biggest difference in this space, I 
cannot tell you." 
</P>
<P>
Some homeowners who want to remodel stairways are tackling the job themselves, 
according to Todd Skinner, general manager of the Hardwood Center in Santa Ana, 
which sells oak and paint-grade stair parts and other finish materials such as 
moldings and doors. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this growing trend toward people doing it themselves," Skinner says. 
"In fact, we give classes two or three times a year on installing a stairway." 
He says he gets at least one customer a day who plans a do-it-yourself stair 
remodel. 
</P>
<P>
Most people, he says, just want to change a handrail to give a home an updated 
look. Skinner says there's sometimes "sticker shock" when he tells them that 
materials for basic handrails and posts or balusters average $60 a linear foot. 
That means $60 times two for each linear foot, because there are two sides to 
most stairways. 
</P>
<P>
He says hiring someone to do installation will at least double that cost and 
that's why a lot of people decide to try it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
How hard is it? 
</P>
<P>
"It's really not that difficult," Skinner says. "We tell people it's just 
something you can't rush into and expect to get it done because it's a 
structural project. . . . It's not something you can just screw together and 
put down real quick." And, he admonishes, do-it-yourself stair remodelers 
should have "a basic knowledge of woodworking" and need to check on city 
building codes regarding stairways. 
</P>
<P>
Handrails, for instance, usually are required to be around two inches wide so 
that they are easy to hold on to and balusters usually must be "six-inch on 
center," which means that there is no space between them where a six-inch 
sphere can fit through. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeowners who are opting for stairway remodels are not interested in 
do-it-yourself. Rod Bradfield of Bradfield Manufacturing, Inc. in Santa Ana 
says that between 10% and 15% of his work is remodeling old stairways and 80% 
of his business is residential. Bradfield's company manufactures and installs 
metal handrails and circular metal stairways with all steel construction. 
</P>
<P>
Accessories available for metal stairs include bronze, marble or wood pieces 
that can be laminated to handrails or treds. The price range for these welded 
creations is "somewhere between $2,000 and a hundred grand," according to 
Bradfield. 
</P>
<P>
An example of a $2,000 stair would be a spiral stair that is five feet in 
diameter and might be used outside from a second-story deck to a patio deck. A 
$100,000 stair might be 12 to 14 feet tall, with glass panels and solid 
stainless-steel handrails, all polished to a chrome sheen and marble treds, 
according to Bradfield. 
</P>
<P>
Remodeling a stairway may include changing a handrail or even removing wood or 
metal stairs and installing a whole new metal stairway. 
</P>
<P>
"Curved stairs can buy you a lot of space if they are done right," he says. 
"You gain more space a lot of times if you take out a straight stair and put in 
a curved one." He says the extra space can then be used to enlarge an entryway, 
bedroom or bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
All rails and stairways are done on a custom basis, he says, because the 
measurements in each house are different. Parts may be forged or cast and then 
welded together. 
</P>
<P>
And metal stairs are not just for contemporary homes, according to Bradfield. 
He says texturing and casting items can create even English or French 
provincial stylings on the metal. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Sims is a partner with his brother Bob Sims in American Ironcraft in 
Orange, which manufactures and installs spiral metal stairs and handrails. He 
says he also does a fair amount of remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
Sims says sometimes he needs to remove an old stair railing and add some design 
features to it "and reinstall it or, in some cases, we've taken out their 
existing rails and started from scratch and built new ones." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of removing stair rails and replacing them with a new metal ones 
ranges from $15 a linear foot, for each side of the stair rail, to $400 a 
linear foot and more, according to Sims. 
</P>
<P>
Existing metal rails can be enhanced by adding detail such as forged S scrolls 
or by welding on pre-made designs of aluminum on to the old rails. Sometimes, 
he says, this can be done without even removing the existing rails. 
</P>
<P>
Metal stair rails and stairs are usually painted a color to match the interior 
or another contrasting color. Bradfield says: "Painting iron black is a thing 
of the past, hopefully. It sure made a lot of it ugly when it could have been 
nice. Black paint also covers up a lot of sore spots. Lousy craftsmanship is 
easily hid with black paint." 
</P>
<P>
Craftsmanship and careful planning do seem to be the key to a successfully 
executed stairway. 
</P>
<P>
Patty Mickey says the original plan for West's stairway called for a basic wood 
turned-post stair rail. "We thought it was too traditional and a little too 
ordinary" for this home, she says. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, West got a stairway that dramatically sets the tone for a house 
with such appointments as a refrigerated wine cellar tucked beneath the 
stairway and a powder room with walls and ceiling hand-painted in a richly 
textured faux ostrich skin finish. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically what I was looking for," West says of the stairway. "I wanted 
something unique and totally different. I love the fact that the lights are in 
it. . . . The lights light up the beveled glass and it's just gorgeous at 
night."

Helen Guiltinan couldn't believe her luck. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband John had traveled Europe taking photographs and researching 
how they could create an authentic 17th-Century living room for their custom 
French chateau-style house to be built in Cowan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
And here was an antique dealer offering her an opportunity to purchase, from a 
photograph, an exquisite antique green marble fireplace front that appeared to 
be an exact copy of one she had seen in France's famed Versailles. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't even begin to think what a fit we had," recalls Guiltinan. "John and 
I saw this (the original) and took pictures of it in Versailles before we ever 
found this." 
</P>
<P>
This passion to find just the right antique fireplace front is not all that 
unusual. Buck Bradley searched for an antique fireplace for his Orange home for 
three years before he finally found the one he wanted. The circa 1870 piece is 
made of dark-finished oak, has beautiful hand carving, an oval mirror and came 
from the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Barbee had already purchased an antique oak fireplace for his Santa Ana 
home when he located another he liked even better because of its delicately 
carved columns and classic lines indicating its origins in the South in the 
1870s. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Vincent Di Biasi of Vincent Di Biasi Architects in Irvine designs a 
lot of traditional style homes and says clients often want antique fireplaces. 
Usually the client goes out and finds the fireplace, and it's the architect's 
job to incorporate it into the design. One home he designed two years ago in 
Irvine has five antique fireplaces, each carefully selected by the homeowner 
for specific rooms of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Antique fireplaces (including the mantle and other construction framing the 
opening of a firebox) are popular in Orange County. Homeowners find that an 
antique fireplace is a charming, one-of-a-kind focal point on which to base the 
design of a room. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, old fireplace fronts are so popular that prices have risen 300% in the 
last couple of years, according to Kay Keddie, whose Liberty Bell Antiques in 
Orange specializes in selling them. 
</P>
<P>
And they are getting harder to find because fewer become available as their 
value grows, Orange County antique dealers say. 
</P>
<P>
American-made oak fireplaces are perhaps most available. French and English 
fireplaces, which might be wood, marble or even pewter, are more difficult to 
find these days as more Europeans decide to hold onto these handcrafted works. 
</P>
<P>
But several antique dealers in Orange County are able to keep at least a few of 
the popular items in stock. Prices range from around $300 for a small mantle to 
$15,000 and far beyond for fireplaces with intricate and unusual craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Guiltinan declines to say what she paid for her marble masterpiece but says, "I 
could probably not buy this for $125,000 today." 
</P>
<P>
Her fireplace, which measures just under nine feet across and stands seven feet 
high, is a stunning combination of swirling black-green and soft-green colors. 
It took six men to lift the top piece of the mantle into place. The casting 
style of the gold-colored cast bronze adornments -- the head of Hercules, a 
medallion with Zeus, Napoleonic lions and cornucopias of fruit -- indicate that 
it is 150 to 250 years old, according to Guiltinan. 
</P>
<P>
It may sound imposing and a bit ornate, but Guiltinan, an interior decorator, 
has made it work. The fireplace is the centerpiece of a room filled with 
antiques and clever reproductions, and it has soft gold-colored walls that seem 
bathed in light. 
</P>
<P>
Plaster acanthus leaves painted with gold leaf ring the ceiling and on the same 
wall as the fireplace there is a trompe l'oeil (painting that fools the eye), 
of what Guiltinan calls her "Renaissance Man," that greets those entering the 
room. With French marches playing in the background, it seems that at any 
minute the Three Musketeers or the Count of Monte Cristo will dash into the 
room, swords in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Guiltinan says that many people are overwhelmed by the sight of the fireplace 
at first. But then they "start to look at it" she says and they see "it's not a 
cold marble fireplace. It's filled with character. It has life and depth." 
</P>
<P>
The oak fireplace front in Barbee's family room may not be as elaborate as 
Guiltinan's, but he seems just as happy with it. "I had never seen one exactly 
like that, but in my mind I had envisioned what I wanted to own," says the Los 
Angeles County fire fighter. "I have a lot of old, large oak pieces. I wanted 
to redo this room, and I wanted something that would stand out." 
</P>
<P>
The fireplace stands about eight feet high and is a bit more than five feet 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
To install it, Barbee added a layer of bricks over an existing brick fireplace 
and a raised hearth, in a pattern popular in the late 1800s. Barbee used wood 
wedges to fit the oak fireplace tightly against the ceiling. He then covered 
the wedges with wood molding. 
</P>
<P>
Barbee also kept the first fireplace he found, which is made of tiger oak 
(circa 1880). He's creating a fake fireplace in his living room, using antique 
oak bedrails to form a frame for a brick hearth. Then he will use an antique 
tin ceiling and an old stained-glass window, which he will light, to fill the 
fireplace opening. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, a mechanical engineer, also collects antiques. He chose his 
7-by-6-foot oak fireplace front because it had just enough carving to suit him 
and because the grain of the wood was the finest he had seen. Others he saw had 
either too much carving or not enough. This one cost him about $5,500, and 
removal of an old fireplace mantle and installation of the new one was about 
$1,800. 
</P>
<P>
The antique wood fireplace had to be lifted off the floor to keep it the proper 
distance from the opening of the existing firebox. He decided on a peach marble 
hearth to complement peach-colored ceramic tile on the floor of his family 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Di Biasi says installing antique fireplace fronts can be tricky. One 
problem with wood fireplace fronts is that combustible materials must be kept 
to a minimum of a foot from the opening of fireboxes. In some instances, the 
size of the opening of antique fireplace fronts might require the firebox 
openings to be too small. "So the scale you have to work in, everything 
changes," he says, " . . the sizes of the flues . . . the amount of the masonry 
you have to use." 
</P>
<P>
His solution to this problem in the Irvine house with five antique fireplaces 
was to make the fireboxes deeper and gain the distance horizontally rather than 
vertically. 
</P>
<P>
The fireplaces in that house include: an 1880s 11-foot-high French dark walnut 
fireplace with a 26-inch-high clock carved into the mantle, about $15,000; a 
delicate French walnut mantle with a faced carved into it, about $4,000; a dark 
oak French fireplace front with a motto in French -- "do what you must, suffer 
what you will and you will have wisdom and virtue" -- painted across it in gold 
leaf, circa 1880s; a 1900 pewter fireplace front from England; and an English 
dark oak fireplace front with intricate carving. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Erickson, manager of Lyman Drake Antiques in Santa Ana, says that anyone 
purchasing an antique fireplace front should work closely on installation plans 
with someone familiar with the pertinent fire codes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a number of times through the years where people have bought one 
and . . . they've run into problems and not been able to use them," Erickson 
says. People sometimes get carried away, especially at auctions he says, and 
purchase an antique fireplace without understanding the problems of getting one 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
Lyman Drake currently has about eight antique English and French mantles in 
stock, ranging in price from $600 to $7,500, according to Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
Liberty Bell Antiques in Orange specializes in American wood fireplace fronts 
and usually has about 50 in stock. Keddie, who owns the business with partner 
Bela Spanyol, says they used to be able to purchase fireplace fronts by the 
truckload, 100 at a time. Those she has in stock now range from $295 to 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur Leeper of Leeper's Antiques in Orange says, "I don't have very many 
anymore. It's hard to get them." But he adds, "We sell all we can get. We have 
only two now. That's the least we've ever had." In the past, he says, he's sold 
"hundreds and hundreds." 
</P>
<P>
He thinks that part of the reduced availability is because fewer old homes and 
buildings are being torn down these days. 
</P>
<P>
And Erickson says that in the last five years the French have developed an 
appreciation for their own antique fireplace fronts. "We are now in competition 
with the home market to purchase these, where before . . . these houses were 
demolished and the mantles didn't have much value and it was quite easy to come 
upon them." 
</P>
<P>
But even this reduced availability is not likely to stop the search of 
determined homeowners who want just the right antique fireplace to add richness 
to their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Keddie, for instance, decided to specialize in the fireplaces when she had 
difficulty finding the right one for her home. Eventually she found one that 
gave her "goose bumps" the first time she saw it. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I would own it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
This one-of-a-kind fireplace front with intricate carving by a master Italian 
craftsman has a light tiger oak finish and is the focal point of Keddie's home. 
</P>
<P>
She says she's been offered as much as $45,000 for this 1875 fireplace, but she 
still says no sale. "I wouldn't take any kind of money for it," Keddie says. 
</P>

A STROLL IN BROOKDALE;

<P>
TOUR TO SHOWCASE 1920S-1930S HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When residents of Brookdale Place in Fullerton open their doors today for the 
YWCA of North Orange County's 50th Home and Garden Tour, they will be offering 
visitors a glimpse of Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 17 homes on the tour were built before 1930 and, although they have 
been remodeled over the years to accommodate growing families and modern 
conveniences, they have retained much of their original architectural detail. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of integrity in the remodeling," said Patricia Straube, a 
Fullerton interior designer and chairwoman of the YWCA event. "Everybody who 
moves there feels a responsibility to key their remodeling to the style of the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
Those who participate in the walking tour from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. will see an 
eclectic mix of architectural styles, from Spanish Colonial Revival to English 
country cottage -- perhaps a reflection of the diverse backgrounds of early 
residents, Straube said. 
</P>
<P>
The 300 and 400 blocks of jacaranda-lined West Brookdale Place -- part of a 
city-designated historic district -- were selected as the home tour site 
"because this area has always been known as a very charming neighborhood," 
Straube explained. "It's one of several unique communities in Fullerton that 
have an identity." 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood was developed as "Brookdale Heights" in the 1920s by Lois 
Weber, an actress who became known as the first female movie director, and her 
husband, Capt. Harry Gantz, a retired World War I Army officer who had acquired 
the land when he bought the El Dorado Ranch in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Lots originally were advertised for $1,500 to $3,000, and houses were priced at 
$8,000 to $9,000 -- an upscale project at the time. The neighborhood, later 
promoted as "Hospitality Lane," wasn't fully developed until the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
On another part of their acreage, the Gantzes built a Spanish-style residence 
with a tower retreat for Weber, a prolific screenwriter who became a 
controversial figure after forming her own production company to make films on 
such topics as birth control, abortion, infidelity and interracial 
relationships. The house was bought in 1931 by C. Stanley Chapman, son of 
Fullerton's first mayor, and remained in the Chapman family until its donation 
recently to Cal State Fullerton for use by the college president. 
</P>

The former Gantz home won't be on today's home and garden tour, but the era 
during which Weber made such films as "Angel of Broadway," "The Sensation 
Seekers" and "What Do Men Want?" is recalled in Brookdale homes dating as far 
back as 1923. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy Kelsey, who moved to Brookdale Place seven years ago with her husband, 
Frank, and their two children, said they were drawn to the neighborhood by its 
sense of history. 
</P>
<P>
"We liked the older, classic, unique kinds of homes," she said. "We liked the 
feeling of an old neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
The Kelseys added a second story with bay windows that give the exterior of 
their 1939 home a New England-style look, but they maintained the original 
character of the home by preserving its hardwood floors and wood-framed windows 
and using traditional molding as an accent in the entryway and dining room. 
Straube helped them create an American country look in the living and dining 
rooms, both of which will be open to visitors today. 
</P>
<P>
Kelsey, who helped organize the tour, said the neighborhood's residents are a 
mix of young families who are relatively new on the block and older couples who 
have lived there 20 to 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
They all come together several times a year for block parties, and at Christmas 
for a cookie exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very close neighborhood, which is why we were able to pull this home 
tour off," Straube noted. "There was a lot of camaraderie that we could draw 
upon." 
</P>
<P>
Even residents whose homes won't be open today have been sprucing up their 
gardens for the occasion, Kelsey said. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $20 each and can be purchased from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the YWCA 
House, 321 N. Pomona Ave., Fullerton, or at one of the three admission tables 
along the two-block tour (at Richman, Highland and Ford) from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Box lunches will be sold for $5 each at the concession area near Ford Avenue 
and Brookdale Place. 
</P>
<P>
Parking will be available on adjacent streets. Shuttle service from the rear 
parking area of Fullerton City Hall, 303 W. Commonwealth Ave., will be provided 
for seniors or people with walking difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the event will support projects of the YWCA of North Orange 
County, including child care and youth employment services. For more 
information, call (714) 871-4488.

ON THE WATERFRONT: BOAT LOVERS BUY THE OLD, FIX THEM UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Life.

When Henry Wheeler began looking at new boats, he couldn't find anything he 
liked. For one thing, most new boats are made of fiberglass and Wheeler wanted 
wood. He also liked the traditional lines of older vessels. So Wheeler bought a 
used boat and hired a yacht restorer to renovate the vessel from stem to stern. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more boat lovers like Wheeler are opting to fix up the old rather than 
buy the new. 
</P>
<P>
"Restoring a boat is more difficult than building a new boat," says Bob Steel, 
the man in charge of the two-year project that will transform Wheeler's 64-foot 
sailboat into something "better than new." 
</P>
<P>
Steel and his seven-person crew have been working on the boat for 18 months and 
expect to have it completed by September. First the hull had to be taken down 
to bare wood and refinished and the boat's teak decks were replaced. The crew 
is now working on the boat's interior. 
</P>
<P>
"To do a boat restoration properly, you have to keep it as close to the 
original as possible," says Steel, who runs a Costa Mesa company called 
Maritime Outfitters. "But in doing that you can marry the old traditional ways 
with new technology while relying on old-world craftsmanship." 
</P>
<P>
One way Steel plans to do that is by using some of today's newest and strongest 
materials, such as titanium, which will be used to make the spreaders on the 
ship's mast. He also is coating the boat's wooden bottom with an 
environmentally safe paint that contains no anti-fouling ingredients or 
solvents that could pollute the water. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he is strengthening the rigging so that the boat can carry some of 
today's high-tech sails, which are often stronger than the hardware that holds 
them, he says. "Old sails could disintegrate. Now the new ones are almost 
bulletproof and won't fail. The rigging could fail before the sails would. So 
(in an old boat) you have to have rigging to carry the new sails that are made 
of new, stronger materials." 
</P>
<P>
Whether you call it restoration or renovation, nearly everyone involved in such 
boat work agrees that it requires lots of patience, lots of skill and lots of 
money. Although Steel would not reveal the exact budget of the restoration 
project he is conducting, he says that typical restorations can cost hundreds 
of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Vanderwater, a marine carpenter who has been working on a 66-foot 
powerboat for a year and a half, says: "Any client we have is in the 
millionaire status." Vanderwater, who has his own marine carpentry business in 
Costa Mesa, says his work on the boat involved remodeling three heads, three 
staterooms and an entire galley. "We even built a refrigerator, every inch of 
it from beginning to end," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The boat, which is owned by Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Farrah of Long Beach, has a 
steel hull and teak upper deck and was originally built in 1965 in Holland. The 
restoration project was under the direction of Sheryl Bretz of Yachts of Class, 
a marine design firm in Newport Beach. "Our goal was to keep the classic look 
of the boat," Bretz says. "It even looks older than it really is." 
</P>
<P>
Bretz designed all the interior structural changes, including custom tables and 
settees, then hired a crew of four carpenters to work on the project. "The 
whole interior was redone," she says. "There were structural changes in every 
single room. It was challenging, believe me. Everything on a boat is a 
challenge. There are no straight lines and everything has to be custom made. 
You don't just go out and buy furniture." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Bretz cites the custom teak cocktail table built by Vanderwater 
at a cost of about $6,000. The table had to follow the line of the settee and 
so is wider at one end than it is at the other. In addition, the table is 
convertible and can be raised to dining table height when needed. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Ambrose of Newport Woodworking compares boat restorations to redesigning 
a house. "Usually the owner gets a designer. And then you bring in the various 
trades -- upholsterers, carpenters, shipwrights. On the upper end, where you 
have these mega yachts -- the million-dollar-plus yachts -- the owners will buy 
one and then change it to his personal preference. That makes up about 30% of 
our work for us." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to renovating mega yachts, Ambrose says he does a lot of custom 
built-ins. "The majority of our customers are building something in -- like a 
nice master stateroom with a built-in TV." Last year Ambrose says he built in a 
giant TV monitor on a 45-foot powerboat owned by a television producer who 
worked on "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
Building something into the cramped quarters of a boat is always a challenge, 
says Dwayne Irvin of South Coast Marine, a Costa Mesa company that does custom 
woodworking. "On a boat you are conscious of every inch and how it works in 
proportion to the interior and how it will function to do what it is supposed 
to do and to give you storage. The design has to make all the compromise you 
need to make and still not make you feel crowded or uncomfortable. Almost 
everything you put into a boat has to function in many ways. From a building 
standpoint, you can't get any more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest challenges facing such craftsmen is trying to figure out how 
to build in as much storage space as possible when doing a remodeling job. 
"They (boat owners) discover that they don't have as much storage space as at 
home. And they want to know if we can put in a shelf here or enlarge this," 
says Chris Shelley, owner of C. Chris Shelley Woodworks in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
When faced with such a job, Shelley says: "The first concern is that the boat 
should look as if it has always been that way. It shouldn't look as if it has 
been added on."

TRAGIC 'MUSICA DOLOROSA' ECHOES LATVIA'S POLITICAL STRUGGLE; 
</P>
<P>
COMPOSER: PETERIS VASKS' MUSIC, TO BE PLAYED IN ORANGE AND COSTA MESA, WAS 
WRITTEN IN MEMORY OF HIS SISTER. BUT MAYBE, HE SAYS, IT IS A CRY OF PAIN -- 
PERHAPS THAT OF HIS TROUBLED COUNTRY.

<P>
As the tension surrounding Latvia's May 4 declaration of independence from the 
Soviet Union escalates, one person watching the news with special concern is 
Latvian composer Peteris Vasks. 
</P>
<P>
"Friends and relatives and countrymen are keeping me informed all the time," 
Vasks said in a phone interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
Vasks is making his first trip to the United States and will be stopping in 
Orange on Sunday and Costa Mesa on Monday to hear his "Musica Dolorosa" played 
by the Orange County Chamber Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
In Latvia, "composers and writers are paralyzed in their creativity, in being 
able to work as they would like," Vasks said in the three-way phone interview 
in which he often outpaced his translator. 
</P>
<P>
"In the present situation, with the to-be-or-not-to-be (independence), it is 
very difficult for them. . . . Some of them are also actively involved in the 
political scene. If I had political talents, I would take part too." 
</P>
<P>
Vasks feels, however, that the only thing he has to offer is "my musical 
talent. . . . I am very happy that I have the opportunity of representing my 
country so that Americans can know it exists." 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1946, Vasks grew up in an educated family. His mother was a doctor; his 
father, a Baptist minister -- in a country dominated by Lutherans, in so far as 
religion is practiced at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Religious families weren't considered trustworthy under the (communist) 
regime," Vasks recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he said, a period of "neo-Stalinism" in 1959 "put (its) mark on 
everything, including culture." 
</P>
<P>
"In 1964, I was not accepted into the Latvian conservatory (of music) because I 
was too outspoken. Yes, I've been very stubborn." 
</P>
<P>
Over time, however, Vasks has become a respected, state-supported composer. But 
respect does not mean great material success. Vasks lives with his wife and 
five children in a modest apartment in Riga. They cook on a wood-burning stove, 
according to Orange County Chamber Orchestra conductor Micah Levy, who went to 
Latvia last May to conduct the Chamber Orchestra of the State Symphony of Riga 
in works by American composers. (Levy came back a staunch Vasks enthusiast.) 
</P>
<P>
Says Vasks: "Composers all work a little bit in schools and such things. We 
have a cultural ministry and it has a budget to purchase works from composers. 
It does make it possible to live." 
</P>
<P>
Vasks' music has a strong nationalistic element, but he has also learned the 
techniques of 12-tone and serial music. "I have utilized whatever is 
appropriate to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, he named American composer George Crumb, an exponent of tone 
color and mysticism, as being "very influential" on him. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a sense of closeness to eternity," Vasks said. "Any music that comes 
from the heart has some connection with something higher. It is a creation from 
something spiritual. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to show in my music some kind of eternal harmony, something spiritual, 
that life can be beautiful, not how ugly it is. That's why I write music. I 
have no other wish than whatever I've written would please someone." 
</P>
<P>
Vasks described "Musica Dolorosa" as "one of my more tragic works." He wrote it 
in memory of his sister, Marta, who died of cancer in her early 40s. 
</P>
<P>
"It is maybe a cry of pain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While this is his first trip to the United States, last April he crossed the 
East-West border for the first time in a visit to Germany. "My first impression 
in the free world was of the stores and everything that was available," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"My first impression here? The harmony between people and nature impressed me. 
I had had the impression that all was rocks and stone. I was surprised at all 
the beauty here." 
</P>
<P>
He is cautiously optimistic about the political changes in Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the paths will be open now to a lot of future contact," he said. 
"Nothing can be more wonderful than having harmony among people. I'm just happy 
when I did leave and saw other parts of the world where freedom is." 
</P>
<P>
 Peteris Vasks' "Musica Dolorosa" will be played by the Orange County Chamber 
Orchestra under the direction of Micah Levy Sunday at 4 p.m. at the St. Joseph 
Center (Loyola Marymount University), 480 S. Batavia St., Orange; and Monday at 
8 p.m. at South Coast Repertory theater, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. 
Tickets: $15 and $17. Information: (714) 538-8391.

JOHN RAITT: ABSORBED IN 'ZORBA'; 
</P>
<P>
'EVERYBODY WHO EVER PLAYED THIS ROLE HAS HAD HIS LIFE CHANGED BY IT' 
</P>

<P>
The last time Broadway veteran John Raitt performed on the stage of Plummer 
Auditorium was in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
"Being back here again creates a tremendous nostalgia," he said the other night 
in his makeshift dressing room -- a converted utility closet -- as he put on 
his makeup for the starring role in the Fullerton Civic Light Opera's "Zorba," 
a professional production that continues through June 3. 
</P>
<P>
Nostalgia has a way of creeping up on a performer who has lasted more than a 
half century in show business. Raitt actually had cause for double nostalgia, 
having just returned from the 75th anniversary celebration for the Shubert 
Theatre in New Haven, Conn., where uncounted musicals used to try out before 
taking the plunge in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I did 'Carousel' for three weeks at the Shubert," he recalled. The Rodgers and 
Hammerstein classic went on to a nine-month Broadway run and made him a star in 
1945 as the original Billy Bigelow. "I also did 'Pajama Game' there. Everybody 
played there, from Eddie Cantor to the Marx Brothers. That's where Mary Martin 
first set foot on stage." 
</P>
<P>
The tall, sturdy, silver-haired actor recounted the celebration while sitting 
shirtless in red bikini underwear and a small, green towel knotted at his 
waist. He gazed into a table-top mirror and applied his facial makeup: first a 
base to darken the skin, then eye liner for accenting the eyes and finally some 
rouge to give his cheeks a ruddy glow under the stage lights. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians came and went all around him, searching for light filters and 
microphone connections. A photographer hovered over him. "Zorba" director James 
Luisi popped in and out. But nothing seemed to disturb Raitt, who was 
invariably gracious, utterly devoid of star temperament and apparently so 
comfortable with strangers that he never asked anyone to leave while he dressed 
for his role. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the 73-year-old Raitt has starred in "Zorba." Hal 
Prince, who produced and directed the original Broadway version in 1969, 
persuaded him to take the show on its first national tour during the '70s. "At 
first, I told him I wouldn't play Zorba," Raitt recounted. "I said, 'I'm still 
dyeing my hair to play leading-man roles.' " 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the role of Zorba wasn't considered much of a gift to a singer, 
Herschel Bernardi's sterling original performance notwithstanding. But Raitt 
gave in when Prince told him that composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb 
would write an additional song for him ("Bouboulina" in the second act.) 
</P>
<P>
Years later in 1983, when "Zorba" was revived on Broadway with Anthony Quinn, 
the movie star countered negative criticism of his singing voice by claiming 
that Zorba, being an earthy peasant, was not supposed to sing well in the first 
place. "Obviously, Tony Quinn doesn't sing," said Raitt, looking amused. "But I 
loved his excuse." 
</P>
<P>
Voice or no voice, Quinn is more closely identified with Zorba than anybody 
because of his electrifying portrayal of the role in the 1964 movie "Zorba the 
Greek," a brooding, non-musical screen adaptation of the Nikos Kazantzakis 
novel. Moreover, the Broadway revival with Quinn was a smash hit. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably made $40,000 a week doing the show," said Raitt. By now, he had 
donned a pair of black socks, a green shirt, blue corduroy pants and a pair of 
nearly knee-high leather boots. He checked his makeup in the mirror and, to 
complete his visual transformation into Zorba, put on a brown sheepskin-lined 
vest and a black beret, cocked at a rakish angle. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who ever played this role has had his life changed by it," noted 
Raitt, who was born in Santa Ana, grew up in Fullerton and lives in Pacific 
Palisades. "You can't help it. In my workshop at home I've got 20 'Zorbaisms' 
on the wall." He offered two of them in the faintly European accent he uses on 
stage: "The only death is the death you die every day by not living" and "There 
are only two things that make a man a man -- what's in his heart and what's in 
his pants." 
</P>
<P>
Both lines are in the show, which features Dennis McNeil as Nikos, Shirley 
Romano as Madame Hortense, Katherine Peters as the Widow, Alicia Irving as the 
Leader and Matthew DeCambio, George Sullivan, Randy Gianetti and H. Carl Nelson 
in other supporting roles. 
</P>
<P>
Although Raitt hasn't appeared on Broadway in more than a decade -- the last 
time was in 1975 with Lillian Gish and Tammy Grimes in "Musical Jubilee" -- he 
has done 25 consecutive years of summer stock, which affords him the chance to 
play in shows he would never have done otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the loudest, tallest John Adams in '1776,' " he quipped. "I even did 
'The Fantasticks' over at La Mirada" Civic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Summer stock also enables him to continue working in the Broadway musical 
repertoire which he has long favored, such as "Shenandoah," "Man of La Mancha" 
and "The Most Happy Fella." Despite his age, Raitt doesn't want to retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I've still got a lot of energy," he said. "And I can still sing. As long as 
people enjoy it, I'll keep doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Raitt maintains, in fact, that his high lyric baritone is such a natural 
extension of his speaking voice that he never even does vocal warm-ups before a 
performance. "Some people cannot sing at my age," he said. "Beverly Sills 
stopped at 52, right? But I'll be able to sing for the rest of my life because 
I sing right where I talk." 
</P>
<P>
There are two basic things to singing well, he maintained: "One is 
musicianship, the other is character. You need proper enunciation, so people 
can understand you. And you need proper emotional control. If you're scared, 
you can't sing." 
</P>
<P>
What about all the technical mastery, such as diaphragm support, that goes into 
proper breathing? Raitt (who happens to be the father of singer Bonnie Raitt) 
grinned broadly. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't talk about breathing at all," he said. "Why should I? I've been 
breathing for 73 years." 
</P>
<P>
Spoken like the true Zorba. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Civic Light Opera production of "Zorba" continues at Plummer 
Auditorium, Chapman Avenue and Lemon Street in Fullerton, through June 3. 
Performances are today at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $11 to $21.

PEOPLE: BURKE NAMED NEW CHIEF AT CAPITAL CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel B. Burke has been elected to replace Thomas S. Murphy as chief executive 
of Capital Cities-ABC Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Burke's appointment, effective June 1, was approved unanimously by the 
company's board, which met in Bristol, Conn., following the company's annual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Burke, 61, served as Murphy's chief assistant for 19 years, 14 of them at 
Capital Cities Communications Inc., which bought American Broadcasting Cos. for 
$3.5 billion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy announced in January that he would step down June 1, a day after his 
65th birthday. He will stay on as chairman but will not be involved in the 
company's day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
Burke joined Capital Cities Communications Inc. in 1961 as general manager of 
WTEN-TV, Albany, N.Y., and was elected vice president in 1962. Two years later, 
he was appointed general manager of WJR-AMFM in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Burke rose to the rank of executive vice president and director in 1967. From 
1969 to 1972, he served as president of the company's publishing division 
before being named president and chief operating officer. He continued in that 
position when Capital Cities took over ABC in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the transition will have little immediate impact because 
Murphy and Burke share virtually identical philosophies about the operation and 
role of the company. 
</P>
<P>
When he announced that he was stepping aside, Murphy said he believed that a 
corporation prospers under younger leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy became renowned in 1985 when his company took over ABC. The move marked 
the first takeover of a major television network.

Jill Ireland, the British-born actress who bore her private agonies publicly in 
order to help others, succumbed Friday at her Malibu home to the spreading 
cancer she had fought for six years. She was 54. 
</P>
<P>
She slipped into a coma early Friday and died at 11:30 a.m. Her husband, actor 
Charles Bronson, whom she credited with helping her endure intensive radiation 
and chemotherapy treatments and with whom she appeared in numerous films, 
including "Breakout" and "Death Wish II," was at her side when she died. 
</P>
<P>
Paul and Valentine McCallum, her sons from her first marriage to actor David 
McCallum, her daughter, Zulieka Bronson, her mother, Dorothy, and her brother, 
John, also were at her bedside Friday, according to publicist Lori Jonas. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ireland was first diagnosed as having breast cancer in 1984. She wrote 
about her mastectomy and recovery in her first book, "Life Wish," and made 
upbeat talks and appearances to bolster cancer victims and raise money for 
cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1989, doctors told her that the cancer had reappeared and 
metastasized to her lungs. The disease quickly spread to her hip, femur and 
thyroid. She was given two to three years to live. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to die," she said shortly after that. "It's not an OK thing. Not 
right now. We all die one day, but I am not in the mood to do it yet." 
</P>
<P>
A different tragedy struck last November, interrupting her chemotherapy and 
prompting a cross-country flight in a chartered plane from her much-loved 
Vermont farm. Jason McCallum, 27, the son she had adopted at infancy with 
McCallum, had died of ingested and injected drugs. 
</P>
<P>
She had chronicled his drug addiction and treatment in her second book, "Life 
Lines," and had believed he was "clean" when the death occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ireland celebrated a special day last month when a star honoring her work 
in more than 35 films was placed on Hollywood Boulevard. She appeared frail and 
gaunt at that time, as she hoarsely said: "This is really quite a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
She had been working on a third book, "Life Times," a series of profiles of her 
friends, when she died. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ireland was born April 24, 1936, in London. She was trained as a ballet 
dancer and first performed professionally when she was 12. For a time, she 
appeared with the Monte Carlo Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Singing and acting as well as dancing, she began performing in British films 
and television as a teen-ager, making her film debut in 1955 in "Oh, Rosalinda" 
with Sir Michael Redgrave. 
</P>
<P>
She appeared in several of the "Carry On, Nurse" series of comedy films. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, Miss Ireland married McCallum, with whom she had appeared in several 
British productions, and the couple moved to Hollywood in 1962. She soon became 
a popular guest star on U.S. television series including "Ben Casey," "Mannix," 
"Star Trek," and husband McCallum's "Man from U.N.C.L.E." 
</P>
<P>
Her marriage to McCallum ended in 1967, and a year later, she married Bronson, 
becoming his permanent leading lady in a string of action films beginning with 
"Villa Rides." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in so many Charles Bronson films," she once joked, "because no other 
actress will work with him." 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, looking for new challenges, Miss Ireland co-produced some of 
their movies. 
</P>
<P>
She also recorded an album, "Hello and Goodby," in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Off-screen, Miss Ireland devoted her time to positive speeches encouraging 
fellow cancer patients and their families to live fully. She referred to 
herself as a "survivor" of cancer, never a "victim." 
</P>
<P>
"Think of yourself and be happy. Make the most of your life and put yourself 
first," Miss Ireland had urged women who had undergone mastectomies. "A breast 
does not make me who I am." 
</P>
<P>
She also sought to help families fight drug addiction, openly discussing son 
Jason's travails. Miss Ireland had not determined until after the adoption that 
the infant had been born addicted to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
She regarded former First Lady Betty Ford as a role model because of her public 
discussion of her own mastectomy and treatment for drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I greatly love and admire Betty Ford," she said last year. "She was very 
inspirational to me with her honesty about her breast cancer and then again 
with her candor about her drug abuse. If anything, if I can help other people 
feel less alone with the problem, that would be nice." 
</P>
<P>
With Bronson, she raised his two children, her three, their own daughter, and a 
friend's daughter. Survivors include Bronson, six of the seven children, her 
mother and brother. 
</P>
<P>
In an essay she wrote for Life magazine last June, Miss Ireland described the 
kind of funeral she wanted: "A real wake, with balloons, champagne, everyone in 
bright, happy colors, lots of food and music. A fiesta. A celebration of my 
life. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements were pending.
