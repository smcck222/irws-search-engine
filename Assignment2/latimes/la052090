I wonder if perhaps the only thing fuzzy is Kosko's scientific perception and 
understanding. There is nothing inherently wrong with Western theorizing. 
</P>
<P>
Western science purports that every continuum in science and nature, whether it 
be the transition from hot to cold or from heavy to light rain, can be 
described as a function, or a system of functions, based on a series of yes or 
no responses. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko states: "I'd be the biggest atheist that ever lived." As the term atheist 
is itself absolute, is this not an extreme attitude for one who does not deal 
with either/or interpretations? 
</P>
<P>
For goodness' sake, Bart, turn down the heat in the hot tub, even if it's a 
little bit at a time.

FUZZY LOGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It takes conscious reasoning to conceive of the principles and to apply them. 
Surely, the acts of perception and definition are subjective -- are fuzzy -- 
yet we find application for them. 
</P>
<P>
Take the notions of straight lines. None really exist in our three-dimensional 
universe -- you cannot have one-dimensional, two-dimensional, nor anything 
other than three-dimensional properties in a three-dimensional universe. But 
straight lines are everywhere. Are they? 
</P>
<P>
It is limitations in perceptive and interpretive ability that lead to the lazy 
acceptance of notions like the existence of straight lines being fact, simply 
because we have found a way to apply the abstract conception of them in a 
practical way. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko is really onto something with his bold attempts at reinterpreting how we 
should view our universe. As one who works in the field of computer science, he 
surely enjoys the irony of living in an age where the hardware is so nuts and 
bolts Aristotelian, but the software is embracing principles like chaos and 
fuzziness.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bart Kosko ("Making Everything Perfectly Fuzzy," by Sheldon Teitelbaum, April 
1) claims that "fuzziness refutes the traditional Aristotelian theory of 
absolutes" and that the Law of the Excluded Middle allows "no shades of gray, 
no concepts such as 'partly' or 'mostly.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Law of the Excluded Middle states that "the same attribute cannot at the 
same time belong and not belong to the same subject and in the same respect." 
</P>
<P>
This means that Kosko's fuzzy computer chip cannot at the same time be a 
computer chip and an African elephant. 
</P>
<P>
Aristotle clearly recognized shades of gray: "Again, the intermediate . . . 
will be so either in the way in which gray is between black and white." 
Furthermore, in his classification of animals, he clearly indicated the 
difficulties of classifying animals that differ by gradations into their 
respective groupings. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko is attacking the distorted "logic" of 20th-Century philosophers such as 
Bertrand Russell and his followers, which, unfortunately, is often mistaken for 
Aristotelian logic. 
</P>
<P>
Aristotelian logic is the foundation of all of science and of technology, and 
if it is abandoned, these fields are doomed.

IT'S IN THE MALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kaufman, of course, is the "Babe" Ruth of local man bashers. But she does 
manage, in her chirping, clucking style, to make at least one good point. 
</P>
<P>
Us fellas would be better off, she hints, if -- every once in a while -- we 
allowed ourselves to experience the cosmic self-doubt and general mechanical 
incompetence that goes along with being a chick. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I think it's a great idea. I also think that any idiot -- male or 
female -- knows there is a little bit of doll in every guy and a little bit of 
guy in every doll. Otherwise, dolls would never wear shoulder pads and guys 
would never shave. 
</P>
<P>
The male ego simply does not exist in pure form. Every man has at least some 
"womanly" aspects to his personality. I, for example, have no less than three 
women living inside me. Prudence is in charge of manners, and Martha is great 
with kids. Flo is a study in warmth and spontaneity. All three conspire to make 
me a better man. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, just once, we could hear something positive about the men inside Margo 
Kaufman. I'm dying to know if any one of them could change a flat tire without 
bursting into tears.

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that I have joined the "outside work force" (after having been at home for 
20 years and hearing from everyone at home how easy I had it) and my husband 
left it (due to illness), I laughed when I read "It's in the Male." When I get 
home, all I hear is that the laundry is done and how "tired I am." 
</P>
<P>
At these moments, I recall someone (I won't use names) telling me how easy it 
is staying home and how demanding it is working outside. 
</P>
<P>
Also I recall having to let him go in our room for at least a half hour before 
anyone could say a word to him. When I come from work every evening I am barely 
able to put my purse down when everyone tells me it's dinner time. 
Occasionally, I run my finger on the oven hood and comment on how it needs to 
be cleaned. At these moments we look into each other's eyes and burst out 
laughing. Perhaps it's these differences that make the world go around.

One could pursue further the author's husband's statement, "A man's ego is 
quite large. But it's very delicate." I am thinking of writing a book titled 
"Fathers, Husbands and Sons: Walking on Eggshells in Three Generations."

AS SUMMER APPROACHES and sun block sales soar, the thought of wearing a Panama 
hat becomes appealing. 
</P>
<P>
These hats, the finest of which are hand-blocked, actually come from Ecuador 
(Spanish for equator), where the sun burns hot. The classic cover-ups (which 
sell for about $30) are available in the downtown L.A. garment district's New 
York Hat Store in six styles and seven sizes, in natural and bleach tints. If 
only the downtown neighborhood were as nice as the hats.

IT'S AN old-fashioned oasis, a place where you can relax your way back into the 
civility of a bygone era. High-backed wooden booths have cosseted rich and not 
necessarily famous Angelenos since 1919; meals are still respectfully served on 
linen place mats to solo diners at the counter. 
</P>
<P>
In the bar, shaded wall lamps give off a warm glow as another cloudy Saturday 
afternoon slips into the cocktail hour. 
</P>
<P>
The room is dark and cozy, like a gentlemen's club. You can't quite make out 
the pale-green pastoral mural that encircles the room, but the dim light 
catches the leaded-glass panes of the liquor cabinets behind the dark-wood bar. 
Perched happily on a red-leather bar stool, you can witness, through his 
reflection in the mirror, the stately bartender in the de rigueur white shirt, 
black tie and red jacket as he smoothly makes an honest-to-goodness vodka 
gimlet on the rocks, just as he's done for the past 22 years -- the way it 
should be done: ice into tumbler, a generous jigger of vodka, a splash of lime 
juice until the concoction is just the right golden-green. Cheers.

WHERE CAN KIDS observe bees hard at work, study the workings of an oil derrick 
and climb on a caboose -- all in one place? The Children's Museum at La Habra, 
12,000 square feet of hands-on fun. Located in an old Union Pacific train depot 
with a new 8,000-square-foot wing, the museum has seven permanent and one 
changing gallery, in which the exhibits change quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
Currently running through June 2 is "Children's Arts Festival," featuring 
community art work centered around a Mexican theme. (A transportation exhibit, 
"Cars, Trains, Boats and Planes," will begin June 18 and continue through the 
summer.) 
</P>
<P>
On the museum's Nature Walk, children learn about animals from all parts of the 
world; next door, at the Bee Colony, they can watch the busy bees. The Carousel 
play area includes a place where kids can get busy themselves with Legos and a 
player piano. The Science Station, a physical-science area geared toward 
fourth- through seventh-graders, introduces the kids to a an oil derrick and 
gas pumps and gives them the opportunity to try on the uniforms of different 
members of the oil industry. There's also a Kids on Stage theater gallery and 
the Pre-School Play Park for children up to age 5.

ALICE KAHN: EXERCISING A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO BOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a story as old as maybe 1983: female bonding at the health club. As Tim 
Leary might say, work out, work on, work in. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess who called me last night?" Bree Wellington puffed out as she and her 
friend Mai Blender rounded the 20th lap on the jogging tier. Each lap was an 
eighth of a mile. The longer they ran, the more deeply they delved into their 
psyches and the less capable they became of computing the mileage. 
</P>
<P>
"Was it Dan Quayle?" Mai asked. "Connie Chung? Wolfgang Puck?" Mai's overuse of 
acerbic wit and ascorbic acid had caused many people to sour on her long ago. 
But Bree stood by her. Besides, Bree was too busy to make new friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Nope. None of the above. It was our old inamorata, Neil Blender," Bree said, 
breathing a little heavier now as Mai picked up the pace. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, Neil. Always an ex, never a bride," Mai panted. "Except, of course, for 
poor moi, the only woman dumb enough to marry a womanizer like Neil." 
</P>
<P>
The man in front of them in the "Women's Mountain Bike 100-Miler" T-shirt 
turned around and gave them a vaguely hurt look. 
</P>
<P>
Mai slowed down and said to Bree, "Check out the buns on the guy in front of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
"Mai, how many miles is that?" 
</P>
<P>
"How many times does eight go into 33?" 
</P>
<P>
Bree tried several times and finally said, "Let's do our thighs." 
</P>
<P>
They walked over to the machines. "Name your poison," said Mai. "Outer or 
inner?" 
</P>
<P>
Bree took inner, and they continued their conversation while conducting a 
modern ballet -- Bree bringing her legs together against 60 pounds of 
resistance while Mai pushes her thighs out against 40 pounds of pressure. "A 
pound of penance for every pint of Praline Almond Fudge," she liked to say. 
</P>
<P>
"So what did he want," Mai asked on the intake. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, just to chat, I suspect." 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, Bree. I was married to the jerk for five years. You dated him for 
two. Neil Blender has more agendas than Jesse Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
"What could he want?" asked Bree. "I mean, he knows I'm happily married. Have a 
young child. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to start up again. What does Neil ever want?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think he called to tell me about his new pilot," Bree said, slapping 
her legs together a bit too quickly for full isometric benefit. "He said the 
network is going to pick up the series for next season. It's called 'Girls' 
Night Out.' It's about these three well-adjusted business and family men who 
happen to be cross-dressers. Once a week, they put on their wigs and outfits 
and go out together. Each week the show will feature a celebrity cross-dresser. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, God, I've had enough," said Mai, letting the thigh resister pads fly. 
"Ready for the sauna?" 
</P>
<P>
In the sauna, a woman of about 70 was stretched out on the bench in a state 
that appeared to be bliss but might have been death. Bree gave Mai a "Should we 
do anything?" look, and Mai just shrugged her shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you telling me Neil conducted an entire phone call without coming on to 
you?" said Mai, treating the immobile woman as if she were part of the 
woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't bring a loofah by any chance?" Bree asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No, but if you tell me what Neil really said, I'll let you use my 
protein-enriched anti-aging collagen formula." 
</P>
<P>
"Mai, I'm telling you he just asked about my family. He asked how Dirk's 
business was going. He asked how Rachel likes Kinderkollege. He wanted to know 
how much we paid for our house in Quail Glen. And then he went on and on about 
how excited he was that his series was going to get made." 
</P>
<P>
"And you're telling me he said nothing," Mai muttered, watching a stream of 
sweat eddying down her chest, "nothing even vaguely sexual?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing really that I was aware of," said Bree, "unless you mean the 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
"Operation?" Mai said, bursting the bead of sweat that had stopped mid-sternum. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Bree sighed, rubbing a washcloth across her forehead. "He said he was 
getting a vasectomy tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
"Ah-ha," said the 70-year-old woman, sitting bolt upright. "I've heard that 
line before."

'PERIODICAL PROBLEM' BRINGS READERS' POSTAL COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We are a book publisher in Claremont, the eastern edge of Los Angeles County. 
We have shipped a book via fourth class book rate mail on a Friday and had it 
arrive in Syracuse, N.Y. on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the Post Office is capable of great service at present rates and 
staffing. 
</P>
<P>
Why then is Los Angeles service so poor? Complaints have been pouring in to us 
recently because books have not reached customers in Los Angeles, only 25 miles 
away, more than three weeks after we mail them. Unfortunately, we can't solve 
the Los Angeles delay problem by sending via first class mail, as one of our 
first class letters recently took eight days to get to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like some real accounting from Los Angeles Post Office management, and not 
more whining about volume. Problems aren't solved by complaining about what is; 
problems are solved by adjusting procedures to match that reality.

ON VIEW: AMBASSADOR FROM TURKEY FETED

There wasn't a spot of garden space vacant at the fete honoring the Ambassador 
of the Republic of Turkey to the United States, Nuzhet Kandemir, and his wife, 
Sadiye. Turkish Consul General Mehmet Emre and his wife, Sema, were exuding 
smiles and directing the crowd to the cerkez tavuk (chicken with walnuts), 
doner (beef on a spit), patlican kizartma (eggplant with green chiles), borrek 
(fried pastry) and rice pilav. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent were Mission Viejo real estate broker Vasif Canli, Los Angeles 
developer T.K. Kutay, civil engineer Nezih M. Gunal, Chasen's assistant manager 
Orhan Arli and Turan and Judy Kahraman. 
</P>
<P>
Why the visit? Explained the ambassador: "To explain the business opportunities 
that exist in Turkey." J. Jamison Moore, who owns Atlantis Inc., already knows. 
He and his wife, Mara, have sold their house and will live abroad for the next 
five years to oversee his $552-million resort development near Izmir. Yachting 
was on the minds of Bud and Virginia Carpenter. He's in charge of the Los 
Angeles Yacht Club plans for 75 Southland sailors to sail on seas off the coves 
of Turkey next year.

BOUQUETS: The Friends of Robinson Gardens garden tour has become one of the 
can't-miss events of spring. This year the gardens of Irene Kassorla and Norman 
Friedmann, Stephanie and Louis Snyder, Otis and Dody Booth, Don and Kathleen 
Spiegelman, plus the Virginia Robinson Gardens, were picked by benefit 
co-chairs Carol Mancino and Donna Kamin and co-presidents Donna Wolff and 
Bridget Martens. They also chose famous gardener Georgie Van de Kamp (mother of 
gubernatorial candidate John Van de Kamp) for honorary chair. 
</P>
<P>
WOW! It helps to have former President Ronald Reagan joining entertainers Jose 
Feliciano and Maureen McGovern for fund raising. The folks in the background

A EUROPEAN VIEW: SECURITY NOT DEPENDENT ON TANKS;

NATO: AMERICA AND EUROPE APPEAR TO BE AT ODDS OVER CONTINENTAL SECURITY. EUROPE 
SEEKS A CONSENSUS THAT USE OF MILITARY FORCE IS INCONCEIVABLE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Apotentially calamitous rift between American and European thinking on the 
future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is developing. Several 
visiting U.S. officials have said, in effect: "We must get a unified Germany 
into NATO -- and be done with it." 
</P>
<P>
What they mean is that the Kremlin's escalating difficulties should be 
exploited and the alliance's military component strengthened. The worry here is 
that these assertions reflect State Department policy. 
</P>
<P>
The preferred policy in Europe is exactly the opposite. Europeans have 
witnessed the crisis of communism in the East. They have followed the agony of 
the Communist parties in Western Europe. The sense of relief they now feel as a 
result of the changes coming out of 1989 is well justified: Europeans have 
lived with the Iron Curtain for decades. 
</P>
<P>
In all the media analysis of the emerging situation, however, there is a 
fundamental omission. NATO's conventional forces in Central Europe are now 
superior to the Warsaw Pact's. This advantage is so recent and surprising that 
it seems incredible. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the Bush-Gorbachev agreement to limit the number of American and 
Soviet soldiers, respectively, in Central Europe to 195,000 is enshrined in a 
treaty, NATO troop strength will be: 195,000 Americans, 400,000 West Germans, 
70,000 British, 50,000 French and roughly 12,000 Belgians, Dutch and Canadians. 
Facing them will be the 195,000 Soviets troops. The armies of Poland, 
Czechoslovakia and Hungary follow the orders of center-right or Christian 
Democratic governments, hardly knee-jerk communist allies. 
</P>
<P>
The Vienna negotiations to reduce conventional forces, moreover, aim to 
severely deprive those and other Soviet soldiers up to the Urals of military 
hardware. Under such restraints, who could honestly expect a sudden Soviet 
conventional attack? How could NATO forces be surprised when the nearly 
signature-ready Vienna Protocols identify more than 140,000 pieces of offensive 
military equipment, from the Atlantic to the Urals, subject to international 
verification and inspection? 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, to be sure, will have their huge arsenal of more than 25,000 
nuclear warheads. But nobody can foresee the circumstances in which such an 
arsenal would be used, even if unrest spreads throughout the Soviet Union and 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is overthrown. This is precisely the reason why the Soviet 
leader should not be faced with such challenges as a militarily stronger NATO. 
</P>
<P>
On this side of the Atlantic, more and more people think that "security" should 
be divorced from a balance of military power. Rather, it should be hinged to a 
consensus that military power is irrelevant. This belief is reflected in the 
views of several West European leaders who have stressed -- most recently 
during the NATO meeting in Brussels on May 3 -- that the Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, not NATO, is the best vehicle for maintaining 
security on the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of European thinking is the idea of "security areas," a 
geographical zone in which people share loyalty to the principles of democracy, 
the renunciation of the military force, peaceful settlement of disputes and 
cooperation. Most of the 35 member states of the conference might eventually 
form a "security area." 
</P>
<P>
Is this utopia? 
</P>
<P>
Not at all. Such a "security area" already exists in Western Europe -- the 
European Community. That one of its 12 members would use military force against 
another is inconceivable. Thus, military force is irrelevant. The Scandinavian 
states certainly are another example of the triumph of this concept of 
security. The East European nations, now liberated from communism and adopting 
the principles and practices of democratic countries, may be the next converts. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet military threat to Western Europe has, for all practical 
purposes, disappeared, it certainly would require a large dose of optimism to 
conceive of the "security area" including the Soviet Union, at least in the 
near future. In calling for a NATO summit meeting in June "to consider the 
future political mission of the alliance," President Bush rightly warned that 
"our enemy today is uncertainty and instability." 
</P>
<P>
Since both enemies are likely to come from the East, the alliance, with a 
unified Germany as a member, should be kept alive. Yet the Soviets should 
receive assurances that the ultimate goal is not a militarily stronger NATO but 
a more "secure" Continent.

MANILA TELLS UNCLE SAM TO TAKE A HIKE -- BUT IF HE DOES?; 
</P>
<P>
PHILIPPINES: THE AQUINO GOVERNMENT, EYEING '92 ELECTIONS, PLAYS TO DOMESTIC 
POLITICS. BUT AN EARLY U.S. PULLOUT COULD BE DAMAGING. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
All of Manila's 28 dailies bannered the news that the Philippines had served 
notice on the United States that the 43-year-old Military Bases Agreement would 
be terminated on Sept. 16, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The move surprised most Filipinos, as it did the U.S. panel headed by special 
negotiator Richard L. Armitage. Even by the usual Philippine interpretation of 
the bases agreement, the notice of termination was not due until September this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Filipino spokesman for the "exploratory" talks now going on in Manila did 
not fail to play up the significance of the gesture. "Today, 15 May, 1990," he 
declared, "marks a historic moment for all Filipinos. We have taken that first 
step in terminating an agreement that was executed in 1947 during the days of 
lingering U.S. colonialism in the Philippines." 
</P>
<P>
The wording of the announcement was clearly tailored to address the sharpening 
nationalist sentiments of the domestic audience. Outside the Central Bank 
building, where the negotiations are being held, anti-bases militants have been 
holding daily demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the talks, guerrillas of the New People's Army gunned down two 
U.S. servicemen in the vicinity of Clark Air Base. Dissident soldiers 
affiliated with the clandestine Young Officers Union announced plans to 
undertake military actions against U.S. forces should the process of American 
withdrawal from the bases fail to commence this September. 
</P>
<P>
In the Philippine Senate, where a majority expressed unwillingness to ratify a 
new treaty extending the tenure of the U.S. military facilities, opposition 
Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile called not only for the termination of the bases 
agreement but the abrogation, as well, of the Philippines-U.S. Mutual Defense 
Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The approaching expiration of the Military Bases Agreement governing the stay 
of U.S. military facilities in the Philippines coincides with a critical period 
in this nation's politics. 
</P>
<P>
General elections are scheduled for mid-1992. In the run-up to that decisive 
contest, both conservative and radical political forces opposing the Aquino 
government have been trying to tap the widening nationalist current in an 
increasingly exasperated electorate. 
</P>
<P>
The public debate over the possibility of extending the stay of U.S. military 
facilities in the islands has been laced with partisan maneuvering and 
threatens to polarize opinion deeply. Any indication that the Aquino government 
is conceding to U.S. demands will be seized upon by opponents and converted 
into political capital to woo nationalist votes. 
</P>
<P>
In such a situation, Aquino's administration is not likely to be very attentive 
when U.S. officials discourse on the "mutuality" of interests in keeping the 
bases and the role played by these facilities in maintaining regional 
stability. It is 1992 -- not the Lombok Strait in Indonesia, site of World War 
II naval battles, or Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam, now being abandoned by the 
Soviets -- that is foremost in the minds of the current Philippine leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the growing potency of the nationalist vote, Corazon Aquino's 
negotiating stance on the bases is conditioned by other factors. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 constitution, ratified by nearly 80% of the population, specifies the 
date of termination of the Military Bases Agreement and requires that any 
further maintenance of foreign troops on Philippine soil be covered by a proper 
treaty -- recognized as such by both parties. Aquino cannot depart from these 
provisions without incurring great political costs. 
</P>
<P>
Too, the presence of U.S. military facilities in the Philippines is tolerated 
by a slight majority of Filipinos because of their perceived material benefits 
to the country. When the terms of the bases agreement were reviewed two years 
ago, the focus of Filipino public opinion was on the compensation package 
promised in exchange for hosting the bases. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. failure to meet its compensation commitments -- Philippine 
officials estimate a 1989 shortfall of $222 million (the U.S. claims it is $96 
million) from a promised $481 million a year in military and economic aid -- 
has dismayed public opinion to an extent that Washington seems to 
underestimate. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the "exploratory" talks, Aquino's negotiators have responded 
to nuances of the domestic political milieu, rather than to the American 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Aquino went on nationwide television to affirm her government's 
commitment to the constitutional provisions on the bases question -- a move 
intended to calm anxiety, fueled by her critics, that the Philippine government 
would bend over backwards and mutilate the charter in order to accommodate U.S. 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's opening session, Foreign Affairs Secretary Raul Manglapus 
lectured Armitage and his team on the inequities that have characterized 
Philippine-American relations -- again, a move to appease nationalist public 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, when the Philippine negotiating team officially informed the 
U.S. government of Manila's decision to terminate the bases agreement, the 
unexpected move broke the momentum of anti-bases agitation sweeping the streets 
of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
The next day the Filipino side badgered the U.S. team about the shortfalls in 
the compensation package. That was to appease Filipinos wanting their 
government to move more decisively in securing what they feel the country 
justly deserves. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, the Aquino government, consistent with its populist inclinations, has 
taken the talks as an opportunity to play to the crowd and consolidate its 
sources of political support -- at the expense of the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far the government has managed to deflect anti-bases agitation, preempt 
its nationalist critics and prevent the early emergence of an issue that would 
unite the political forces opposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
But this public-relations blitz also commits the Aquino government to a 
political trajectory that invites early U.S. military withdrawal and economic 
dislocation in the communities dependent on base expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislative-Executive Bases Council, charged with drawing up an economic 
conversion plan for the areas around the Clark and Subic facilities, is not 
ready to put enough projects on-stream to contain the adverse effects of an 
early American pullout. 
</P>
<P>
The dire prospects called up by the current standoff do not seem to impress 
Filipino strategists. They are, after all, merely prospects. In typical 
Filipino fashion, the Aquino government seems to have adopted the attitude that 
future outcomes are future worries. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, President Aquino's government is basking in political gains 
derived from the talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
Carlos Pizarro became a walking corpse the moment he decided to campaign for 
the Colombian presidency. None of his compatriots were surprised when he was 
killed in a storm of bullets April 26. His was another death foretold. 
</P>
<P>
Who killed Carlos Pizarro? He had many enemies. 
</P>
<P>
As the chief of one of the most effective guerrilla groups -- the M-19 -- he 
had long ago been branded a public enemy by the police and army. As a legal 
Marxist presidential candidate -- after M-19 made peace with the government in 
March -- he became an open target of the ultra-right and its paramilitary 
forces. As a reformed guerrilla, he became a traitor in the eyes of those who 
continue the armed struggle. As the leader of a new and popular alternative 
opposition party, he made mainstream politicians nervous. Finally, as a 
charismatic and handsome public figure, he was attractive prey for the 
narco-terrorist campaign now under way in Colombia. The people behind the 
murder of Pizarro, three other presidential candidates and hundreds of public 
and private Colombians surely will never be discovered. A curtain of fear will 
protect them. 
</P>
<P>
But whoever ordered the murder, the killer is the same: a boy without ideology 
or politics, without past or future, whose only skill is killing. In Colombia, 
he is known as a sicario, a hired assassin. 
</P>
<P>
Medellin was one of Colombia's most modern and prosperous cities in the early 
'70s. Its climate was exceptional, its residents hard-working, its economy 
flourishing. As a center of development and economic hope in a poor country, 
however, it attracted the unemployed, the forgotten, the hopeless. 
</P>
<P>
A subculture of poverty took root in the emerald mountains around the city. 
There, ignored by God and law, families destroyed by unemployment, domestic 
violence and alcoholism gave birth to the sicario. 
</P>
<P>
From early studies by sociologists, psychologists and journalists, a general 
profile of the sicario can be drawn. 
</P>
<P>
He lives peaceably with his neighbors, staying in the neighborhood even when he 
becomes wealthy. He adores his mother, on whom he spends much of what he earns. 
He may still be a student. He does not use drugs or alcohol. He has suffered 
hunger and generally been a victim of his father's violence. 
</P>
<P>
The number of deaths he has caused gives him prestige, membership in a gang, 
the love and respect of girls and, in many cases, money to buy the clothes, 
music and guns he admires. 
</P>
<P>
"They are creatures from pure urban roots, born amid the noise of high-powered 
motorcycles and machine guns, grown in the shadow of easy money and the fever 
of consumerism," wrote journalist Laura Restrepo. 
</P>
<P>
The first signs of the sicario phenomenon appeared a decade ago. Groups of 
armed civilians were organized in the regions most affected by guerrilla 
violence. They were known as "health brigades." A government investigation 
revealed that these groups were supported and financed by well-known and 
wealthy ranchers and businessmen. They had the blessing and protection of the 
army. 
</P>
<P>
The groups' self-imposed duty was to "clean" entire regions of guerrillas and 
their collaborators. But as their operations expanded, the voluntary financial 
support became insufficient. At the time, the narcotics traffickers were buying 
their way into ranching. Their "contributions" to the brigades were welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
The brigades moved into other regions, their organizations growing more 
sophisticated. Schools for sicarios taught the fine art of killing. The 
curricula included courses in camouflage, weapons, target shooting, personal 
defense, intelligence and counterintelligence, communications and first aid. 
</P>
<P>
The major traffickers founded their own killing schools to satisfy their 
personal needs. Many of the students organized their own groups. The new and 
prosperous industry of death features private cars, weapons, planes, boats, 
helicopters, airports, computers and, of course, unlimited access to money. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia's deteriorating economic situation, meanwhile, forces more boys and 
young men into the streets. Easy money for "quick jobs" -- murders -- is all 
the more desirable. In Medellin, center of the narcotics industry, bands of 
sicarios mushroomed in the poor mountain neighborhoods. These boys are 
self-taught. They do not want to become amuraos -- jobless people who spend 
their days leaning against walls. Officials have tallied more than 300 bands of 
sicarios, with an average of 10 members each, in Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
Although economics largely explains the attraction of the killing life, why the 
killer of Pizarro chose to do the deed on a plane in flight, full of armed 
bodyguards, remains elusive. Age is one suggested reason. Gang members are 
rarely older than 17. They are too young and immature to understand the gravity 
of their actions. But even a young boy would know that if he confronts 12 
bodyguards in a plane, he will die. 
</P>
<P>
Since their birth, death has been a daily fixture for these kids. In their 
Medellin neighborhoods, there are, on average, 25 murders a day. A generation 
does not know that people can die as a result of old age, illness or other 
natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
Killing comes easily because these boys see no value in their own lives. The 
way they live and act -- and the desperation that surrounds them -- is half of 
what in Colombia is known as "la cultura de la muerte" (the culture of death). 
</P>
<P>
As in any profession, the bands of young killers develop and abide by an ethics 
code. An assassination is simply "a job." Dying is desirable if it comes in the 
line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of examples. In "No Future," a Colombian documentary about 
sicarios, a scene shows the young colleagues of a felled assassin filing by the 
coffin, each congratulating the victim for a good death. "You were valiant, 
brother," one says. "You died according to our law." 
</P>
<P>
When a young man murdered the head of a leftist party and wounded a leading 
presidential candidate in the Bogota airport in 1989, he was filmed by security 
cameras jumping with joy next to the bodies -- as if he were a soccer player 
who had just scored the winning goal. He made no attempt to escape. Seconds 
later, bodyguards mowed him down with automatic gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Religion and love for mother also are woven into these boys' lives. Many 
assassins are known to attend confession and ask for God's protection and help 
before doing a job. Some have been seen making the sign of the cross moments 
before firing. And on many of the bodies of dead sicarios are Catholic 
medallions inscribed with the images of saints or the Virgin Mary. Some have 
tattoos that read "God and Mother." 
</P>
<P>
Many sicarios say they do their work for their mothers. As the breadwinner in 
single-parent homes, he is husband, father and son. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to die," said one 15-year-old assassin in an interview. "But my 
mother will remember me because I gave her a beautiful new refrigerator." 
</P>
<P>
The complicity of a terrified society and an emasculated government, combined 
with the immeasurable wealth of the drug traffickers, nourish the phenomenon of 
sicarios. Many Colombians believe that the growing and widespread tolerance of 
violent death permeates their society. Public tolerance is the other half of 
the culture of death that prevails in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Only a national effort can save a vibrant culture that existed long before 
death began taking over.

U.S. MISERY IN INEQUALITY: IGNORING THE GRIM TRUTHS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: WHILE WEALTHY AMERICANS ARE REWARDED WITH TAX CUTS, WORKERS FALL 
DEEPER IN DEBT. FAMILY INCOME HAS BEEN STATIC SINCE 1973. 
</P>

By Maurice Zeitlin, Maurice Zeitlin, a professor of sociology at UCLA, is 
author of The Large Corporation and Contemporary Classes (Rutgers University 
Press).

<TEXT>
<P>
Four years before the ancien regime fell in France, the new American ambassador 
observed: "The property in this country is absolutely concentered in a very few 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
This enormous inequality produced so much misery, Thomas Jefferson wrote to 
James Madison on Oct. 28, 1785, "it is clear that the laws of property have 
been so far extended as to violate natural right." 
</P>
<P>
If Jefferson returned to America today, he would find a powder keg of "enormous 
inequality producing so much misery." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration ignores this grim reality, as do too many politicians 
and pundits. They prefer self-congratulatory celebrations of the "collapse of 
communism" and the "triumph of capitalism." Some even unblushingly claim that 
"the egalitarianism of modern America represents the essential achievement of 
the classless society envisioned by Marx." Resurrecting this notion of a 
"classless" merica -- it was a favorite marketing theme from the 1950s through 
the 1970s -- is grotesque. 
</P>
<P>
During the '80s, this classless refrain, to be sure, was muted. Equality was 
relentlessly assaulted by the right, the rich and organized big business. 
Unions were busted, plants closed, workers intimidated into giving back wage 
gains. Meanwhile, Congress slashed the "safety net" while rewarding the 
nation's wealthiest with generous tax cuts. All this in the name of a theory 
that these measures would make workers work harder and capitalists invest more. 
General prosperity was sure to follow, went the theory, even at the expense of 
more inequality. 
</P>
<P>
The smart money flowed not into productive investment but into corporate 
takeovers. Raiders and financiers made fortunes; America's basic industries 
rotted. A handful of companies now dominate our economic life. In 
manufacturing, the top 20 corporations control more than one-third of the 
assets and make 40% of the profits. Among the nation's 14,000 or so commercial 
banks, the top 100 hold roughly one-half the deposits, the largest 14, 
one-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Despite what Republicans promised, the economy grew at about the same rate 
during the Reagan regime as it did during the previous eight years. Fewer new 
jobs were created (of which 85% are in the lowest-paying industries). The 
number of employed workers living in poverty rose. Workers' real weekly wages 
fell (by about 10% from 1972 to 1987). The median real family income has barely 
changed since 1973; many more of us are now deeply in debt. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s and 1960s, workers in America could look forward to earning 
one-third more than their dads. Today, they can expect to earn one-sixth less. 
</P>
<P>
Far from the advent of a "classless society," America in the '80s underwent 
dramatic class polarization. The income gap between top and bottom widened 
significantly: Not since 1950 has the country's upper one-fifth enjoyed such a 
large share of all personal income. The lowest fifth were big contributors to 
the good life of those at the top -- it lost the equivalent of $25 billion to 
them. Except for France, the income gap in America is larger than in any of the 
other dozen leading capitalist countries. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, while the real income of the top fifth of America's families jumped 
32%, their effective federal tax rate dropped by 5.5%. As for the bottom fifth, 
the tax bite on their real income growth of 3% increased by 16%. 
</P>
<P>
The shift of income to the tip of the top has been even greater. According to 
the Congressional Budget Office, in the past decade the share of income 
received by the top 1% rose by more than one-third: in 1977, the ultra-rich got 
9.2% of all pretax personal income; by 1988, they were getting 12.5%. In real 
dollars, their pretax income leaped more than 50%, from an average of $301,000 
in 1977 to $452,000 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
So who owns America? Not many of us. 
</P>
<P>
Out of modesty or to avoid taxes, wealth is deliberately hidden. But an 
ingenious method, using Internal Revenue Service data on estate-tax returns, 
makes the dead disclose what the living conceal. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Rose Bowl's 104,696 seats, two-thirds would be empty if only Americans 
with a net worth of $5 million or more -- averaging about $11 million apiece, 
$538,000 of it in cash -- came to cheer. Another 20,000 seats would be taken if 
everyone owning $1 million in corporate stock got in. These 58,200 individuals 
alone own roughly one-fifth of the value of all the corporate stock and 
two-fifths of the bonds and notes. Glancing downward a bit, the richest 1% own 
one-quarter of the net worth of all adults. 
</P>
<P>
This is what's owned by wealthy individuals. But, especially in the upper 
reaches, wealth is jointly owned and controlled by the family. A host of legal 
devices (e.g., trusts and estates) are used to control a family fortune. Family 
members share in its benefits (yachts, planes, retreats), receive income from 
it and are the potential heirs of each other's holdings, which are slices from 
the same property pie. 
</P>
<P>
The "family" among the wealthy typically extends, through ties of blood and 
marriage, far beyond the immediate family. Sometimes, even its members don't 
know exactly where its boundary is. That's why the wealthy take care to define 
inheritance rights with exquisite precision -- to the fifth degree. No one 
knows how much of America is really owned by a few interwoven opulent families. 
</P>
<P>
Counting only what the immediate family owns, a special survey for the Federal 
Reserve Board reveals that the families of the "super-rich" (the top 0.5% of 
all families) own 30% of all commercial real estate, half the corporate stock 
and a bit more of the bonds and trusts. All told, the "super-rich" own 24.6% 
and the "very rich" (the 0.5% just beneath them) another 7.2% of the net worth 
of all families. Just beneath them, the next 9% own another 35.1%. Altogether, 
the top tenth of the nation's families own 67 cents of every dollar's worth of 
everything owned by every family in America. 
</P>
<P>
Contrast this with what ordinary people own. The families of the bottom half 
own less than 3% of America's wealth. If they're lucky, they have some "equity" 
in their home. But that's it. The net worth of more than a quarter (26.3%) of 
all families (as of 1984) is less than $5,000; another 6.4% have under $10,000; 
and another 12.4% under $25,000. Summed up, nearly half (45.1%) of all families 
have less than $25,000 to their name, counting everything they own, minus 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say it plainly. A small, privileged class owns America. So long as we 
deny this unpalatable truth, preferring to hang on to the illusion that this 
country is "classless" or its economic life has been democratized, no real 
political struggle to achieve those aims is possible. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes, its guiding principle should be, as Jefferson observed, that 
"the earth is given as a common stock for man to labor and live on . . . (So) 
legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property, only 
taking care to let their subdivisions go hand-in-hand with the natural 
affections of the human mind."

REASON AND RHETORIC ON FLAG BURNING AND FREE SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your excellent picture of a young lady shredding the American flag (front page, 
May 15) is unlikely to send a message to Congress where reason has so obviously 
succumbed to rhetoric. I can appreciate full well what the anguished face in 
the picture is "saying." 
</P>
<P>
Call it symbolic speech or what you will, I "read her lips" as the desperate 
call of an intelligent, conscientious, young person directed to the ruling 
class in this nation to put an end to foreign wars and interventions, to 
restore respect for the Constitution and laws of the United States, and to 
embrace as a plank of our foreign policy the age-old doctrine of the comity of 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sad reflection of our times that the people who flirt so freely with 
the words "democracy" and "freedom" are hellbent on the incarceration of 
conscientious dissenters. What we don't seem to realize is that we are 
returning to pre-independence days when the British used the sedition laws to 
suppress free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Who would have thought that only a few months ago, Congress gave standing 
ovations to the two greatest dissenters of our times. They, of course, were 
anti-communist dissenters. And that's another story!

<P>
It is possible to love America and hate the flag. I love America because it has 
taken great steps toward meaningful democracy, has taken in millions of 
immigrants from less-fortunate nations and has, for the most part, allowed its 
citizens to speak freely. 
</P>
<P>
I hate the flag because it has become a shroud to conceal the crimes of 
militarists, would-be kings, racists, deadbeats and ethnocentrism. 
</P>
<P>
Through assiduous propaganda, American society has forged a false connection 
between "support" for the flag and patriotism. True patriotism requires no 
symbol, rather it is demonstrated and fulfilled by deeds. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of patriotism that I associate with the flag is the kind to which 
Samuel Johnson referred in saying, "Patriotism is the last refuge of a 
scoundrel." 
</P>
<P>
The danger to freedom is not from those who burn flags, but from those who wrap 
themselves in them.

By urging the Supreme Court to make expressing objection to what the U.S. 
government is doing by symbolically burning a flag, the Bush Administration is 
trampling on what that very flag stands for, freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
It recalls to mind the wrongheadedness of that infamous reasoning of some years 
ago during the Vietnam disaster when some military excuse maker said "we had to 
destroy the village to save the village," or the stupidity of the parent who 
says to the child, "I'll teach you go around hitting people!" and gives the 
child a smack on the head.

Even in Moscow recently a protester who publicly defiled a Russian flag was not

My heart aches! Yes, I cannot believe that our country has come to the point 
where our flag, in our own United States, is not respected, protected, and, 
yes, venerated by our people.

We criticize other countries that desecrate our flag, that almost act 
uncivilized in a lot of ways and yet these other people from other countries do 
respect their country's flag.

WHAT WILL THE TROOPS DO NOW?; 
</P>
<P>
A RESTRUCTURING OF SOVIET MILITARY FORCES IS CERTAIN. WE SHOULD DROP OUR OWN 
EMPTY DEBATE AND JOIN THE PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY HART, Former Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) is writing a book on the second 
Russian revolution. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How does a giant military power go about dismantling a vast military machine, 
constructed over a half century at great cost and sacrifice, at a time when 
that great power's economy is beset by a multitude of problems? This question 
is not directed to the United States, although in many respects it might well 
be, but rather at the Soviet Union. And, of his many migraines, this might turn 
out to be one of Mikhail Gorbachev's most long-lasting. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze recently told me that sweeping 
reorganization and reduction of the Soviet military -- based on a new, peaceful 
relationship with the West -- has been a central premise of the perestroika 
syllogism from the beginning. But the reformers knew from the outset that they 
could not undertake sweeping reforms of the political and economic structures 
of the Soviet Union while the Cold War, the arms race and a policy of military 
confrontation depleted so much of their restricted resources. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Soviet military officials insist that their institutions have always 
been scrupulously non-political. And history bears them out. By and large, the 
Soviet military does what it is told. But it is not so simple. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party, as defined by the Bolsheviks, has consistently sought to 
indoctrinate Soviet military forces. Although one wonders what the ordinary 
recruit from Uzbekistan knows (or cares) about Marxism-Leninism, there have to 
be ties of some strength between senior military commanders and the party 
apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
This must be true, since the party is increasingly becoming the conservative 
bulwark against perestroika. In virtually all of the discussions I have had 
with Soviet officials and observers, the military is placed on the right, 
conservative, anti-perestroika end of the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
Still, presuming the policies of perestroika prevail, the size of the Soviet 
military will diminish overall by as many as 1 million or 2 million men by the 
end of the century. Where do these people go? What are their jobs? Where will 
they be housed? How can large numbers of weapons plants be converted to 
domestic production? These are daunting questions. Soviet negotiators in 
Hungary and Czechoslovakia have admitted that they cannot speed the withdrawal 
of Soviet forces from these countries because they don't have answers for these 
questions -- the Soviets don't know what to do with these troops when they 
bring them home. 
</P>
<P>
Perestroika leaders are also military reformers. They want to use this new era 
to undertake categorical reorganization of their military forces, including 
their military systems, doctrines and strategies. The best thinkers envision a 
Soviet military that is much smaller, more elite, better trained, better 
educated, better disciplined and more professional -- a military whose mission 
is to protect and defend Soviet frontiers against all threats. In short, a 
defensive military. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the Soviet military we have come to know and fear since 1945. But 
the military always reflects the society that creates it. And today's Soviet 
Union is not the same one we have known for half a century. The real question 
is whether we also have something to learn from all this. 
</P>
<P>
1990 is a historic moment. Now is the time to reform our own military. Even the 
secretary of defense has reluctantly accepted the fact that our world has 
changed. But instead of having a hollow, unproductive debate about how much to 
cut, let's discuss what kind of defense structures we now need, what the threat 
is and, maybe, what our new strategies should be, how we should structure our 
forces to achieve our goals, how to make those forces truly effective, what 
kinds of weapons are needed and -- only then -- how much this should cost. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime we'd better also begin to debate what to do with the excess. We 
need a policy of economic conversion. Otherwise unneeded weapons production 
plants simply will be shut down, skilled workers laid off, communities 
disrupted and economies decimated. 
</P>
<P>
Most assuredly, these questions are being hotly discussed in Moscow. For on the 
resolution of these issues could rest the future of Gorbachev, perestroika, the 
Soviet Union and perhaps world peace.

ON NAVAL WEAPONS, THE SOVIETS HAVE A POINT; 
</P>
<P>
WITH BOTH SIDES SEEKING DEEP CUTS, WE SHOULD PUT ELIMINATION OF SEA-LAUNCHED 
CRUISE MISSILES HIGH ON THE LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. LEE, Retired Vice Adm. John M. Lee served as assistant director of 
the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency during the first strategic arms 
limitation talks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid predictable last-minute wrangling over the arms treaty that President Bush 
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev hope to sign next month, the Soviets 
have renewed their demand to limit a breed of especially destabilizing naval 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the Soviets are pushing for something that would help our 
security. Oddly, we are refusing to talk about it. The United States should 
concede the point and agree to binding limits on nuclear sea-launched cruise 
missiles, or SLCMs. 
</P>
<P>
SLCMs fly low, cool and quiet, making them hard to detect. They are meant to be 
accurate to within 50 feet. Fired from ships close in, they would reach land 
targets on short notice. They are thus able to penetrate and strike reliably. 
</P>
<P>
They are also destabilizing, nearly impossible to verify in peacetime -- and 
useless. Destabilizing, because they threaten a first strike from us and so 
risk a preemptive strike from the other side. Hard to verify, because virtually 
identical non-nuclear missiles could be distinguished from them only by highly 
intrusive and unreliable means. Useless, because they merely add to an already 
excessive number of nuclear weapons at a time when United States and the Soviet 
Union alike seek deep cuts in strategic arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
America plans to deploy 758 nuclear SLCMs on 200 vessels. These are nulear 
war-fighting weapons at a time when it is absurd to contemplate fighting a 
nuclear war. The Navy claims that SLCMs protect our ships by increasing the 
number that the Soviets must target in a crisis. In reality, they simply make 
more ships into platforms for global menace and thus increase the danger of 
atomic war started by subordinates, or by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The only substantial argument for SLCMs is that we are technically ahead in 
developing and deploying them. But the Soviets will catch up in due course, as 
they have with other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Our goal should be to eliminate nuclear SLCMs altogether. Failing that, we 
should at least negotiate the minimum possible number and get them off surface 
ships where, unlike in submarines, they would act as magnets for a preemptive 
or counter attack. 
</P>
<P>
We should take heed of Ambassador Paul Nitze, the architect of the treaty on 
intermediate-range nuclear forces, and Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., former 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Both have said in recent months that 
they consider a verifiable ban on tactical nuclear warheads at sea to be 
important enough for the United States to abandon the Navy's policy of never 
identifying its nuclear-armed vessels -- and even to let Soviet inspectors 
aboard our most advanced submarines. 
</P>
<P>
Nitze relates that he arrived at that position after learning that Pentagon war 
games show our otherwise superior Navy almost never wins once a conventional 
battle escalates to nuclear weapons. Naval officers know this, and they don't 
want to spend their careers as pawns in a game of deterrence.

THE WAR OVER WHO KEEPS THE LOOT; 
</P>
<P>
THIS NATION ISN'T BROKE; BUSH JUST WANTS THE MONEY TO STAY IN PRIVATE HANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying that the United States is a rich country is like saying that Iceland is 
a cold one. But that statement made news down here in south Florida's gleaming 
montage of speedboats, speedy cars, glass towers, glossy people, and half the 
treasure, legal and illegal, of countries from Guatemala to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
The headlines were made by a Brookings Institution report restating the 
obvious: The U.S. economy is almost three times as big as any other in the 
world, and it is still growing and growing. 
</P>
<P>
The report, calling for the universal solution of "more leadership," is really 
a book-length attack on what appears to be some of George Bush's zanier 
points-of-light thinking. The President likes to deflect calls for action or 
leadership by pleading national poverty. The United States, says our only 
President, has "more will than wallet." 
</P>
<P>
Ridiculous, says Brookings, with righteous and accurate indignation. The 
report, called "Setting National Priorities," concludes: "The question is not 
whether America has enough wallet, but whether it has the will to use its 
abundant wealth to solve the problems it faces." 
</P>
<P>
But Bush the bad-mouther is not zany at all. He's protecting the traditional 
power of rich people who control American culture and charity. What Bush is 
trying to create, with some success, is perceptions of public poverty. That, he 
and many other conservatives reckon, creates or adds to private wealth -- 
particularly for those whose wallets bulge with revenues from capital gains and 
trust funds. The "investing class" is Bush's core constituency. 
</P>
<P>
Squinting through the day's news in Florida sunshine, you can see the 
skirmishes in the internal war over the distribution of growing wealth. In the 
Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale, there is a photograph of some of the 2,000 
teachers and school officials demonstrating at the state capitol to protest a 
$300-million shortfall (their estimate) in funding to educate the 100,000 new 
students expected to enter Florida schools next year. 
</P>
<P>
The minority leader of the state's House of Representatives, Dale Patchett, a 
Vero Beach Republican, was quoted in the Miami Herald, in response to calls for 
spending, as saying that there is no money. The only thing left to be taxed in 
Florida, he said, is "the time of day." 
</P>
<P>
Good line. But among the things the state of Florida does not tax is income. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's fundamental argument -- and Patchett's, too -- is that the power of 
America's fantastic wealth is better kept in the hands of the people than of 
the government. That's a pretty good argument, but it would be better if he was 
talking about all the people. In practice, most of that wealth and power -- 
like the revenue that would be raised by progressive income taxes -- is being 
transferred from the middle class to the trust-fund rich. 
</P>
<P>
Another item in the news last week shows how it works. The Bass Foundation and 
the Philecology Trust contributed $20 million to establish an Institute of 
Biospheric Studies at Yale. Edward Bass, whose uncle was a fabulously 
successful oil man, is a 44-year-old Yale graduate who worries about the 
ecosphere and has used the power of his money to determine what research and 
study should be done at one of the country's great institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Trusts and foundations -- basically ways to avoid income and inheritance taxes 
under American law -- give the rich control over the great range of American 
institutions between government and commerce. A few rich people exercise 
enormous power over universities and hospitals, theaters and symphony halls and 
museums -- whatever interests them. Bass happens to be interested in 
biospherics -- so Yale is, too. If he were interested in philately, Yale would 
be collecting stamps. 
</P>
<P>
On balance over the years, such philanthropists have probably done a great deal 
more good than harm. But they did it their way. Other Americans need not apply 
when it comes to institutionalizing much of art and science in this great and 
wealthy and productive democracy. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush, as President, is a diligent protector and proponent of his own 
kind. He is pretending that America is a poor country to protect the privileges 
and power of the better people -- at least the ones with the better wallets.

VIRGIN ATLANTIC'S PLAN TO PLANT TREES IS SINCERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to respond to S. J. Diamond's May 4 column, "Seeing Through the 
Forest of Environment-Themed Ads." 
</P>
<P>
The labeling of Virgin Atlantic's tree planting endeavors as a "trust us" 
campaign I find to be particularly troubling and inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
Our interest in improving the environment is genuine, continuous and filled 
with real hope, not hype. 
</P>
<P>
As founder and owner of Virgin Atlantic Airlines, Richard Branson has been 
involved with numerous charitable and environmental commitments in England. 
</P>
<P>
The tree planting campaign that coincides with the Los Angeles-to-London route 
is a natural extension of his environmental concern that includes nonsmoking 
flights, biodegradable bags and a recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin Atlantic's commitment to TreePeople and their commitment to plant trees 
is clear, and specific arrangements will be made once TreePeople determines 
what would best serve their cause. Virgin Atlantic will be there with full 
financial support and genuine interest. 
</P>
<P>
As with any new venture or endeavor, projections of customer response cannot be 
predicted with complete accuracy. For this reason, we are unable to provide a 
precise figure as to the amount of funds this program will generate. Be 
assured, however, that Virgin Atlantic has entered into this program solely as 
a means of aiding the environment and improving the quality of life.

MUTUAL FUNDS: WATCH OUT FOR ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSE FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national 
consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every little bit counts, as mutual fund companies well know. 
</P>
<P>
Portfolio managers have a hard enough time selecting the stocks or bonds that 
will let them beat their rivals. If they could somehow garner a slight edge 
beyond actual performance, most would thank their lucky stars. 
</P>
<P>
That's where annual expenses come in. 
</P>
<P>
All funds face certain operating expenses, which reflect ongoing outlays for 
staff, offices, equipment, shareholder services and other assistance, including 
the fee to hire the portfolio manager. Normally, these standard costs will eat 
up just 1% to 1.5% of a typical fund's assets each year -- hardly enough to get 
worked up about. 
</P>
<P>
But for any given portfolio, operating expenses can range from under 0.5% 
annually to more than 3%. At extreme levels and compounded over several years, 
they can make or break a fund. 
</P>
<P>
Investors don't pay for annual expenses all at once. Instead, the investment 
company will subtract the charges gradually over the course of a year. This 
means a fund's per-share price, quoted in newspapers, will already reflect 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Don't confuse annual expenses with sales charges. Front- or back-end loads, 
which can range as high as 8.5%, are one-time levies that don't figure into the 
yearly expense equation. However, 12b-1 fees, a type of marketing cost that 
sometimes is used to compensate stockbrokers and other salesmen, does count. In 
fact, a relatively high 12b-1 of 1% or more can easily double a fund's ongoing 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
How important are annual expenses? Craig Litman of Litman/Gregory &amp; Co., a 
San Francisco-based money management firm specializing in mutual funds, cites 
several other factors that normally weigh more heavily, including a fund's 
investment approach, track record, management style and the like. "The expense 
ratio is not the most important item, but it can help you choose among funds 
when other things are equal," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Mansueto, president of Morningstar Inc., a Chicago firm that tracks fund 
performance, points out that a bloated expense ratio wouldn't affect all types 
of portfolios to the same degree. A good stock manager would have an easier 
time masking high ongoing costs with superior performance. 
</P>
<P>
Not so with bond and money market funds, which tend to move more closely in 
line with one another. "Expense ratios are more critical on the fixed-income 
side, where annual returns tend to be more tightly clustered," Mansueto says. 
</P>
<P>
Basis-Point Battle 
</P>
<P>
If you don't think fund companies take their expenses seriously, tune into the 
verbal duel being waged by the Vanguard fund group against two rival giants, 
Dreyfus and Fidelity. The controversy erupted when Dreyfus and Fidelity decided 
to limit expenses on certain money-market funds, allowing them to boost their 
yields and lure investors. 
</P>
<P>
Dreyfus pledged to absorb all operating expenses on its Worldwide Dollar Money 
Market Fund at least until June 15 or until the portfolio reaches $7.5 billion 
in assets, at which time the policy will be reviewed. Fidelity guaranteed to 
cap the expense ratio on its Spartan Money Market Fund at 0.45% a year -- 45 
"basis points" in investment lingo. Compare those numbers to the 0.65% to 0.8% 
in annual expenses that the typical money market fund runs up. 
</P>
<P>
Vanguard Chairman John C. Bogle complained to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that Dreyfus and Fidelity ads touting the money funds are misleading 
because they incorporate the temporary fee waivers to arrive at attractive 
annualized yield figures. (At the time of Bogle's complaint in late March, 
Fidelity's expense cap extended through 1992 only; it has since been extended 
through 1995.) 
</P>
<P>
Dreyfus and Fidelity deny any deceptions and point out that investors can, at 
any time, make penalty-free withdrawals from the funds. "The yield we advertise 
is the yield we pay. There's nothing tricky about it," says Neal Litvack, vice 
president of marketing for Fidelity in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
While Dreyfus is itself footing the bill for annual expenses on Worldwide 
Dollar, Fidelity has adopted more of a pay-as-you-go approach with Spartan. To 
keep the fund's costs down, it charges shareholders $2 for each check they 
write against their Spartan account, each wire transfer they request and every 
exchange of shares they make into another fund. Most money funds don't charge 
separately for such transactions. But Litvack calls Spartan's way a more 
equitable approach for shareholders who don't make much use of these services. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing Apples 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, expense ratios are relatively easy to find and compare. Before you 
invest in a fund, consult its prospectus. Standard tables near the front of the 
document list all fees and charges, including the expense ratio. Look for any 
multiyear trends that show expenses rising or, preferably, declining. 
</P>
<P>
Make an effort to compare apples to apples. It would be misleading to examine 
the expense ratio of an international stock fund, for instance, next to that of 
a municipal bond portfolio. Fixed-income funds tend to have lower proportionate 
costs. The same goes for larger portfolios of any type because they can spread 
their expenses across a bigger asset base. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that a fund's expense ratio won't include transaction costs -- 
outlays for buying and selling stocks or bonds. But another prospectus line 
item, the entry for "portfolio turnover," will reflect how often a manager 
trades securities. 
</P>
<P>
An annual turnover rate of 100% implies that every stock or bond is replaced 
once a year on average. A 200% rate would imply twice as much trading, at 
perhaps twice the cost. As with expense ratios, watch for worsening trends in 
portfolio turnover. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TRACKING EXPENSE RATIOS 
</P>
<P>
A fund's expense ratio, which can be found in the prospectus, expresses annual 
operating costs divided by total assets. It's an important tool that can help 
you spot mutual funds burdened by excessive costs. Just keep in mind that you 
should compare a fund's expense ratio to that of others in its investment 
classification. Various categories of bond funds, for example, tend to have 
lower expense numbers than stock portfolios, as the following table shows. 
</P>

INVESTORS' CELEBRATION PREMATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who could blame investors for celebrating last week? 
</P>
<P>
After all, didn't the latest statistics from the government show that inflation 
abated in April? And didn't the recent Treasury refinancing, in which the 
government replenished its coffers by $30.5 billion, go off without a hitch? 
And aren't Congress and the President at this very moment beginning a powwow 
that will undoubtably solve that dastardly problem with the federal budget 
deficit? 
</P>
<P>
What wonderful developments those are. 
</P>
<P>
And if you happen to dislike stocks, put your money into bonds. Who wouldn't be 
happy to accept yields of more than 8.6% on long-term bonds? Boy, oh, boy! This 
sure is a great time to be an investor. You can't lose. 
</P>
<P>
Now that we've gotten that out of our system, let's douse that enthusiasm with 
a little reality. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates seem to have come down (and bond prices gone up) because the 
economy is in trouble. Retail sales, employment levels and industrial 
production were all much weaker than experts had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
As the bond market sees it, the economic slowdown means that the Federal 
Reserve Board will have to reduce interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
That same weak economy is probably behind the sudden decision by President Bush 
to try to arrive at a compromise with Congress on the federal deficit. With the 
nation's economy apparently sagging, the government's revenue shortfall will 
make the budget deficit look yucky. 
</P>
<P>
All that, of course, is good news for bonds. If permanently lower interest 
rates should come out of all this -- and that's a big "if" because of upward 
pressure on rates overseas -- the value of bonds held by investors will 
appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
But does that mean that slower economic growth is good for stocks? 
</P>
<P>
"If interest rates are coming down because we have moderate growth and low 
inflation, then the stock market has a right to rally," says David Jones, chief 
economist of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government bond dealer. Jones is 
also one of the most respected Fed watchers in the investment community. 
</P>
<P>
"But if interest rates are coming down because there is (economic) trouble 
ahead, then the stock market had better watch out," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Jones thinks that interest rates are falling because of the second reason: 
trouble with the economy. 
</P>
<P>
A chief reason that the federal government is coming up short in its revenue 
forecasts is that individual taxpayers and corporations aren't making as much 
money as expected. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, would the stock of corporations react favorably to such apparent bad 
news? 
</P>
<P>
Says Jones: "In the past, the stock market has applauded slower economic growth 
and stable inflation because it meant lower interest rates, which in turn would 
make stocks more attractive when compared to bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is an entirely different situation. When slower growth in the economy 
could exacerbate already weak (corporate) earnings, as well as create credit 
problems, then the outcome for stock prices should be negative instead of 
positive." 
</P>
<P>
As you know by now, the cheering began when the government announced that 
producer prices dropped 0.3% during April. Last week the government disclosed 
that the more important consumer price index, which includes the costs of 
services, rose 0.2%. That's about what most economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Let's give the data the benefit of the doubt and say inflation is moderating. 
Does that mean that the Fed will lower interest rates soon? 
</P>
<P>
William V. Sullivan, senior vice president and economist at Dean Witter 
Reynolds Inc., says the central bank will move hesitantly on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed, says Sullivan, "won't be that quick" to lower rates. "It will probably 
be a period of several months before we see the active reduction of interest 
rates." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed is still very concerned about the so-called core rate of inflation, and 
it won't abandon its inflation-fighting high interest rate policy just because 
one month's economic statistics were sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Fed decides to reduce interest rates, there is a big question as to 
whether that policy will stick in the marketplace. Interest rates overseas have 
been climbing the past few months and there is no sign of a major reversal. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Fed were to ease interest rates now, I believe the dollar would 
collapse. That would be followed by the bond market collapsing and that would 
put an enormous amount of pressure on the stock market," says Charles F. Eaton, 
a longtime Wall Street economist who now co-heads Intervest Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Eaton says that, after factoring out inflation, U.S. interest rates are already 
2 1/2 percentage points lower than rates in any of the major nations with which 
the United States trades. A drop in interest rates here, without an 
accompanying drop in rates overseas, could be disastrous, sending foreign 
investors scurrying out of U.S. financial markets. While foreigners aren't 
abandoning U.S. financial markets, they aren't heartily embracing them, either. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say demand for what the Treasury was selling was strong at the May 
auction. But, they add, a lot of the buying -- especially in the longer 
maturities -- appeared to have been speculative purchases made by U.S. dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Those dealers were banking on their ability to unload the bonds on small 
investors, to whom the 8.83% yields on the 30-year bonds should be very 
attractive. The all-important Japanese demand for the bonds wasn't any better, 
or worse, than it usually is. 
</P>
<P>
But keep in mind what went on last week during the bond auction. Out of the 
blue, Congress and the President suddenly announced their budget negotiations. 
And, maybe more important, newspapers were reporting that President Bush was 
willing to back off his stand that the budget gap would not be filled by new 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
With that as a backdrop, there was every reason to believe that the Treasury 
refinancing would be enormously successful. 
</P>
<P>
Things looked a little different right after the refinancing. First, there was 
some talk from White House officials that President Bush really wouldn't accept 
any new taxes. (That issue is still up in the air.) And then White House press 
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the budget talks could take weeks -- maybe even 
months -- to conclude. 
</P>
<P>
In short, it looks as though Washington is getting back to politics as usual. 
</P>
<P>
With all of this economic and political uncertainty, there is a lot of room for 
disappointing news to come out in the weeks ahead. And the financial markets 
are likely to react very negatively to any disappointment.

Q &amp; A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: What do you think about Pan Am? I hear stories about it taking over another 
airline or another airline taking it over. Is it a good investment? -- Oak 
Lawn, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
A: Pan Am has problems. Even its chairman, G. Thomas Plaskett, has been saying 
publicly for a long time that the best action for Pan Am would be to become 
part of a "larger route network." That means Pan Am needs to combine with one 
or more airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest of the talks, according to a well-informed source, came a few 
months ago when Pan Am was discussing a deal with NWA Corp., the parent of 
Northwest Airlines. Those discussions have virtually ended. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, there were talks with TWA. Carl Icahn, head of TWA, wanted Pan Am 
to purchase his airline, according to a source. With more than $1 billion in 
tax losses to carry forward, Pan Am can offer lower taxes to another airline if 
a merger is structured in which Pan Am is technically the one doing the 
acquiring. 
</P>
<P>
Because fuel costs have declined, airlines are generally making better profits 
these days. So Pan Am could be safe for a while. But next September, the 
airline has a $73-million pension payment due that could stretch its liquidity 
to the limit. Pan Am has requested a waiver on that payment. If it doesn't get 
it, it will probably have to sell an asset. Which one? Its Boston-New 
York-Washington shuttle is a likely candidate. 
</P>
<P>
But even then, Pan Am's problems won't be over. In October, says Thomas Longman 
of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Pan Am will have to pay big bills that were 
deferred on leased aircraft. Longman thinks that Pan Am will lose $1.40 a share 
this year, better than the $2.31 a share it lost in 1989. According to the 
Institutional Brokers Estimate System computer, the average estimate is a loss 
of $1.76 a share this year. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read recently that T. Boone Pickens, the corporate raider, said he 
attacked companies first and foremost because he was trying to serve the 
interest of the shareholders of his company, Mesa Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
I bought Mesa Limited Partnership units at $16 in 1987. They closed recently at 
less than $5. I wonder who Pickens is serving? -- Palm Desert, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
A: T. Boone Pickens did, indeed, say all he was trying to do with his forays 
was serve the interests of Mesa shareholders. But sometimes people just don't 
succeed in following through on their intentions. 
</P>
<P>
David Bradshaw, the energy analyst at Paine Webber Inc., says a lot of Mesa's 
problems weren't caused by Pickens. "The '80s were bad for the energy 
business," Bradshaw says. The price of natural gas, Mesa's main business, 
peaked in 1981 at more than $6 per 1,000 cubic feet. Recently, he says, the 
price was around $1.65. Since Mesa didn't have any refining and marketing 
capabilities, it couldn't insulate itself against such a steep drop in natural 
gas prices. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw is neutral on Mesa Limited units. They'll perform no better -- or 
worse -- than the market for the next 12 months, he says. Mesa recently 
announced an $18.2-million first-quarter loss and suspended cash distributions 
to holders of its preferred units. 
</P>
<P>
The company lost 24 cents a unit in 1989, contrasted with a profit of 52 cents 
the year before. According to Institutional Brokers Estimate System at Lynch 
Jones &amp; Ryan, an average profit of 12 cents a share is expected for Mesa 
this year.

Q: In 1984 I bought 4,000 shares of Gemini Resources Inc. at about 40 cents 
each. Lately, I've been unable to find out anything about the stock. Do you 
have an address to write to? -- Hummelstown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
A: I think you can kiss that $1,600 good-bye. The company's last address was 
878 E. Ninth St., Salt Lake City, Utah 84105. But there is no listing in the 
Salt Lake City telephone directory for a firm with that name. 
</P>
<P>
And the last time Gemini Resources stock traded over the counter was more than 
two years ago -- on March 22, 1988. It was then quoted at a bid price of just 
10 cents. JOHN CRUDELE

<P>
THRIFTS: THE BUREAUCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT IS ILL-EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THE BAILOUT. 
WE NEED A QUASI-PRIVATE AGENCY WITH REAL INCENTIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MAYER, MARTIN MAYER is the author of The Greatest Ever Bank Robbery, 
a book about the S&amp;L crisis to be published in October. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody who understood the savings and loan business knew a year ago, when 
the Bush Administration bailout bill was moving through Congress, that the 
legislation was badly flawed and couldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
The bill assumed that the assets in insolvent savings and loan associations 
were just a little off when really they were rotten; that the thrift industry 
would continue to grow by 7% a year when really it was going to shrink; that 
investors would be willing to put fresh capital into a business blighted by 
overcapacity, and that interest rates would drop throughout the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
But the real disaster has turned out to be institutional. The law put the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in charge of the Resolution Trust Corp. created 
to run and sell busted thrifts and their assets. The FDIC then, inevitably, 
structured the new agency in the image of the old. That process took a 
difficult task and made it hopeless. 
</P>
<P>
We needed a bunch of fast-talking super salesmen working on commission to sell 
off the salable assets of busted thrifts as soon as the government gets stuck 
with them. Instead, we have a worthy but rigid bureaucracy that notoriously 
sells only to people who have mastered all the moves in its own elaborate play 
book. 
</P>
<P>
I spoke in January with Lamar Kelly, a large and obviously capable Southerner 
who had come over from the FDIC to manage RTC's asset disposition activities. 
He said, "We have an RFP out for an MIS to enable us to track movements in all 
the large real estate markets." An RFP is a "request for proposal." An MIS is a 
"management information system." It takes some months for the computer software 
houses to prepare their proposals, more months for the agency to choose among 
them and award the contract, many more months for the software house to do the 
actual work in setting up the system and then maybe years to find out it 
doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
And through all this time the property has to be managed for the government, 
probably by people who don't have much stake in enhancing its value. And the 
government has to borrow money, roiling the credit markets, to give the RTC the 
"working capital" that it needs to hold the property. 
</P>
<P>
In his book about the failure of the Penn Square Bank in Oklahoma City, 
reporter Philip Zweig talked to a number of borrowers from the bank who 
couldn't pay back their loans and surrendered the collateral to the FDIC, which 
just hung on to it. A bank employee who had stayed on as a liquidator said FDIC 
officers worried more about being criticized than about the efficiency of their 
operation. One borrower told Zweig: "Talking to the FDIC is like visiting a 
very expensive Disneyland. It's like talking to Huey, Louie and Dewey. You 
can't get them to make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Delays are particularly painful because the FDIC as a government agency sells 
"as is," giving no warranties whatsoever. So people who want to bid must spend 
a lot of money up front to find out what they're bidding for. And among the 
first actions of the RTC Oversight Board was an order mandating "adoption of 
existing FDIC policies." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago the General Accounting Office did a "flow chart" of the 
traditional FDIC loan liquidation process. There were 36 boxes of various 
shapes, connected in various ways. Eight of the boxes involved the making of a 
decision, and in virtually every case that decision could be made only by a 
committee. Sometimes the decision required the concurrence of three committees 
-- local, regional and national. 
</P>
<P>
All government agencies move slowly by comparison with private actors because 
time is revenue, not cost, to a bureaucracy. But in this case there is a 
further reason for extreme care: Congress, which collectively doesn't 
understand the time value of money, looks over the agency's shoulder at all 
times. If an appraiser has said a property is worth $1 million in five years 
and the FDIC sells it for $700,000 now, some congressman is sure to call 
"Thief! He sold government property for $300,000 less than it was worth" -- 
even though $700,000 now is more than $1 million five years from now. 
</P>
<P>
Congress wrote into the bailout bill a requirement that RTC not sell property 
in distressed areas for less than 95% of appraised value. The appraisers work 
for the local banks and S&amp;Ls, which have a strong stake in keeping these 
appraised values high. Fortunately, the RTC Oversight Board brought in a man 
from the Federal Reserve who found a loophole in the law, a place where 
Congress had left out the word "appraised," and he declared that the law said 
RTC had to sell for 95% of "market value," which is easy to do. 
</P>
<P>
This wise decision was then sabotaged in a typically bureaucratic way, with an 
announcement that RTC will cut prices on an asset after it has been in 
inventory for six months. Why should anyone buy today when he knows the price 
will soon go down? 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC, moreover, likes to sell "whole banks" on a "TAPA" (total asset 
purchase agreement) basis. The insurer essentially guarantees the healthy bank 
acquiring the busted bank against loss on that bank's asset portfolio. Whenever 
the acquirer sells one of these assets to a third party for less than its book 
value -- the value at which the asset was carried on the balance sheet -- the 
FDIC makes up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
This was a very sweet arrangement for acquirers until December, 1988, because 
an idiotic tax law that expired with that year permitted the acquirers of 
S&amp;Ls and some banks to take their losses on these bad assets as credits 
against their other income for tax purposes -- even though the government was 
reimbursing them for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
This gave the acquirer roughly zero incentive to get a good price when he sold. 
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the S&amp;L insurance fund, made 
complicated deals to recover some of the tax break for the insurance fund. The 
FDIC didn't even do that in its rescues of Texas commercial banks, which were 
the most generous deals of all. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious objection to selling S&amp;Ls (or banks) as going institutions 
is simply because they've failed. If two of six S&amp;Ls in a small city have 
perished, the odds are that this city doesn't need six S&amp;Ls. If the 
government subsidizes acquirers to keep all six in operation, it creates a 
domino effect in which the other four fall one by one and have to be rescued by 
the government in turn. This is also very expensive for the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
So the regulators have to close down a lot of thrifts and banks, get what they 
can from anyone who wants access to the depositors (this is grandly called 
"franchise value"), and unload the assets as fast as possible. It's a very hard 
job. Most of the assets are not overvalued properties but bad loans, and 
there's a lot of legal work to be done before loans (sometimes loans that 
involve a number of lenders) can be converted to salable property. The 
government can't do any of this effectively, let alone efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
What we need, then, is a government-sponsored enterprise more or less along the 
lines of the Federal National Mortgage Assn. (Fannie Mae), except that its 
charter would give it only a limited time to live. The sole function of the 
enterprise would be to sell assets acquired in the receivership of insolvent 
banks and thrifts, on a basis whereby the enterprise would be paid more to get 
better prices (and less or nothing for worse prices). It should be able to pay 
its super salesmen high salaries, and it should be funded as much as possible 
from the private markets. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing up the rules for such an enterprise and establishing ways to police it 
would be a great challenge, because the world of asset disposition is full of 
people who are very practiced at feeding buckshot to the government's frog. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps we should license competing enterprises (the original plan for Fannie 
Mae, now more or less fulfilled by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or 
Freddie Mac). But even an enterprise pocked with skulduggery would be less 
costly than what the Administration and Congress structured in last summer's 
bailout bill.

SMALL VICTORIES THE REAL WORLD OF A TEACHER, HER STUDENTS &amp; THEIR HIGH 
SCHOOL BY SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN (HARPER &amp; ROW: $22.95; 416 PP.; 0-06-016254-6) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jay Mathews, Mathews, Los Angeles bureau chief of the Washington Post, is 
the author of Escalante: The Best Teacher in America, published by Henry Holt. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Turn a few pages of this remarkably vivid portrait of a New York City high 
school and you can almost smell the fluid of an overworked mimeograph machine, 
hear the dissonance of Asian and Latin American accents and feel the latest 
headache gathering force in the curly head of the book's heroine, English and 
journalism teacher Jessica Siegel, an educator who cared so much for her 
students that she finally had to choose between them and herself. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a few books that better address the broader issues of American 
education, but none I have read provide such a multilayered, personal, 
galvanizing account of what it is like to teach in a seriously troubled school. 
Samuel G. Freedman, a former New York Times reporter with a masterful command 
of detail, obtained enviable access to Seward Park High during the 1987-88 
academic year and uses it to take us into an emotional labyrinth. 
</P>
<P>
It being torture enough to have to teach in the New York city schools and care 
about the result, will anyone want to read about it? I think so. It is 
difficult to resist the story of Siegel's struggles in her last year of trying 
to keep an award-winning student newspaper alive, while making F. Scott 
Fitzgerald enlightening to farm kids from the Dominican Republic and Guangdong 
Province. The dramatic possibilities are not lost on Hollywood; 20th 
Century-Fox optioned the book long before its publication. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the best educators in today's public schools, Siegel, a doctor's 
daughter from New Milford, N.J., wandered into teaching after dabbling in 
another career -- journalism. She had worked for the student newspaper at the 
University of Chicago and tried the frenetic, poverty-stricken life of a 
Liberation News Service reporter before taking her energy and social 
consciousness to Seward Park in the Lower East Side. Freedman discovered her 
after she wrote him a letter complimenting him on one of his stories. With the 
assent of Seward Park principal Noel N. Kriftcher the teacher and the 
journalist hatched a plot to expose the darkest corners of a high school 
teacher's world. 
</P>
<P>
Freedman calls Siegel a "fiercely private" person, but she seems to have opened 
herself very wide here. She betrays both her frustrations with the social and 
emotional problems of her students and the school bureaucracy, and some more 
delicate personal matters, such as her carefully monitored affection for a 
married colleague and her need to take an occasional sick day just to be able 
to catch up with her paper work. 
</P>
<P>
The demands of her raging ambition -- not shared by many other faculty members 
-- to pull her students out of filthy streets and fractured families and into 
colleges and careers take every minute of her day. She grows frantic at the 
number of students who resist her efforts. 
</P>
<P>
What does she do about Mary Tam, who received a perfect "100 on her 
autobiography, 95 on her book report on 'Ethan Frome,' 90 on a test on Indian 
and Puritan literature, 90 on a surprise quiz on Thoreau" and yet "missed every 
other examination and all but three of 28 homework assignments"? The student's 
autobiography, brilliant as it was, had "intimations of suicide." Would Siegel, 
who had fashioned a classroom persona as a "tough cookie," be the one to push 
one more child over the edge? 
</P>
<P>
The staff of the Seward World, the newspaper that brought her and the school 
some unusual recognition, has difficulty even finding a room for an occasional 
meeting. Some of the paper's funds come out of Siegel's pocket. She has had to 
finesse a growing set of insane district rules to ensure that it is printed 
correctly and cheaply. In one painful episode, she begs for the $2,000 needed 
to print the year's last issue. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Siegel decides to leave teaching and try journalism again. "I'm 
really tired," she tells her closest friend on the faculty. "I work all the 
time. I have no life . . . and I just can't take it any more." 
</P>
<P>
Freedman seems intent on sticking close to Siegel, plus a few of her more 
interesting colleagues and students whose stories he sometimes travels halfway 
around the world to tell. He makes few attempts to link what he sees to any of 
the several debates over theory and practice now raging in Washington and in 
the universities, the teachers unions and the offices of governors and state 
school superintendents. But even so unadorned, his vignettes suggest real 
trouble for some of the most popular of the current educational fads. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel has to violate New York's "equalization" policy to keep a bright 
Hispanic youth, whose fragile self-esteem she has built to a critical point, 
from being transferred out of her class. This well-meaning rule, a result of 
the current emphasis on lowering class sizes, says she cannot have more than 34 
students in any period. In practice, it threatens to ruin years of work making 
certain children secure in an often hostile high school environment. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the most depressing -- and yet fascinating -- episode in the book, 
Siegel unsuccessfully begs for $3,000 for a copying machine so that teachers no 
longer have to spend hours typing stencils. Other members of the English 
department insist on spending the money on video-cassette recorders and 
television sets. This is their decision under one of the "teacher-empowerment" 
programs that have become so popular lately and have altered the management of 
every public school in Los Angeles under a new union contract negotiated last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of why teachers of English would rely so heavily on a visual 
medium was never broached," Freedman said of the television and VCR purchase: 
"This faction's most persuasive argument was its leadership," most notably 
"Judy Goldman, a reading teacher who served as the United Federation of 
Teachers (UFT) chapter chairwoman at Seward Park, and as such wielded more 
power in school than anyone except the principal." 
</P>
<P>
As rich and compelling as Siegel's story is, it leaves a thirst for a longer 
look at where public schools in New York are going and how well Seward Park's 
care-ridden classrooms match the picture of educational crisis we hear about in 
campaign speeches and on editorial pages. In his introduction, Freedman 
describes the falling SAT scores, low teacher salaries and widespread 
illiteracy that produced an avalanche of reform proposals in the early 1980s, 
then notes that "none of these trends was new. Not even the perception of 
crisis was new. In every generation or so, it seemed, America had indulged 
itself in a spasm of conscience about the state of the public schools." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a writer this talented, no matter how weary from a nerve-rasping year 
at Seward Park, has enough energy for another book that will tell us more about 
what we can change in our approach to learning. Can we keep the Jessica Siegels 
in the schools, or must this generation, like all the previous ones, resign 
itself to muddling through, ignoring the prophets of doom and the latest 
presidential commission?

THE WORDS ON THE PAGE, THE WORLD IN YOUR HANDS BOOKS ONE, TWO, THREE EDITED BY 
CATHERINE LIPKIN AND VIRGINIA SOLOTAROFF (HARPER &amp; ROW: $14.95, CLOTH; 
$6.95, PAPER; BOOK ONE: 114 PP.; BOOK TWO: 161 PP.; BOOK THREE: 184 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Neder, Neder is administrator of the Los Angeles Times Reading Lab, 
an employee and community literacy project. She tutored Steve at the Downey 
City Library for three years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve was in his early 50s. He had come to the library seeking help with 
reading. His 4-year-old son asked him to read stories and he couldn't. Steve 
said he had "screwed up" with his children from his first marriage -- children 
all grown now -- and he couldn't bluff his way along with this little boy. 
</P>
<P>
After a few years with a tutor, a variety of "fill-in-the-blank" workbooks, 
phonics drills and a string of "high-low" books with juvenile covers, Steve 
grew frustrated. One evening in the library, he said in disgust, "I want to 
read a real book!" Steve's strong determination to improve his skills was 
hampered by a scarcity of appropriate literature. 
</P>
<P>
To help fill this void for the thousands of new adult readers like Steve, 
editors Catherine Lipkin and Virginia Solotaroff have developed a new literary 
series, "The Words on the Page, the World in Your Hands." The series is three 
volumes of fiction, poetry and memoirs by an impressive list of 76 contemporary 
writers, including Shirley Kaufman, Alice Walker, A. R. Ammons, Peter Meinke, 
Karl Shapiro, Thomas Disch and Joyce Carol Oates. 
</P>
<P>
Lipkin and Solotaroff, both actively involved in adult literacy programs in New 
York, solicited and received overwhelming support of hundreds of published 
writers. The contributions are not "written down" to readers, but rather 
"written to them." Some are selected excerpts from published works, others are 
original, and some are carefully adapted by their authors, "without sacrificing 
flavor, point or power." 
</P>
<P>
The series, however, isn't exclusively for adults learning to read. It also is 
an invitation to another segment of the population whose numbers are countless 
-- the aliterates: those who know how to read, are well-educated, and whose 
priorities have become other than reading for pleasure. This anthology awakens, 
challenges and enlightens imagination. I read through each volume with a 
swelling sense of addiction. I had an uncontrollable urge to browse in the book 
store and at the library, to dust off my own neglected collection at home, and 
to share rhyme and prose with anyone who willingly listened. 
</P>
<P>
The editors describe available adult-literacy materials as having been written 
originally for children or developed by educators "assuming adults learn much 
as children do, emphasize phonics and word recognition, often at the expense of 
meaningful content." 
</P>
<P>
Lipkin and Solotaroff believe literacy students should have texts that "engage 
their adult imaginations and offer them opportunities to experience their 
surroundings in new ways. 
</P>
<P>
While savoring each selection in each volume of "Words on the Page," I was 
reminded that my love of reading isn't for consonants and vowels or proper 
spelling. It is a love for the words and the images and feelings they evoke 
inside of me. Perhaps this is what being literate means. 
</P>
<P>
It is the anxiety shared with Dick Gregory in "Freedom March," adapted from his 
book, "Nigger," and included in Book One, as he is confronted by police in 
Greenwood, Miss., during a civil-rights march in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
It is the heart swelling with emotion in Tess Gallagher's recollections of her 
longshoreman father, "My Father's Love Letters," adapted from her article, "In 
Praise of What Persists": "My father's love letters were to be the only record 
that my parents had ever loved each other, for they never showed affection for 
one another in front of us." 
</P>
<P>
In Alfred Corn's "Learning the Words," the reader lives the words he has 
learned. Literacy can provide a new reality: 
</P>
<P>
 "I spelled the word for dove: 
</P>
<P>
 One landed on the ground 
</P>
<P>
 I asked the spelling of love, 
</P>
<P>
 And love is what I found." 
</P>
<P>
While discussing the magic and mystery of reading an essay sharing the 
anthology's title, "The Words on the Page, the Worlds in Your Hands," novelist 
Thomas M. Disch confides that he doesn't have a "clear idea what's going on in 
my head" when reading a novel. Disch doesn't explain how writing works to turn 
the words on the page into a dream "as real as your own life." He only 
reassures the reader "that it happens all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Disch encourages new readers and reminds rusty ones to "just look around" -- 
and to read.

RICHARD EDER: PARABLES WITH AN AUDIBLE PING!; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY SINS BY WILLIAM TREVOR (VIKING: $18.95; 251 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A secret is hidden not once, but every day. In William Trevor's stories, each 
daily concealment is the thinnest of layers. Added one by one, they work up 
over the years a texture as rich as flake-pastry. Besides the richness, they 
also work up tension. And at some point, the tension snaps; a hidden shame, 
longing or meanness is revealed with an almost audible ping! 
</P>
<P>
Pings! are not much found in the short stories written in this country 
nowadays. Our newer writers dismantle the spring even as they tighten it, and 
the final release is a dampened-down Chirr! 
</P>
<P>
There are good contemporary reasons for this, and unquestionably, the stories 
of the Irishman Trevor can seem old-fashioned. In his new collection, not as 
strong as "The Silence in the Garden" and "Fools of Fortune," which preceded 
it, this faintly archaic note is especially noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
No writer uses more cunning strategies or a more finely meshed prose. These 
should be almost enough in themselves, but perhaps they involve more artfulness 
than life. Trevor, in any case, seems to require a theme of some sweep -- the 
passing of time and history over Irish lives -- for his skills to do themselves 
justice, for his pings! to suggest the striking of a tower clock and not simply 
the four minutes of an egg-timer. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the egg-timer stories take a frequent Trevor theme, and delicately 
elaborate it. The protagonist of "In Love With Ariadne," middle-aged and 
established, still carries his longing for a girl he had met at the boarding 
house where he lodged as a university student. 
</P>
<P>
Shy and fragile, she had entered a convent as soon as he revealed his 
attraction. Shame sent her there; her father had been caught making advances to 
a child. On a snowy night years later -- we think of the snow in "The Dead" -- 
a bus passes, Trevor writes. "A lone figure stares out into the blurred night, 
hating the good sense that draws him away from loitering gloomily outside a 
convent." 
</P>
<P>
Another youthful love set in unhospitable soil is recalled by an artist, now in 
her 30s. She had gone as an au pair to a French family living in the Jura. Mme. 
Langevin was kind and welcoming, but with a touch of steel. During the war, 
left alone to run the estate, she had shot a German soldier. And when she 
senses a spark between the girl and her husband, she quietly puts an end to his 
custom of driving her, on her days off, to a neighboring village. For the 
artist, now, an ocean of yearning surges in a teaspoon of memory. Not a drop 
spills. 
</P>
<P>
The transactions of love and of regret could not be better set out, nor could 
every last detail of their setting: the pinched Dublin boarding house, the 
French country estate. Yet both have the air of a geometric proof; the 
characters have no real shape outside the shape of their transactions. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true of the transactions of malice. In "The Third Party," a husband 
meets in a bar with the man that his wife is leaving him for. All bluff 
understanding and sportsmanship, the husband works a needling torment of his 
rival, capped with a revelation that will take full revenge both on the other 
man and on the faithless wife. In "Coffee With Oliver," we get an exquisite 
portrait of a middle-aged scoundrel who lives in Italy on remittances from his 
wife, and on his own careful meannesses. 
</P>
<P>
The geometry is less naked in "August Saturday." A woman unexpectedly meets, at 
a country-club gathering of her set -- old friends, all of them -- a man who 
had been her lover one night, years before, after another such gathering. The 
dinner, the bantering and reminiscing among the couples are a tapestry of 
shared lives; the presence of the outsider and the memories he evokes are a red 
thread through it. 
</P>
<P>
All of these stories have a fine command of texture and pace; the polish of a 
supreme attentiveness. Yet they are remote. They float in a curious idleness; 
no necessity reaches out to us from them. 
</P>
<P>
It is in the stories set among the impoverished homes and farms of rural 
Ireland that Trevor's gifts find a more important use. In "Kathleen's Field," 
the daughter of a hardscrabble farmer goes to work as a maid for a local 
shopkeeper so that her wages can pay for a well-sited field that will let her 
struggling family survive. The shopkeeper abuses her sexually; she has no 
choice but to put up with it. We feel the fearful wound to her spirit, not so 
much in the abuse itself as in her helpless knowledge that other girls, who had 
worked there and quit, will know the shame of her staying on. 
</P>
<P>
The burden of unjust shame gives passion and life to the other rural stories. 
In "A Husband's Return," Maura Brigid Colleary, her brother, Hiney, and their 
mother live half-destroyed by it. Maura Brigid had married Lawless, a young 
neighbor. Six months later he ran off with Bernadette, her sister and the 
family favorite. And Bernadette died, pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Hiney lodges his pain in stolid labor, Mrs. Colleary in endurance, Maura Brigid 
in longing for her vanished husband. The family lives by its myth: Lawless is a 
scoundrel, Bernadette a poor victim. And when Lawless asks to come back, and 
convinces Maura that it was her sister who was the seducer, she struggles to 
get the myth changed. 
</P>
<P>
But her family cannot put aside its image of Bernadette; it is all they have. 
Maura Brigid must live on, not only husbandless but also bearing the story's 
burden: She is the one who, by foolishly marrying a wicked man, brought death 
to her saintly sister and disgrace upon them all. 
</P>
<P>
For us, of course, it may be hard to think of shame as having the power to 
become a story's heart's blood. It is a rural, not an urban agony; it burns in 
poor and enclosed communities where honor is the only treasure. It is 
remarkable that a modern and sophisticated writer is able to take such a notion 
from the book of dead sayings, and make it live so ardently.

CITY OF THE BROAD SHOULDERS, CITY OF THE YEARNING HEART; 
</P>
<P>
THE COAST OF CHICAGO BY STUART DYBEK (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $17.95; 192 PP.; 
0-394-57449-4) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Eric Larsen, Larsen is the author of the novel An American Memory (Anchor 
paper) and has contributed frequently to Book Review.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, Stuart Dybek published a collection of Chicago-set stories, 
"Childhood and Other Neighborhoods," receiving for that achievement the 1981 
PEN Hemingway Award. Now he comes forth with another story volume, again set in 
Chicago, and again about childhood and coming-of-age. The book sags and 
maunders now and then, but at its best (which is a lot of the time, from its 
quietly ironic and theme-hookingly perfect title on through a last paragraph 
that plucks at the heart-string of time itself), this is fiction that's moving 
and real and often brilliantly ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
Dybek's Chicago -- or much of it -- is the Chicago of the poor, the rough and 
the run-down that will remind many readers (as his earlier book did, too) of 
the legacy left to Dybek by Nelson Algren. In the story "Blight" ("During those 
years between Korea and Vietnam, when rock and roll was being perfected, our 
neighborhood was proclaimed an Official Blight Area"), Dybek spins out 
sidewalk-and-back-alley tales about adolescent boys such as Pepper Rosado, 
Deejo DeCampo and the troubled Ziggy Zilinsky, who somehow fears that the year 
when the White Sox win the pennant will also be the year the world ends by 
nuclear apocalypse -- and who disappears at the end, on his way to become a 
Trappist monk. 
</P>
<P>
The story itself is a longish one, lanky and string-like in shape. If the 
anecdotal adventures of these bad-neighborhood boys (music, love, street-tough 
emergings of unlettered but poetic yearnings) seem familiar and faintly like 
literary reruns, the atmosphere of the place they live in doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
A more substantial point of entry into Dybek's work is revealed almost 
accidentally -- for example in his narrator's comment that "among blocks of 
factories, railroad tracks, truck docks, industrial dumps, scrapyards, 
expressways, and the drainage canal, people had managed to wedge in their 
everyday lives." 
</P>
<P>
It's with this instinctive movement to a position just under the surface, and 
with the turning of his back on the demands of a conventional narrative pulled 
along by one stalwartly outward event after another, that Dybek's particular 
genius begins to find its voice and its subtle, wordlessly whispering wings. 
</P>
<P>
"Chopin in Winter," for example, is a touching and poetic weaving together of 
themes that will emerge in one way and another throughout much of the book. 
Here the old world meets the new, in a dingy apartment building operated by its 
landlady, Mrs. Kubiac, whose daughter went East to study piano, then came home 
again, pregnant, to play boogie-woogie and Chopin through the winter before 
disappearing once again to give birth to her black baby (to be named Tatum 
Kubiac, after the great jazz pianist, Art Tatum). These events are witnessed -- 
and heard -- by a schoolboy narrator whose father died in World War II, whose 
mother works diligently on correspondence courses in bookkeeping, and whose 
Gypsy-like and ne'er-do-well grandfather, Dzia-Dzia, has drifted back that 
winter to soak his ailing feet in buckets of steaming water on the kitchen's 
linoleum floor before, himself, setting off once again. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of what I knew of Dzia-Dzia's past had mainly to do with the history of 
his feet," says the boy, explaining that his wandering grandfather's feet "had 
been frozen when as a young man he walked most of the way from Krakow to Gdansk 
in the dead of winter escaping service in the Prussian army." Steam rises up 
and clouds the homely kitchen windows; the boy labors at his schoolwork; snow 
whirls on desolate city rooftops outdoors, and the sounds of Chopin, evening 
after evening, come from the apartment upstairs, as "Across from me, Dzia-Dzia, 
his hair, eyebrows, and ear tufts wild and white, swayed in his chair, with his 
eyes closed and a look of rapture on his face as his fingers pummeled the 
tabletop." 
</P>
<P>
It's with symbols such as these that Dybek is at his very best, finding within 
them, somehow, vein after vein of reverberant and moving richness. In 
"Nighthawks," named for the famous Edward Hopper painting of a late-night 
diner, he creates a long and wonderful tapestry of collage and image and myth 
(including Orpheus) that tells, at its center, the story of the young lovers, 
Choco and Nina: how Choco went AWOL to be with Nina; how they went up onto a 
summertime rooftop and "took angel dust, which made the moon seem near enough 
to step onto from the roof"; how young girls afterward, "on moonlit nights . . 
. would see a fantasma, Nina, her hair flying and blouse billowing open, 
falling past their windows . . so slowly that it seemed as if it might take 
forever for her to hit the street." 
</P>
<P>
In this ode to the lonely and the sleepless and the grieving, Dybek strikes out 
coins of gold again and again in a piece that itself takes on the half-dreamed 
fullness and life of a Chagall painting. A counterman at the diner works 
nights, then goes home to his lonely and bare room in the suffocating heat of 
the day "to lie listening to children yelling as if they've re-created light . 
. while the drone of a ball game is gradually replaced by the buzz of a f1y. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
The spirit of the worn-down but promise-studded city breathes through Dybek's 
often magical prose, as does the wider world from which its poor and oppressed 
and hopeful have come to dwell on this inland coast. A grandmother tunes in the 
"yellow plastic radio on her kitchen table," trying to get the polka station 
but sometimes missing it "by half a notch" so she gets "the Greek station 
instead, or the Spanish, or the Ukrainian." Explains Dybek's narrator, evoking 
all of the book's immigrant life with a perfect and unpretentious lightness of 
touch: "In Chicago, where we lived, all the incompatible states of Europe were 
pressed together down at the staticky right end of the dial." 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed between and among the longer pieces here are numerous short ones, 
some less than a page in length; in general, although not always, these reveal 
many fewer of Dybek's strengths, showing less certainty either of choice or of 
material in a collection that, whatever its high merits, is not always smoothly 
shaped or uniformly hewn. Dybek should be known, however, by his strengths and 
not his weaknesses, and his book, overall, is that rare thing: real fiction, 
otherwise known as beauty and uncompromising loveliness raised up out of life 
as it is.

As a junior high school teacher, I have always enjoyed "The Wonder Years" for 
its intensely accurate portrayal of the heart and mind of the adolescent. A 
recent episode about Kevin's reaction to his math teacher's death was 
brilliantly depicted. Every junior high counselor should have a copy of this 
episode in his desk and no parent should be without a video copy of it.

Good story, good actors, good direction. "Caroline?" had it all. Interrupted 
only by enthralling mini-dramas for Hallmark cards, it made for two hours of 
delightfully wonderful network television.

How could KTLA continuously and distastefully show previews of "Voyage of 
Terror: The Achille Lauro Affair"? The event was an atrocity that affected a 
lot of lives and should not have been trivialized or capitalized upon for 
ratings.

Photo, 1957 was "a golden year in a golden era for American consumers," and to 
a young Japanese boy moving with his family to the United States, the appeal of 
consumer imagery was epitomized by the new gimmick of putting advertisements on 
matchbook covers. Yosh Kashiwabara's collection, catalogued in "Matchbook Art" 
(Chronicle Books: $16.95; 120 pp.), records the boasts of many California 
landmarks, including L.A.'s Coconut Grove and Chili Bowls and San Francisco's 
Cliff House. These matchbook messages, carried out by the thousands in purses 
and trouser pockets, no doubt gave every businessman hope that the epithet 
"world famous," which appeared on such a large number of their establishments, 
would indeed soon apply.

I enjoyed "The Andrew Lloyd Webber Story." PBS did an excellent job in going 
behind the scenes to talk to the British composer of such mega-hit musicals. I 
loved the excerpts from "Evita," "Cats," and "Phantom of the Opera."

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: HOW I MADE A HUNDRED MOVIES IN HOLLYWOOD AND NEVER LOST A 
DIME BY ROGER CORMAN WITH JIM JEROME (RANDOM HOUSE: $18.95; 206 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

There was never a more aptly named autobiography than "How I Made a Hundred 
Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime," written by the film maker who's 
been called the King of the B Movies and the Pope of Pop Cinema. Roger Corman 
can boast -- and does, on his first page -- that his operation is on an 
unbelievable streak: 60 consecutive profitable movies. 
</P>
<P>
Corman has made a success in every aspect of the business, from producing and 
directing such works as "The Little Shop of Horrors," his Edgar Allan Poe films 
("The Fall of the House of Usher" and "The Pit and the Pendulum," among others) 
and his biker films (made with the real Hell's Angels) to distributing his own 
films and others'. 
</P>
<P>
"I am known for making films cheaply, quickly, profitably," Corman writes 
succinctly, "and for finding innovative, unconventional ways of putting up on 
the screen an intangible 'production value' worth several times my films' 
actual cost." Although his hallmark is economy, he reminds readers that "my 
better films have been shown at prestigious festivals. . . . Moreover, at New 
World, while we churned out R-rated exploitation fare through the 1970s, I also 
found new and quite lucrative ways to import world-class art films from abroad, 
four of which won Best Foreign Film Oscars." (The legendary producer/director 
and self-confessed "outlaw" film maker is still at it: His biggest-budget film 
ever, "Roger Corman's Frankenstein," is due for release over the Memorial Day 
weekend.) 
</P>
<P>
Corman's boasts, however -- and much he has to boast about -- begin and end in 
Chapter 1. The rest of the book (written with journalist Jim Jerome, co-author 
of "Papa John") is devoted to storytelling -- by Corman, about Corman, at 
Corman's expense, at everyone else's expense, but always to the greater glory 
of the art he practices so exuberantly. The overriding sense one gets from the 
torrent of stories told here is that film is treated too often with kid gloves, 
and that the success of Corman productions comes from never fearing to jump in 
and get dirty. 
</P>
<P>
Corman's own narrative is intercut with stories told by people who worked with 
him. Some of the best stories chronicle the early efforts of the host of famous 
film people who got their start under Corman's tutelage: Martin Scorsese, 
Jonathan Demme, Ron Howard, John Sayles, Jack Nicholson and many others. 
</P>
<P>
Here are riotous tales of feature-length films shot in a few days on shoestring 
budgets. "Hollywood Boulevard" was made when Jon Davison bet Corman that he 
could produce a picture for $50,000 less than anything Corman's company had 
done. The film used stock footage from the studio, and young trailer-cutters 
Joe Dante and Allan Arkush got their first chance at directing. Abby Dalton 
recalls another mad production in which "Roger, on his way to setting his 
record, set up shots so quickly that one of the Viking girls in the background 
raced through a shot with her sunglasses on. No one even noticed." When Martin 
Scorsese first met Corman, he expected to meet the maniacal, seat-of-the-pants 
yahoo type that the stories might suggest. "Instead," Scorsese recalls, "I 
found him a very courteous and gentlemanly guy, but a very stern and tough 
customer who was quite polite as he explained these outrageous tactics of 
exploitation in cold, calm terms. . . . 'Martin, (Corman told him,) it's 
important that every fifteen pages there should be a touch of nudity or the 
suggestion thereof. Like a shoulder or leg exposed. It keeps the interest.' " 
</P>
<P>
Corman's autobiography employs the same successful technique as his films: It's 
fast-paced, not overly intricate, and it tells a great story.

Like teddy bears wrapped in barbed wire, the characters in T. Coraghessan

vulnerability behind a thorny shield. Boyle is an often devastating commentator 
on Los Angeles and the weirdos, wanna-bes and mountebanks who congregate here.

A down-and-out immigrant stunt man risks mutilation and death to achieve 
fleeting immortality in the supermarket tabloids. A sleazy press agent faces 
the monumental task of improving the Ayatollah's public image. A 
security-system saleswoman preys on yuppie paranoia with carefully orchestrated 
stories of psychotic attackers: A murder she inadvertently provokes becomes the 
choicest grist for her mill. This acerbic, scrupulously observed portrait of 
contemporary Southern California is apt to confirm the reader's most dire 
suspicions about the people next door.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: CAUGHT IN A STILL PLACE BY JONATHAN LERNER (SERPENT'S TAIL: 
$9.95)

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON

<TEXT>
<P>
A weird, almost hallucinogenic novel of post-apocalyptic life in the Florida 
Keys. Government has collapsed, leaving Jonathan Lerner's bizarre cast of 
characters struggling half-heartedly to preserve the guttering flame of 
civilization. Lerner seems to be offering a testament to the enduring powers of 
love and friendship, but the two get rather muddled when a gay man and a 
heterosexual woman inexplicably decide to become bedmates.

'PEAKS' AND VALLEYS

<TEXT>
<P>
David Lynch has been quoted as saying that "Twin Peaks" is like "Peyton Place" 
meets "Blue Velvet." On that, I have to agree, for like its apparent 
progenitors, "Twin Peaks" is long, ponderous and pretentious. 
</P>
<P>
But adventurous or unprecedented? Hardly. "Quantum Leap" already handled a 
similar murder mystery -- complete with the clues-in-the-home-movie gimmick -- 
and told a much more interesting story along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Lynch has always seemed more impressed with the sizzle than the 
steak, which explains the showUs quirky photography, gratuitous morbidity and 
music that sounds like cowboy junkies on Valium. Beyond all that, however, 
"Twin Peaks" is nothing more than a garden-variety soap opera. And that, you 
should pardon the expression, has been done to death.

"Twin Peaks" is the only TV program I will put aside the crocheting or

second, and the plot is shot.

EVERYBODY'S A CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
Based upon the absolutely glowing review by Michael Wilmington (Movies of the 
Week, April 15), we decided to view "That's Life!" rather than Vaclav Havel's 
"Audience" on PBS or "20/20" on ABC. We saw a tedious, unfunny, unwitty, pop 
psychology movie and now understand why we never heard of it before. I taped 
the Havel play (fortunately) but regret missing "20/20."

Regarding Howard Rosenberg's May 13 article about Kirstie Wilde, the former Los 
Angeles news anchor: I am curious as to why Wilde underscored the crazed 
heinousness of John Gacy's crimes by noting he was not just a garden-variety 
mass murderer but a "homosexual mass murderer!!" So, mass murder committed by 
heterosexual persons is more indicative of a healthy personality?

HOLLYWOOD'S OBSTACLES TO MOVIES ABOUT AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As any recent traveler to West Africa will attest, the truly ignored victims of 
AIDS are not homosexuals, intravenous drug users or even hemophiliacs. By far 
the largest bloc of AIDS sufferers are ordinary African men and women who are 
dying by the millions in conditions we in America can barely imagine. 
</P>
<P>
These people far outnumber those unfortunate upscale homosexuals whose life 
styles are depicted in "Longtime Companion" (the subject of David J. Fox's May 
13 article, "They Found Out How Tough a Sell AIDS Really Is"). 
</P>
<P>
Can we hope that a sympathetic screenplay is even now on a producer's desk 
somewhere in Hollywood? Perhaps. But how many African-American producers are 
there who would have sufficient clout to lobby for such a movie to be made?

HOLLYWOOD'S OBSTACLES TO MOVIES ABOUT AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If all studio executives feel as Ricardo Mestres (president of Disney's 
Hollywood Pictures) does about AIDS, it's no wonder that major studios aren't 
making movies on the subject ("Fear of AIDS Movies," by Elaine Dutka, May 13). 
He says "because AIDS is so utterly hopeless, there's no catharsis after the 
suffering." 
</P>
<P>
True, AIDS has brought with it much fear, pain and grief. But that's only part 
of the story. 
</P>
<P>
I've seen people giving freely of their time and energy to those in need, and 
the incredible satisfaction that these exchanges bring. I've seen young men 
embraced by their long distanced families and strained relationships healed. 
I've witnessed those facing death open up to their spirituality and being 
rewarded with peace and comfort. 
</P>
<P>
The story of AIDS is one of contrasts -- between pain and peace, despair and 
hope, fear and love. But most of all, I think it's a love story, for the love 
I've shared with those dealing with AIDS is moving and beautiful. And I think 
that's a story that people need to hear.

WRONG GEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Champlin erred when he wrote that Charles MacArthur said "I wish they 
were diamonds" when he offered peanuts to renowned actress Helen Hayes ("Helen 
Hayes Isn't Ready to Rust," May 13). 
</P>
<P>
In her 1965 memoir "A Gift of Joy," Hayes told how her future husband, during 
their first meeting, "poured several peanuts out of the bag into my hand. Then 
he smiled and said, 'I wish they were emeralds.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the same paragraph Miss Hayes noted that the oft-repeated proffer of love 
had a new twist when, years later, the successful playwright brought her a bag 
of emeralds from India, saying, "I wish they were peanuts."

'DR. WELSING IS THE FIRST SCIENTIST TO PSYCHOANALYZE WHITE RACISM. . . .' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beyond the scientific information on color dominance, whites also emulate black 
people in terms of what we do and say and how we look. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the bustle worn by whites was inspired by the prominent buttocks 
of black women (i.e., Hottentot sculpture and other images in the 17th and 18th 
Centuries in Europe); dances and phases and gestures invented by blacks are 
immediately snatched and adopted by whites. 
</P>
<P>
I believe melanin has a great deal to do with the association of blacks with 
having more soul, rhythm and coordination. 
</P>
<P>
If I were white and read the Cress Theory and the other scientific information 
on melanin (such as "Melanin: The Chemical Key to Black Greatness" by Carol 
Barnes, chemist), I'd not only want to look, act and sound black as many whites 
already try to do -- I'd want to be black.

AN UPSCALE ITALIAN MEAL IF YOU DON'T MIND A FORTISSIMO 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the owner of Cafe Giuseppe! recently read me the specials off a 
blackboard, he translated as he went along. Risotto was "Italian rice," 
cioppino was "seafood soup," mascarpone was "Italian cream cheese." I was glad 
that the understated translations were confined to Italian food, lest it be 
said that Michelangelo was a painter, that the Pope lived in a church and the 
"Inferno" was a travelogue. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe Giuseppe! is an attractive, upscale restaurant whose most outstanding 
visual characteristic is its green dining room. The walls are painted a solid, 
toned-down kelly green, as close to emerald as interior wall paint can get. 
Linens are pale pink. There are some posters and a few droopy philodendrons -- 
in terms of greenery, plants are no match for those walls. 
</P>
<P>
On a Tuesday night, there are more staffers than customers. We're greeted at 
the door by a cheerful Italian fellow, who tells us that we'll have Peter, "the 
big guy" who is an Australian, as our waiter. Sure enough, The Big Guy did the 
menu translation in an authentic Down Under accent. He pronounced pollo to 
rhyme with hollow. 
</P>
<P>
We started with endive wrapped in prosciutto served with shiitake mushroom caps 
in a veal reduction sauce. Separately, the components were tasty; together, a 
curiosity. A cold Sicilian antipasto had a tablespoon of good caponata but was 
otherwise unremarkable. Dinner comes with minestrone or a green salad: both 
were utterly bland and ordinary. My pollo alla griglia, half a grilled chicken, 
was plain, but it came with perfectly cooked green beans and carrots. The hit 
of the evening was linguini con muscoli: plenty of good black mussels on a huge 
heap of linguine awash in a well-herbed broth spiked with white wine and olive 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
When we left, the waiter who greeted us saw us out. He seemed worried and urged 
us to return. "There was nobody here tonight," he kept saying. 
</P>
<P>
On a Friday night, sure enough, Cafe Giuseppe! was packed. Clearly, the 
7-year-old restaurant has a loyal following. If we had just picked up our pace 
a little, we might have beaten the two women ahead of us to the door, and the 
last available booth. As it happened, despite our reservations, we were seated 
at a small table on an aisle close to the bar, in what felt like the fringes of 
the restaurant. The light, bentwood chairs were not particularly comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
On this night, the owner himself, David, took our drink orders and read the 
specials. We then ordered dinner from a cheerful young waiter. When I couldn't 
make up my mind among several entrees, the waiter said, "I'll take care of 
you." 
</P>
<P>
We started with provoletta alla oreganato, roasted cheese with olive oil and 
garlic, served with sun-dried tomatoes and a slice of roasted red pepper. We 
had fun spinning the hot cheese up onto chunks of bread and topping it with the 
tomatoes. I also had a creamy soup that was thick, "tomatoey" and filled with 
plump mussels. 
</P>
<P>
While we were working on our appetizers, David, flanked by two or three other 
staff members came up to the next table with a dessert-cum-candle. He proceeded 
to sing "Happy Birthday" a cappella in a reedy and strident operatic tenor. It 
was all terribly dramatic: He hit the high notes with such explosiveness that 
we nearly popped off our chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Our entrees provided revelations. The so-called risotto (a.k.a. Italian rice) 
under the twin chicken breasts in the pollo saporito was not risotto per se. 
Something serious -- a good gob of butter, Parmesan cheese, 20 minutes of 
stirring and one or two of beating, i.e. the bare essentials of what makes rice 
into risotto -- had been left out. It looked like yellow-colored rice with 
flecks of peppers. Indeed, the whole dish most resembled chicken divan, except 
for a curiously large dose of dill. 
</P>
<P>
My dinner was a revelation because, as you may recall, I didn't know what it 
was to be. The waiter arrived with two big plates of food. "The chef's feeling 
generous tonight," he said. The capellacci pomodoro, a big over-sized ravioli, 
was stuffed with ricotta cheese and spinach and topped with a good fresh tomato 
sauce. It was simple, pure, delicious. But the Italian sausage with fettuccine 
had a musty, pungent-tasting brown sauce full of green olives, capers, 
mushrooms, onions, tomatoes and mismatched dried herbs: It tasted like a 
kitchen accident. 
</P>
<P>
I was doing my best with all this food when another birthday dessert suddenly 
emerged from the kitchen. It occasioned a repeat of the same 
conversation-killing operatic performance. When it concluded, my friend 
whispered, "When are most people born? In the summer? I don't want to be around 
here when there are more than two birthdays a night." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings me to a final question: Would I ever return to this restaurant? 
Well, if for some reason I had to meet someone for an upscale meal in 
Northridge, I probably would. Unless, of course, it was my birthday.

PRICE HIKES CAUSED CANCELLATION OF JET DEAL, CHINA SAYS

China says that it canceled a huge deal with Grumman Corp. to modernize its jet 
fighters because the company raised its prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department said last Tuesday that Beijing had pulled out of the 
deal, under which Grumman would have modernized 55 of China's F-8 fighters with 
cockpit electronics and targeting radar. 
</P>
<P>
Estimated at $502 million, it would have been the biggest U.S.-Chinese military 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
"The project to renovate the F-8 fighters can no longer proceed according to 
the original agreement now, simply owing to the considerable increase of prices 
by the U.S. side," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Work under the deal had already been blocked by the current U.S. ban on arms 
sales to China, imposed in reaction to Beijing's bloody crackdown on dissent 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
China gave no indication of the size of Grumman's price increase, nor did it 
comment on speculation by military analysts that China would look elsewhere for 
advanced cockpit technology. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Beijing declined to comment, except to say cost overruns on 
military projects were common. 
</P>
<P>
China's cash flow has worsened since last June because of a freeze on Western 
government credits.

Scientists associated with the National Academies of Sciences have proposed 
dumping hundreds of thousands of tons of iron into the ocean to create giant 
blooms of marine algae that could soak up much of the excess carbon dioxide 
believed to be responsible for global warming. 
</P>
<P>
If the massive scheme is carried out, researchers say, it would be among the 
greatest manipulations of nature ever attempted. The Washington Post said the 
group recommended that a large international "iron enrichment experiment" be 
implemented at a cost of between $50 million and $150 million. Scientists are 
unsure, however, about the negative effects of inducing algae growth.

A HERO'S WELCOME AWAITS MANDELA AT EACH U.S. STOP

<P>
It is a phenomenon in the making, a 10-day odyssey that promises to mix the 
pomp and ceremony of visiting royalty with the emotional chemistry of a civil 
rights observance: Nelson Mandela is coming to America. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, anti-apartheid activists are attempting to secure 52,000-seat Tiger 
Stadium for Mandela to address an expected overflow crowd. New Yorkers are 
organizing two speeches -- one at the United Nations and another at 68,000-seat 
Yankee Stadium -- plus a ticker-tape parade through downtown Manhattan. In Los 
Angeles, a squabble has already occured over control of Mandela's schedule. In 
Boston, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has reserved the John F. Kennedy 
presidential library for a luncheon; a public reception is expected in Boston 
Commons. 
</P>
<P>
And here, in the nation's capital, Mandela will cruise from a private audience 
with President Bush at the White House to star-studded fund-raising dinners to 
political conferences with well connected lawmakers. Organizers say an 
appearance at RFK Stadium or the Lincoln Memorial also is being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden from public view for 27 years by South African prison walls, Mandela 
stepped squarely into the international spotlight with his release on Feb. 11. 
Now, as word spreads of his journey to America, liberating expectations combine 
with racial tensions as municipal officials prepare to welcome and protect one 
of the world's greatest living heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress and the focal point 
of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, is expected to meet President 
Bush at the White House on June 25 and to visit Los Angeles on June 29 and 30. 
Other stops are planned in New York, Boston, Atlanta, Miami and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of Mandela's American visit are scrambling to find places deep and 
wide enough to hold the anticipated thousands who will pay to see -- and be 
seen -- during his historic visit. Some are comparing the coming of Mandela to 
the much publicized visit of Pope John Paul II to nine U.S. cities in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Mandela will get the kind of treatment the Pope got," said Bill Owens, a 
Massachusetts state senator and a leading figure in Boston's black communities. 
"For all intents and purposes, Nelson Mandela is more than a head of state. He 
is, perhaps, the most well-known person in the world right now." 
</P>
<P>
For millions of Americans, including an overwhelming number of black Americans, 
Mandela's struggle against the South African government has made him a world 
leader of almost mythic proportion. His seven-city U.S. tour will take him to 
urban areas with large black populations and, in some cases, severe racial 
tensions. Five of the seven cities have black mayors. While local officials so 
far have played down the possibility that Mandela's visit could spark 
confrontations, they acknowledge that his presence is likely to evoke powerful 
emotional outbursts among both blacks and whites, particularly at large outdoor 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
Since the "Free South Africa" protests in 1984 focused attention in this 
country on the racially segregationist policies of the South African 
government, Americans have identified increasingly with Mandela's cause. 
</P>
<P>
Although the turnout will be difficult to predict until his schedule is 
completed, each of Mandela's public appearances in the United States could 
attract tens of thousands of participants and create scenes reminiscent of the 
historic civil rights rallies of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
In what was seen as an early indication of the likely U.S. reaction to his 
presence, Mandela attended a rock concert in his honor at London's Wembley 
Stadium before more than 70,000 admirers who paid $33 each for their tickets. 
When Mandela rose to speak, the overflow crowd of blacks and whites, 
celebrities and commoners, sat in awe-struck silence. 
</P>
<P>
Already, organizers of his visit to the United States are preparing for an 
onslaught of people who hope to meet with him or use his celebrity to enhance 
their causes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to shake his hand," said Roger Wilkins, coordinator of the 
Mandela Reception Committee, which is supervising Mandela's lodging, travel and 
social engagements in concert with the African National Congress; TransAfrica, 
an anti-apartheid lobby, and Fenton Communications, a Washington public 
relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Since people found out I have this job, I've gotten so many calls from new 
friends, all people who want to participate some way or meet him," said 
Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
Describing Mandela as "a very, very valuable 71-year-old human being," Wilkins 
said the planning of his U.S. itinerary would be supervised through the 
committee's Washington office. Local officials in each of the host cities are 
making arrangements and recommendations for activities in the respective 
locations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A small dispute erupted last week in Los Angeles, where the local ANC office 
expressed dismay at the announcement of the Wilkins group's control of 
Mandela's schedule. Responding to the concerns of the Los Angeles ANC chapter, 
the reception committee issued a statement affirming its duties as the sole 
"organizing body for the visit." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some local confusion and apprehension have become evident amid 
the excitement surrounding Mandela's impending visit. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the chief source of controversy arising from Mandela's planned 
one-day stop in Detroit on June 28 is who gets the credit for his Motown visit. 
Mayor Coleman A. Young said it was his invitation that swayed Mandela; a group 
of Baptist ministers who traveled to South Africa this spring said it was their 
appeal that persuaded Mandela to visit Detroit; United Auto Workers officials 
claimed it was the union's longstanding solidarity with the struggle of black 
South Africans that tipped the scales. 
</P>
<P>
"The people involved in the process have all worked together on so many things 
that we don't anticipate much conflict," said Bob Berg, Young's chief 
spokesman. "The whole idea of his being here is a celebration of what he stands 
for and a chance for people of Detroit and Michigan and the surrounding states 
to show their support for the fight for freedom in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
For Young, however, the planned visit has revived a source of antagonism 
between the mayor and many of his black critics involving disclosures of 
Young's investments in South African Krugerrands. Young has disavowed any 
direct involvement in purchasing the gold coins, which were acquired by an 
investment firm created solely for Young's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Though growing tensions between Miami's black and expanding Latino communities 
exploded into rioting in 1987 and 1988, Alvin Peabody, an assistant to Miami 
Mayor Xavier Suarez, said the city will ensure tight security for Mandela's 
visit to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"If they do have intentions to disrupt Mandela's time here, our organizers will 
make sure they are not seen or heard," Peabody said. However, he called Mandela 
"a hero for all people" and predicted he would be "a unifying force for people 
of all colors in America." 
</P>
<P>
Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn assured anti-apartheid activists that he would 
assist their efforts to celebrate Mandela by providing city-donated parade 
permits, police overtime and other necessary resources. "What the mayor said 
was, you tell us what you want, and we're here to help," said Arthur Jones, an 
assistant to Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, a series of recent racial incidents have heightened tensions among 
the city's minority population groups. Even so, Wilbert Tatum, editor of the 
Amsterdam News, the city's largest black-owned newspaper, doubted that the 
recent troubles would affect Mandela's visit. 
</P>
<P>
"If friction does come at all," he said, "it will be about who is to sit on the 
right hand of God, and nothing more." 
</P>
<P>
Tatum said he believed that New York's sometimes-divided black community would 
display unprecedented unanimity in its reaction to the visit, citing a near 
universal agreement about the need to offer "a real American outpouring of love 
and money for Mandela." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins, the Mandela Reception Committee coordinator, said the U.S. tour is 
designed to allow Mandela to request U.S. financial support for the ANC and to 
persuade government officials and private individuals to assist in ending 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to putting together a program that is designed to help him 
accomplish his objectives," Wilkins said, noting that the organizers will not 
allow groups to exploit Mandela for selfish purposes: 
</P>
<P>
"Nelson Mandela is not a moveable photo opportunity to inflate the ego of 
Americans and American institutions."

IMMIGRANTS GET TAKEN FOR RIDE WITH STUDENT LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the newly legalized immigrants, it must have sounded too fantastic to be 
true. 
</P>
<P>
With their temporary resident cards in hand, about 3 million men and women 
throughout the United States who qualified for the immigration amnesty program 
in 1988 were suddenly eligible for $5,000 or more in federally backed student 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
Attracted by aggressive marketing campaigns, the immigrants began flocking to 
vocational schools, hoping to learn word processing, computer repair and other 
skills that would help them escape the near-minimum-wage jobs that had been 
their lot as undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
Only now have many of the student-immigrants concluded that the trade schools 
have taken them for a ride, cheating them of thousands of dollars each. They 
tell academic horror stories of classes without books or teachers and of school 
administrators who taunt them with racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
As complaints pile up, government regulators, public interest attorneys and 
immigrants' rights advocates have reached the same conclusion: Thousands of 
recently legalized immigrants have become the newest and, in some cases, the 
preferred targets of trade schools that use them as mere funnels to collect 
millions of dollars in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of California's 2,500 vocational schools have not generated 
complaints, the state attorney general's office is investigating cases 
involving one-fifth of California's 500,000 private voca tional and trade 
school students, according to Deputy Atty. Gen. Ron Reiter. Many of the 
complaints involve recently legalized natives of Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"The schools just look at us and see the pesos on our foreheads," said Alvaro 
Lopez, a 26-year-old Mexican immigrant who is one of about 20 students who have 
contacted public-interest attorneys and asked them to take legal action against 
Webster Career College, a Long Beach vocational school. 
</P>
<P>
The students say they received little or no instruction at the college. No one 
will hire them to work in the vocations for which they were ostensibly trained 
-- such as accounting and computer data entry -- because they clearly are 
unqualified. And yet they must repay the loans. 
</P>
<P>
Webster officials deny having misled the immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a qualified faculty with credentials to back up their training," said 
Lourine Hodge, director of operations at the Long Beach campus. 
</P>
<P>
But one student, Carmen Chacon, 33, a packinghouse worker, said school 
administrators took advantage of her desire to better herself. With her poor 
command of English, she said, she has no chance of becoming a computer operator 
-- despite the $5,041 she spent for three months of course work at Webster. 
</P>
<P>
"To succeed, that's what you come to this country for," she said in Spanish. 
"You don't want to end your days in a factory, tired, with some foreman yelling 
at you. . . . The school made so many promises to us. And of all those 
promises, not one has come true." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, students like Chacon and Perez will receive terse letters from 
bankers and the federal government demanding payment of the loans. They are 
made by private banks, which do business with the immigrants and other 
economically disadvantaged students because the loans are backed by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
If the students refuse or are unable to pay the loans, the Internal Revenue 
Service will place liens on their federal income tax refunds. The student 
immigrants thus face a cruel irony: Now that they have lost their fear of "la 
migra" (Spanish slang for the immigration authorities), they must contend with 
IRS agents. 
</P>
<P>
Emiliano Herrera, an unemployed metal worker, said he incurred a $5,500 debt by 
enrolling in a course at Beta Technical Schools, also in Long Beach. His 
three-month class in automobile repair cost more than an academic quarter at 
Stanford University. And, according to affidavits on file in Los Angeles 
Superior Court, the school didn't even have a garage or cars to work on. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have any tools; they didn't have anything," Herrera, 37, said in 
an interview. "If they're going to charge that kind of money, they should at 
least have a workshop. . . . When I complained, they told me, 'Don't worry, 
we'll have it all in a couple of weeks.' " 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general filed suit in March against Beta Technical Schools, 
alleging that the college misrepresented its auto repair courses. In April, a 
Los Angeles Superior Court judge issued a temporary restraining order 
preventing Beta Technical from operating auto repair courses that are not 
certified by the state. The school, however, is still providing other courses 
at its Long Beach campus. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Posell, an attorney representing the school, said the state was to 
blame for some of the problems because, he said, it delayed issuing the school 
permits that would have allowed the teaching of the auto course. Posell added 
that former students also bear some of the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the people who come to trade schools are people who aren't successful 
in the normal educational system," said Posell, who has represented vocational 
schools in civil suits for more than 15 years. "They really don't like going to 
school. That's what it comes down to." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, state and federal regulators have sharply criticized trade and 
vocational schools for defrauding low-income men and women of millions of 
dollars in federally backed loans. Four states, including California, have 
enacted legislation designed to curb the most serious abuses. More than a dozen 
other states are considering similar laws. 
</P>
<P>
California's law went into effect Jan. 1. By then, aggressive recruiting 
campaigns in the Spanish media had already attracted thousands of immigrants. 
Newly legalized immigrants became eligible for the loans after May, 1988, when 
they began completing the first stage of the amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
"The immigrants are a whole area that had been untapped before," said Elena H. 
Ackel, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. "This is a 
group that was disregarded because they didn't have access to government loans. 
The amnesty was like opening up another bucket of money for the schools." 
</P>
<P>
The loan payments are made directly to the schools. Students who drop out, even 
after only a few weeks, must still pay the bulk of their loans. 
</P>
<P>
Many student-immigrants are only now receiving their first notices that they 
are delinquent in repaying loans. As a result, in recent months, many have 
arrived at legal aid clinics throughout Los Angeles seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
This month, the Los Angeles public interest law group Public Counsel is 
assisting 240 students who are taking legal action against their school 
operators, said Kenneth W. Babcock, director of Public Counsel's poverty law 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
At one Los Angeles-area trade school, Babcock said, most "instruction" in an 
English class consisted of viewing rented video movies. 
</P>
<P>
"(The students) kept seeing 'La Bamba' over and over again," Babcock said. 
"They complained. They thought it was ridiculous they were paying all that 
money to watch videos." 
</P>
<P>
Advertising in the Spanish media is not the only draw to the vocational 
schools. Students said there are "employment offices" that double as school 
recruiters. This practice is called "blind advertising" and is illegal in 
California. Still, blind advertising is common in the vocational school 
industry, according to Deputy Atty. Gen. Margaret Reiter, who has filed fraud 
suits against several schools. 
</P>
<P>
She said schools will typically pay recruiters about $500 for each prospective 
student "delivered." 
</P>
<P>
Olga Betancourt, 51, said she was recruited to a Los Angeles business college 
by an employment office in the downtown Greyhound bus terminal. A low-paid 
seamstress for more than 20 years, Betancourt said she had gone to the office 
in search of a job in housekeeping or any other better-paying field. Instead, a 
woman at the office persuaded her to try her luck at computer classes. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me, 'Why do work (as a housekeeper)? Earning $100 per week doesn't 
suit you. If I were you, I would go to school. It won't cost you much money.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Training equals jobs," read the flyer Betancourt was given at the employment 
agency. With that slogan in mind, Betancourt walked the few blocks from the bus 
station to the business college on Spring Street, hoping to become a computer 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
Betancourt is among 40 former students who are preparing to take legal action 
against the school with the help of attorneys at Public Council. Among other 
complaints, she says that computers at the school were in various states of 
disrepair and that with her limited English she stands little, if any chance, 
of finding work as a computer operator. 
</P>
<P>
"The school didn't show me any more English than I knew already and they didn't 
show me anything at all about computers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And besides, Betancourt said, paying the roughly $12,000 she said she owes the 
school and the banks would be impossible on her salary of $20 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Similar concerns motivated a group of more than 20 Latino students to organize 
itself at Webster Career College in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The former students claim that instructors were in such short supply at Webster 
that one teacher has, at times, simultaneously handled five or six classes. 
Under pressure to make room in their crowded classrooms for more students -- 
and thus more tuition money -- instructors handed out final grades even to 
those who hadn't completed their course work, the students said. 
</P>
<P>
"This grade is for a class I never took," said Rene Chavez, 42, as he held a 
grade slip showing he received a B in business communication. "How are we going 
to take that kind of class if we don't even know (English) grammar?" he added 
in halting English. 
</P>
<P>
Hodge, the director of operations at Webster, denied the allegations of the 
former students. She said the school provides its students with a quality 
education. "We are definitely not perfect, but we do try," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Regulations governing the trade schools will be debated this week in Sacramento 
when the Senate Education Committee holds hearings on Assembly Bill 1401, which 
would strengthen the law. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyists for the private trade school industry, however, are attempting to 
loosen restrictions that require at least 60% of the students to complete 
course work and at least 70% to be placed in jobs for which they were trained. 
Trade school representatives say the law's requirements are an unnecessary 
financial burden to the colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"By and large, the schools offer what they say they offer," said Anthony 
Pitale, president of the California Assn. of Private Post-Secondary Schools, 
one of the lobbyists. "There are problem schools, just like there are problems 
in any sector of business. But I think a majority of the people in the (Latino) 
community are being helped. . . . It's not something that requires a Draconian 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what action the Legislature takes, Carmen Chacon, the packinghouse 
worker who spent $5,041 for three months of course work at Webster Career 
College, says she doubts she will ever set foot in another private vocational 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she is paying $8 per semester to study English at Paramount High 
School. After she completes her English studies, she may one day enroll in 
nearby Compton College, where vocational courses typically cost about $50 per 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that all of this has happened to me, I just want to study English first," 
she said. "That was the problem in (Webster Career College). We didn't speak 
the language; we couldn't fight back."

HALT PRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS. BUT THE DEBATE ON CONVENTIONAL ARMS IS

<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union reached agreement Saturday on limiting 
air- and sea-launched cruise missiles, a key issue in a new treaty that will 
substantially reduce the superpowers' nuclear arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of States James A. Baker III, concluding four days of intense 
negotiations with Soviet leaders, said that difficult compromises were required 
but that the agreements clear the way for a treaty this year and would open 
negotiations for a subsequent treaty on reducing strategic arms. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is expected to sign a joint declaration on the fundamental 
elements of the new treaty with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the 
centerpiece of the Soviet-American summit meeting next week in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said that although a number of 
difficult issues remain, largely concerned with ensuring the two countries' 
compliance with the proposed pact, he is "confident now that the treaty on 
reducing strategic arms can be prepared for signature before the end of this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
The treaty is expected to reduce by 30% or 35% the number of nuclear weapons 
the two superpowers have. 
</P>
<P>
The superpowers also reached an agreement on halting the production of chemical 
weapons and destroying 80% of their present stockpiles of such weapons. 
Following an international treaty outlawing chemical arms, they would proceed 
with the stage-by-stage destruction of the rest of their stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
Baker called this accord on chemical arms "a trailblazing agreement" that would 
"provide a real pathway toward a global ban on horrific weapons that we already 
know from bitter experience actually get used." Its signing will be another 
summit highlight. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet and U.S. negotiators also concluded protocols that will implement two 
treaties, originally agreed upon 15 years ago, limiting the size of underground 
nuclear tests and of nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. The protocols 
provide for the treaties' verification, including on-site inspection. 
</P>
<P>
And an agreement was worked out on cooperation in preventing the proliferation 
of nuclear and chemical weapons and the spread of the technology required to 
develop and manufacture missiles. 
</P>
<P>
But no progress was reported on reducing conventional armed forces in Europe. 
Negotiations in this area, now under way in Vienna, remain in "gridlock," Baker 
said, apparently because of Soviet reluctance to move until the future 
political and military status of a reunified Germany is settled. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, said that the 
Soviets are "stonewalling" on the conventional forces talks. But the two sides 
had achieved a breakthrough in Mosocw on strategic arms, he told reporters 
traveling with the President en route to a commencement address at the 
University of Texas. Some "minor things" remain to be settled, he said, but 
"not treaty stoppers." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he had discussed a variety of other issues -- German reunification, 
regional conflicts in Afghanistan and Central America, Jewish emigration and 
Lithuania's bid for independence from the Soviet Union -- in final preparation 
for the Washington summit. 
</P>
<P>
"These have been some of the most intensive discussions we have had with our 
Soviet counterparts during this Administration," Baker told a press conference. 
"In short, we have been engaged in some heavy lifting to lock in agreements by 
the time of the summit between President Bush and President Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that the agreements on a number of difficult arms control 
issues had laid the basis for further Soviet-American rapprochement at the 
Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Final decisions and solutions in principle were found here with respect to 
many issues," he said at a separate press conference. "We can now say that the 
state visit of President Gorbachev will constitute an important and fruitful 
phase in the development of the Soviet-American dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow negotiations were on the verge of breakdown several times as the 
carefully balanced compromises were upset by new elements. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not really easy to achieve -- I won't conceal it," Shevardnadze said 
of the strategic arms agreements. "At this final stage, talks and negotiations 
take on their own characteristics. Any progress forward is achieved by reaching 
balanced decisions, creating packages. 
</P>
<P>
"There were points when it seemed that our packages were about to fall apart," 
he continued. "It is very important in situations like this not to yield to 
panic or become desperate but to continue to persist and move forward." 
</P>
<P>
Although the breakthroughs were achieved in Baker's five hours of talks with 
Gorbachev on Friday, he and Shevardnadze met late into the evening, put their 
teams of negotiators into all-night bargaining sessions and then resumed their 
own meetings on Saturday, delaying Baker's departure by eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest issues, Baker said, were the limits to be imposed on air-launched 
cruise missiles under the new treaty and on a way to limit the deployment of 
sea-launched cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The sea-launched missiles will not be included in the treaty but will be 
covered by politically binding declarations limiting the number of such 
missiles to 880 for each side and setting their maximum range at 600 kilometers 
(about 375 miles). 
</P>
<P>
This formula establishes a limit on sea-launched cruise missiles, as demanded 
by Moscow, but keeps it outside the treaty and thus not subject to 
verification, which Washington had insisted would be impossible without 
disclosing which ships carried the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The limit of 880 missiles imposes no real restriction, since the United States 
had planned to deploy no more than 760 and the Soviet Union probably fewer. 
Each nation will inform the other every year of the number of missiles it has 
deployed and the number it expects to deploy over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise, concluded in the negotiations Saturday, runs along the same 
lines as the one reached in February. But that had appeared to unravel last 
month as Moscow weighed the whole package and concluded it was giving more than 
it was getting on key issues. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the compromise required on air-launched cruise missiles, the United 
States agreed to the range of 375 miles wanted by the Soviet Union after Moscow 
agreed that a new, conventionally armed U.S. missile, known as Tacit Rainbow 
and employing stealth technology that makes it hard to detect, would be 
exempted from the limits despite its longer range. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators also worked out a series of complicated rules on how to count 
cruise missiles that might be carried by long-range bombers. 
</P>
<P>
A number of issues remain to be resolved before the joint declaration can be 
signed, U.S. and Soviet officials said, and a team of Soviet negotiators will 
go to Washington at midweek to continue the talks. In Geneva, U.S. and Soviet 
negotiators will be asked to complete the drafting of the statement of 
objectives for the next strategic arms treaty. And at least four months will be 
needed to finish negotiating this treaty, the officials added. 
</P>
<P>
The issues still unresolved concern verification of both countries' compliance 
with the agreed limits, with ways to prevent any circumvention of the treaty, 
and limits on some weapons, including the Soviet Union's Backfire bomber. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary issues were the ones that we wound up ultimately resolving," Baker 
said. "These have been issues that have been very vexing in these negotiations 
for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said these agreements were "really the main result" of the four 
days of talks, and he praised Baker's determination to get an agreement and 
what he called his "high professionalism" in the difficult negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Baker expressed disappointment that no progress was made on reducing 
conventional armed forces in Europe, saying that the United States had put 
forward proposals on key issues in the hope of obtaining an early agreement and 
holding an all-European summit by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that the Soviet Union needs time to study the U.S. proposals 
and review them with other members of the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear that Moscow is not likely to move until its security is 
assured in the wake of German reunification, and Soviet leaders discussed those 
issues extensively with Baker. 
</P>
<P>
"The formation of all-European security structures might speed up the process 
of German unification and the development of the required security for 
everyone," Shevardnadze said. 
</P>
<P>
"But German unification is the problem of problems. It is a very complicated 
and difficult issue. . . . We find totally unacceptable the idea of the entry 
of a unified Germany into NATO. We must search for a solution that will meet 
both the interests of the Soviet Union and the West," the Soviet foreign 
minister added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cruise Missiles 
</P>
<P>
An article by retired Vice Adm. John M. Lee on reductions in sea-launched 
cruise missiles appears on Page 7 of today's Opinion section. It went to press 
before Saturday's announcement in Moscow of a preliminary U.S.-Soviet agreement 
on this type of weapon.

VAN DE KAMP, FEINSTEIN GET SET FOR SECOND DEBATE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prepped and primped, Dianne Feinstein and John Van de Kamp take the stage in 
Los Angeles today for the last roll-the-dice debate in their long struggle for 
the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, to be decided little more than two 
weeks from now. 
</P>
<P>
Their hourlong debate will put the former San Francisco mayor and current 
attorney general side by side in the studios of KCBS-TV, which will broadcast 
it live at 4:30 p.m. The debate is the second for the two Democrats, following 
by a week a similar effort in San Francisco that prompted days of thrashing 
around to explain what they really meant. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp particularly has been on the offensive, goading Feinstein into 
repeated explanations of her statements in San Francisco that abortion for 
purposes of sex selection was a "misuse" of abortion rights and that 
cost-of-living raises for the aged, blind and disabled would be subject to 
budget negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, after uncertain early attempts to explain her positions, seemed to 
regain her footing as the week progressed, launching attacks on Van de Kamp for 
defending the state of California's malathion spraying program. 
</P>
<P>
While it remained unclear just how much impact the back-and-forth accusations 
had, each campaign was hoping that today's debate and the post-debate news 
reports would spur its candidate ahead in the tight race. The primary is June 
5. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a huge undecided (vote) out there," said Bob Shrum, a political 
consultant helping run Van de Kamp's campaign. "In a real sense, the campaign 
started last Sunday and Monday." 
</P>
<P>
For candidates, the debate holds the potential of introducing them to voters, 
in more depth than can be accomplished in a 30-second television commercial: 
Feinstein, who is seeking to become the first woman governor of the state, and 
Van de Kamp, who is trying to become the third attorney general in three 
decades to win the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
But the decision to watch is, of course, up to the voters. And last week's 
viewing audience was disappointing -- broadcast locally on public television 
station KCET, it was seen in fewer than 20,000 of the 5 million households in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Today's debate is statewide, in theory, at least. It could be hard to catch in 
some areas of California. No San Francisco television station was planning to 
air the event, and the only Bay Area radio station to air it -- KCBS -- will 
delay its broadcast until 9 p.m. KNSD-TV in San Diego and KXTV-TV in Sacramento 
will carry the debate live, as will radio stations KNX and KFWB in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco and Los Angeles debates are historic: Never before in a 
gubernatorial contest have there been such pre-primary face-offs. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, indeed, has been putting pressure on Feinstein to agree to more 
debates, so confident was he coming out of the San Francisco exchange. 
Feinstein's campaign has thus far refused. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Pete Wilson also joined the fray Friday, urging Feinstein and Van de 
Kamp that the winner of the Democratic nomination join him for bipartisan 
debates. He asked each to agree to curb "character assassination" advertising 
during the general election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes in the debate are such that both candidates have been run through a 
mill of mock contests to hone their familiarity with both issues and the 
stilted format. Each candidate will have one minute to explain his or her 
position, with 30 seconds allowed for rebuttal.

ROMANIA'S OFFSPRING OF OPPRESSION VOTE TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN EUROPE: VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION AND RUMOR MARKED A TURBULENT CAMPAIGN. 
</P>

BUCHAREST, Romania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Battered by a turbulent election campaign that has deepened Romania's image of 
darkness and distrust, voters go to the polls today in a ballot that will test 
whether the offspring of oppression can learn democracy. 
</P>
<P>
So far, in the first multi-party election in 53 years, the answer appears to be 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
Violence, intimidation and rumor have been employed as the tools of persuasion 
in a campaign that wound up this weekend amid clashes of thunder and lightning, 
intensifying an atmosphere of suspense and posing a backdrop out of the tales 
of Transylvania. 
</P>
<P>
"No one denies that the campaign has been flawed. The question is to what 
degree that affects the outcome," said Ken Wollack, executive vice president of 
the National Democratic Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of more than 250 international observers in Romania to oversee the 
voting and guard against irregularities. Some voters have expressed fear that 
former Communists and remnants of the hated Securitate secret police force will 
try to disrupt the voting. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a country that has been repressed for so long, it is difficult 
to have a normal electoral process," said Wollack, whose institute and its 
Republican counterpart have been monitoring the Romanian campaign since it 
began early this year. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no candidate rallies for the past two days, as prescribed by 
the complicated election law drafted by Romania's interim Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
But the final days leading up to the vote have afforded no pause for quiet 
reflection. A noisy demonstration by opponents of the National Salvation Front 
and interim President Ion Iliescu continued day and night despite the ban on 
political assembly. And fresh outbreaks of unrest have been reported from 
Timisoara, birthplace of last December's revolution that ousted dictator 
Nicolae Ceausescu, and from Salaj, in western Romania, where National Peasants 
Party President Corneliu Coposu was attacked by a band of rock-throwing Gypsies 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The front is widely favored to win the presidency by virtue of Iliescu's 
popularity, and its role as the interim governing force has given it the best 
chance of gaining the largest share of parliamentary seats as well. 
</P>
<P>
But worries about the ideological leanings of the front have intensified in 
recent days, drawing more mainstream support to the anti-Iliescu demonstration 
that has blocked University Square since April 22. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu was forced to apologize for denouncing the protesters as "hooligans," 
and his recent comments on the economy have worried those Romanians who favor a 
radical switch to market forces. 
</P>
<P>
During a debate with his two top rivals for the presidency that was broadcast 
on national television late Thursday, Iliescu appeared to advocate a more 
measured approach to reform. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had enough of communism, whether it has a human face or not," said Anda 
Minza, a 35-year-old nuclear power plant worker who took up arms against 
Ceausescu's forces last December. She was among the several thousand violating 
the election ban on public assemblies, although most contended that the rally 
was non-political and therefore legal. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched my son do his homework with gloves on in our apartment where it was 
9 degrees (48 Fahrenheit) inside last December," said Minza, choking back tears 
and gesturing toward her 12-year-old son, Stefan. "Many people are changing 
their views of the front because they fear it is a neo-Communist organization." 
</P>
<P>
At the University Square protestthat blocks one of Bucharest's central traffic 
arteries, students, revolutionaries and poets rant about the neo-Communist 
threat from a corner balcony festooned with banners denouncing Iliescu, the 
front and Soviet influence. 
</P>
<P>
The front-dominated interim government warned earlier that the square would 
have to be forcibly cleared to conform to the election law prohibiting 
political gatherings during the two days before the elections. But, faced with 
a choice of putting up with the protest or provoking what could turn into a 
brutal confrontation with the demonstrators, Prime Minister Petre Roman told 
journalists that "we have opted for tolerating this violation of law." 
</P>
<P>
The election law also prohibits the sale and consumption of alcohol within 
three days of the vote, but that regulation, too, has been unevenly enforced. A 
forest of wine and beer bottles topped the tables in most major restaurants, 
and senior front figures who met with journalists smelled of whiskey even 
before nightfall Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
By virtually all accounts, the front is poised to win the presidential election 
with an outright majority for Iliescu, a former Communist Party secretary who 
fell out with Ceausescu a decade ago. Even the opposition National Peasants 
Party concedes that Iliescu is unbeatable, although it attributes his appeal to 
the results of a front monopoly on media and government resources. 
</P>
<P>
A Bucharest regional Peasants Party leader, Imanoil-Dan Barbaresso, accuses the 
front of orchestrating the Friday night attack on 74-year-old Corneliu Coposu, 
the Peasants Party's national president, as well as widespread defacing of 
presidential candidate Ion Ratiu's ubiquitous posters. 
</P>
<P>
A poll by the respected newspaper Romania Libera, which has been critical of 
the front and its campaign activities, forecast a 61% share of the votes for 
Iliescu, with National Liberal Party leader Radu Campeanu a distant second with 
about 17%. Ratiu, a dapper and eccentric millionaire emigre, was predicted to 
get less than 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Voters will be given two ballots when they enter their polling places, which 
are to stay open from 6 a.m. until 11 p.m. to give the nation's 17.8 million 
voting-age citizens the maximum opportunity to take part. One ballot is for the 
presidential race, and the other for choosing local candidates for the 119 
Senate seats and the 387 seats in the lower house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Full results of the presidential ballot are not expected until Tuesday, and the 
distribution of parliamentary seats will be known no earlier than Wednesday, 
the National Election Commission says. 
</P>
<P>
INFAS, a West German polling organization whose sampling of voters during the 
March 18 East German election proved extremely accurate, plans to make similar 
forecasts on the Romanian outcome shortly after the polls close. The Bonn-based 
research firm plans to conduct exit polls at 300 voting places.

NATO CANCELS WAR GAMES TO SHIFT SCENARIOS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, responding to sweeping changes in the 
former East Bloc, has canceled its biennial nuclear war games until it can 
devise more realistic -- and politically acceptable -- scenarios for the 
exercises, U.S. and NATO officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to cancel the controversial games came after alliance officials 
tried unsuccessfully to find an alternative simulation that would not offend 
the 14 NATO countries that normally participate in the exercises. 
</P>
<P>
The canceled Wintex-Cimex games -- short for Warning and Intelligence Exercise 
and Civil-Military Exercise -- involve a group of lower-level national security 
officials from the participating nations. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear war games have sparked particular controversy in West Germany. Bonn 
abruptly called for early termination of the last such exercises in March, 
1989, because the participants authorized simulated nuclear strikes on East 
Germany and a second round of strikes that involved use of nuclear weapons on 
West German soil. At the time, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the 
scenario "completely unacceptable" to Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that West German political sensitivities were a key factor in 
the alliance's recent decision to cancel future games. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, military and political officials acknowledged that the traditional 
Wintex-Cimex scenario has become increasingly anachronistic and implausible. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no point in doing something that might prove to be irrelevant, or if 
(some of the allies) have reservations that are reasonable," said one 
knowledgeable U.S. official. "It's time to re-evaluate. We are in a time of 
transition." 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation of Wintex-Cimex comes as NATO is reassessing its entire 
spectrum of war games and military simulations. The alliance is attempting to 
devise more cost-effective training and to adjust its responses to changing 
circumstances, particularly the rapid dissolution of the Warsaw Pact as a 
military entity.

ARMS CONTROL: TWO SUPERPOWERS ADOPT A SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE TO BREAK IMPASSES 
AND ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT.

<TEXT>
<P>
It took an extra day of sometimes rancorous negotiations, but the United States 
and the Soviet Union have broken the back of a vexing disagreement that could 
have dimmed the summit meeting between President Bush and Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev beginning May 30. 
</P>
<P>
The compromises on seemingly abstract range and counting rules for cruise 
missiles provide the basis for an arms control agreement that will permit Bush 
and Gorbachev to claim success for their Washington meeting. With anything 
less, the summit probably would be counted a failure. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze said that a few details remain to be worked out. But both men 
predicted that the remaining issues could be settled before Gorbachev arrives 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
According to senior U.S. officials, the deal was struck Friday during a 
five-hour meeting between Baker and Gorbachev. But the agreement almost fell 
apart a few hours later when Soviet military leaders tried to impose new 
conditions and pull back from concessions Gorbachev had accepted. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the senior official said, the Soviet side agreed to return to the 
Baker-Gorbachev understanding. 
</P>
<P>
On most matters, the two sides simply split the difference between the official 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev accepted the U.S. demand that the only limitation on sea-launched 
cruise missiles would be "politically binding" statements of intent by both 
sides, without any requirement for verification. 
</P>
<P>
Washington opposes verification of limits on sea-launched cruise missiles 
because nuclear missiles -- which would be covered by a strategic arms treaty 
-- cannot be distinguished from conventionally armed missiles, which would not. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet side agreed to such an unverified statement last February but then 
pulled back. In effect, the Soviets have returned to their earlier concession. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the United States agreed to a limit of 880 on sea-launched cruise 
missiles. Washington had hoped to avoid any numerical ceiling, but the 880 
figure is at least 100 higher than the number the Pentagon plans to buy. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also agreed to exclude sea-launched cruise missiles with 
ranges of less than 375 miles. Washington had wanted to include weapons with 
ranges of more than 185 miles. Officials explained that the Soviet Union has a 
number of aging missile systems with ranges between 185 and 375 miles. Under 
the compromise, these will not be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
On air-launched cruise missiles, the United States agreed to a Soviet demand 
that all missiles with a range of more than 375 miles be counted by the treaty 
after the Soviet side agreed that a new American missile known as Tacit Rainbow 
would not be included. 
</P>
<P>
The Tacit Rainbow project is intended to be armed with non-nuclear warheads, 
which normally would mean it would not be included in the treaty. However, 
under a provision that was accepted months ago, all cruise missiles that had 
been tested by the end of last year -- including Tacit Rainbow -- would be 
presumed to be nuclear. The compromise changed the effective date for the 
earlier agreement to the end of 1988, thus exempting Tacit Rainbow from the 
limitations. 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. officials, Gorbachev and Baker agreed to the compromise 
language for both classes of cruise missiles. However, they said, lower-ranking 
Soviet officials, particularly those from the military, tried to impose new 
conditions on Tacit Rainbow, such as banning modernization of the missile, 
restricting its range and imposing a guarantee that it would never have a 
nuclear warhead. All of those restrictions were unacceptable to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Gorbachev meeting, we did feel that we had broken the back of the 
issues," one senior official said. "The package that we thought had been put 
together began to unravel because they pulled a piece out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Another official said that arms control specialists wrestled with the issue all 
morning Saturday. About noon, he said, Baker sent a letter to Shevardnadze 
saying that, if the Soviet side continued to push additional restrictions, 
there would be no deal. Shevardnadze accepted the U.S. position a few hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments seem technical and abstruse, but just such problems have blocked 
all previous attempts to control cruise missile technology. 
</P>
<P>
The latest U.S.-Soviet compromises probably would not have been possible 
without the overall warming in superpower relations. As an example of the 
changed mood, a senior official said that, late in the Friday meeting, 
Gorbachev broke one deadlock by asking Baker: "How about if we split the 
difference?" 
</P>
<P>
"Baker said, 'You've got a deal.' And they reached across the table and shook 
hands."

DECLARATION STANDS, LITHUANIA DECIDES;

<P>
SECESSION: ACTION VIRTUALLY ENSURES THAT CRIPPLING SOVIET SANCTIONS WILL 
CONTINUE.

Lithuanians searched Saturday for concessions to offer Mikhail S. Gorbachev as 
a way of opening talks with the Soviet leadership but ruled out suspending 
their declaration of independence, which virtually ensures that crippling 
Kremlin economic sanctions against them will continue. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting to an emergency session of the Lithuanian parliament, Kazimiera 
Prunskiene, the breakaway republic's prime minister, summed up talks she held 
in Moscow with Gorbachev. Then deputies debated proposals they hope will bring 
Soviet authorities to the bargaining table to end a two-month-old stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
Though no formal vote was taken, lawmakers concurred that "there can be no 
question" of suspending the independence declaration they approved March 11, 
Arvidas Ryabchis, a spokesman in the Parliament's Information Bureau, said by 
telephone from the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
The March 11 declaration set off the crisis with Moscow. Unless the Lithuanians 
reverse themselves or there is a dramatic shift in the position of Gorbachev, 
who has repeatedly said the proclamation is illegal under Soviet law, the war 
of nerves over Lithuania's right to unilaterally proclaim its independence 
seems certain to continue. 
</P>
<P>
In a dispatch printed earlier on the front pages of Soviet newspapers, the 
official Tass news agency said the bottom line of the Kremlin's position is 
"the indispensable necessity that the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet (Parliament) 
cancel -- or at a minimum, suspend -- this act (the independence declaration) 
and all the legislative measures following it that contradict the Soviet 
constitution." 
</P>
<P>
In her remarks in Parliament, Prunskiene acknowledged that Gorbachev, who met 
with her Thursday, was still pressing for suspension of the independence 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
According to Edward Tuskenis, another Information Bureau spokesman, Prunskiene 
said suspension would be too risky because it would juridically return 
Lithuania to the status of a "Soviet socialist republic" that it had for 50 
years after annexation by the Kremlin in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
"What the deputies will do is review laws passed since March 11 and see which 
can be suspended," Tuskenis said. Gorbachev has specifically objected to laws 
establishing separate Lithuanian identity cards and annulling mandatory Soviet 
military service and to the alleged confiscation of Communist Party property. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian deputies adjourned Saturday night without making a formal 
decision. They are to reconvene Monday to hear legal experts and reports from 
economists on the damage done by the Soviet economic sanctions imposed in 
April. Parliament is to consider several drafts of concessions it might offer 
Moscow, and Prunskiene sounded optimistic that the proposals would win its 
agreement for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"To my mind, all possible effort has been made from our side," she told 
state-run Soviet television. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who met Friday with Prunskiene in the 
Soviet capital, expressed support here for Lithuania's "hopes and aspirations 
for independence" and again called for dialogue between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference, Baker denied a published report that he had 
pressed the Lithuanians to suspend their independence declaration, saying, 
"That is not for me to do."

CRANSTON VOWS TO FIGHT HOPE PARKLAND DEAL 
</P>

Environmentalists, bitterly divided over a land swap endorsed by comedian Bob 
Hope, clashed once again Saturday when U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) 
promised an appreciative Malibu audience that he would try to kill the plan in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston told about three dozen environmentalists and neighborhood activists 
that the controversial land exchange would set a dangerous precedent and could 
threaten the future of other national parklands. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Hope would sell and donate a total of 5,700 acres in the Santa 
Monica and Santa Susana mountains to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. In 
return, the National Park Service would relinquish 59 acres in Cheeseboro 
Canyon so that a developer, who has optioned another of Hope's properties, 
could build a road to a presently inaccessible tract. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you put into permanent trust a beautiful part of the land or the water, 
it stays that way forever," Cranston told the crowd gathered in the back yard 
of a Malibu estate. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the land swap were not content to let Cranston and his 
backers receive all the publicity on Saturday. A handful of pickets, carrying 
bright placards, mingled in the street in front of the home of Margot Feuer, 
the event's hostess and a longtime environmentalist. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cranston, clad in a dark suit and sitting on a straw mat, listened 
to speakers in the back yard. At one point, an uninvited guest -- a staffer 
from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy -- interrupted the event, loudly 
announcing that she was inviting him to take a helicopter ride later that day. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Cranston has not seen those 5,700 acres, and we feel it is of great 
importance for him to support giving the public this much acreage of land," 
said Julie Zeidner, a temporary employee of the conservancy. "Fifty-nine acres 
is not a great price to pay for 8.9 square miles of the most beautiful parkland 
left in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Her message was drowned out by shouts from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see the polarization that the conservancy has created with this 
issue," Feuer said after she told Zeidner to leave. "It has put group against 
group, neighbor against neighbor . . . friends against friends."

FEMINISM: WOMEN SAY THEY WERE CHANGED BY THE SUCCESSFUL PROTEST AGAINST 
ADMISSION OF MEN. 'WE CAN DO ANYTHING,' SAYS ONE.

Joyce Adca is proud of the education she has received at Mills College. But as 
the 22-year-old senior prepares to graduate today, she says the past two weeks 
have changed her view of what she values most about her college days. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the two-week student strike that shut down the campus and helped 
persuade Mills officials to reverse a decision to admit undergraduate men to 
the college, she says the protest has provided her with a profound lesson: 
</P>
<P>
"Women can change the world. We can do anything. This proves it," said Adca, a 
psychology major. "I didn't think the protests would work, but we did it. I 
think it's the perfect happy ending to my four years here." 
</P>
<P>
The "happy ending" was Friday's vote by Mills trustees to reverse the decision 
to admit undergraduate men to the 138-year-old college. The reversal came in 
response to the protests and a financial rescue plan put together by alumnae. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees had wanted to admit men in fall, 1991, to boost enrollment from 
the current 777 to 1,000, and to help balance Mills' $24-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
Adca's sentiments about the protest were echoed by more than a dozen students 
interviewed Saturday at Mills' sprawling, tree-dotted 135-acre campus. They all 
agreed that the last two weeks changed the way they look at the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a clean revolution. There were no police, no violence," said 
Chiara Monodori, 21, a senior. "We didn't have to riot or burn cars. . . . 
Women can organize to get what we want without violence." 
</P>
<P>
A celebratory mood continued to prevade the campus Saturday. More than a 
hundred students gathered on the main square, hugging one another and shouting 
congratulations. Many still wore T-shirts that had become an unofficial uniform 
for the protest, emblazoned with the slogan: "Better Dead than Co-ed." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby were neat piles of tents, posters and banners left over from the 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been so proud to be a Mills woman," senior Barbara Needell said as 
she waited for the beginning of rehearsal for today's commencement ceremony. 
"I've learned so much in the past two weeks. People who used to just pass by 
one another have learned so much from each other." 
</P>
<P>
Needell, like many Mills students, re-entered college after working. At 41, 
she's old enough to remember a different era of campus activism. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned a lot from the 19- and 20-year-olds," she said "The passion for 
what they believed in is reminiscent of the civil rights movement or the 
anti-war movement." 
</P>
<P>
Strike organizers claim that more than 500 students participated in the protest 
at Mills. Several said they hope to transfer the school's new-found activism 
into a long-term struggle for women's rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in a way Mills College could be the start of the women's movement of 
the '90s," said Lisa Kosiewicz, a 21-year-old junior from Salem, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
But she added, "Right now, we need this energy to keep Mills College alive." 
</P>
<P>
College President Mary Metz said that even though there were tense feelings and 
disagreements during the two-week strike, she's proud of the Mills students. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that what we do works. These women haven't just been educated 
intellectually," said Metz, gesturing to the seniors lined up at the rehearsal. 
"These are proud and strong women who cannot be put down."

RALLY COMMEMORATES BIRTHDAY OF SLAIN BLACK NATIONALIST LEADER MALCOLM X 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1,000 people gathered Saturday at a Southwest Los Angeles park to 
commemorate the 65th birthday of slain black leader Malcolm X, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
The rally, organized by the African-American National Malcolm X Commemorative 
Committee, was held "to let people know we have not forgotten his striving" and 
to press legislators to declare the leader's birthday a holiday, organizer 
Brian Breye said. 
</P>
<P>
Bands played and speakers such as poet Sonya Sanchez and civil rights activist 
Marcus Garvey Jr. invoked the memory of Malcolm X, a member of the Nation of 
Islam and leader in the black nationalist movement who was killed in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm X overcame a prison record acquired in his teens to become a leader in 
the 1960s of the burgeoning Nation of Islam, a black American religious sect. 
He was shot to death in February, 1965, a short time after he publicly broke 
with Nation of Islam leadership over its strident anti-white message.

SCHOOL DISTRICT'S BAN ON R-RATED FILMS TOSSED OUT 
</P>

<P>
In a case closely watched around California, a school district's ban on R-rated 
films, including such acclaimed movies as "Apocalypse Now" and "Rain Man," has 
been declared unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The Contra Costa County Superior Court ruling Friday by Judge Richard Patsey 
stops the district from enforcing a 1986 policy that banned movies based solely 
on the Motion Picture Assn. of America's rating system. 
</P>
<P>
The San Ramon Valley Education Assn. filed a lawsuit against the district in 
1988, maintaining that the ban violated teachers' rights to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Dianne Mayer, one of four teachers named in the lawsuit, used to show 
"Das Boot" when teaching World War II history to juniors at California High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel (the ruling) is just another vindication for the teachers trying to 
keep education open for the students," Mayer said. "I think the teachers are 
professional enough to make decisions of what is of educational value. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can get away with (outlawing films) with schools, then they can get 
away with it with books and newspapers and freedom of speech, press, assembly," 
she said. "It's a dangerous first step." 
</P>
<P>
Patsey's ruling states that the board cannot rely on the MPAA's guidelines for 
rating films. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who do the rating for the MPAA need have no qualifications or experience 
in education," Patsey wrote. "The rating system does not concern itself with 
educational quality or utility." 
</P>
<P>
The policy was spurred by a parent's complaint about "The Emerald Forest" being 
shown at Del Amigo Continuation High School.

TURNOUT FOR FREE MEASLES VACCINATIONS FALLS SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County health officials said the turnout was disappointing Saturday for a 
series of free measles vaccinations despite a publicity blitz aimed at the 
Latino community, hardest hit by the outbreak of the deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 people were inoculated at 18 sites, far short of the 8,000 the Los 
Angeles County Medical Assn. had hoped to attract. 
</P>
<P>
The worst measles epidemic in two decades is sweeping the state. 
Spanish-speaking populations have been particularly vulnerable to the disease. 
Of the 2,400 measles cases reported in Los Angeles County during the first four 
months of this year, 76% involve Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
But county efforts to vaccinate large numbers of Latinos and other minority 
groups have fallen short, and Saturday was apparently no different. At many of 
the vaccination sites, there were more doctors than patients, said Marie 
Kuffner, chairwoman of the county medical association's measles immunization 
task force. 
</P>
<P>
"It is disappointing because we advertised heavily on Spanish-language radio 
and TV," Kuffner said. "Thousands of letters were sent in some areas, and all 
the schools were notified. We need to reach Hispanics, it is the group that is 
most at risk." 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the seriousness of the epidemic, Kuffner said the association 
organized Saturday's immunization program at sites primarily in South-Central 
and East Los Angeles. In recent months, county health officials have offered 
similar free or low-cost vaccinations at established clinics and agencies, but 
with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
To improve the chances of a big turnout Saturday, Kuffner said the association 
selected churches and fast-food restaurants to vaccinate people, believing that 
the familiar surroundings of a neighborhood landmark or business would ease any 
fears about coming forward and seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, those we are trying to reach are undocumented or illegally 
living here," Kuffner said outside a Carl's Jr. restaurant at the corner of 6th 
and Virgil streets. "They are mindful of any authority and rarely venture 
beyond their own neighborhoods. So we wanted to take the program to them." 
</P>
<P>
But only two people were in line waiting for the vaccine as Kuffner spoke. A 
handful of physicians -- more than 200 doctors and medical association staff 
members volunteered at the various locations -- busied themselves by 
straightening stacks of patient releases and information forms. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a shame," Kuffner said. "The line should be around the block. This is 
unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Measles has claimed at least 30 lives in California in the first four months of 
this year, compared to 20 during all of 1989. Seven of those deaths have been 
in Los Angeles County, where the number of reported measles cases for the first 
four months of 1990 is already double the total for all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Children are especially susceptible to the disease. An estimated 375,000 
California children ages 1 to 4 are not immunized against measles, and in some 
minority neighborhoods as many as 70% of young children have not been 
inoculated, Kuffner said. 
</P>
<P>
Language barriers and cultural differences have made it difficult to reach 
immigrant groups about the problem. In many cases, officials say, parents of 
non-immunized children are natives of other countries where childhood 
immunizations are unheard of.

The Dodger bullpen has blown another game in the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia's Rod Booker hit a three-run triple off a weary Jay Howell in the 
11th inning Saturday night to give the Phillies a 15-12 victory, the fourth 
Dodger loss caused by the bullpen in the late innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
Before what remained of a crowd of 44,703 at Dodger Stadium, Howell hit Ricky 
Jordan with a pitch, gave up a single by John Kruk, and one out later Dickie 
Thon singled to load the bases for Booker, who came to the plate one out later. 
He hit the ball into the right-center field gap, scoring three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Howell should not have even been in the game, as the Dodgers wanted to rest him 
after his strong comeback from knee surgery Friday night, during which he 
pitched two innings. But Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda had little choice, and 
brought Howell into the game to start the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
The game began, and appeared to end, with Kal Daniels' grand slam in the fourth 
inning. That gave the Dodgers a 8-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers, who already knew their middle relief pitchers are not very 
dependable, learned they are also not very original. Thirteen days after the 
Dodger bullpen blew a 5-1 lead against Philadelphia, they blew two leads 
against against the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Maddux, the second reliever to follow an ineffective Fernando Valenzuela, 
gave up a run in the sixth inning. Two innings later, Tim Crews gave up four 
consecutive hits, two runs scoring on Kruk's single, to make the score 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers appeared to win it again in the bottom of the eighth, when Alfredo 
Griffin scored on Darrel Akerfelds' wild pitch, and Daniels later singled for 
his fifth RBI of the night. 
</P>
<P>
But Don Aase and John Wetteland combined to blow another Dodger lead, and 
nearly the game, by giving up four runs in the top of the ninth. The keys were 
a two-run single by Tommy Herr and an RBI grounder by Jordan that shortstop 
Griffin threw into the Phillie dugout to account for another run. 
</P>
<P>
Where was Howell? The Dodgers didn't want to use him because on Friday night he 
threw his first two innings in 27 days after arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
But 10 minutes after the Phillies took the lead in the ninth, the Dodger 
offense rescued the bullpen again. With the Dodgers trailing, 12-10, John 
Shelby hit a two-run double off reliever Roger McDowell. The Dodgers appeared 
ready to win it then, as Shelby moved to third base on catcher Darren Daulton's 
fielding error with no outs. 
</P>
<P>
But after the Phillies intentionally walked both Griffin and Mike Scioscia, 
Juan Samuel laid down a poor suicide squeeze bunt that resulted in Shelby being 
thrown out at the plate. Stan Javier then flied out to shallow left field and 
Mickey Hatcher hit a grounder to shortstop Thon to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth inning, Griffin nearly became the Dodgers' hero. After he singled 
against Akerfelds, the Dodgers took a chance on a hit-and-run play with 
Scioscia batting. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia hit a grounder to Herr, who caught it near second base and tried to 
step on the bag. But Griffin was already there, and in the confusion among 
those two and shortstop Thon, the ball popped from Herr's glove and rolled into 
center field. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin went to third on the error. On the next pitch, as Griffin danced off 
third base, Akerfelds threw the ball into the dirt and Griffin scored. The 
Dodgers added another run later in the inning on Daniels' RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
The eighth inning nearly overshadowed Daniels' first dramatic statement as a 
Dodger: a 400-foot grand slam against Don Carman that gave the Dodgers that 8-5 
lead in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels' first career grand slam was laced with answers for those who 
questioned the trade that brought him here from Cincinnati last season. 
</P>
<P>
It came in his 32nd game in this 36-game season, not a bad attendance mark for 
a player who some said would miss many games because of bad knees. And it came 
against a left-handed pitcher, who the left-handed batting Daniels is not 
supposed to be able to hit. 
</P>
<P>
The night featured a couple of other brash Dodger statements. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Javier, the outfielder acquired from Oakland for Willie Randolph last week, 
proved that perhaps he can make the Dodgers not miss their favorite player. He 
saved a run in the first inning with a diving catch in center field, then set 
up Daniels' heroics with a two-out, two-strike RBI single in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fernando Valenzuela, who many thought had returned to his earlier form with 
three victories in his last four starts, proved that such thinking is still 
premature. Once again, he looked more like 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was given a 3-0 Dodger lead against previously unbeaten Phillies' 
starter Dennis Cook in the second inning, but gave it back by giving up five 
runs on six hits in the fourth inning. He finally departed with one out in the 
fifth inning after giving up five runs on nine hits, a season high in both 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
By then, the Dodgers were already in the lead thanks to Daniels.

SUMMER SQUALL REIGNS SUPREME;

<P>
PREAKNESS: HE DEFEATS KENTUCKY DERBY WINNER UNBRIDLED BY 2 1/4 LENGTHS. MISTER 
FRISKY FINISHES FAR BACK IN THIRD.

<P>
A year ago, Pat Day was on the fence, aboard Easy Goer and pinned in tight by 
Sunday Silence and Pat Valenzuela in the Preakness. Easy Goer and Day reached 
the wire a nose short of their more aggressive opponents, and it was a hollow 
consolation to be second best in one of the most thrilling races ever. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, in the 115th Preakness, Day had the rail again, but this time he also 
had the horse. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, the same little colt who came up empty in the stretch of the 
Kentucky Derby two weeks ago, won by 2 1/4 lengths, ending the Triple Crown bid 
of Unbridled in a reversal of the way they finished at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's Preakness, Day's problem persisted through Pimlico's stretch. 
This time, crunch time lasted only a second or two, when Summer Squall needed 
room to go inside at the head of the stretch. Fighting Notion, who had led from 
the start under Alberto Delgado, came off the fence, enabling Summer Squall to 
slip through. 
</P>
<P>
On Summer Squall's right at the time, gathering steam as he had in the stretch 
run of the Derby, was Unbridled and his jockey, Craig Perret, who would have 
been able to keep Summer Squall behind Fighting Notion if Day attempted to 
swing to the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Both Perret and Carl Nafzger, the Derby winner's trainer, said that the 
Preakness turned on this point. 
</P>
<P>
"If Pat doesn't get through (on the rail), he would have had to check before he 
came around (Unbridled)," Nafzger said. "I don't think he would have gotten 
(the victory). If Pat doesn't get through, then it's a good horse race. He 
beats us a nose, or we beat him a neck, something like that." 
</P>
<P>
Perret was astonished that Delgado, the champion apprentice in 1982 who was 
riding in his first Preakness, allowed Summer Squall and Day to get by. 
</P>
<P>
"You would think," Perret said, "that riders riding for this kind of money 
would not give an inch. We're pros, and we want to ride safely, but the reason 
we're here is to win the horse race. I had Pat in a good spot if he doesn't get 
through. But he showed a lot of patience, and waited for the hole to open." 
</P>
<P>
Fighting Notion, sent off at 35-1 by the crowd of 86,531, finished fifth in the 
nine-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Pat inside me," Delgado said. "I had closed the fence (on Day) once. But 
then my horse came out a little at that point. My horse was tired, and there 
was no sense stopping Pat and costing him the race." 
</P>
<P>
Some jockeys would have deposited Summer Squall and Day in the infield and then 
gone on about the business of finishing fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a fortunate break we had in the stretch when the hole opened," Day 
said. "This time my horse stayed in the game and kept his concentration, not 
like he'd done in the Derby. He finished the way he was capable of finishing 
and was not at the bottom of the barrel at the end. 
</P>
<P>
"If the other horse keeps the fence, then Craig keeps me locked in and I have 
to wait until he gets out of there." 
</P>
<P>
With a Triple Crown sweep no longer a possibility, the only extra money 
available in the series is a $1-million bonus that goes to the horse that runs 
in all three races and totals the most points on a 5-3-1 basis for finishing 
first, second and third. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall and Unbridled are tied with eight points apiece, but Summer 
Squall will not run in the Belmont Stakes, the final leg of the series, June 9. 
Cot Campbell, head of the 28-member syndicate that owns Summer Squall, repeated 
Saturday that the colt would skip the Belmont because New York prohibits the 
use of Lasix, which Summer Squall is given to prevent respiratory bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
"That decision is etched in stone," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, the 17-10 Preakness favorite, finished nine lengths ahead of Mister 
Frisky, who saved third by a half-length over Music Prospector, a 61-1 shot who 
had trouble most of the way. The others, in order, were Fighting Notion, Land 
Rush, Kentucky Jazz, Baron de Vaux and J.R.'s Horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, earning $445,900 of the $686,000 purse -- both Preakness records 
-- was barely the second choice over Mister Frisky in the betting and paid 
$6.80, $3 and $2.60. The other payoffs were $3 and $2.80 on Unbridled and $3.40 
for Mister Frisky. 
</P>
<P>
After a slow early pace, the time for 1 3/16 miles was 1:53 3/5, one-fifth of a 
second slower than the Preakness record and three-fifths of a second off the 
track record that Criminal Type set in winning the Pimlico Special a week ago. 
Summer Squall ran the last three-sixteenths of a mile in 18 seconds, the 
fastest finishing time since Pleasant Colony won the race in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, who won the Santa Anita Derby aboard Mister Frisky for the Puerto 
Rican import's 16th consecutive victory, was unable to explain the colt's 
defeats in the Derby and Preakness. Saturday, Mister Frisky was within a length 
or two of Fighting Notion, whose early fractions -- 23 1/5 seconds for a 
quarter-mile and 47 seconds for the half mile -- were especially slow for a 
track that had been producing fast times. From the quarter pole to the wire, 
Mister Frisky had nothing left. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two (Summer Squall and Unbridled) ran by me like my horse was tied 
down," Stevens said. "The last two starts have not been up to par, but why, I 
don't know. At the five-sixteenths pole, I asked my horse to run pretty good, 
and after two or three strides, he didn't pick it up like I anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera took the blame for Mister Frisky's early position, saying that his 
instructions to Stevens were too rigid. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Gary to lay second behind the speed," Barrera said. "But that was only 
cheap speed. Gary did what I told him, but we should have gone to the lead 
because the pace was so slow. The horse was fighting him early." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the fast pace in the Derby hurt Mister Frisky because he was 
too close, and the slow pace was his undoing in the Preakness because he wasn't 
close enough. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall was fourth going down the backstretch, behind Fighting Notion, 
Mister Frisky and Kentucky Jazz. Unbridled was ahead of only one horse, about 
eighth lengths off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Perret moved with Unbridled on the outside about the time Day was gunning 
Summer Squall along the fence. When the hole opened for Summer Squall at the 
top of the stretch, Unbridled appeared to nose ahead of him for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
Day had no qualms about taking Summer Squall through the gap. "Easy Goer is the 
best horse I've ever ridden, and this horse is the most courageous," Day said. 
"He showed me that in the Hopeful last year at Saratoga, when he got knocked 
around in the stretch and still won. He likes the competition, he even relishes 
it. Today he wanted it, and he was hunting for it." 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, who had bled twice before in the morning, during a workout at 
Gulfstream Park in February and after a gallop at Keeneland last month, caused 
a stir Friday when blood trickled from his nostrils for about four or five 
minutes after a 1 1/2-mile gallop. Before the Preakness, Summer Squall was 
treated with Lasix. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this is hard to believe," Campbell said, "but we know the horse, and 
his bleeding on Friday didn't worry us. What worried us more is that some 
reporters saw the bleeding, and then we had to answer all the questions about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be irresponsible to run the horse in three weeks (in the Belmont) 
with no Lasix, going a mile and a half." 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled races on Lasix, too, but Nafzger said that the horse can run one race 
without it. Running without Summer Squall can't hurt, either.

PISTONS, BULLS GO AT IT AGAIN IN EASTERN CONFERENCE FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A year hasn't changed much in the Eastern Conference, only the contenders who 
have fallen, leaving the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls to play again for a 
berth in the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
The best-of-seven conference championship series, won by the Pistons in six 
games last season, opens today at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Game 2 will be played there Tuesday night, before the next two are played 
Saturday and next Monday at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
On display will be Michael Jordan against the Piston defense, both having 
kicked into postseason form. Jordan is coming off a second-round series against 
Philadelphia that Bull Coach Phil Jackson termed the greatest five-game playoff 
run ever. And the Pistons, with Joe Dumars the first line against the game's 
premier offensive weapon, have held 22 of their last 25 postseason opponents to 
100 points or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel confident," said Jordan, who averaged a league-best 33.6 points a game 
during the regular season and 43 in the 76er series. "Our bench has improved, 
and we're going to need it, facing a team with a strong bench as well." 
</P>
<P>
With Detroit at 59-23 and Chicago 55-27, the teams finished 1-2 in the Central 
Division and Eastern Conference standings. The Pistons, looking to become only 
the fifth team and third franchise to win consecutive NBA titles, after 
Minneapolis-Los Angeles and Boston, allowed only 98.3 points a game during the 
regular season, the league low. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit won four of the five regular-season meetings. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

NBA DRAFT LOTTERY; 
</P>
<P>
INSTEAD OF STERN, THIS DEAL CALLS FOR MONTY HALL 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Striving for parity among its franchises, the NBA will bring its have-nots and 
one other lucky team to the Equitable Center, where it will stage the sixth 
annual draft lottery Sunday -- the key word being stage. 
</P>
<P>
By the time CBS' television cameras switch from Auburn Hills, Mich., at 
halftime of Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, to New York, the picking 
order for the first 11 spots of the June 27 draft will already have been 
determined. But Commissioner David Stern and the team representatives, 
including General Manager Elgin Baylor of the Clippers, will not know the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
This is done strictly for television purposes. That it has to be played out 
twice, once behind closed doors with another official from each team on hand, 
is indicative of how the constantly changing process has become so complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Now it will look more like a game show than ever, which is saying something. 
Under the new weighted system developed so that the poorest teams have a better 
chance of getting the earliest picks, New Jersey, with the worst record, will 
have 11 balls placed into a cylinder. The second-worst team will have 10, and 
so on. 
</P>
<P>
The team with the first ball out will have the first choice, the team with the 
second non-duplicate ball the second, and the team with the third non-duplicate 
ball the third. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the eight remaining teams will be placed in reverse order of 
finish, so the Nets can pick no lower than fourth. Finally, cards with team 
logos will be sealed in envelopes and brought onstage for TV's reaction shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, with the seventh-worst record at 30-52, can do no worse than 
10th. 
</P>
<P>
The other non-playoff teams involved are Atlanta, Charlotte, Golden State, 
Miami, Minnesota, New Jersey, Orlando, Sacramento and Seattle. The 11th 
participant is Dallas, which went 47-35 but in 1986 traded Jay Vincent to 
Washington for a first-round pick in 1990. The Bullets didn't make the 
playoffs, so the Mavericks make the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers' other first-round selection, by virtue of the Ron Harper deal 
with Cleveland this season, will also be determined today when a drawing is 
held to split the tie between the Cavaliers and Indiana. Both finished 42-40, 
and the winner picks 13th, the other 14th. It's actually the Clippers against 
Dallas, since the Mavericks hold the Pacers' spot from another trade. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of having the best regular-season mark, the Lakers will choose 27th. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper history here is good -- a first, second, third, fourth and sixth. But 
there is no Danny Manning or David Robinson this year, so, depending on team 
needs, the exact position might not be of critical importance. 
</P>
<P>
The likely lottery picks include Derrick Coleman of Syracuse, Dennis Scott of 
Georgia Tech, Lionel Simmons of La Salle, Gary Payton of Oregon State, Kendall 
Gill of Illinois and Rumeal Robinson of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fratello and Mike Schuler remain the main candidates to become the next 
Clipper coach. K.C. Jones, who eventually moved up in Seattle, and Jimmy 
Rodgers declined interview requests, and the Clippers did not get permission 
from Cleveland to meet with Cavalier Coach Lenny Wilkens. . . . When Winston 
Garland underwent surgery last week to repair some loose cartilage, he became 
the fourth Clipper to be operated on since mid-January and the third to have 
his knee worked on, joining Ron Harper and Jay Edwards. Gary Grant's surgery 
was on his ankle. . . .Benoit Benjamin earned approximately $500,000 in 
incentives during 1989-90 to go with his base salary of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Contract talks with Harper, a restricted free agent as of July 1, are in the 
early stages. The Clippers, who plan to match offers from other teams, will go 
for a deal that contains incentive clauses based on how much Harper plays after 
coming back from his knee surgery.

NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
* Iron Men: All you need to know about durability and fortitude in the era of 
big salaries and guaranteed contracts is this: Joe Carter of the San Diego 
Padres, having played in 215 straight games through Thursday, or the equivalent 
of a modest 1 1/2 years, has the second-longest streak among active players, 
exceeded only by the 1,283 game streak of Baltimore Oriole shortstop Cal Ripken 
Jr. Two other streaks ended last week: Eddie Murray's because of a hamstring 
strain at 389, and Ruben Sierra's because of a sprained ankle at 325. 
</P>
<P>
* Bowled Over: Oriole catcher Mickey Tettleton had 13 home runs by the end of 
May last year and went on to career highs of 26 homers and 65 runs batted in, 
crediting it all to the Fruit Loops he had for breakfast each morning. The 
cupboard must now be bare because Tettleton didn't hit his first homer until 
Thursday night in Chicago and has struck out 40 times in 95 at bats, while 
collecting just 19 hits. 
</P>
<P>
* Bash Brothers: The Oakland A's Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire had a combined 
24 home runs through Thursday, which put them ahead of the Milwaukee Brewers 
and Boston Red Sox, who had 23; the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox, who 
had 18; the Orioles, 17, and the Kansas City Royals, 14. Said A's batting coach 
Merv Rettenmund: "Mark's going to get his 35-plus, but there's no telling how 
many Jose will hit. I haven't seen Cecil Fielder yet, but he better stay hot if 
he's going to beat Jose in home runs." 
</P>
<P>
* Gopheritis: One of the keys to Bert Blyleven's 17 victories in 1989 was that 
he allowed only 14 home runs in 241 innings. But Blyleven, who allowed a major 
league record 50 home runs in 1986, is suffering from that familiar malady 
again, having allowed six in 44 innings. If he again pitches 241 innings, his 
pace projects to 33 homers. Also at that rate, if he pitches the 271 2/3 
innings he did in 1986, he will allow 37 homers. 
</P>
<P>
* Comeback Story: Dan Petry, re-signed by the Detroit Tigers following his 
release by the Angels, has regained his winning touch under pitching coach 
Billy Muffett. Petry is 4-1 going into today's assignment against the Chicago 
White Sox. He already has more victories than in either of his two seasons with 
the Angels, 3-9 and 3-2. As a measure of his effectiveness, he has struck out 
27 in 38 2/3 innings after striking out only 21 in 51 Angel innings last year. 
</P>
<P>
* Mariners' Course: After a 4-10 start, the Seattle Mariners regained .500 
Thursday by completing a three-game sweep in the Toronto SkyDome. Most of the 
attention has been on Ken Griffey Jr., and the Seattle offense, prompting this 
from pitcher Randy Johnson: "I don't think people around the league are giving 
our pitching staff enough credit. Everybody talks about potential as if we 
can't win now, and we can. This sweep proved it." 
</P>
<P>
* To err is . . .: Well, the Angels and Dodgers have definitely proved they are 
human. The Angels, with 16 players committing errors through Thursday, have 34 
in 35 games, the Dodgers 34 in 34. The projected totals of 157 for the Angels 
and 162 for the Dodgers are surprising, considering the Angels made only 96 
errors last year and the Dodgers 118. ROSS NEWHAN

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

BRUNANSKY'S TWO HOMERS, 7 RBIS LEAD RED SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Boston obtained Tom Brunansky from the St. Louis Cardinals for Lee Smith, 
it appeared that both teams had made a good move. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals needed a reliable relief pitcher and the Red Sox needed a 
right-handed power hitter who could take advantage of the Green Monster in left 
field at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
From the moment he joined them, Smith has done the job for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
It took a little longer for Brunansky. His first nine games for the Red Sox 
were on the road. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday, in his second game at Fenway Park, Brunansky lived up to the Red 
Sox's hopes. He went five for five, including two home runs, and drove in a 
career-high seven runs in a 13-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Brunansky doubled in a run in a five-run first inning in support of Roger 
Clemens (6-2). Clemens, who has lost only to the Oakland Athletics' Dave 
Stewart this season, gave up five hits in seven innings. Clemens is 11-1 
against the Twins, who had won five of their last six. Brunansky hit a two-run 
home run over the left-field wall in the fourth, an RBI single in the fifth and 
a three-run home run in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
After going hitless in four at-bats Friday night, Brunansky, who started in the 
American League with the Angels in 1981, was batting .237 with his new team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had chances to drive in some runs (Friday) night and didn't do it," 
Brunansky said. "I had something to make up for. This is my best day by far at 
this level." 
</P>
<P>
Before joining the Red Sox, Brunansky had played 32 games at Fenway, hitting 10 
home runs and driving in 22 runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Brunansky did just what we want from him," Manager Joe Morgan said. "Maybe 
even a little more today." 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Kansas City 4 -- Steve Sax was heading home from the moment Don 
Mattingly hit his double in the 11th inning at New York. If he had hesitated, 
Sax would have been out. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a fine relay from right fielder Willie Wilson and second baseman Terry 
Shumpert, Sax beat the tag by catcher Mike Macfarlane to score from first base. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals argued, but replays showed that Sax beat the tag. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee relief pitcher Dave Righetti had seven saves in seven previous chances, 
but he couldn't retire a batter in the ninth while trying to protect a 
three-run lead. Jim Eisenreich's two-run single tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Witt, obtained from the Angels in the Dave Winfield deal, went six 
innings, giving up three hits and an unearned run in his first start for the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 4, Seattle 3 -- Jerry Browne doubled and scored the tiebreaking run 
on a wild pitch in the seventh inning at Cleveland and Doug Jones got his 14th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who lost a chance for a save Wednesday when he gave up a home run to 
Mark McGwire, retired all six he faced. 
</P>
<P>
Jones has saved 14 of the Indians' 19 victories. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 9, Milwaukee 1 -- Dave Stewart overcame a 93-minute rain delay at 
Milwaukee to hold the Brewers to four hits in six innings and become the 
league's first seven-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart (7-1) is 11-1 against the Brewers. He joins Frank Viola of the Mets and 
Jack Armstrong of the Reds as seven-game winners. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers committed three errors in the fourth inning and the Athletics took 
a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 6, Chicago 4 -- Lou Whitaker got his first hit in 22 at-bats, a two-run 
home run, and Gary Ward drove in three runs at Chicago as the Tigers won their 
fifth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Tanana (3-2), although he gave up 10 hits, including Ivan Calderon's home 
run, went seven innings and is 26-13 against the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McDowell (1-3) was removed in the sixth when the Tigers scored three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 5, Baltimore 3 -- Charlie Hough retired 18 of the first 19 he faced at 
Baltimore and the Rangers ended their five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles' only baserunner through Hough's six innings was Mickey Tettleton, 
who singled with two outs in the second. Tettleton hit a three-run homer in the 
seventh to end Hough's bid for a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Incaviglia hit his sixth home run and Rafael Palmeiro drove in two runs 
for Texas. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
GROSS LOSES NO-HITTER, BUT HE STILL BEATS GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Gross could only wonder if the way he lost his bid for a no-hitter 
Saturday at San Francisco was really fair. 
</P>
<P>
Gross pitched a perfect six innings in the Montreal Expos' 7-4 victory over the 
Giants, but he walked the first batter in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark hit a roller to first baseman Andres Galarraga that appeared to be 
the first out. But umpire Greg Bonin called it foul over the objections of the 
Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Given a second chance, Clark lined the next pitch to right for the Giants' 
first hit. Apparently upset, Gross (5-2) didn't even make it through the inning 
before he needed help. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up three runs and two hits before Tim Burke replaced him with one 
batter retired. Burke gave up a run in the ninth inning but earned his ninth 
save. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked to me like Kevin lost his concentration after walking (Brett) Butler 
on four pitches," Manager Bob Rodgers of the Expos said. "You can't pitch with 
more complete command than he did for six innings." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig, whose team had won four games in a row, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Gross had great stuff," he said. "He had a good slider and a cut fastball. He 
had great command of everything until the last inning." 
</P>
<P>
After Clark spoiled his no-hitter, Gross walked Kevin Mitchell and Kevin Bass 
followed with a two-run double. Burke took over and a run scored on an infield 
out before he got out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball was getting up there in a hurry," Gross said. "I was able to keep 
them off balance. I had a real good fastball. I mixed my pitches, I threw 
strikes and I kept the big hitters from hitting the ball out of the park." 
</P>
<P>
In ending their four-game losing streak, the Expos jumped on Bob Knepper (2-2) 
for three runs in the second inning. Knepper hurt his own cause with 
consecutive balks. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Raines, who had three hits, singled in the third inning, advanced to third 
on a wild pitch and scored on a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 4, St. Louis 0 -- The Reds have the best record in the majors -- 
25-8 -- despite playing much of the season without center fielder Eric Davis 
and their best starting pitcher, Danny Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons has been Jack Armstrong. Armstrong, getting a chance to 
start because of Jackson's injury, pitched a four-hitter at Cincinnati to 
improve his record to 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who had won six games in parts of the last two seasons, gave up two 
of the hits in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
In 28 starts for the Reds, Armstrong never made it through the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Roomes, playing because Davis is hurt, hit a three-run home run off 
John Tudor in the fifth inning to break a scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week Tudor, who won his first four starts, said he wasn't sure 
he had enough strength in his arm to get the ball to the plate. But, he went 
six innings, giving up six hits and three runs, two earned. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds are making a runaway of the West. Jackson returns and will start 
today. Davis, who came off the disabled list Saturday, said he is ready to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 2, Pittsburgh 1 -- Tom Glavine lost his shutout in the ninth inning at 
Atlanta, but reliever Joe Hesketh saved the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine (2-2), coming off four consecutive no-decisions, had a six-hitter 
through eight innings, but he gave up a walk and a hit and Hesketh came in. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Redus beat out a bunt to load the bases. Bobby Bonilla struck out. A force 
out scored a run, but Don Slaught grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
The first Atlanta run scored when Andres Thomas hit into a double play in the 
fourth inning. Jim Presley homered in the eighth for the other run. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Houston 1 -- Andre Dawson hit a two-run homer and a sacrifice fly at 
Houston to take over the major league RBI lead with 38 and help Les Lancaster 
improve to 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, who was recently moved out of the bullpen into the starting 
rotation, gave up eight hits and a run. Mitch Williams held the Astros hitless 
for the final 1 2/3 innings to get his eighth save. 
</P>
<P>
New York 6, San Diego 4 -- Kevin Elster hit a three-run home run and David Cone 
pitched a strong eight innings at San Diego as the Mets ended an eight-game 
road losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets built a 6-1 lead, but John Franco got the final out with the potential 
tying run on base. DAN HAFNER

UCLA CAPS SWEEP ON ANOTHER ONE-HITTER, 4-0

Freshman Heather Compton pitched her 12th shutout of the season, giving up one 
hit as UCLA beat Northern Iowa, 4-0, Saturday at UCLA's Sunset Field to 
complete a two-game sweep and advance to the NCAA Division I softball World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Compton (16-1) had a perfect game for four innings until giving up a walk to 
Deena Chipp and a single to Jenny McElmeel. 
</P>
<P>
Compton struck out 10. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins were led by sophomore designated player Kelly Inouye, who had two 
hits and drove in two runs. Junior right fielder Shanna Flynn also had two hits 
and scored once. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Iowa (29-30) got only two hits in the two games. Lisa Longaker pitched 
for UCLA Friday. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (57-6), which has won the last two NCAA titles, will be making its eighth 
Series appearance in the last nine years. The Bruins will play Mideast Regional 
winner Kent State in the first round Wednesday at Oklahoma City.

THE WORLD CUP;

<P>
SHORT MEMORY MAKES FOR A CONFIDENT U.S. TEAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the U.S. soccer team prepares to play its final exhibition game on home soil 
today before departing later this week for Europe, the players seem more sure 
of themselves, more -- should we say it? -- cocky, than at any time since they 
beat Trinidad and Tobago last November to get into the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Is that sort of attitude setting them up for a big fall next month in Italy? Or 
is it necessary in order for them to have a chance in the first round against 
Czechoslovakia, Italy and Austria, not a slouch in the bunch? 
</P>
<P>
No one can even begin to answer those questions until June 10, when the United 
States opens World Cup play in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the Americans will try to continue building momentum in exhibitions 
today at the Yale Bowl against Partizan Belgrade, a better-than-average 
Yugoslav professional team; on May 30 in Eschen, Liechtenstein, against 
Liechtenstein, and on June 2 in St. Gallen, Switzerland, against Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to use these next three games for further polishing," Coach Bob 
Gansler said Thursday at a luncheon in New York. 
</P>
<P>
When the players gathered for the first time this year in January in La Jolla, 
Gansler said his goal was to advance to the second round of the World Cup, 
which probably will require at least a victory and a tie in three first-round 
games. But it was apparent from the comments of other U.S. Soccer Federation 
officials Thursday, and even some of the players, that Gansler's goal has 
become their expectation. 
</P>
<P>
They may be dreaming, but the United States has played respectably enough in 
its last three exhibitions, earning two victories and a tie, that a berth in 
the second round no longer seems totally beyond the realm of possibility. 
Opening-game opponent Czechoslovakia, in case you haven't been following, has 
been far short of awesome in its exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Like in any sport, you play better with confidence," forward Peter Vermes of 
Delran, N.J., said. "We're starting to think really optimistically. There's a 
realistic chance to get to the second round." 
</P>
<P>
Also at Thursday's luncheon were the critics, or perhaps realists, including 
some journalists and longtime followers of international soccer, who were quick 
to point out that the most recent results were against highly disrespected 
Malta, rebuilding Poland and an Amsterdam professional team, Ajax, that was 
without several starters. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those same critics continue to second-guess Gansler, whose primary 
coaching experience before he became involved with the USSF was at the 
University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. They tend to disregard that he coached the 
under-20 team in 1989 to a fourth-place finish in the World Youth 
Championships, the best result for any U.S. team in an international 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
He has been criticized for experimenting too much with his players at different 
positions, for not establishing a lineup sooner so that the starters could 
become accustomed to each other and for not playing a more difficult schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people used European and South American barometers to measure us, and 
you can't do that in the United States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, the best players in Europe and South America compete in 
professional leagues that require them to play one or two games a week. 
National team coaches, for the most part, evaluate the players they will use in 
the World Cup by watching them play in those leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Since there is no professional outdoor soccer league in the United States that 
plays in the winter, Gansler has not had that luxury. He used training camps 
and exhibition games to learn of his players' skills and fit them into the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his experiments, such as using gangly forward Bruce Murray of 
Germantown, Md., in the midfield, did not work. But it was only through a 
similar experiment that Gansler learned that forward Eric Wynalda of Westlake 
Village could play in the midfield and, with Murray back at forward, give the 
United States a more concerted offense. 
</P>
<P>
As for the charge that he has used too many players in games, Gansler said 
that, besides hoping to develop inexperienced talents such as UCLA freshman 
midfielder Chris Henderson, he felt he had to have more than 11 players 
match-fit for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"If some of these players weren't going to play in games with us, then they 
weren't going to play at all because they had no league," Gansler said. "Am I 
just supposed to get 11 or 12 guys ready?" 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether the U.S. schedule has been too soft. They have 
played only three other World Cup teams, losing once to Costa Rica, once to the 
Soviet Union and twice to Colombia. But since only the second loss to Colombia, 
1-0 in Miami, was recent, the players seem to have forgotten the others. 
</P>
<P>
USSF President Werner Fricker said Thursday that Gansler has brought the team 
along "just right." Fricker might feel compelled to give the coach a vote of 
confidence, however, since the federation has given Gansler a contract through 
the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Fricker also seemed unfazed by criticism from veteran players such as Hugo 
Perez and Ricky Davis that Gansler did not give them opportunities to earn 
places on the 22-man roster, which has an average age of 23. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever in my life that I've terminated employees, I've never taken time to 
listen to their reasons about why I was wrong," he said.

<P>
SOCCER: SURVEY SHOWS ONLY THREE OF 18 THINK AMERICANS WILL BEAT CZECHS. NO ONE 
IS WILLING TO PREDICT A U.S. VICTORY OVER ITALY IN ROME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three weeks from now, on June 10 to be exact, the moment of truth will arrive. 
After a 40-year hiatus, the United States will be playing in the World Cup 
soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
If a nationwide survey of coaches, players and officials, is any indication, 
the Americans are not going to be staying in Italy for long. An early exit from 
soccer's quadrennial championship is predicted by virtually everyone 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, to be published in Soccer International magazine's June World Cup 
issue, suggests that the U.S. team has little to no chance of defeating any of 
its first-round opponents -- Czechoslovakia, Italy and Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 18 soccer experts interviewed by the magazine, only three figure there 
is any chance of a U.S. victory over the Czechs in Florence on June 10; no one 
predicts an American win over the Italians in Rome on June 14, and just three 
believe that the Austrians can be beaten on June 19 in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, it will be arrivederci, Italia, for Coach Bob Gansler and his 
U.S. squad by June 20. 
</P>
<P>
"We must realize that the United States has already achieved success by making 
it to the finals," said Gordon Jago, president of the Major Indoor Soccer 
League's Dallas Sidekicks. "Any future achievement is a bonus. This is a 
learning experience for our boys. They should not be expected to go beyond the 
first round -- they'll probably play better without that pressure." 
</P>
<P>
The 24 countries that have reached the tournament are divided into six groups 
of four teams each. After round-robin play, the top two teams from each group 
advance, along with the four third-place teams with the best records. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't be quite good enough to go through to the second round, but I don't 
see us getting embarrassed," said Terry Fisher, former coach of the Los Angeles 
Aztecs and now general manager of the San Francisco Blackhawks of the American 
Professional Soccer League. "We can defend well enough to keep the scores down. 
We'll be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher's view is shared by most of those surveyed. No one saw the United States 
losing any of its matches by more than three goals, and more than half believe 
the team is capable of gaining at least one tie. 
</P>
<P>
"The key in showing how well the U.S. will perform is the first game, against 
Czechoslovakia," said Clive Toye, former president of the North American Soccer 
League and now chairman of the APSL but perhaps best known as the man who 
brought Pele to the United States in 1975. "That will set the tone. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the U.S. will go out with dignity. It will be performing on a stage 
many levels higher than it has stepped on before." 
</P>
<P>
The Americans' opening match will be the first in World Cup play for a U.S. 
team since July 2, 1950, when the United States was beaten by Chile, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
That alone is a daunting statistic, but Ty Keough, a former U.S. national team 
player and now coach of Washington University in St. Louis and a television 
soccer commentator, thinks the Americans can cope. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the opener against Czechoslovakia may be our best performance," 
Keough said. "Our guys will be up for the game and may surprise the Czechs with 
our level of play." 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Roitman, coach of Brooklyn College in New York and an assistant coach on 
the U.S. team during part of the early qualifying rounds for Italy, believes 
the same thing, but for a different reason. 
</P>
<P>
"The political turmoil in Eastern Europe will have a negative effect on teams 
from that region," Roitman told Soccer International. "Those players have more 
important problems on their minds than just soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Of those interviewed, 11 predicted an American loss to Czechoslovakia, three 
said the match will end in a tie and three, rather optimistically, said the 
United States would win. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to show faith in the team -- make our guys feel better," explained 
Harry Keough, Ty's father and a member of the last American team to win a World 
Cup game -- on June 29, 1950, over England. 
</P>
<P>
The match against the Italians at Rome's Olympic Stadium is an altogether 
different story. If there is any chance of the United States being thrashed in 
the tournament, this is it. Italy, a World Cup winner in 1934, '38 and '82, has 
players who are light-years ahead of the Americans in skill and experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Our players have the athletic ability to stay with the best players in the 
world, but not to match their level of soccer knowledge, both in technique and 
tactics," said John Kerr, director of the players' association since 1977 and 
coach of the APSL's Washington Stars. 
</P>
<P>
Another view is that of Julio Mazzei, former coach of the New York Cosmos and 
manager of Pele's business office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Italians are going to be overconfident," Mazzei said. "Playing at 
home will put them under a lot of pressure from their own fans if they don't 
score in the first 20 minutes against the United States, a team that is not 
supposed to be very good. 
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. defense doesn't react badly, there can be an interesting result. 
Remember, Italy is not the best team in the World Cup, offensively." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the survey showed 14 of those interviewed predicting a U.S. loss and 
three foreseeing a tie. No one had the United States winning. 
</P>
<P>
However, against Austria, in what the experts believe will be the Americans' 
final game, only nine of those surveyed said the United States will lose, five 
predicted a tie and three, including UCLA soccer Coach Sigi Schmid, figured 
victory is possible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's both a hope and a prediction," Schmid said. "I believe Austria and the 
United States will still be in contention to go on to the next round. Don't 
forget that four third-place teams will move up. 
</P>
<P>
"That means Austria may take risks in going forward and give us opportunities 
to counterattack successfully. Bob Gansler showed he could develop a team with 
a strong counterattacking game when he coached the U.S. under-20s (to a 
surprising fourth-place finish) in the 1989 World Youth Cup in Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the United States will show any offensive ability at all is debatable. 
Roitman, for instance, said the United States would match Canada's feat of four 
years ago and fail to score a goal in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"I still do not see a single U.S. player who is capable of scoring consistently 
on that level of play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several coaches blame Gansler for the team's inability to score against all but 
the weakest opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"You are seeing players who are an extension of Bob Gansler's personality -- 
defensively oriented, conservative, more concerned with not making mistakes 
instead of thinking about attacking," said Angus McAlpine, former coach of the 
U.S. under-16 and under-20 national teams. "They play a counterattacking game, 
which is basically a conservative game. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe soccer should be entertaining, and that means attacking. A team 
should be loaded with artists, not just technicians. The attacking part of the 
(American) game is not being developed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed in the lack of offensive commitment, flair and imagination in 
the team as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Sampson, 1989 college coach of the year at Santa Clara, the NCAA 
co-champion, said: "You can't come away thinking we're going to score or get 
beyond the first round when the emphasis is on the defensive side of the game. 
We need more of an offensive scheme. We must take risks and score. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the majority of our players are not being allowed to go forward in 
numbers. This results in lack of offensive movement off the ball and lack of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is that this World Cup should be viewed as preparation for 1994 
(when the United States will play host to the tournament). Don't be concerned 
with keeping the score down or with losing. The American public will react more 
positively to an aggressive and well played 4-2 loss than a boring 1-0 
defensive loss." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Newman, coach of the MISL's San Diego Sockers and the most successful coach 
in U.S. soccer history, indoors and outdoors, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little critical of the way the team has been prepared," Newman said. 
"The level of intensity in its play isn't enough. I think a good part of the 
problem is that there is a letdown after international exhibitions. There's 
nothing to keep our players sharp day after day. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign players go back to a tough professional league. Our guys go back, if 
anything, to playing in college or in the park or some local league. It's just 
not the same. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was coaching (the national team), I would have encouraged American 
players to play in Europe instead of depending on exhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
Still, as Toye suggests, after having to wait 40 years between World Cup 
appearances, not too much should be expected of the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important part is that we qualified," he said. "This team is going to 
be setting a standard for all future teams to improve upon. This is the best 
U.S. team in recent decades, and the worst team we're going to have in looking 
toward the future." 
</P>
<P>
That future means 1994, said Rodney Marsh, coach and general manager of the 
APSL's Tampa Bay Rowdies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the games will have much impact on American soccer at this time 
because we aren't going very far -- in fact, not beyond the first round." Marsh 
said. "The real impact of the World Cup will come in 1994 -- it will be 
staggering."

A SCHEME RARE AS A DINOSAUR ALLEGED BY SEC; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: THE AGENCY SAYS SIX MEN CORNERED 83% OF SHARES IN AN OBSCURE SANTA 
ANA COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southland Communications Inc. isn't listed in the phone book. Doing business as 
National Paging Co., it has about 70 employees and an unassuming headquarters 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
After five years of losses and working-capital deficits, Southland is hardly 
the kind of company that catches the eye of the press or big Wall Street 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
It was, however, the kind of company that drew a network of short sellers, who 
this spring speculated that Southland's stock price would collapse. Instead, 
the stock soared in a trading frenzy last March, and the short sellers lost 
their shirts. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, the Securities and Exchange Commission charges in a lawsuit filed 
Monday, was that company president Ahmad Bayaa, an Atlanta broker-dealer named 
Shaw Tehrani and four others committed securities fraud by conspiring to 
manipulate the stock price. The actions were a desperate attempt to keep the 
firm afloat so the individuals could sell at a huge profit, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
The Southland saga, as outlined in the SEC's 28-page civil complaint filed in 
U.S. District Court in New York, provides a rare glimpse into the shadowy world 
of short selling and insider stock manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
What sets the Southland case apart is the extent of the alleged fraud -- Bayaa 
and his cohorts allegedly drove the stock price up by cornering nearly 83% of 
Southland shares through numerous secret trades, the SEC claims. 
</P>
<P>
"This is about as rare as a Tyrannosaurus Rex walking through Greenwich 
Village," said Daniel R. Schnipper, senior counsel with the SEC in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Bayaa declined to comment. The other defendants either refused to comment or 
could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
The key figures in the scheme were Bayaa and Tehrani, who met in early 1988 
when the chief executive gave a presentation at a brokerage where Tehrani 
worked as a stockbroker, the suit said. Tehrani later moved to B.C. Financial, 
a brokerage in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
They conspired to manipulate the stock as early as January, 1989, by 
positioning themselves to secretly control large blocks of shares owned by the 
four other defendants and 22 friends, family members and brokerage customers, 
the suit charged. 
</P>
<P>
During the year, Bayaa's ownership of stock fluctuated from about 35% to 40% of 
the outstanding shares, but through Tehrani's accounts the two men secretly 
controlled more than three-fourths of the total. The SEC requires that 
shareholders who acquire more than 5% of a company's shares disclose their 
holdings and intentions. 
</P>
<P>
Bayaa, 36, is a hard-working Palestinian refugee who moved to the United States 
virtually penniless in the 1970s and studied electrical engineering at Cal 
State Long Beach. In 1981 he founded Southland Communications, which provided 
customers with radio-paging services that allowed them to receive messages away 
from the office. The company went public in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
By October, 1989, the company had about 48,000 subscribers, mainly in the Los 
Angeles area, though an account providing Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.'s service 
technicians with paging services generated 21% of sales. 
</P>
<P>
Hurt by heavy price competition and the cost of investing in paging technology, 
Southland continually lost money. The company stayed afloat during 1989 with 
$1.2 million in loans from five unnamed individuals, who were repaid with 
146,246 shares of stock at $7 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Bayaa, described by former associates as a quintessential salesman who wore 
expensive suits, nevertheless maintained an upbeat front. He told people he 
believed in the company's future and was in it for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Bayaa was characteristically optimistic about the company, former 
employees said. Despite its large contingent of Palestinians, who as Muslims do 
not observe Christmas, the company threw a $3,000 Christmas party. At the 
party, Bayaa said the company's prospects for recovery were bright. 
</P>
<P>
But for the first quarter ended Jan. 31, the company acknowledged it was in 
"serious condition" and reported a loss of $324,129 on revenue of $1.9 million. 
The report said the company was unable to get additional financing and 
acknowledged auditors' concerns that the company might not continue as a "going 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
During the quarter, Bayaa and Tehrani realized that the sagging performance of 
the company could prompt a stock selloff that would lower prices sharply. They 
also feared short sellers had taken positions in the firm. 
</P>
<P>
In a short sale, an investor speculates that a company's stock will fall in 
value over a given time. The short seller borrows stock and then sells it in 
the open market. The seller must buy back the same number of shares later and 
return them to the lender. If the stock price drops as expected, the short 
seller makes a profit from the difference between the purchase prices. But if 
the price rises, more money is needed to "cover" the same number of shares, and 
the short seller loses money. 
</P>
<P>
Short sellers say they contribute to market efficiency, but stockbrokers often 
deride them as vultures who sometimes generate false rumors about a company. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the short sellers' interests ran counter to the management of 
Southland, and a classic confrontation set in. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone is trying to destroy the company," Bayaa reportedly told employees 
when the short sellers began targeting the company this year. 
</P>
<P>
Bayaa sought to get extricate the company by positioning Southland as a 
takeover candidate. That plan itself required the acquisition of another paging 
firm, A+ Beepers of California in Torrance, to give Southland almost 80,000 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
That would be near the 100,000 mark that Tehrani believed Southland needed to 
become an attractive takeover candidate, the SEC said. Since Southland's 
subscriber growth had always been healthy, the mark was "well within sight," 
the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
To finance the acquisition, Bayaa tried to secure $5 million in a private 
placement of stock with unidentified investors in the Middle East. For both 
ventures -- the private placement and the acquisition -- it was crucial that 
Southland's stock price be stable or rising, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
One snag arose in October when Pacific Bell petitioned the state Public 
Utilities Commission to block the takeover, saying that A+ Beepers had worked 
as its agent and therefore its customers belonged to Pacific Bell. Pacific Bell 
and A+ Beepers are negotiating to settle the dispute, said Pacific Bell 
spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen. 
</P>
<P>
But the real trouble for Southland began on March 3. 
</P>
<P>
That day, Tehrani angrily heaved a telephone through his office window when he 
learned of a written recommendation circulated on Wall Street. It urged 
investors to sell the company's stock short, a sure sign that the drop in price 
was imminent, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
The unsigned report was allegedly generated by John Pehrson, owner of K. A. 
Knapp &amp; Co., a firm with a checkered history that also happened to take 
Southland public, sources said. Pehrson declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
After the report, the short sellers swarmed over Southland. The defendants 
countered aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
Bayaa and Tehrani obtained their "ultimate weapon" in their battle with the 
short sellers from BHC Securities in Philadelphia, which handled trades for a 
firm with many Tehrani-controlled accounts. BHC agreed to Tehrani's request not 
to loan out any more shares to the short sellers, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
By March 14, Tehrani cornered the market in Southland's stock, the SEC alleges, 
and the share price skyrocketed 49% in a day. 
</P>
<P>
Trading volume in Southland stock rose to a frenzy level of 3.3 million shares 
in March from 103,500 in February. At the same time, the short sellers were 
dramatically increasing their investments. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Bayaa and Tehrani knew that substantial short sales would 
cause the price of the company's stock to fall, cut the value of their holdings 
and disrupt deals to acquire another company and place stock with private 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
To counteract the short sellers, Bayaa and Tehrani allegedly plotted to 
"squeeze" them by artificially withholding shares from the market, thereby 
manipulating the price upward, the SEC said, and forcing the short sellers to 
take losses. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC claims the pair orchestrated the manipulation in a number of ways: 
Through accounts they controlled, they withdrew from the market as much of the 
freely-trading stock as possible and created the illusion of nationwide buying 
interest; they engaged in prearranged transactions, and Bayaa fabricated 
optimistic reports about Southland's future, such as a statement in November 
that the company rejected a $17-a-share takeover bid in hopes of receiving a 
$25 bid. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC says the broker-dealers that Bayaa and Tehrani allegedly used were 
scattered throughout the country, with each firm trading only a small 
percentage of the stock the two men controlled. Bayaa or Tehrani directed 
brokers to open accounts in the names of one of their associates. 
</P>
<P>
Tehrani directly controlled 24 accounts associated with Bayaa or himself at 
B.C. Financial. Bayaa reportedly set up four bogus accounts with Stifel, 
Nicolaus &amp; Co. in St. Louis. The accounts were later spread to other firms 
including Baird Patrick &amp; Co in New York; Legg Mason Wood Walker, Inc. in 
Baltimore; Paine Webber Group Inc. in New York; Blunt Ellis &amp; Loewi Inc. in 
Milwaukee; Prudential Bache Securities Inc. in New York; Suplee Reed &amp; Co., 
a defunct firm in Media, Pa., and Newhard, Cook Advest Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
While SEC officials declined to elaborate on their investigation, the lawsuit 
suggests the agency has evidence that Bayaa told a public relations agent he 
was planning a "short squeeze," and phoned brokers giving them instructions on 
how to manipulate the stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
If there were such instructions, they apparently worked. Southland's bid price 
soared from $8.75 a share on March 13 to $16.75 a share on April 3, a 91% 
increase. The final bid price represents 87 times the company's per-share book 
value for the first quarter ended Jan. 31 and 6.5 times annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
The price increase was triggered by the squeeze on the short sellers, who had 
to cover their positions by buying back more expensive shares. 
</P>
<P>
On April 4, the SEC halted trading in Southland and began its investigation. 
One source said Bayaa cooperated with the SEC, perhaps telling more than he 
should have without his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
In its suit, the SEC charged that Bayaa and Tehrani held direct or indirect 
control over 83% of the company's 2.3 million shares by early April, far more 
than the 919,804 shares Bayaa reported he controlled at the end of October. The 
agency said the defendants failed to disclose their true holdings, as required 
by law. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that the defendants ran up an unpaid bill of $11.6 million for 
thousands of shares bought partially on credit. Of six securities firms owed 
money by customers affiliated with Tehrani and Bayaa, the SEC says BHC is owed 
the most, at $7.5 million, and it has been unable to collect from Tehrani. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC is seeking to recover profits from the defendants' alleged fraudulent 
activities, as well as other relief. The SEC did not specify damages. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, Bayaa and his family are keeping stiff upper lips. His wife, Jill 
Bayaa, is standing by her man. "He is an honest, sincere man who was only 
trying to save his company," she said.

Think of it as a huge, nationwide, computer-accessed subject index catalogue. 
Something that would really impress Melvil Dewey, of decimal fame. 
</P>
<P>
Type in "corrosion" and the names of half a dozen of the nation's top experts 
pop up on the screen, complete with telephone numbers, short biographies and 
summaries of their research. Type in "hazardous-waste disposal" and get more 
names and numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"A National Technology Extension Service is a way of harnessing our great 
strength in research for the needs of American industry," said Rep. John J. 
LaFalce (D-N.Y.) in introducing legislation (HR 4659) before the U.S. House of 
Representatives. "It would give small firms, in particular, the opportunity to 
access technical expertise which can be crucial to their ability to compete and 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
LaFalce envisions a technology-access program that would construct bridges 
between federal experts doing research in national labs and industry where such 
research could be used to increase the productivity and competitive strength of 
American businesses in the global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
The Technology Extension bill would draw upon the experience of the U.S. 
agricultural research and extension system, which for a century has funded 
agricultural research and disseminated new technology to U.S. farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Teltech Inc. is doing it already. "The centerpiece of our program is a network 
of 7,000 of the brightest technical minds in the country. These people come 
from major universities, national labs; some are consultants, some are even 
retired," said Ron Helgeson, vice president of the Minneapolis firm. "The 
genius of the program is its simplicity. What we have done is to set up a 
knowledge commons that allows people to talk to one another. What a concept!" 
</P>
<P>
In an informal survey of companies already offering a similar service, 
LaFalce's staff found that the average cost per year per firm was $17,000 and 
the average increase in profit was $290,000. The bill, LaFalce said, "could 
have a major impact on our economic growth rate and standard of living, and on 
the international competitiveness of American goods." 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty percent of all U.S. research and development is funded by the federal 
government. If people can't commercialize that, perhaps we would be better off 
not doing it," said Joe Allen, director of the Office of Technology 
Commercialization at the Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of LaFalce's bill would authorize the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology to create a user-friendly database of federal experts, 
technologies and research projects. The second part would authorize the 
creation of small-business centers to defray the cost of using the database. 
</P>
<P>
As the bill stands, for businesses with gross annual sales of less than $5 
million, there would be no charge. For businesses with gross annual sales of $5 
million to $15 million, there would be no cost the first year, but they would 
pay 25% of cost the next year, 50% the next and then 100%. Businesses with 
gross annual sales of more than $15 million would pay at cost. 
</P>
<P>
The Technology Extension Service has been referred to the Small Business and 
Science and Technology committees in the House for hearings. The start-up cost 
of the program is estimated at $5 million for the first year and $15 million in 
the following years. Details to be worked out will include compensation of the 
federal experts and access by foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
A Plan to Fight Mini-Oil 'Spills' 
</P>
<P>
Americans dispose of more than 400 million gallons of used motor oil a year -- 
pouring it down storm drains or putting it in containers to be hauled away with 
the rest of the household garbage to the local landfill. From there, the oil 
can leach directly into ground water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
It is the equivalent of 35 Exxon Valdez oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Esteban Torres (D-Calif.) has proposed legislation, the Consumer Products 
Recovery Act (HR 2648), designed both to stop the waste of a valuable natural 
resource and to remedy a major environmental problem. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the severity of the problem, Torres is waving a carrot, not a stick. 
</P>
<P>
"More regulations, even if they are reasonable, are difficult, if not 
impossible, to enforce without an army of inspectors and lawyers," he said. 
"The installation of a system of 'credits' to provide economic incentives to 
the actors in this drama, together with a simple but highly effective 
enforcement mechanism, would have a positive impact on this process." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that used motor oil has a negative value; it costs money to 
dispose of it properly. Gas stations and auto repair shops have accepted used 
oil from the do-it-yourselfers, who constitute roughly half of the motor oil 
market. But with today's tougher regulations and liability issues, they're 
reluctant to accept the oil. They have to pay to have their own hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Products Recovery Act would give used oil an economic value. Here 
is how it would work: 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency would get the authority to mandate annual 
recycling requirements. Producers could fulfill their obligation under the new 
law either by re-refining oil themselves, by purchasing recycled oil or by 
purchasing an "oil credit." 
</P>
<P>
The credit: For every gallon of used oil that is recycled, the recycler is 
entitled to sell a used oil credit. It is as if he is producing a second 
product. By selling the credit at whatever the market will pay, he has two 
income streams. Thus, the recycler has the ability to lower the price of his 
product or increase his capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 30% of lubricate oil sold is recycled, 60% is thrown away and 10% is 
lost in the system -- burned up by engines, leaked out on garage floors or 
tossed out in filters. The law would set a rising recycling requirement each 
year, perhaps reaching 50% at the end of 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue generated could be used by the reprocessor/recycler to purchase 
used oil from gas station owners. The station owners, now realizing a profit 
from used oil, might be willing to pay for oil returned by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"Recycling is technically feasible and environmentally sound but does not get 
done because the wrong economic incentives are in place," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Products Recovery Act has almost universal support from 
congressmen, environmental groups and even the oil industry.

NEW RECORD COMPANIES SCOUR THE GLOBE IN HOPES OF SWINGING ON A STAR; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: AN ARRAY OF WELL-FINANCED LABELS HAS EMERGED AT A TIME OF FLAT 
SALES. THEIR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON DEVELOPING NEW TALENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the last of the major independent labels, Geffen Records, gobbled up in 
March, entertainment conglomerates have begun spending millions of dollars to 
hatch their own labels in an effort to develop talent for an industry that some 
say sorely needs stars with staying power. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented emergence of seven well-financed, full-service labels, at a 
time of generally flat domestic music sales, confounds some observers, who 
doubt that there is a large enough market to keep them all afloat. 
Nevertheless, the prominent executives behind the new efforts are stirring high 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recall the last time there were that many potentially big labels 
(started) in one year," said Abbey Konowitch, senior vice president of music 
and talent at cable TV's 24-hour rock video channel, MTV. "Like any business, 
the strong will survive. But I think the consumer is the big winner here." 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of CBS Records' Sony Classical label, the new efforts are 
all pop music ventures headed by some of the record industry's most experienced 
music executives. They include: 
</P>
<P>
Giant Records, a joint venture of Warner Bros. Records and Irving Azoff, former 
chairman of MCA Music Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
DGC Records, started by entertainment mogul David Geffen after his record 
company was acquired by MCA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Zoo Records, headed by former Island Records President Lou Maglia and backed by 
Bertelsmann Music Group. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Records, a Walt Disney Co. label headed by former music industry 
lawyer Peter Paterno. 
</P>
<P>
Charisma Records, headed by Phil Quartararo, a former promotion executive at 
the label's parent company, Virgin Records, a London-based concern. 
</P>
<P>
Cardiac Records -- also backed by Virgin -- is led by Cathy Jackson, a former 
executive at Island Records. 
</P>
<P>
"The significance of all these new labels emerging at one time is that 
everybody . . . decided it's much more cost-effective to start a new label than 
buy one," said Azoff, whose Giant label this month will release its first 
record, by the Australian band Boom Crash Opera. "That, plus the fact that 
there is nothing else out there left to buy." 
</P>
<P>
Not since the early 1970s, when entertainment companies such as Gulf &amp; 
Western, MGM and United Artists briefly entered the music business, has there 
been such a flurry of new record ventures, said Joe Smith, president of 
Capitol-EMI Records. Experts estimate that the new companies each are spending 
$6 million to $10 million yearly to hire staff, lease office space, conduct 
talent searches and sign acts. 
</P>
<P>
For their huge investments, the record companies hope to emulate the track 
records of an earlier generation of start-ups such as Geffen Records, which 
since its founding in 1980 has produced 22 albums that have sold at least 1 
million copies each. Many executives believe that they can imitate Geffen's 
success by projecting the right kind of image -- that of a "boutique" label 
that gives its artists more support and attention than older and larger 
recording enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Record conglomerates say new labels help diversify artist management. So if an 
act is dissatisfied with their label, they can switch to another at the same 
record company without leaving the fold. Having several labels also enables a 
record company to field more talent scouts as well as more promotional teams to 
persuade radio stations to play the record company's music. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion of new recording ventures comes despite the notorious absence of 
brand loyalty among record buyers, who usually act like moviegoers and book 
buyers in focusing on content. Classical music aficionados are a notable 
exception, often preferring labels known for superior sound quality. 
</P>
<P>
In that respect, CBS Records' launch of Sony Classical will be closely watched. 
With most classical music now being released on CDs, sound quality is not the 
issue it once was and collectors who once swore by labels such as Polygram 
Records' Deutsche Grammophon are more willing to experiment, Sony officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"CD has made everybody equal" in sound quality, said Harold Fein, vice 
president of marketing at Sony Classical. As a result, Fein said consumers will 
focus more on the performance and the artists associated with a label. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by an expensive marketing campaign, Sony Classical has released 10 
albums, Fein said. And one of the label's first finds, Murray Perahia, has 
already progressed from prodigy to international star after winning a Grammy in 
February, 1989, for his duet with Sir George Solti on Bartok's Sonata for Two 
Pianos and Percussion. 
</P>
<P>
The backers of the six pop music labels, however, may face big obstacles in 
trying to uncover talent. Existing record companies have a head start, and the 
pop music market is becoming increasingly fragmented, as some grow disenchanted 
with the old ways of rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
"The days of the long-haired guitar guys playing rock 'n' roll are dead," said 
Joe Levy, music editor of the Village Voice, a New York weekly that is closely 
watched by the nation's music critics. "It's become a real producer's 
business," where the producers of singers Bobby Brown and Paula Abdul, for 
example, are as significant as the singers themselves, Levy said. In such an 
environment, he added, "it's more difficult for artists to achieve real staying 
power." 
</P>
<P>
The new labels hope to change that with a massive talent search that has record 
executives traveling as far away as Europe, Australia and South America to 
audition new acts. 
</P>
<P>
A talent scout at A&amp;M Records, who requested anonymity, said he once used 
to see just two or three other colleagues at clubs he visits in Austin, Tex. 
Recently, however, he has seen as many as 10 people from other labels prowling 
the clubs for new acts. 
</P>
<P>
The bounty hunting has not gone unnoticed by performers, who have begun to 
flood talent shows and record offices with audition tapes in hopes of being 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Meyers, co-director of the South by Southwest Music and Media Conference, 
which showcases new talent annually in Austin, said nearly twice as many bands 
-- 1,500 -- as last year applied for the 400 performance spots in March. 
Similarly, the upcoming New Music Seminar festival in New York is expected to 
draw more than 250 bands July 13-18. 
</P>
<P>
With new groups already getting signing bonuses and recording-fee advances of 
$100,000 or more, some experts worry that the new labels will get embroiled in 
a bidding frenzy for new groups. "My fear is that they could all end up paying 
too much for hot acts," said Jerome N. Gold, national director of media and 
entertainment at the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers reports that there have been no bidding wars yet in Texas. And Ron 
Oberman, a vice president of artists and repertoire at Columbia Records, said 
dollars don't always sway groups. He noted that his company signed one group, 
Toad the Wet Sprocket, last June even though the quartet got higher offers from 
other labels. (Another industry source said the group sought higher royalty 
fees on their records rather than a large up-front advance.) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, John Andrew Frederick, lead singer of a Los Angeles band called 
Black Watch, said that despite "tons and tons of great press" from the Los 
Angeles music magazine BAM and other publications, his group hasn't received a 
serious offer. 
</P>
<P>
"I would encourage any band to release their own records on their own label 
rather than wait to be discovered," said Frederick, who records for his own 
Eskimo Records label. "These labels all say they are into people with artistic 
integrity . . . but this is a business. I think you have to remember that." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even if an act is signed by a major label, the road to fame can be 
rocky. 
</P>
<P>
All those new labels will make radio -- the traditional outlet for new records 
-- even tougher to crack, experts say. Top 40 radio stations typically add only 
two or three songs to their playlists each week. 
</P>
<P>
"The creation of all these new labels is not going to expand the playlist," 
said Alan Burns, president of the consulting firm Alan Burns &amp; Associates 
in Oakton, Va. "There are only so many records an audience can handle at any 
one time." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be very difficult for some of these labels to survive; I see 
only one or two lasting past three years," said Charles Koppelman, chairman of 
SBK Records. 
</P>
<P>
Smith of Capitol Records is also pessimistic but sees the struggle lasting much 
longer: "The prominent ones are all well-financed and there's a lot of ego on 
the line," he said. "I don't think they will give up very easily."

PERSONAL FINANCE: DEDUCTING TRAVEL COSTS CAN STILL BE BENEFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Summer vacation time is almost here. Wouldn't it be nice if you could write off 
at least part of your expenses? 
</P>
<P>
Tax reform made it harder -- but not impossible -- to deduct travel expenses. 
Purely personal vacations, such as sightseeing or visiting relatives, are not 
deductible. Neither are trips to attend investment seminars and other 
investment-oriented excursions. 
</P>
<P>
What is deductible are trip expenses incurred for business purposes, such as 
sales calls or client visits. But even those expenses face limits on 
deductibility. You can write them off only to the extent that they exceed 2% of 
your adjusted gross income. And only 80% of food and entertainment expenses are 
deductible. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some tips on how to get the most tax bang for your vacation buck: 
</P>
<P>
* Mix business with pleasure. If your trip is primarily for pleasure, you can't 
deduct the air fare or other transportation costs to and from the vacation 
site. However, if you perform some legitimate business activities at the 
vacation site, you can deduct the hotel, local transportation fees, meal costs 
or other expenses directly related to that work. You also can deduct expenses 
such as dry cleaning if, for example, you had to clean a suit before visiting a 
client. 
</P>
<P>
One way to take advantage of this rule: When planning your vacation, look for 
business-related meetings or conventions that you can plan your trip around. 
"If you're an accountant and you want to go to Hawaii, find out when there are 
tax meetings there," says Sidney Kess, an accountant and tax lawyer in New 
York. "Or if you're a doctor, find out when the medical convention is there. 
Make your plans accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
* Mix pleasure with business. If your business trip falls on Thursday and 
Friday, tack on a little R&amp;R for the weekend. As long as your trip is 
within the United States and is primarily for business, you can generally 
deduct the transportation costs to the site. And staying the weekend gives you 
a double benefit: If you fly, fares are lower for staying over Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
How do you prove that your trip is primarily for business? The Internal Revenue 
Service has no set rule, but generally the trip will qualify if you can show 
that you spent most of the time on business or that you would not have gone 
were it not for the business purpose, Kess says. 
</P>
<P>
So if you go to Hawaii for a four-day business meeting and extend your stay for 
another three days to swim and sightsee, the cost of the flight should be fully 
deductible, Kess says. And the food and lodging expenses should be deductible 
for the four days that you spent on business. 
</P>
<P>
But taking along the spouse and kids could present problems. You can't deduct 
their costs unless their presence was essential to the business purpose. Taking 
notes or running errands for you isn't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
* Beware of foreign trips. Here, tougher rules apply. If business was the 
primary reason for the trip and it lasts less than a week, you can deduct all 
transportation costs. 
</P>
<P>
But if the trip lasts longer than a week, you cannot spend more than 25% of the 
time on pleasure to deduct all transportation costs. Otherwise, you can deduct 
transportation costs only according to the percentage of the trip spent on 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The tests are even tougher for conventions, seminars or related activities 
outside North America. The activity must be directly related to business, and 
there must be a good reason the activity had to be held outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
* Donate your vacation time. Travel expenses related to essential charitable 
activities can be deducted as a charitable contribution, which is not subject 
to the 2% floor as long as you itemize. Mileage driven for charitable 
activities, for example, can be written off at the rate of 12 cents a mile. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a big catch: The trip must be primarily for the charitable purpose 
and have no "significant" element of personal pleasure -- generally meaning 
that you must put in a full day of charitable work each day, Kess says. And 
your duties to the charitable organization must be significant and essential, 
such as if you are leading your group's fund-raising drive or performing actual 
work on an archeological dig. Merely attending a meeting is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
* Make your educational trips necessary for work. Under tax reform, "travel as 
a form of education" is no longer deductible. So if you teach French, visiting 
Paris to get a taste of the culture and practice your language won't cut it. 
But you can deduct the cost if you go to France to take language classes that 
are essential to your professional development. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of taking classes to learn a new occupation, however, are not 
deductible. 
</P>
<P>
* Get your employer to pick up the tab. The best way to save money on your trip 
is not to spend your own. Also, you won't have to worry about the IRS 
questioning the intent of your trip if your company is willing to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
If you are self-employed, charge the expenses to your business as an expense on 
Schedule C. That's also not subject to the 2% floor. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep your cruises within the United States. You can deduct up to $2,000 a 
year (not per trip) for cruise ship conventions or meetings, only if you 
establish that the activities are directly related to business. Also, the 
cruise ship must be registered in the United States, and all of its ports of 
call must be in this country or its possessions. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep good records. This is a must if you are audited. The IRS considers 
travel expenses a primary area of taxpayer abuse. The better you can document 
the business purposes of your travel -- by saving convention programs, meeting 
notes, business cards and the like -- the safer you'll be. 
</P>

"Travel, Entertainment and Gift Expenses."

CELIBACY SEDUCES SOME WEARY SINGLES

<P>
The sexual revolution has spawned a group of counter-revolutionaries: Single 
adults committed to celibacy. 
</P>
<P>
Bucking societal trends, more than 400 men and women of varied ages and 
backgrounds have found a haven in the National Chastity Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Some members have never had sex, but others have been married. Many say they 
didn't join for any religious or moral reasons; they're just fed up with the 
singles' bar scene and empty relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Many admit they've had a difficult time convincing others they are not weirdos. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been humiliated, ridiculed, laughed at, made fun of," says Janice Hodge, 
30, of Holbrook, Mass., who has never dated and believes in premarital chastity 
because "it was the way my mother brought us up." 
</P>
<P>
When she heard about the group, "I was totally psyched because I was saying to 
myself, there are finally other virgins out there besides me." 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Marsh, a 35-year-old legal secretary from Orange County, Calif., found 
her husband through the group. 
</P>
<P>
They began corresponding in November and decided to get married in May. But 
impatience intervened, and they eloped March 30, one day after they saw each 
other for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"When you can't do certain things before you get married, you want to hurry 
up," Marsh says. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh has been single since her divorce six years ago. Three years ago, she 
became celibate. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes from my religion, but it's more than that," she says. "I just feel 
it's such a precious part of yourself, you don't give it to someone when you 
haven't made the commitment of marriage." 
</P>
<P>
The decision wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I had friends try and talk me out of it," she says. "I had a man say to me, 
'Why should I spend money on you if you're not going to have sex with me, 
because 99 out of 100 women will?' " 
</P>
<P>
The pressure became too much to handle. 
</P>
<P>
"I stopped dating; it was that difficult," she says. "I got tired of wrestling 
matches basically, so I just said forget this." 
</P>
<P>
She joined the chastity association last June. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say there's no evidence of any major national trend toward chastity, 
but concede the AIDS scare has made many singles shy away from intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
The National Chastity Assn., a non-religious group founded less than two years 
ago by a divorced suburban mother of two, functions as a kind of dating service 
and support group. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Meyer, 37, says she formed the group after suffering too many heartaches 
from bad non-platonic relationships. She tried joining a singles club and 
placing personal ads in local newspapers, but failed to meet a man who shared 
her values. 
</P>
<P>
"I love hand-holding, I love kissing, I love caressing, I love sex," she says. 
"But even more than I would love to experience these things right now, I want 
to be able to have a relationship where I can experience them forever." 
</P>
<P>
Convinced that the best way to find an ideal mate is to build a non-physical 
relationship before marriage, Meyer formed the group based on what she calls 
the "19 Desires." 
</P>
<P>
They include the desire to save hand-holding, kissing and sex until marriage, 
and to be close friends with someone for at least two years before considering 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Members pay $15 a year and get their names published in a group directory that 
lists brief descriptions of members and their values. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Althea, a model in her 30s from Los Angeles, joined about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I have fooled around a lot, but I just reached a point where I'd had enough, 
and I just wanted something more," she says. "It gets to the point of being 
boring. Men are after you all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Fear of AIDS had something to do with her decision, but more than that, Althea 
says, she "was just tired of that shallow feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Since joining, Althea says she's met lots of celibate people. 
</P>
<P>
"You begin to feel like you're the only one, but you're not," she said. "We're 
not prudes. We've been around." 
</P>
<P>
David Dismore, 43, a video archivist for feminist groups in Southern 
California, says chastity is the sexual revolution's forgotten ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think liberation means glorification of casual sex," he says. "I 
think the definition of sexual liberation is the right to freely and 
comfortably say 'no.' " 
</P>
<P>
Clergyman Joe Leonard of Wayne, Pa., who is involved in a project on human 
sexuality for the National Council of Churches in Christ, says he sees no trend 
toward chastity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any evidence of it, frankly," despite the National Chastity Assn., 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Neither does Jerome Sherman, a Houston psychologist and president of the 
American Assn. of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't find that more people are saying no to sexual activity," Sherman 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is not should you have any sexual activity before marriage, 
because it depends on each individual." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, to each his/her own.

Henrietta Shore is back. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, about a quarter-century after the artist had died penniless and 
forgotten in a San Jose sanitarium at the age of 83, Shore was the subject of a 
full retrospective of paintings, drawings and prints at the little Monterey 
Peninsula Museum of Art in Northern California. (She had moved from Los Angeles 
to Carmel in 1930.) 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently that exhibition traveled south, without fanfare, to the Laguna Art 
Museum, where it was seen by Michael Quick and Ilene Ford, curators at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art who last year acquired two pictures by the artist 
for the museum's collection of American painting and sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, the Turner Dailey Gallery on Beverly Boulevard is currently 
showing 15 paintings, nine lithographs and six pencil drawings -- the first 
gallery presentation of Shore's art in 39 years. 
</P>
<P>
If this modest but nonetheless noteworthy spurt of activity doesn't exactly 
seem to constitute a tidal wave of enthusiasm and acclaim, that depends on what 
you're comparing it to. Weighed against the voluble fanfare surrounding Georgia 
O'Keeffe -- the painter (or should I say saint?) whose name is most often 
murmured in the vicinity of Shore's radiant, and frankly strange, floral 
paintings -- these recent developments hardly register at all. Yet, compared to 
the near total obscurity in which Henrietta Shore has languished since before 
World War II, they add up to a veritable tsunami. 
</P>
<P>
Who was Henrietta Shore? The question is not so simple as it seems. This 
largely unknown artist turns out to be something of a paradigm for an entire 
era in modern American art. 
</P>
<P>
Her biography certainly can be sketched with relative ease. Born in Toronto in 
1880, the seventh and youngest child of a comfortable bourgeois family, she 
went to New York at 20 to study painting with society painter William Merritt 
Chase. The apprenticeship was brief. Soon she switched to more rigorous and 
demanding classes with Robert Henri, whose admonitions to paint from the 
immediate world at hand would mark Shore's art for the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Following a "grand tour" of European capitals and a stint at a London art 
school, Shore joined her brother and his wife on an extended journey to 
California in 1913. (Her departure meant that, by a few short months, she 
missed seeing New York's landmark exhibition of European modern art, the Armory 
Show.) In Los Angeles she decided to set up a studio, exhibited her work 
wherever she could and helped to found the Los Angeles Modern Art Society. She 
stayed for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1920, just as women in the United States finally got the vote, Shore 
returned to the East and co-organized the New York Society of Women Artists. 
(She also became an American citizen.) Missing California, she returned to Los 
Angeles in 1923 and stayed another seven years, eventually moving to the 
Monterey Peninsula, where she worked until the beginning of the war. 
</P>
<P>
Through middle age Shore enjoyed at least a modest success. She won prizes, 
garnered gallery and museum shows on both coasts (and one in London) and was 
the subject of a small, 1933 monograph with essays by the impresario Merle 
Armitage, San Diego Fine Arts Gallery director Reginald Poland and, most 
notably, her colleague and friend, the photographer Edward Weston. 
</P>
<P>
From 1939 on, details are sketchy. Although Shore lived for another 24 years, 
no postwar paintings by her hand are recorded with any certainty, and the 
circumstances surrounding her commitment to a sanitarium in the late 1950s are 
vague. Whatever the facts, her quiet brand of modernist easel painting was 
emphatically swept away in the years following the war, by the arrival of New 
York School abstraction and its West Coast variants. Outside the narrow realm 
of occasional academic research, we've seen neither hide nor hair of it since. 
</P>
<P>
Until lately. The return of Henrietta Shore is by no means complete, but that 
it's happening at all deserves a careful hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the two paintings at LACMA and the exhibition at Turner Dailey reveal 
a typically provincial artist of undeniable skill who worked hard, blossomed 
late and was possessed of occasional flashes of dazzling brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
Shore did not begin to come into her own as a painter until she was about 40, 
while two-thirds of the 15 paintings in the gallery exhibition were made in the 
decades before (only five are dated after 1920). Portrait studies such as 
"Meditating," circa 1910, and "On the Street" -- undated, but redolent of 
Robert Henri and the cheery grime of his so-called Ash Can School aesthetic -- 
are prosaic examples of period style, as are the few conventional landscapes in 
the show. By sharp contrast, the 1929 "California Cactus" is an exquisitely 
riveting picture. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a late cycle of murals, all Shore's work is small. "California 
Cactus" is no exception, but it's nonetheless powerful for it. Against a 
shallow ocher ground, two flame-tipped succulents and a pair of leafy stems 
fill the space, rather like animated pinwheels. One cactus, reserved and 
demurely elegant, is shown in upward-reaching profile at the rear, while the 
second, showier plant is rendered frontally, as if it had somehow miraculously 
turned to meet the spectator's advancing gaze. 
</P>
<P>
Through carefully modulated tones, the leaves of this latter cactus get 
progressively brighter and more radiant as they approach both the frontal plane 
of the picture's 
</P>
<P>
space and the center of the plant; there, at the compositional nucleus, an 
eye-shaped bud of golden hue stares resolutely back. A nearby pair of sinuous 
tendrils, which occupy the foreground between the painting's unblinking "eye" 
and our own, begins to register an aura of exploratory searching. These 
California cactuses may be mundane desert plants, but Shore has masterfully 
orchestrated them to exude a numinous quality of bristling, sentient awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Shore was by no means a prolific artist. In her mature work she painted slowly, 
laying on oil colors -- green, violet, orange, magenta, cerulean -- in thin, 
carefully built up, seemingly brushless glazes. Reflected through transparent 
color, light seems magically to glow from within the deepest recesses of the 
canvas. This extraordinary quality of illumination connects her to, on one 
hand, the conservative and fashionable plein-air landscape painters of the day, 
and, on the other, to progressive photographers such as her friend Weston. 
While her best paintings blew away the mawkishly nostalgic revery of so-called 
California Impressionism, they productively engaged in rigorous dialogue with 
Weston's luminous photographs. 
</P>
<P>
At LACMA, the abstraction called "Life" (circa 1921) shows how downright 
peculiar Shore's visionary images could certainly be. This vertical canvas 
features two jack-in-the-pulpit-like forms, from which emerge white, 
streamlined, faceless bodies, one male and the other female. In the gray field 
between them arises a dark blue, biomorphic form (imagine the shape of an 
attenuated peanut). This blue shape, which flickers between being a negative 
space and a positive form, erotically suggests both a cave-like opening and a 
swelling tumescence. 
</P>
<P>
"I have worked to develop the gift of understanding of nature," Shore wrote to 
her brother, Egerton, in an inscription inside a copy of her monograph, "that I 
might best use that gift through my drawing and painting to express the love 
received from and given to God." The painting, "Life," employs modernist 
devices to fashion an abstracted depiction of Adam and Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Any understanding of Henrietta Shore and her art must take into account another 
peculiar feature of this odd canvas, which seems to me decisive. The male 
figure in the picture emerges from a cuplike stem, or calyx, which grows rather 
awkwardly from an unseen place off the right edge of the canvas. By stark 
contrast, both the female calyx and the central blue "spirit" grow directly 
from an organic, abstract, red-orange shape, which is centrally placed and 
certainly reminiscent of the floating leaf of a waterlily. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a lily pad it may well be. (At Turner Dailey there's a small, handsome 
lithograph of a waterlily, dating from the end of the decade.) But I looked at 
this odd shape for a long while before I realized what else it resembles. 
Unlike Adam, the abstracted figures of both Eve and the "spirit" are growing 
from an old-fashioned painter's palette. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamentally modernist idea that a painter could invent herself through 
art became the pivotal realization for Henrietta Shore's work. Likewise, that a 
woman could invent herself through art was the pivotal realization for 
Henrietta Shore's life. 
</P>
<P>
Shore's birth in 1880 had placed her, as a woman and as a painter, at a 
decisive juncture in American society. By the end of the century, full-scale 
industrialization was rapidly transforming women from robust producers into 
passive consumers, while art -- the human ability to make things -- was 
metamorphosing into leisure. Together, these twin developments caused the very 
idea of painting to be feminized. In the mind of mainstream America, art of any 
kind was becoming a less than manly thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
The fact of Henrietta Shore's gender is of course the central reason for her 
almost total obscurity today, just as it was basic to the cruel poverty and 
suffering she was to experience in her own lifetime. The trauma of the 
Depression generated a reactionary, no doubt inevitable elevation of artistic 
traits associated with stereotypical masculinity, which re-emerged in the 
postwar years as the "dynamism," "muscularity" and "action" of Abstract 
Expressionism. The woman from California was swept into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
Shore's "Life" is certainly not among the greatest modern pictures of its time, 
nor could it even be claimed among the handful of the artist's most 
accomplished works. Those would come later, in stunning canvases such as 
"California Cactus" and "Gloxinia by the Sea." (The latter I've seen only in 
reproduction, but if this painting from the early 1930s is even half as 
impressive in person as in a photograph, it ranks as Shore's consummate 
masterwork.) Still, the historical significance of "Life" is equally certain -- 
especially for a city and a country whose artists have played an influential 
role in framing feminist cultural issues since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
This peculiar painting is also among the first direct pieces of evidence of the 
full spread of early modernism into the provincial culture that was the United 
States circa 1920. Furthermore, it's as clear a testament as could be imagined 
to the utterly indivisible relationship between modernist artistic principles 
and progressive social thought. The painting's new public home at LACMA, which 
signals at least the nominal return of Henrietta Shore, couldn't be more 
meaningful.

HOLLYWOOD'S AWASH IN MONEY; THE UPCOMING MOVIE BUDGETS ARE OFF THE CHARTS; WHAT 
DOES IT ALL MEAN? IT'S ACTION SUMMER!

<P>
It's become a Hollywood tradition to roll out the biggest guns during the 
summer. This year is no exception -- except that the guns are even bigger than 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
Coming soon to a theater near you: More than half a dozen sequels to monster 
hits -- including "Another 48 HRS.," "Die Hard 2" and "RoboCop 2." Plus, some 
heavy-duty non-sequels -- notably, "Dick Tracy," "Days of Thunder" and "Total 
Recall." They'll all be accompanied by tenacious and expensive marketing 
efforts aimed at pulling you into theaters. 
</P>
<P>
From now through Labor Day, box-office receipts will account for an estimated 
40% of the year's grosses. So, it is no coincidence that the summer's 
heavy-duty titles are mostly action/special effects-oriented, boasting some of 
the biggest stars in the business -- with an aim towards kids, teens and young 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hollywood isn't betting exclusively on the young. Coming off 
the success of such adult-oriented hits as the Oscar-winning "Driving Miss 
Daisy" and "The Hunt for Red October," major distributors will respond to adult 
tastes with titles including Spike Lee's "Mo' Better Blues," about a New York 
trumpet player, and "Presumed Innocent," the screen adaptation of Scott Turow's 
best-selling courtroom thriller. 
</P>
<P>
But the attention, inevitably, focuses on the action films and stars, not to 
mention dazzling budgets. Consider: The collective cost of the budgets of a 
dozen pictures, boasting some of the biggest price tags, totals between $350 
and $400 million. That figure doesn't include marketing costs. 
</P>
<P>
20th Century Fox's "Die Hard 2," which has had a troubled production, is said 
to be costing about $60 million. Tri-Star Pictures' special effects-laden 
science fiction saga "Total Recall" may run up a higher price tag -- perhaps as 
much, according to some sources, as $70 million. Paramount Pictures' racing 
drama, "Days of Thunder," is said to have been clocked at $50 million -- and 
still racing. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep hearing about all this money being spent, and I'm stunned," admits a 
marketing executive at a studio where the top summer film cost less than $40 
million. "You ask yourself, 'How much is too much?' " 
</P>
<P>
The answer in today's Hollywood economy might be: Too much is never enough. 
Coming off a record year at the box office, the motion picture industry is 
awash in money. 
</P>
<P>
So, consider (as most of Hollywood is) the possibilities of the big returns on 
the huge budgets: 
</P>
<P>
* The total domestic box office last year was $5.1 billion. (The domestic take 
consists of U.S. and Canadian ticket sales.) Of that, $2 billion -- about 
$500,000 more than most industry analysts predicted -- came from last summer's 
box office receipts. During the startling summer of 1989, five movies passed 
the magic $100-million mark. 
</P>
<P>
Led by "Batman," and its record-breaking ticket sales of $251.1 million, the 
others were: 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" ($197.1 million); "Lethal 
Weapon II" ($147.2 million); "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" ($130.1 million) and 
"Ghostbusters II" ($112.4 million). 
</P>
<P>
* Already this year, domestic grosses are in excess of $1.5 billion, compared 
to nearly $1.4 billion at this same time last year, reports Art Murphy, veteran 
box office analyst for the trade paper Daily Variety. "In April, alone, box 
office jumped more than 45% from a year go," says Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"The market on the whole has shown the ability to expand," says Barry London, 
Paramount Pictures' motion picture group president in charge of distribution. 
London cites the $100-million-plus performances of the four spring releases, 
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" ($109.5 million), "The Hunt for Red October" 
($105.4 million), "Pretty Woman" ($100.5 million), and "Driving Miss Daisy" 
($100 million). (Released last fall, the Oscar-winning "Driving Miss Daisy" did 
not open wide until early this year.) 
</P>
<P>
"That's already an enormous figure for one year," enthuses London, adding, "so, 
who knows what the summer could bring?" 
</P>
<P>
Especially considering that the upcoming crop -- while seemingly without a 
dominating film like last summer's "Batman" -- has what various analysts feel 
are 10 to 12 potential hits. This includes the much talked-about "Dick Tracy," 
with Warren Beatty and Madonna. Conjecture about whether the no-nonsense 
detective can dominate the box office the way "Batman" did has met with some 
skepticism. Both are taken from the comics, but Tracy -- unlike Batman -- isn't 
as familiar to young people. Disney strategists are currently working to 
counter that with a big marketing campaign that's just beginning to roll. 
</P>
<P>
Action films certainly seem to have the highest profile at this point, but 
there are also a number of comedies, family films and "serious" titles due out. 
No one is discounting their potential, based on last summer's surprises in 
"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," "Dead Poet's Society" ($94.5 million) and Spike 
Lee's "Do the Right Thing" ($27.1 million). "It's going to be some summer," 
predicts John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations, which provides industry 
news to theater owners. 
</P>
<P>
"I see only cause for joy -- and the possibility that this summer's movies 
could do as well as last summer," says Phil Garfinkle, executive vice president 
of Entertainment Data Inc., which tracks box-office figures. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy didn't want to make any predictions: "I'm not walking the plank on the 
summer movies. Last summer's figures reflected such an abnormally big 
</P>
<P>
jump, that you can't really predict these things -- especially since the 
studios tend to 'front-load' the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Explains Murphy: "All the giant titles are released in the first half of the 
summer. Remember that a film that opens in June can play three months of 
seven-day weeks. That's a lot of money, compared to what a movie released later 
in the summer can do." The season's first shots were fired Friday, with the 
release of Universal Pictures' romantic comedy, "Bird on a Wire," and Orion 
Pictures' comedy, "Cadillac Man." 
</P>
<P>
But the real kick-off comes this Friday -- the first day of the Memorial Day 
weekend -- when Universal's "Back to the Future III" opens at about 2,000 
theaters. The only opposition to "Future" is the Apache 
helicopters/war-on-drugs action picture "Fire Birds," distributed by Disney's 
Touchstone Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in rapid succession, an army of high-profile, potential blockbusters 
troop in: "Total Recall," "Another 48 HRS.," "Dick Tracy," "Gremlins II," 
"RoboCop 2" and "Days of Thunder." That's just in June. Among the titles in 
July: "Die Hard 2" and "Flight of the Intruder," a Vietnam action-adventure 
about Navy fliers. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the high stakes and the fact that summer is such a competitive 
arena, studios have jockeyed release dates for weeks -- usually after assessing 
their products and sizing up the opposition's. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Fox announced that "Die Hard 2" would open on July 4, when there is 
no major competition, rather than on the previously announced June 22, when it 
would have squared off against Orion's "RoboCop 2." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as May 3, Warner made the surprise decision to go head-to-head with 
Disney's "Dick Tracy" and pushed back the release of "Gremlins II: The New 
Batch," from May 18 to June 15. 
</P>
<P>
The move was made to send a message to Disney: Warner believes that kids on 
school break would rather watch the hip (and sometimes malevolent) Gremlins 
than a nostalgic comic character. (Last year, Disney dared to release "Honey, I 
Shrunk the Kids" the same day as Warner's "Batman," and it went on to become 
the surprise success of the summer.) A Disney studio insider, responding to 
this year's "Gremlins" strategy, sent a message back: "They'll be sorry -- real 
sorry -- that they ever made that move." 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes. "Total Recall," once scheduled to take on "Dick Tracy," is now 
being released June 1 -- without any major competition, until "Another 48 HRS." 
opens on June 8. "48 HRS.," in turn, was originally scheduled for release June 
27. But when it became evident that "Days of Thunder" wouldn't be done in time 
to make its previously announced June 8 release, Paramount Pictures' 
flip-flopped the two. 
</P>
<P>
Along with plotting release-date strategies, studios have also been plotting 
marketing campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
A studio executive interviewed for this piece estimates that the summer's major 
films are each being launched with marketing campaigns of "at least" $10- to 
$12-million (that's above and beyond the budgets and the cost of film prints). 
</P>
<P>
Already shaping up are these maneuvers: 
</P>
<P>
* Say it with billboards. That's what Fox is doing in 26 cities, where 
billboards proclaim: "This Summer, Die Harder" -- referring to "Die Hard 2." 
"You're not going to be able to turn around without seeing us. If you do, 
please call me," says Tom Sherak, president of marketing and distribution. Over 
at Paramount, they're touting the billboards for the Tom Cruise picture, "Days 
of Thunder," which herald, "Cruise Like Thunder on June 27." Buses are 
similarly plastered. 
</P>
<P>
* Magazine cover blitzes. "Total Recall" star Arnold Schwarzenegger graces at 
least half a dozen -- including "GQ," "Smart," "Vanity Fair" and "Premiere." 
For the latter, he's photographed underwater (cover copy proclaims the issue is 
"Worth the Wet!"). Schwarzenegger is also featured in a slew of "inside" 
stories -- including one in Muscle &amp; Fitness. 
</P>
<P>
* Product tie-ins, galore. There'll be Chevrolet and Exxon promotions for "Days 
of Thunder." Kids can partake of the fantasy, too, with Tyco Toys race cars. 
</P>
<P>
The Gremlins will do some pitching for the Quality Inns. One spot, touting the 
Inn's family rates, features Brain (the Gremlin who talks), and a passle of 
cute baby gremlins all tucked side-by-side into their hotel bed for the night. 
</P>
<P>
* Fast food, anyone? There'll be a "Jetson's" kid's meal at Wendy's. And a 
McDonald's "Happy Meal" tied to Walt Disney Pictures' re-issue of "Jungle 
Book." 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the biggest-ever tie-in between a fast-food enterprise and a movie, 
McDonald's and Disney have also teamed for what may be the season's premiere 
promotional campaign: the Dick Tracy Crimestopper's Game -- a lottery style 
contest with "scratch-off" cards that reveal clues to solving crimes and 
catching bad guys. It kicks off in early June, and will continue through the 
summer, offering a whopping $40 million in cash and prizes (including food 
items). 
</P>
<P>
* The MTV/VH-1 video push. Look for Z Z Top performing "Doubleback" in the 
"Back to the Future III" video, which will also feature scenes from the movie. 
The Neville Brothers sing the "Bird on a Wire" title song; the Beach Boys 
perform the title song to Universal's comedy, "Problem Child"; heavy metallers 
Babylon A.D. emote to "The Kid Goes Wild," from Orion's "RoboCop 2," and Dave 
Stewart of the Eurythmics performs "Party Town," in the video for Columbia's 
dramatic "Flatliners." Plus, Prince and Morris Day in videos for Warner's 
"Graffiti Bridge," starring both rockers. 
</P>
<P>
* Glitzy premieres. Monday night's premiere of "Back to the Future III," to 
benefit the Westside Children's Center, will be attended by the stars and 
include a Western-style party. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere party for Tri-Star's "Total Recall" will be held at Griffith Park 
Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
"Tracy's" will be held at a theater complex adjoining Walt Disney World in 
Orlando, Fla. Afterward, VIPs -- and 3,000 members of the press junket -- will 
mix it up with the film's stars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DICK TRACY'S DILEMMA 
</P>
<P>
Of all the marketing campaigns, none will be as pivotal as the one for Disney's 
"Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
Director/star Beatty has assembled an impressive cast (including Al Pacino and 
Dustin Hoffman hidden behind make-up in supporting roles) and crew (including 
production designer Richard Sylbert and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, both 
of whom worked on Beatty's "Reds"). But if the elements are intriguing, the 
film also faces hurdles, based on the target audience. Simply put, kids and 
teen-agers don't know Tracy or Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
Created in 1931, the Tracy strip was once read by 29 million people in more 
than 650 newspapers. Today, it appears in just more than 150 papers. As for 
Beatty -- who last bombed in 1987's "Ishtar" -- he hasn't had a commercial hit 
since 1978's "Heaven Can Wait." 
</P>
<P>
So the question persists: Will Beatty/"Tracy" play to the young people who 
helped to make other comics-movies, like "Batman," and the current "Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles," mega-hits? 
</P>
<P>
"That's our job from a marketing standpoint," says Disney Studio chairman 
Jeffrey Katzenberg, who confesses that at this point, his own 7-year-old son 
"doesn't really know what 'Dick Tracy' is. But," he stresses, "that will change 
by the time June 15 comes around." 
</P>
<P>
Katzenberg declined to reveal how that change would be accomplished. But in the 
last week or so, ads for the PG-rated "Dick Tracy" have been bombarding TV -- 
especially during kids' programming. 
</P>
<P>
Disney officials didn't want to detail their promotional plans for the 
$25-$30-million "Tracy," which will be released with the second Roger Rabbit 
cartoon short, "Rollercoaster Rabbit." (The first Roger Rabbit cartoon, "Tummy 
Trouble," was attached to "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.") But, gradually, 
information was provided by studio insiders -- one of whom estimates that 
within two weeks of "Tracy's" release, it will have been supported by $150 
million worth of efforts, including promotional activities from the various 
licensees. 
</P>
<P>
Among the "Tracy" marketing tactics: 
</P>
<P>
* Three "logos," all in the primary comic strip colors that are used as a motif 
in the movie. They appeared in succession, beginning at Christmas. The first 
showed Beatty's mug in profile, with the warning, "This Year They're Out to Get 
Him." No. 2 had him full face, telling his wrist radio, "I'm on My Way." In No. 
3 he's shown full figure, blasting away with a machine gun. It reads: "June 15. 
Everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
* Magazine covers. Madonna, who plays gangster moll Breathless Mahoney, has 
racked up Vanity Fair (including sexy photos snapped by Helmut Newton), 
Cosmopolitan, Harper's, several issues of Entertainment Weekly and US. The 
traditionally press-shy Beatty came out of the shadows for Rolling Stone and 
Premiere, plus his widely seen encounter with Barbara Walters, after the Oscar 
telecast. The film will be spotlighted in an upcoming segment of ABC's "20/20" 
and featured on covers including USA Weekend and Memories magazine. "Tracy" 
also got half the covers of the "summer blockbuster" June issue of the 
authoritative genre magazine, Cinefantastique, which chose "RoboCop 2" as the 
other film worthy of cover status. 
</P>
<P>
* Three -- count 'em -- record albums. Madonna's "I'm Breathless," includes the 
three Stephen Sondheim songs (including, "I Always Get My Man") that she 
warbles on screen. (Her current tour includes a "Dick Tracy" homage.) 
</P>
<P>
Plus an album featuring orchestral score by Danny Elfman ("Batman") and an 
album of some of the songs in the film (other than Breathless' numbers), as 
performed by artists ranging from k.d. lang to Mel Torme. 
</P>
<P>
* A specially made syndicated TV special, the 30-minute "Dick Tracy, Behind the 
Badge, Behind the Scenes," expected to air a week before the film opens. 
</P>
<P>
* An MTV promotion to feature specially made "Tracy" promos and contests 
offering prizes of Dick Tracy's sedan, Breathless' roadster convertible and a 
chance to attend the film's premiere. 
</P>
<P>
* A little help from the theme parks. Disneyland's hip music hang-out, 
Videopolis, will feature a 20-minute live musical stage show ("with original 
script"), focusing on "Tracy." Likewise the Hollywood stage of the Disney/MGM 
Studio Tour in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
A Disney representative says with characteristic marketing understatement: 
"You're not going to be able to go very far in any direction and not run into 
Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE OTHER BIG NON-SEQUELS 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Schwarzenegger on Mars. "Top Gun" on wheels. High-concepts are among the 
reasons for the high-profiles of the summer's other significant non-sequels. 
</P>
<P>
Take the $10-million-a-movie muscleman/actor Schwarzenegger and team him with 
original "RoboCop" director Paul Verhoeven. Throw in a Martian science-fiction 
scenario involving memory implantation, a budget that reportedly swells to $70 
million, and what do you get? 
</P>
<P>
Since this package was first announced, "Total Recall" has been generating 
interest among science-fiction and fantasy fans -- rabid moviegoers -- and also 
throughout the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Philip K. Dick's short story, "I Can Remember It for You Wholesale," 
the film's history spans more than 15 years. It was Schwarzenegger's clout that 
finally got the project made -- and it is Schwarzenegger who is the focus of 
the film's promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Days of Thunder" reteams Tom Cruise with his "Top Gun" superstar producers, 
Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. (With ticket sales of $171.6 million, "Top 
Gun" was the top-grossing film of 1986.) Cruise came up with the story idea, 
which has him as an ambitious young race driver on the fast track to 
self-discovery and, presumably, the top prize on the NASCAR racing circuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SEQUELS 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are those films that can rely largely on built-in promotional 
factors: namely, the sequels. 
</P>
<P>
This summer's biggies -- "Gremlins II: The New Batch," "Another 48 HRS.," 
"RoboCop 2," and "Die Hard 2" -- are especially formidable because they are 
follow-ups to films that became huge hits on videocassette and cable after 
their theatrical success. They'll all be released within a single month. 
</P>
<P>
(Last summer, "Lethal Weapon II" benefitted mightily from the videocassette and 
cable afterlife of "I," which grossed $65 million at theaters.) 
</P>
<P>
In the case of 1982's "48 HRS.," it even established a formula. As Paramount's 
Barry London notes, the buddy-cop film was one of the decade's most imitated 
movies. It also stands as what is arguably Eddie Murphy's best movie. 
</P>
<P>
The original "Gremlins" -- which earned $148 million in 1984 -- also let loose 
a trend: a spate of creature movies. To promote the sequel, Warner's has been 
out in force at the science fiction/comics fans conventions. (Other studios 
with genre pictures have been doing the same, the better to capture the 
repeat-audience crowd.) Among the Warner selling tactics: a behind-the-scenes 
special -- which goes awry when the Gremlins take over. (Director Joe Dante's 
shown pulling out his hair.) 
</P>
<P>
As for the original "Die Hard," released in 1988, when Bruce Willis' popularity 
had subsided, the film nonetheless won over non-Willis fans -- and critics -- 
to slowly become a hit, with $81 million in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Fox sequel has had a lengthy and reportedly costly and troubled 
production -- not unlike the "The Abyss," the studio's 1989 summer underwater 
thriller. As a result of that film's production woes, the $60-million project 
wasn't released until August, when peak movie-going had subsided. It earned 
only so-so reviews and ticket sales of $54.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"RoboCop" had receipts of $53 million in 1987 -- and let loose one of the 
genre's most identifiable "stars," a half-robot/half-man. 
</P>
<P>
As befits a star, RoboCop has lately taken up causes. According to David 
Forbes, Orion president of domestic distribution, the man of metal is going to 
become involved in anti-drug efforts. And he appears in an anti-smoking spot (a 
scene cut right from the film, in which he blasts a cigarette out of a smoker's 
mouth), which is running in 7,000 theaters, as well as on several airlines. 
</P>
<P>
True to his image, RoboCop also acted as a peacekeeper at last week's National 
Wrestling Alliance's pay-per-view telecast, which pitted wrestling villains 
like Sid Vicious, Ole and Arn Anderson against heroic wrestler, Sting. 
</P>
<P>
Still other titles that should be able to draw from moviegoers who like a sense 
of deja vu: "Young Guns II" and "Exorcist III: 1990" (both from Fox), and "The 
Two Jakes," Paramount's long-awaited sequel to 1974's complex murder 
mystery/character study, "Chinatown." 
</P>
<P>
A (financial) footnote to summer box office: A summer blockbuster's ticket 
sales are only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
According to Art Murphy, a film's U.S. and Canadian film rentals -- that is, 
the portion of the box office gross that is returned to the distributors -- 
represent only 20% of what a title will ultimately earn. 
</P>
<P>
"The universe keeps expanding," says Murphy, pointing to growing markets for 
movies, "like foreign TV, which has suddenly become a huge new marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
It takes approximately five to seven years for each picture to travel through 
the expanded marketplace universe -- which includes theatrical, pay-per-view, 
video, cable, pay TV, network TV, syndicated TV and the burgeoning foreign 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Which means that long after Hollywood's summer has come to an end, it will 
still be summer somewhere else. 
</P>

WHERE THE ACTION ISN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Not everything this summer will be ultra-high-profile/action-oriented movies. 
</P>
<P>
Studio marketeers are also at work on campaigns for comedies, a smattering of 
dramas targeted at the adult audience and family films. 
</P>
<P>
Comedy-wise, some of the genre's biggest names will reportedly help promote 
their products by chatting with the press. Including: Bill Murray, 
star/co-director of Warner's "Quick Change"; Steve Martin, for Warner's "My 
Blue Heaven"; controversial Andrew Dice Clay, for Fox's action-comedy, "The 
Adventures of Ford Fairlane." (The film, in turn, is expected to fuel a second 
Dice Clay summer film -- "The Andrew Dice Clay Concert Movie," also for Fox.) 
</P>
<P>
Plus Matthew Broderick and the co-stars of Columbia's quirky comedy "The 
Freshman." (As for the film's other star, Marlon Brando, a studio source 
quipped, "Yeah, we're gonna send him on a 30-city tour.") 
</P>
<P>
With the late summer release of "Taking Care of Business," starring Charles 
Grodin and Jim Belushi, Touchstone hopes to emulate the late summer successes 
of the company's "Turner and Hooch" ($70.4 million in 1989) and 1987's 
"Stakeout" ($65.6 million). With "Betsy's Wedding," Touchstone will 
counter-program. Essentially an updating of "Father of the Bride," the film 
will be released in late June -- when there are few films with appeal for 
female viewers. (The movie has already had considerable visibility; its trailer 
is attached to the hit "Pretty Woman.") Likewise, Paramount is counting on the 
romantic appeal of the late July release "Ghost," starring Patrick Swayze, Demi 
Moore and Whoopi Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
On the serious side: Universal will again release a Spike Lee film, "Mo' Better 
Blues," at summer's end. (Last year's entry was "Do the Right Thing.") As Si 
Kornblit, Universal's executive vice president, worldwide marketing, notes: 
"Spike himself has become a celebrity." Warner's "Presumed Innocent" -- one of 
the summer's most anticipated "adult" titles -- which will get a PR boost from 
star Harrison Ford. The long-awaited "Chinatown" sequel will reportedly get a 
push from director/star Jack Nicholson (who kept silent during the "Batman" 
media blitz). To promote "Memphis Belle," about a B-17 bomber crew during World 
War II, Warner plans to let the press meet the ensemble cast at a junket in 
Memphis -- where the real Memphis Belle is on display. The studio is promoting 
the film via World War II organizations, air shows and aviation groups. "But," 
stresses a spokeswoman, "we don't want this film to be perceived as nostalgic. 
It's more like 'Young Guns' in the air." 
</P>
<P>
The film with the summer's strangest title, Touchstone's thriller, 
"Arachnophobia" (definition: fear of spiders), has been generating "buzz" 
within the industry and bragging, among Disney staffers, of a potential 
surprise hit. 
</P>
<P>
Family-wise: Proof of the swelling ranks of family audiences, and pint-size 
moviegoers, came with "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," and "Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles." 
</P>
<P>
Summer titles attempting to tap that market will include a trio of animated 
features, the reissue of a live-action adventure tale "starring" a kitten and a 
puppy, and a comedy starring "America's favorite dad." 
</P>
<P>
Originally released last summer, the Japanese-made "The Adventures of Milo and 
Otis" (Milo is the kitten) charmed critics but made little money. This year 
Columbia will put the "thumbs-up" reviews to use in an all-new campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of "Jetsons: The Movie," Universal is hoping for cross-over appeal, 
since many of today's moms and dads grew up watching the series. There's even a 
teen-age angle, since teen singer Tiffany provides the voice of the teen-age 
Judy Jetson. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's new animated feature, "Ducktales -- The Movie: Treasure of the Lost 
Lamp," should have no problem luring small fry. For the uninitiated, 
"Ducktales" -- about the exploits of kid ducks Huey, Duey and Louie, as 
chaperoned by the grown-up Scrooge -- is one of TV's hottest, most heavily 
merchandised kids' shows. Also from Disney: a reissue of "The Jungle Book" 
(1967). Both films' release will be accompanied by "the making of" syndicated 
TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
To promote the PG-rated, "Ghost Dad," Universal is touting star Bill Cosby. 
Boasts Kornblit: "We have America's favorite dad." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, among the film's Father's Day promotional tie-ins, you'll find The Coz 
on the cover of The Sharper Image's Father's Day catalogue. And you can read 
all about his views on fatherhood in the June issue of Parenting magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, The Coz and his "Ghost Dad" movie family will put in a special appearance 
at the June 7 grand opening of Universal Studios in Orlando. "Like any good, 
healthy American family, they'll go on the rides," says Kornblit. PAT H.

OUTTAKES: DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pat H. Broeske 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olympic diving champ Greg Louganis is back in a bathing suit -- to play 
lifeguard and romantic interest to Traci Lords. It's for Abba Entertainment's 
"The Object of Desire," which just started filming in the Central American 
nation of Belize, with Lords as a soap opera queen on holiday, stalked by a 
crazed fan. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of four Olympic gold medals doesn't see any problem being teamed 
with a former porn star. "As far as I'm concerned, she's an actress. And I'm an 
actor. And I think we work well together," he says by phone from the Caribbean 
nation, adding, "She happens to be real sweet. I just had dinner with her last 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Now 30, Louganis has studied acting and dance, with stage experience dating 
back to childhood. (Last summer, he was Prince Charming in a Long Beach Civic 
Light Opera production of "Cinderella.") 
</P>
<P>
The role in "Object of Desire" is his biggest to date, following a bit part in 
a straight-to-video pic, "Dirty Laundry," and some TV game show appearances. 
He's nixed other film offers, he says, because "they wanted a body, I think, 
more than anything." 
</P>
<P>
But isn't he scantily clad as a lifeguard? "Yes, but there's more to this 
character than just a bathing suit. There's a relationship here. To be frank, 
I've been ready to make a transition -- from being an athlete -- for a long 
time. But most of the general public doesn't seem ready for me to make that 
transition. This is a kind of step." 
</P>
<P>
It's not unlike learning a new dive, he says: "It's terrifying. You're testing 
unknown waters." Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: NEW LINE BUCKS THE SUMMER ODDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
New Line Cinema, the little studio that proved it could -- by unleashing 
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" -- will attempt to make another splash this 
summer amid the waves of big-budget studio pictures with their mega-marketing 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
New Line's three summer entries: 
</P>
<P>
* "Metropolitan," the social comedy from new director Whit Stillman, about a 
group of upper-crust Manhattan debutantes and their dates. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times' Vincent Canby dubbed it the "unequivocal hit" of the 
Sundance U.S. Film Festival. "We'll definitely be using reviews to find our 
audiences, who'll be yuppies who want something different than crash-bang 
movies," says marketing president Sandra Ruch. 
</P>
<P>
* "Chicago Joe and the Showgirl," a period drama about the "Bonnie and 
Clyde"-type adventures of an American GI and a British showgirl, starring 
Kiefer Sutherland and Emily Lloyd. New Line looks forward to following 
Columbia's "Flatliners" and Fox's "Young Guns II" -- both of which co-star 
Sutherland. "If they're successful," says Ruch, "audiences will want to see 
more of Kiefer." 
</P>
<P>
* "Pump Up the Volume," stars Christian Slater as a high schooler who starts a 
pirate radio station. The company's widest release, it will open in 800 
theaters in late summer. New Line is working with teen magazines to help 
capture the targeted audience of 15- to 18-year-olds, with heartthrob Slater 
doing some interviews. There are also plans to exploit the film's pirate radio 
theme with radio station promotions. New Line is up against major competition 
and odds, but isn't worried. Says Ruch, "They don't call our company lean and 
green for nothing!" Pat H. Broeske

'DR. BOB' MAURER USES FAMILY COUNSELING SKILLS TO HELP ACTORS THROWN TOGETHER 
PERFORMANCE AFTER PERFORMANCE

Deborah Stack was caught in the middle of a real emotional storm. Actors in the 
long-running hit show "Tamara" wanted time off for TV and film jobs, but 
general manager Stack usually had to play the heavy and tell them "no" -- the 
show had to go on. As might be expected, that made some people in the "Tamara" 
family pretty unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
It was clearly another case for the theater shrink. 
</P>
<P>
On and off for five years now, 44-year-old Robert Maurer has set up shop in the 
dining room of "Tamara's" mock-Italian villa, using Il Vittoriale's elegant 
table and chairs for his sessions as the play's resident psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Bob," director of Behavioral Sciences for Santa Monica Hospital's Family 
Practice Residency Program, simply adapts a few of his marriage counseling 
skills to the problems that can arise when you throw creative people together 
for eight demanding performances a week. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, says Stack, "The actors thought management was unapproachable 
and management thought the actors were unapproachable. We sat down, we talked 
about the problem and we tried as much as possible to understand each other's 
point of view -- He got us working like a functional family." 
</P>
<P>
Most of us find work a relief from emotional pain, says Maurer, but actors, 
writers and other people in the arts instead "each day live the emotional 
element of the art they're creating or participating in. Their success or 
failure is judged publicly, and from the artist, writer or producers' point of 
view, often arbitrarily." 
</P>
<P>
That produces enormous stress, and after years of studying how successful 
people cope with stress, Maurer has come up with a stress management program 
tailored for people in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Indulging his own infatuation with the stage -- he's seen "The Phantom of the 
Opera" seven times -- he heads backstage here and elsewhere, counseling actors 
and theater companies alike. He supplements medical statistics and chimpanzee 
videos with quotes from director Harold Prince's autobiography, televised 
interviews with screenwriter Robert Towne and clips from such films as "Rain 
Man" and "Ordinary People." 
</P>
<P>
Participants in some of his classes and seminars have gone on to become therapy 
patients, says Maurer, but his theater clients never pay for treatment. His 
clients say he usually works just for expenses and sometimes even hangs around 
after performances to offer free on-the-spot counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"In many other professions, one reaches a level of status and income and can 
anticipate that going on indefinitely,"Maurer says. "But the actor, and 
particularly the theater actor, has to struggle continually with the threat of 
being out of a job. The control actors feel over the quantity and quality of 
their work, and the reception it gets, is also utterly and completely out of 
their control, and that's a hell of a way to live." 
</P>
<P>
Worse still, the stress doesn't always disappear with success. "You have to 
tolerate an extraordinary amount of failure to succeed in the arts or 
entertainment," says Maurer. "So when they finally succeed, some people start 
to self-destruct. Success triggers the alarm system and if you're not feeling 
entitled, or are a worrier, it will diminish your ability to enjoy success and 
may cripple your willingness to risk again. This town is full of people who 
created one successful screenplay." 
</P>
<P>
Maurer's full-time job at Santa Monica Hospital consists mainly of family 
counseling and training medical doctors to communicate better with their 
patients -- he does the show business work on the side. 
</P>
<P>
In his work, he has long focused on stress management, trying at first to 
reduce its impact with relaxation techniques, self-hypnosis and communication 
skills. Then one day, after reading how vaccines didn't come about until 
scientists began to study who didn't die during plagues, he felt psychology was 
making the same mistake by concentrating on people who were victims of stress 
rather than those who weren't. 
</P>
<P>
When reports came out saying that 40% of all air controllers had stress 
disorders, Maurer didn't concentrate on the 40%. He thought it was a miracle 
that 60% did not suffer from stress. "How did we decide cholesterol was bad for 
you?" he asks. "We looked at why the Japanese didn't get heart attacks. You 
look at who has the skill you want and what makes them different from you." 
</P>
<P>
In regard to stress, Maurer looks at those who handle it well in all aspects of 
their lives. "The people we are interested in understanding," says Maurer, "are 
those who stay healthy romantically, physically and vocationally." 
</P>
<P>
Combining scientific data with character studies gleaned from such sources as 
films, books, and newspaper articles, Maurer came up with four traits that 
successful people exhibit in dealing with stress. Successful people, he found, 
are good at giving and receiving attention and can relate to their fears 
honestly and effectively by asking for help. Their internal voices support them 
in risk-taking so they don't live in fear of making mistakes, and they have a 
vision of what they want and how to get it. (See box page 77.) 
</P>
<P>
Tailoring all this for show business audiences, he'll ask questions like: "How 
do you keep creative, inspired and energetic?" ( Answer: "Vision. There's no 
creativity when you're in doubt. Once we know what we want, life is easier.") 
His presentation includes statistics from Variety about the odds for success 
with Broadway musicals as well as commentary on how to ease the pain of romance 
or rejection by a director. 
</P>
<P>
Self-assured and amusing, Maurer keeps his lessons zipping along with analogies 
from his work at Santa Monica Hospital, his relationship with his parents, his 
dating experiences, his friends, even his cleaners. There's plenty of snappy 
patter and clever phrasing as he calls complaining "junk food attention" and 
duly notes such things as "the four f's that control your life -- fight, 
flight, food and sex." 
</P>
<P>
Well aware that it's a lot easier to look at errant behavior or defeatist 
attitudes on the big screen than in the bathroom mirror, Maurer also weaves in 
a great many film clips and videos. And whether he's addressing a theater 
company, a UCLA Extension class on character development for screenwriters, or 
even his UCLA Extension class on intimacy, his star visual is a video of 
"Ordinary People," a film "every therapist uses." 
</P>
<P>
Showing several scenes from that film, which depicts the effects on his 
immediate family when a young man drowns, Maurer points out how son Timothy 
Hutton denies his own needs, building up anger that later gets expressed 
inappropriately, while mother Mary Tyler Moore responds to her own fears by 
excessive criticism and distance. Moore and Hutton's behavior on screen 
exemplify two types of "internal parents," or injunctions we hear in our heads, 
but the kind of "internal parent" Maurer is after is one that encourages 
directness about being afraid and expressing needs. 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true in collaborative situations such as theater. At St. 
Petersburg's American Stage, which used rehearsal time for a mandatory staff 
workshop with Maurer, producing director John 
</P>
<P>
Berglund says "for those of us in the business of creating catharsis as our 
product, it was an invaluable tool . . . Now it's common to say in a staff 
meeting, 'what are you afraid of?' " 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles theater professionals express similar sentiments. "When I'm in a 
situation now where I don't have all the answers, he has given me permission to 
reach out to people who do," says actress Patricia Gaul, a co-founder of the 
Los Angeles Children's Theatre who attended a recent Maurer seminar sponsored 
by Los Angeles' Theater League Alliance. "I thought stress was inevitable if 
you're in an anxiety-ridden profession, but now I see it's not really chronic. 
You can do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Maurer's help is indirect, in fact. For instance, he encourages 
"Tamara's" actors to discuss their problems positively in front of each other 
so that they support one another rather than tear each other down. When one 
actor started handing his fellow cast members critical notes on their 
performances, Maurer couldn't get him "to come voluntarily to my Sunday night 
soires, so there was no way to help him with this behavior. But (I helped) the 
cast see him as afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Maurer says his only compensation for several years worth of regular visits to 
"Tamara" has been party invitations. He doesn't complain about that, but he 
does say that producers generally "have no incentive to treat their actors and 
actresses as inventory and make sure they are well cared for and well 
maintained. I have full access at 'Tamara,' but had I sent a bill, they would 
have laughed at me." 
</P>
<P>
Maurer's small, cluttered office at Santa Monica Hospital's Les Kelley Family 
Health Center reflects his vocational split. Theater programs blanket nearly 
every wall, but there are stuffed animals on the floor and couch, and the 
cassette sitting on top of his video monitor this time isn't "High Noon" or 
"Ordinary People" but rather a medical tape on depression. 
</P>
<P>
On several different occasions, Maurer ingenuously remarks about his feelings 
of giving back to the theater, a medium he feels he's gotten so much from. But 
he also says that the theater work gives him a break from harsh realities of 
his other work -- like the preteen boy who was sexually abusing his 
16-month-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
Raised in Los Angeles, Brooklyn-born Maurer got a bachelor's degree in 
psychology at UCLA, then worked as a probation officer in Van Nuys. The 
probation work "ignited" him about the impact of psychology, and he went back 
to college to get "some alphabet after my name." Emerging from the University 
of Houston three years later with a doctorate in psychology, he started his 
work in behavioral medicine in Fresno, where he began helping doctors work more 
sensitively with their patients. 
</P>
<P>
At Santa Monica Hospital, Maurer works with doctors and their patients, 
sometimes actually going into the examination room (with patients' permission) 
to take notes on the doctor's communication skills. He teaches doctors to 
identify risk factors and try to intervene before a person gets depressed, 
divorced or suicidal. And he helps doctors and patients alike treat tension 
headaches and obesity or cope with heart attacks or AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
His branching out to arts medicine was serendipitous. Longtime friend Stephen 
Albert, managing director of the Taper, persuaded him to bring his stress 
management findings to a major meeting here of the California Theatre Council 
in the mid-'80s. There was a good-sized audience, and his talk there led to 
work with the Chicago Theatre League that continues today. His timing was also 
good. Los Angeles psychologist Thomas Backer, for one, was already conducting 
stress management seminars for film actors and directors, while in recent 
years, health professionals in New York and elsewhere have begun banding 
together to treat the special medical and psychological problems of dancers, 
musicians, actors and others. 
</P>
<P>
Maurer readily admits that he gets plenty himself from his new sideline. For 
one thing, his private practice today is made up primarily of people in the 
business and technical sides of the arts. Moreover, he concedes, 'Where on the 
planet could I find people who live with fear more creatively than actors? They 
help me understand fear better and help me embellish the theory and 
techniques." 
</P>
<P>
Maurer also received considerable publicity after "Tamara" publicist Diane 
Carter persuaded him, she says, "that promotion of 'Tamara' and the theater 
doctor made for a good marriage." Although he says not a single call has come 
from all the media coverage, Carter's office also helped him get a few speaking 
engagements and, she says, "a lot of people are aware of him now and that this 
service exists." 
</P>
<P>
As each class and seminar ends, the man is swamped at the podium. After the 
Theater League Alliance seminar, for instance, actor Douglas Sills said "For 
me, it was an opportunity to have a well researched medicine man address 
problems from an artistic viewpoint unique to our business with empathy and 
understanding." 
</P>
<P>
Another seminar attendee, Fred Vicarel, producer-director of the long-running 
production, "Specific Hospital," says he's hoping Maurer will stop by to help 
solve some of their communication problems. And Theater League Alliance 
executive director Karen Rushfield says her organization hopes to sponsor a 
second seminar later this year. "Everyone was interested (last time)," she 
says, "but their time didn't allow it. I assume they're so stressed out they 
don't realize they need to step back and see what can help." 
</P>
<P>
Coming up soon for Maurer are a two-day workshop for writers at UCLA Extension, 
a talk to the Directors Guild and a trip to New Haven for work with Yale Drama 
School students and staff. Says Sharon Long, manager of the Florida 
Professional Theatres Assn.: "I'd bring him back every year if I could." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he's interested in getting into the arts himself, he shakes his head. 
"I get my acting urges expressed in my classes." He's currently working on a 
book about stress management, and continuing his research on the four skills of 
successful people. 
</P>
<P>
Over at "Tamara," meanwhile, "he's got us thinking about our lives and 
realizing you can change things," says general manager Stack, one of several 
people there who also sees Maurer individually. "All those personality traits 
that you thought you were stuck with can be changed, provided you want to go 
through all the work it takes. We want the show to be the best it can be, and 
it is better when the people working in and on it are the best they can be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Successful People: A Psychologist's List of Traits 
</P>
<P>
 Here are psychologist Robert Maurer's four traits of successful people: 
</P>
<P>
 1. An awareness of the biological need for attention or appreciation. They are 
able to both give and receive compliments and affection. 
</P>
<P>
2. An awareness and respect for the emotion of fear. In response to fear, they 
reach out for comfort, including both emotional nurturance and technical 
assistance. They relate to their fears directly and effectively. 
</P>
<P>
3. An "internal parent" that reassures them it is OK to make mistakes or be 
afraid or ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
4. A sense of mission that they can also draw on when afraid. They know their 
goals and their order of importance. They can stay passionate, excited and 
directed despite rejection or pain. They see their journey as special and 
important and are thus willing to see rejection as just another experience.

RECORD RACK: *** PRETENDERS "PACKED!" SIRE/WARNER BROS.: ALBUMS ARE RATED FROM 
ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).

A submissive Chrissie Hynde? About as likely as a repentant Ollie North. Even 
when rock's top tough cookie goes begging for love, as she does for the bulk of 
"Packed!," she retains her inherent dignity and independence. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy, not when she pleads with a man to take her home and "give me a 
sense of purpose," or pitches a marriage proposal in no uncertain terms ("Let's 
Make a Pact"). Learning to crawl, indeed. But harnessed to the simple, potent 
Pretenders music (guitarist Billy Bremner is the prevailing musical presence 
this time around) and carried on one of rock's glorious voices, these pleas 
take on the urgency of a quest for salvation. 
</P>
<P>
Like the last Pretenders album, 1986's "Get Close," melodic, mid-tempo tunes 
set the tone -- "Packed!" is not out to forge major new directions. Not that 
you need many when you have Hynde's voice front-and-center. 
</P>
<P>
On three pace-changing rockers she's clenched and agile, adding quirky little 
shapes to the melody lines. In the key ballads, though, she relies on an inner 
radiance. The free structure of "When Will I See You" brings out the best in 
her singing: an effortless union of emotion and instrument that expresses the 
ache of separation as winsomely as anything since Brian Wilson bared his soul 
on "Pet Sounds." RICHARD CROMELIN

ON THE TOWN: When you hear a band billed as the Legendary Grape, it can only 
mean one thing -- Moby Grape, one of the original flower-power pop bands that 
came out of San Francisco's psychedelic scene in the late '60s. Out of 
commission for years, the group recently reformed and has been writing new 
material and playing occasional live dates. 
</P>
<P>
You can see the group, which includes original members Bob Mosley, Peter Lewis, 
Jerry Miller and Don Stevenson, Thursday at the Coconut Teaszer. (It's a 
classic late-'60s bill -- Jackie Lomax will open the show). The Grape is also 
at the Belly Up in Solana Beach on Monday. . . . Remember the much-ballyhooed 
deal between Sam Kinison and the China Club, which had the heavyweight rock 
comic making a weekly appearance (as a singer) at the hip nightspot? Well -- 
it's history. In fact, Kinison popped up last week at Spice, the China Club's 
arch-rival, where he did his usual "Wild Thing" jam session. The most 
encouraging new twist: Kinison and his cronies, who included Julian Lennon and 
actor Christian Slater, hung out backstage, contentedly guzzling bottles of . . 
. Evian water.

SCREEN GEMS: Warren Beatty may be directing "Dick Tracy," but our favorite new 
actor-turned-director is Kiefer Sutherland, who'll be at the helm of the next 
Jude Cole video, "House Full of Reasons." One reason to watch for the clip: 
It'll feature a guest appearance by Sutherland's current paramour, actress 
Julia Roberts. . . . Serious Rock Fans should keep their eyes peeled for a sly 
visual joke in the upcoming "Back to the Future III." 
</P>
<P>
In a sequence that takes Michael J. Fox back to the Wild West of the 1880s, we 
see a scraggly, bearded clump of musicians playing at a raucous hoedown. The 
beards aren't fake -- the band is none other than ZZ Top, who pluck some old 
Western-style tunes (and even offer a trademark spin of their guitars). The 
guys can also be heard performing a new rock tune, "Double Back," on the film's 
sound track. . . . And we're betting that Columbus, Ohio's WMGG-FM must have 
heard that Led Zeppelin recently reunited for Jason Bonham's wedding (the 
surviving members of the group, with Jason on drums, played "Rock &amp; Roll," 
"Custard Pie" and "Bring It on Home"). Maybe that's why -- as a programming 
stunt -- the station debuted its new classic-rock format earlier this month by 
playing "Stairway to Heaven" nonstop for . . . 16 consecutive hours!

POP EYE: DAVID LEE ROTH: GETTING DOWN TO YOUR BASIC ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're planning to vacation in Vancouver, Canada, this year, David Lee Roth 
has a few tips. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to recapture the bawdy sound of his early albums with Van Halen, hard 
rock's most mischievous sex symbol (and self-promoter) is in Vancouver 
recording a new album with hot-shot producer Bob Rock. But it's not the album 
that's causing a stir -- it's Roth's hotel accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you could say this place is a combination of New York's 42nd Street 
and the gorilla exhibit at the L.A. Zoo," said Roth, calling from a phone on 
the fourth floor of the Nelson Place Hotel in downtown Vancouver. "The only 
view I have out my window is of a hotel room next door that reminds me of the 
place in 'Taxi Driver' where De Niro kept saying, 'Are you talking to me? Are 
you talking to me?' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a perfect place to make a rock 'n' roll record. The whole neighborhood 
has a kind of Yukon Gold Rush feel to it. I've been to nine different strip 
joints, all within walking distance of the hotel. We've got a welfare office 
around the corner. Porno stores. Korean delis. Bootleg T-shirt shops. And 
there's a strip joint in the basement called Champagne Charlie's, though it has 
a lot more to do with Charlie than it does champagne." 
</P>
<P>
Roth admits that on his first Vancouver trip he stayed in a plush, rock-royalty 
spot. "It was a typical 12-star place with monograms in the ashtrays and people 
who called you sir. But it was all wrong. So we decided to find the place with 
the most character -- and the sleaziest lobby." 
</P>
<P>
Roth says his band has taken over the entire fourth floor of the Nelson Place, 
which boasts room rates even the scruffiest young rockers could afford. "We're 
paying $15 a night, with one towel each, but no life insurance," he said. "When 
I first arrived I expected to see Tom Waits working the desk." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Roth kept the hotel's identity a secret. But since a local rock 
station revealed the hotel's name, it's become a popular pit-stop for Roth fans 
who crowd the lobby, eager to meet the singer. "We've had a ton of kids here 
lately," he said with a laugh. "But that's the way it goes -- you buy the land, 
you get the Indians." 
</P>
<P>
Roth expects to spend another month in Vancouver, finishing up the album. He 
says it's a departure from his previous solo efforts, which have cast him more 
as a hipster crooner than the outrageous hard-rock warrior he made famous with 
Van Halen. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea behind staying here is that your environment has an impact on your 
music. It all stacks up in your subconscious. So we're going for real roots 
rock. The record's going to be completely original songs. It'll probably sound 
a lot like -- well -- the first Van Halen album." 
</P>
<P>
Roth refused to divulge more details. "Hey, my music is best understood by 
small children and animals. No one's gonna build a monument for me. I just make 
it up as I go along."

This is a psychedelic version of one of those insufferably soothing New Age 
videos that feature serene nature scenes accompanied by tranquil instrumental 
music. 
</P>
<P>
In this half-hour video, colorful, constantly-changing geometric shapes pulse 
and cavort to the rhythms of melodic old Moody Blues tunes, like "Nights in 
White Satin." As a psychedelic light show, it's often mesmerizing -- certainly 
much more exciting than those boring New Age videos. The problem, though, is 
those bland Moody Blues oldies, which are probably only of interest to those 
feeling nostalgic about the hippie era. The best way to watch this video is to 
turn down the sound and add your own soundtrack. DENNIS HUNT

Don't expect a detailed discussion of the artistic merits in each of the nearly 
3,000 career sketches in this sprawling, 1,378-page overview of 20th Century 
musicians and songwriters. The judgments are generally sound, but rarely run 
more than a sentence or two. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of this excellent reference work is its comprehensiveness. Where 
most pop encyclopedias limit their focus to one or two fields, this one treats 
with equal respect artists from rock, folk, jazz, blues, soul, country, even a 
touch of World Beat. Equally important, the listings aren't limited to figures 
from the modern pop era. The Jones entries alone document the book's range. 
Among the Joneses: Elvin, George and Grace . . . to Grandpa, Hank and Howard . 
. . to Isham, Philly Joe and Quincy . . . to Rickie Lee, Spike and Tom. ROBERT

ART WORLD: HER ART HELPS OTHERS BACK NEA FUNDING AT PHOTO STUDIES CENTER

FACES 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard that between 20% and 40% (of letters written to members of the 
Reauthorization Committee of the National Endowment for the Arts) are against 
the NEA, I just freaked and decided, hey, this is really important. If we don't 
do something now, it will be too late," said artist and independent curator 
Karen Atkinson, who has taken the current NEA debate to heart by creating a 
pro-reauthorization installation in the Los Angeles Center for Photographic 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson's installation, "Art Protection Services, Karen Atkinson and 
Associates, ARTtorneys for Art," is certainly not your typical art exhibition. 
In fact, a newcomer walking into LACPS might not even know he was entering an 
art space. That's because, thanks to Atkinson, the gallery has become a mock 
lawyer's office set up to fight censorship and other First Amendment issues. 
</P>
<P>
Included in Atkinson's office are her extensive files of clippings on NEA 
issues, a bookshelf filled with red, white and blue books on "all the things an 
ARTtorney would need to know to defend art," and Atkinson's "degrees" from 
Artists' State University and Los Angeles School of Artists at Law. Also 
included are artworks featuring wordings from Article I of Congress and the 
Official Secrets Act, a looming American Flag and a rack of about 40 different 
postcards created by 20 artists for gallery-goers to sign and send to members 
of the Reauthorization Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of people that support this issue; but how many people have time 
to sit down and write 42 letters?" Atkinson explained. "Here, we have 
everything available to you at cost -- the (pro-reauthorization) postcards, the 
mailing labels, the stamps -- so people can do in a couple of minutes what it 
would take them days to do at home. I'm hoping it will help, especially since 
the people that are fighting against the NEA are so organized." 
</P>
<P>
As Atkinson tells it, the practical aspects of this exhibition -- getting as 
many postcards as possible signed and sent in to committee members by the time 
the exhibition closes June 15 -- are much more important that the art. But 
that's the whole idea, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something that would really make a difference," said Atkinson, 
34, a CalArts graduate who now teaches at her alma mater. "There's always the 
old saying, and my students always say, 'Art doesn't make a difference; it 
doesn't do any good.' But I'm hoping that it does."

A man in his mid-20s wearing horned-rimmed glasses, talking to an equally 
yuppified female while admiring Rauschenbergs at the Gemini G.E.L. gallery on 
Melrose Avenue at a reception for the Tricia Brown Dance Company: "You know," 
he said looking around the room at older people eyeing the art, sipping white 
wine and talking of their collections, "I won't feel comfortable at these 
things until I'm a collector myself. And that means after the Wharton M.B.A."

Look out for a sleeping dog. Noted Santa Monica-based artist Laddie John Dill 
is offering a reward for the sculpture "Sleeping Dog," which was stolen from 
the walled sculpture garden at his home in early May. The bronze piece, by L.A. 
artist Gwynn Murrill, a personal friend of Dill, is worth $25,000. Pat Faure of 
the Asher/Faure Gallery, which represents Dill, said the artist wants dealers 
to be aware that the sculpture is at large in case they encounter someone 
trying to sell it. Anyone with information can call Asher/Faure at (213) 
271-3665.

The ears as well as the eyes will confront AIDS issues when poetry readings 
accompany an art exhibit at the L.A. Municipal Art Gallery in Barnsdall Art 
Park. The poetry is written by eight Los Angeles poets whose lives and works 
have been affected by the disease. The poets will read their works in a program 
called "A Fury of Words" on May 26 and June 9. The readings, by Mark Haile, Bia 
Lowe, Gil Cuadros and others go along with the dual art exhibit, "The 
Indomitable Spirit" and "Raging at the Visible: AIDS in the City of Angles," 
which runs until June 24 at the gallery, 4800 Hollywood Blvd. Information: 
(213) 485-4581. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ETC. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the L.A. Municipal Art Gallery exhibition of the same 
title, "The Indomitable Spirit," a new limited edition portfolio of 10 
previously unpublished photographs is available in Los Angeles at BlumHelman 
Gallery. The portfolio features works by John Baldessari, Chuck Close, Jan 
Groover, Annette Lemieux, Duane Michals, Richard Prince, Robert Rauschenberg, 
Cindy Sherman, Bruce Weber and William Wegman, and is available in an edition 
of 50 plus 15 artist's proofs. Proceeds from sales of the portfolio, available 
in a number of galleries nationwide, benefit the American Foundation for AIDS 
Research and the National Community AIDS Partnership.

Los Angeles-based sculptor and media artist Barbara McCarren has been selected 
as the first artist to have work acquired by the L.A. County Museum of Art 
under the Marvin B. Meyer Family Endowment. Income from the $50,000 endowment, 
established in 1989, will provide for the acquisition of one work by an 
emerging artist from the Los Angeles area each year. For the first acquisition, 
McCarren will create a new work to be installed this summer. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. artists who want to say it on a billboard can submit their work to the 
third annual ArtBulletin Program by June 29. Judges will select three artists 
whose work will be reproduced on 14-by-48-foot billboards. The billboard spaces 
will be donated by Patrick Media Group Inc., which is co-sponsoring the program 
with LACE. Since the billboards will be on city streets for public viewing, a 
spokeswoman for the contest reminds artists to do something that uses the 
outdoor medium and catches the attention of people driving by. Each winner will 
receive a $750 honorarium. Last year's winning billboards included one by 
artist May Sun depicting the student demonstration in China's Tian An Men 
Square. Information: (213) 731-5111. 
</P>
<P>
Artists interested in workin' on the railway can contact the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission by June 15. The commission is searching for one 
artist to create a permanent work for the Metro Blue Line tunnel, which will go 
from under Flower Street to the 7th Street station. Artists should plan on 
incorporating light and reflective materials and creating an installation 
designed for a moving audience. The budget for the project is $325,000. Artists 
may work alone or in teams. Information: (213) 236-9556.

Art gets down to earth as ART/LA90 joins with the Natural Resources Defense 
Council in a project called "Art for Earth's Sake." The sponsors of the annual 
ART/LA90 event in Los Angeles have announced a liaison with the environmental 
action group, and has selected the organization as the beneficiary for the 1990 
Gala Preview to be held in December at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
Artists, collectors and galleries will participate.

THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
The glowing letter "W" sits atop the Woman's Building as a rallying point for 
women. "In a few short strokes, I tried to distill what I see as a 
representation of women," said artist Eve King-Lehman of her colorful and 
grand-scaled sculpture. "I came up with the letter as the first letter of the 
word woman, of course, but it also stands for the West, where we are, which 
gives off an exploratory kind of energy." 
</P>
<P>
King-Lehman's piece is part of the face-lift the building at 1727 N. Spring St. 
received when three works were added to its exterior as part of the "Gilding 
the Building" project last week. She was chosen to adorn the building's walls 
along with artists Norma D'Andrea and Barbara Romain by jurors Sheila De 
Bretteville and Betye Saar. 
</P>
<P>
King-Lehman created a work that "reflected how the Woman's Building sees 
itself." To the artist, the building feels full of "explosive energy. And it 
has a strong connection to nature." As a result, she said she used colors from 
nature -- deep blues and earthy tones -- within the W. 
</P>
<P>
She illuminated her W with florescent lights to attract attention to it. "It's 
bright so I could easily share it with all women, and with the outside world 
who passes the building," she said of her first public commission. 
</P>
<P>
"And the lines of the W, which arch up from the building to the sky, symbolize 
a positive future for women," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Artist D'Andrea's piece is also devoted to the future. Located at the entrance 
to the building, it's a three-paneled etched glass structure of an artist 
drawing in front of a planet while she maps out her future. 
</P>
<P>
Romain has done a frieze that runs across the entire building. The piece, 
called "Las Angelinas," was a community project put together by local woman 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the Woman's Building . . . let Imogen Cunningham, the 20th-Century 
photographer, tell you about her works in her own voice. In a film by her 
granddaughter, filmmaker Meg Partridge, Cunningham discusses her photos. The 
28-minute film is based on interviews with Cunningham when she was in her late 
80s. "Portrait of Imogen" can be seen in the Video Gallery until June 30.

NOTEBOOK: FOUR SEASONS LOSES CHEF; METRO CLOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chef Seppi Renggli's recent (and surprise) departure from the Four Seasons 
isn't the only big news on the New York restaurant scene these days. Metro, the 
2-year-old, Upper East Side showcase for chef Patrick Clark, has gone out of 
business too. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got hit by the kind of slump that's going on in New York right now," 
Clark said. "We were very busy every night at prime time, between about 7:30 
and 9 p.m., but not before or after that -- and basically, with our overhead, 
we needed to fill the restaurant more of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Clark has no immediate plans and said, "it's all just up in the air right now." 
</P>
<P>
Metro was designed by Adam Tihany, who recently opened a version of his New 
York Remi in Santa Monica (see stories on page 98). 
</P>
<P>
Hubert's, another sophisticated Tihany-designed restaurant on the Upper East 
Side, is about to close too -- but only temporarily (weekends in July and the 
month of August), and for strictly seasonal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Hubert's chef and co-owner, Len Allison, will run a summertime restaurant on 
Shelter Island, between the north and south forks of Long Island. "It'll be 
very health-oriented," he says, "with lots of seafood -- very light." The site 
is the recently renovated Chequit Inn, an old Victorian mansion on a hilltop 
overlooking the water, and the restaurant will be open from Memorial Day 
through the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Allison, who has previously discussed the possibility of opening a 
spa-type restaurant somewhere in Southern California, plans to tour Arizona, 
starting with the Scottsdale area, "to see how I feel about the place." He's 
still definitely considering what he calls "this whole inn/resort-style 
restaurant concept -- if not in California, then close by." 
</P>
<P>
In other New York restaurant news, executive chef Geoffrey Zakarian, sous-chef 
Patrick Robertson and pastry chef Melissa DeMayo exited en masse from the 
recently opened (and well-reviewed) Restaurant 44 at Manhattan's Royalton 
Hotel. They are said to be looking for a restaurant location of their own. And 
Alain Sailhac -- former longtime chef at Le Cirque and briefly Zakarian's boss 
at the "21" Club -- has left his highly-publicized post as executive chef at 
the Plaza Hotel. He has reportedly returned to France. 
</P>
<P>
TIP TOPPING: A familiar old canard about restaurant tipping showed up in a 
"Dear Abby" column in this newspaper recently. In response to a letter from a 
restaurant chef complaining because he (or she) didn't get a cut of waiters' 
tips, Abby asked three top L.A. restaurateurs for their opinions on the subject 
-- Bruce Vanderhoff of Le Restaurant, Jimmy Murphy of Jimmy's, and a third who 
wished to remain anonymous. All three basically defended the system by which 
chefs receive salaries commensurate (at least theoretically) with their talent 
and experience, while waiters are rewarded on a check-by-check basis by the 
diners they serve. But the anonymous restaurateur added, "In most European 
countries, the gratuity is included in the cost of the meal. This covers the 
preparation as well as the serving. I feel certain that if the choice were up 
to diners, they too would prefer to do away with tipping." 
</P>
<P>
I call this a canard because it is simply not true that individual tipping has 
been done away with in Europe. An obligatory service charge -- which can be 
anything from 8% to 25%, depending on the country and the nature of the 
establishment -- is indeed added automatically to checks in most of Europe, 
even in bars and cafes. 
</P>
<P>
This is so institutionalized a practice, in fact, that the service charge is 
often included in the price of items ordered and not added as a supplement. But 
both customers at elegant restaurants and regulars at casual bistros or cafes 
almost invariably supplement this service charge with some extra cash. 
</P>
<P>
At an upscale restaurant in France, for instance, it is common to leave an 
additional 5% to 10% of the total amount (which, remember, already includes a 
service charge). You won't necessarily be scorned if you don't -- but you'll 
probably get more attention next time if you do. 
</P>
<P>
If automatic service charges were indeed to be widely implemented in this 
country, I guarantee that diners who are already generous tippers would add 
something on the side -- while those who are not generous would doubtless 
grouch all the way home about having been forced to ante up 15% or so against 
their will. 
</P>
<P>
TABLE SCRAPS: Bice Pomodoro on La Cienega is, as the large sign outside informs 
passers-by, "Closed for Remodeling." The owners hope to reopen the restaurant 
soon, says a spokesman, "with a whole new concept."

ACCUSED RINGLEADER ACQUITTED IN RACIAL MURDER

<P>
The accused ringleader of a white mob that killed a black teen-ager and 
inflamed already heated racial tensions in the nation's largest city was 
acquitted Friday of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Mondello, 19, was cleared of all murder and manslaughter counts but 
convicted of lesser charges in the fatal shooting Aug. 23 of Yusuf Hawkins, 16, 
whose death became New York City's most explosive racial case in years. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict came a day after a separate jury convicted the triggerman, Joseph 
Fama, of murder in the killing last summer in the predominantly white Brooklyn 
neighborhood of Bensonhurst. 
</P>
<P>
Mondello, who stood with tears streaming down his face, was found guilty of 
riot, weapons possession and a series of lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom erupted into pandemonium as the verdict was announced in state 
Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The Mondello family embraced in tears as the Hawkins 
family shouted at them. One said, "You'll get yours." 
</P>
<P>
A second jury Thursday convicted Mondello's co-defendant, Fama, 19, of 
second-degree murder for showing "depraved indifference to human life" for 
being part of the attack in which Hawkins was shot twice and died on the 
street. Fama had been accused of being the gunman but was acquitted of 
intentional murder. 
</P>
<P>
Mondello's attorney, Stephen Murphy, said, "I think Mr. Mondello was happy with 
the verdict. But when a young man's dead and another young man's in jail for 
murder, I don't think there's any winners." 
</P>
<P>
Mondello faces one to four years in jail. His bail was revoked after the 
verdict and he was to be sent directly to jail. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, two groups of demonstrators numbering about 150 marched to the back of 
the courthouse, overturned and ripped up four blue police barricades, and 
scattered parts of them onto the courthouse steps and onto cars. Angry 
demonstrators shouted, "We're going to burn Bensonhurst, to burn it down. Burn, 
baby, burn!" With raised fists they shouted, "Yusuf, Yusuf, no peace, no 
justice!" They threatened a boycott of white businesses in the city. 
</P>
<P>
A free-lance photographer was injured in the melee. 
</P>
<P>
As jury forewoman Mimi Snowden announced the first "not guilty," Mondello's 
father, Michael, screamed out, "Oh, thank God" and began to sob hysterically. 
</P>
<P>
"It's God! It's Jesus! Jesus has risen!," the elder Mondello exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the aisle, relatives and supporters of the Hawkins family 
screamed, pointed at the jurors and shouted threats. 
</P>
<P>
"He did it, he did it!" several of them screamed as the verdicts were read by 
Snowden. 
</P>
<P>
Two people were ejected from the courtroom for their outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
Mondello and Fama were the first of eight young men to be tried in the slaying 
that triggered months of bitter racial demonstrations, marches and vigils -- 
all in the midst of last year's mayoral race. 
</P>
<P>
The killing fueled accusations of bigotry, and the trial, which coincided with 
several other racially divisive incidents, heightened tension to the point that 
Mayor David Dinkins went on television to appeal for calm. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument, Assistant Dist. Atty. Paul Burns said Mondello 
organized the white mob that stalked the black youths, encircled Hawkins and 
left him dying on the street after he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Does one of these guys stick around to help Yusuf Hawkins?" Burns asked. "No. 
They all run. Like a mob they came, like a mob they left. Group courage masking 
individual cowardice." 
</P>
<P>
Mondello, his hands crossed on the defense table, looked skyward and began 
crying as the verdict was read. After the announcement on the final count, he 
hugged his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Mondello was found guilty of riot, three counts of unlawful imprisonment, three 
counts of menacing, four counts of discrimination, and one count of weapons 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
In the hours before last August's attack, about 30 young white men, many armed 
with baseball bats, had gathered near the home of Gina Feliciano, Mondello's 
former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony during the trial, Mondello and Feliciano argued after 
she told him she was dating black and Hispanic youths and said she had invited 
a group of them to her 18th birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
According to the defense, the dispute between Mondello and Feliciano escalated 
after she told him some of her new friends were coming into the neighborhood to 
beat him up, and he recruited his friends and armed them with the bats. 
</P>
<P>
As the gang of youths milled about the street, Hawkins and three black friends 
came into the neighborhood to look at a used car. The mob mistook them for the 
rumored group of Feliciano's friends and attacked. 
</P>
<P>
In the melee, four shots rang out, and Hawkins fell mortally wounded on the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the most damaging evidence against Mondello was a statement 
he gave to police shortly after the killing. In it, he described recruiting his 
neighborhood friends for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Feliciano testified that Mondello bragged about getting ready to attack any 
blacks who came to her birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
A neighborhood woman testified that she saw the mob run by seconds before the 
attack on Hawkins, with Mondello in the lead.

LITHUANIA RULES OUT SUSPENSION OF SECESSION LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lithuanians searched Saturday for concessions to offer Mikhail S. Gorbachev as 
a way of opening talks with the Soviet leadership but ruled out suspending 
their declaration of independence, which virtually ensures that crippling 
Kremlin economic sanctions against them will continue. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting to an emergency session of the Lithuanian parliament, Kazimiera 
Prunskiene, the breakaway republic's prime minister, summed up talks she held 
in Moscow with Gorbachev. Then deputies debated proposals they hope will bring 
Soviet authorities to the bargaining table to end a two-month-old stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
Though no formal vote was taken, lawmakers concurred that "there can be no 
question" of suspending the independence declaration they approved March 11, 
Arvidas Ryabchis, a spokesman in the Parliament's Information Bureau, said by 
telephone from the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
The March 11 declaration set off the crisis with Moscow. Unless the Lithuanians 
reverse themselves or there is a dramatic shift in the position of Gorbachev, 
who has repeatedly said the proclamation is illegal under Soviet law, the war 
of nerves over Lithuania's right to unilaterally proclaim its independence 
seems certain to continue. 
</P>
<P>
In a dispatch printed earlier on the front pages of Soviet newspapers, the 
official Tass news agency said the bottom line of the Kremlin's position is 
"the indispensable necessity that the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet (Parliament) 
cancel -- or at a minimum, suspend -- this act (the independence declaration) 
and all the legislative measures following it that contradict the Soviet 
constitution." 
</P>
<P>
In her remarks in Parliament, Prunskiene acknowledged that Gorbachev, who met 
with her Thursday, was still pressing for suspension of the independence 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
According to Edward Tuskenis, another Information Bureau spokesman, Prunskiene 
said suspension would be too risky because it would juridically return 
Lithuania to the status of a "Soviet socialist republic" that it had for 50 
years after annexation by the Kremlin in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
"What the deputies will do is review laws passed since March 11 and see which 
can be suspended," Tuskenis said. Gorbachev has specifically objected to laws 
establishing separate Lithuanian identity cards and annulling mandatory Soviet 
military service, and to the alleged confiscation of Communist Party property. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian deputies adjourned Saturday night without making a formal 
decision. They are to reconvene Monday to hear legal experts and reports from 
economists on the damage done by the Soviet economic sanctions imposed in 
April. The Parliament, officially called the Supreme Council, is to consider 
several drafts of concessions it might offer the Soviet leadership, and 
Prunskiene sounded optimistic that the proposals would win Moscow's agreement 
for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"To my mind, all possible effort has been made from our side," she told 
state-run Soviet television. "This may be taken into account, and next week we 
may move closer to further discussions on the entire complex of problems 
related to the restoration of Lithuanian statehood by means of compromises and 
a transitional period." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who met Friday with Prunskiene in the 
Soviet capital, expressed support here for Lithuania's "hopes and aspirations 
for independence" and again called for dialogue between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference, Baker denied a published report that he had 
pressed the Lithuanians to suspend their independence declaration, saying, 
"That is not for me to do." He also recalled that the United States has never 
recognized the absorption of Lithuania and its two Baltic neighbors, Latvia and 
Estonia, by the regime of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
"The exact course that they follow is up to them to determine -- and regardless 
of what that course is, they are certain to have the support of the United 
States of America, as they have had (in) the past," Baker said of the 
Lithuanians.

Last month, Gorbachev imposed a cutoff in Soviet oil supplies to the republic 
of 3.8 million people, as well as large-scale reductions in natural gas 
deliveries, as a way to throttle the independence drive. Prunskiene said that 
in their talks, Gorbachev threatened even tougher sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Soviet television reported that an oil-fired power station in 
Lithuania now has only enough fuel for two more days of operations, and that 
industries were warned that electricity could be switched off at any time. 
Prunskiene has also said that half the Soviet rail shipments bound for her 
republic are being sidetracked elsewhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
As deputies pondered what concessions to offer Moscow, pro-secession forces 
rallied on what is now called Independence Square in Vilnius, waving the 
republic's yellow-red-green flag.

<P>
Andy Gustafson wears two wedding rings: one from his new marriage and one from 
the marriage that ended in murder. 
</P>
<P>
Two and a half years ago, Gustafson, 36, a small-town lawyer, came home to find 
his wife raped and shot to death. Their two children had been drowned in 
bathtubs. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old neighbor arrested two days later is serving life in prison 
without parole for the murders. He apparently had been in the house when 
Priscilla Gustafson and her son got home; the little girl was killed when she 
came home later. 
</P>
<P>
"I was too afraid of going to look for my children because I was afraid I'd 
find them dead," Gustafson said of that day. "It was so shocking and 
unbelievable. I screamed. I wailed." 
</P>
<P>
Except for the moving eulogy he delivered at his family's funeral and his 
testimony at the murder trial, Gustafson has remained out of the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
He has not remained a victim, however. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1, 1989, a date chosen to signify beginning, Gustafson married Carol, a 
42-year-old widow. They have known each other since they were married to others 
and both couples attended Townsend Congregational Church. Carol's first husband 
died of a brain tumor in 1984, after 15 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly would have been much more difficult without her," Andy said, 
sitting in his book-lined study. "I don't know whether I would have made it or 
not, without her. Now I have a reason to get up in the morning, something to 
live for." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than try to erase the past, they make it a point to remember. Both wear 
two wedding bands, their new ones on their left hands and their original ones 
on their right hands. 
</P>
<P>
At their wedding, Carol's first husband's father gave her away. Andy's dead 
wife's brother sang. Carol's matron of honor was her former sister-in-law. They 
had two ministers with ties to both of their first spouses. 
</P>
<P>
"Your life is about your relationships. When you lose them, you lose your life 
in a way," Andy said. "You either get stuck or you go on and make a new life." 
</P>
<P>
They both considered whether they might be remarrying too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a few people in this town that were just aghast," said Carol, a 
warm, petite brunette, "but when you've gone through this kind of loss, you're 
just glad the sun is shining every day. Life becomes more precious to you. We 
didn't want to waste it." 
</P>
<P>
They live in Carol's 10-room, yellow clapboard Colonial on Townsend Common, the 
center of this picture-book New England town about 45 miles northwest of 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The house is three doors from the church where the Gustafson family's funeral 
took place and where Andy and Carol were married, and just a few hundred yards 
from Hillside Cemetery, where Priscilla and the children are buried. 
</P>
<P>
Andy has resumed practicing law at his office just across the Common. 
</P>
<P>
Starting over has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
His life was shattered in the late afternoon of Dec. 1, 1987. He had just 
closed a big real estate deal and phoned Priscilla, 33, to see if she could 
find a sitter so they could go out to dinner and celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
When no one answered the phone, Andy drove the mile to the rustic house, which 
is on an isolated knoll in the woods. He saw Priscilla's car in the driveway, 
but the house was eerily dark. 
</P>
<P>
He found his wife, who was 33 and several months pregnant, dead in their 
bedroom. She had been sexually assaulted and shot twice in the head. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't remember everything that happened just after that. The trauma was 
such that he couldn't sleep through the night for six months. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers going into the kitchen to call the police and his parents. He was 
too afraid to look for the children because he feared that he would find them 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
When the police arrived, Andy sat in one of their cruisers. An officer came out 
and told him that his daughter, Abigail, 7, and son, William, 5, were dead. 
They had been drowned. 
</P>
<P>
"You lose total track of time," he said. "The shock gives you the adrenaline to 
get through it at first, but then it wears off." 
</P>
<P>
After the murders, Andy moved in with his parents. He rented an apartment in 
Townsend, but within a few months moved back to his house. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to emotionally reclaim it," he said. "I had to go back in there and be 
all right. The house became a source of strength for me, with the memories of 
my family. The love that occurred there was much stronger than the death 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The first months were difficult, although dinner invitations from thoughtful 
friends helped, Andy said. He joined a support group for survivors of homicide 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a roller coaster with no highs, just different depths," he said. "It's a 
struggle just to get through each day. 
</P>
<P>
"First you sob all the time. Then you set goals. Like, you say, 'Today, I'm 
going to go shopping.' You don't want to go out and deal with people, but then 
you go ahead and feel better because you did it." 
</P>
<P>
Self-pity was not his strong suit. 
</P>
<P>
"You always think, 'Why me?' But you realize soon enough, 'Why not me?' If you 
live with your eyes open, you know life isn't fair." 
</P>
<P>
He gravitated to Carol, who understood better than most in their circle of 
friends from church what it meant to lose someone. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, they both said, they have talked out their grief. Andy, in 
particular, still has bad days. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart grieves for him," Carol said about those times. "All I can do is hold 
him and tell him I love him." 
</P>
<P>
Andy said the hardest part was losing his children. He said he has had dreams 
about his first wife and each child. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of them came to me in individual dreams and told me they were all right," 
he said. "It made me believe in an afterlife. That helped me accept their 
deaths a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Carol said Andy has made her dream of having a family again a reality. They 
hope to adopt a child. 
</P>
<P>
"That would make the circle complete," Carol said.

ARMS DIVERSION TO COLOMBIA CLOUDS ANTIGUA RULING FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
CARIBBEAN: ISRAEL ACCUSES THE ISLAND PRIME MINISTER'S SON OF ORDERING WEAPONS 
THAT ENDED UP IN THE HANDS OF THE COCAINE CARTEL.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A scandal over the shipment of Israeli arms to a Colombian drug lord has become 
a political bombshell in this tourist haven, where the ruling family has 
weathered previous scandals. 
</P>
<P>
The island gained international notoriety in the late 1970s for allowing the 
testing of weapons for South Africa. It was in the news again in the early 
1980s for harboring fugitive American financier Robert Vesco. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Israel has accused Prime Minister Vere Bird's eldest son, Vere Jr., 54, of 
ordering weapons for Antigua's 80-man army that mysteriously ended up in the 
hands of Colombia's Medellin drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Vere Jr., a Cabinet minister, has denied wrongdoing but resigned his Cabinet 
post pending the outcome of a judicial inquiry, the equivalent of a U.S. grand 
jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Another son of the prime minister, Lester, 52, deputy prime minister and 
sometime rival of his older brother, is spearheading the local investigation, 
shrugging off any possible conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Bird family, which has dominated the island's politics for more than three 
decades and grown wealthy while doing it, has long been accused of corruption 
in connection with developing the island's booming tourist industry. But this 
affair, with its suggestion of a government link with the sinister world of 
international drug trafficking and gunrunning, is a bombshell by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"This latest one shocked us to the core," said Anglican Archbishop Orland 
Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Hector, a leftist opposition leader, said he thought the nation could be in 
danger of a coup if the prime minister's son were charged. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we are teetering on the brink . . . of a possible military seizure 
of power and control by Vere Bird (Jr.)," he said. Vere Jr. is said to command 
the army's loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Israel said it had shipped weapons to the Caribbean island in April, 
1989, on the understanding they would be used exclusively by the Antigua 
Defense Force. 
</P>
<P>
Israel said the arms were ordered by Vere Jr., who identified himself as the 
minister of national security. No such ministry exists, but Vere Jr. acts 
informally as his father's national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
The Antiguan investigation determined that the weapons arrived here on April 
24, 1989, and were shipped the same day to Santa Marta, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian officials say soldiers found 232 Israeli-made weapons in February 
during a search of ranches seized from Gonzalo Rodrigues Gacha, a reputed 
kingpin of the Medellin cartel who was killed in a December gun battle with 
police. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons included machine guns, submachine guns, assault rifles, pistols, 
shoulder-fired rockets and infrared night scopes. 
</P>
<P>
The Outlet, a weekly newspaper published by Hector's Antigua Caribbean 
Liberation Movement, said the weapons deal was arranged by two Israelis, 
Maurice Sarfati and Col. Yair Klein. 
</P>
<P>
Sarfati, a former Israeli army officer, once operated a melon farm in Antigua 
but went bankrupt and reportedly is being sought by U.S. authorities for 
defaulting on $1.3 million in loans. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian officials have accused Klein, a reserve officer in the Israeli army, 
of organizing, training and equipping paramilitary groups, and declared him a 
fugitive from justice. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said in Israel that the arms shipment was originally intended for a 
training school he wanted to set up in Antigua for Panamanian rebels opposed to 
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who was ousted by U.S. forces last December. 
</P>
<P>
When plans for the school fell through, Klein said, the Panamanians wanted the 
weapons shipped to Panama, but somehow they were diverted to Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Many questions remain, among them whether anyone in the Antiguan government was 
aware the arms shipment was headed for Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
In Antigua, a former British colony of 80,000 only nine miles wide and 12 miles 
long, the government is largely a function of one family, the Birds. 
</P>
<P>
Vere Bird Sr., the 80-year-old prime minister, rose to prominence in the 1930s 
as a union organizer in the days of colonial sugar plantations and has led the 
nation all but five of the last 34 years. His Antigua Labor Party controls 15 
of the 17 seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Vere Jr. is minister of public works and communication. Lester, the deputy 
prime minister, is leader of the ruling party and minister of foreign affairs, 
economic development, tourism and energy. 
</P>
<P>
Antiguans take it for granted that either Lester or Vere Jr. will succeed their 
father, who is in declining health, and many believe the outcome of this 
scandal could help settle the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers, both British-trained lawyers, have weathered previous scandals. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Vere Jr. was implicated, but never charged, in an investigation of a 
government project to repave the runway of the island's airport. He had formed 
a private company to carry out the project, which was supposed to cost no more 
than $3.5 million but ended up costing $11.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
It was Lester who helped Vesco when the fugitive surfaced in Antigua in 1982 
with a bizarre plan to buy half of Barbuda, Antigua's small sister island, and 
establish a principality called the Sovereign Order of New Aragon. 
</P>
<P>
Vere Jr. is widely regarded as his father's favorite. Lester, who was an 
All-American long jumper at the University of Michigan in 1960, is seen as the 
brighter of the two. 
</P>
<P>
In separate interviews, the brothers played down their rivalry and the possible 
impact of the scandal on their political futures. 
</P>
<P>
"I clearly had no intention of . . . reducing (this matter) to a question of a 
fight for power within the domestic situation," Lester said. "After all, he is 
still my brother." 
</P>
<P>
Vere Jr. would not discuss specifics of the case, but said: "I've never been 
associated with anything of the kind and would never be." 
</P>
<P>
About his relationship with his brother, he said: "Whenever I meet him, it's a 
most amicable . . . relationship. When we leave, I don't know what transpires." 
</P>
<P>
The Antigua government has hired a Washington attorney, E. Lawrence Barcella 
Jr., to head a team that has flown to Israel to get evidence. A British jurist, 
Louis Blom-Cooper, has been named to conduct a judicial inquiry, which is 
expected to open hearings in June.

SHARE WEALTH, INDONESIANS URGED; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: IN A POLICY REVERSAL, PRESIDENT SUHARTO WANTS BUSINESSES TO SELL 
SHARES TO SMALLER COOPERATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

JAKARTA, Indonesia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The country's leaders have admonished rich Indonesians for years not to flaunt 
their wealth with luxury homes or other conspicuous consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Now, President Suharto wants businessmen to help redistribute wealth by selling 
shares in their companies to cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Rudini declared in 1988: "It is an insane idea for people to 
compete to build mansions similar to the White House. . . . They are asocial." 
</P>
<P>
Retired Adm. Sudomo, coordinating minister for general policy and security, 
said last year the slow spread of wealth was a greater danger to stability than 
any political or military threat. 
</P>
<P>
Sudomo said "the side effects of economic development" were not moving rapidly 
enough "to cope with all the social problems so we can narrow the gap between 
the rich and the poor." 
</P>
<P>
In February, Suharto said: "Of course we cannot avoid differences in levels of 
income and abilities, but these differences should not be allowed to grow into 
a social gap that is contrary to the spirit of togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
"We must recognize these differences and take steps to minimize them before it 
is too late." 
</P>
<P>
Per capita annual income is less than $500 in this nation of 178 million 
people. The gap between rich and poor is great and a middle class began to 
emerge only in the last generation. 
</P>
<P>
In his annual budget speech in January, Suharto urged companies to sell 25% of 
their shares to cooperatives so the co-ops could become a "national economic 
force." He suggested making loans to poorer cooperatives to help them buy the 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen were surprised by the proposal and many dismissed it as a populist 
response to criticism of powerful conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 34,000 cooperatives with about 26 million members. They were 
established to give small farmers the advantages of mass buying and marketing 
and to help introduce modern methods in handicraft and cottage industries. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperatives, enshrined in the constitution, were intended as an economic 
complement to state-owned enterprises and private companies. 
</P>
<P>
Suharto has promoted cooperatives as the ideal way to help the poor in a land 
where 70% of the people make their livings in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, most cooperatives are perceived as poorly managed, 
undercapitalized and burdened with bad debts. Of 6,000 rural credit co-ops, a 
1988 World Bank report said, "1,272 are insolvent but not entirely hopeless, 
while 1,658 are candidates for dissolution or liquidation." 
</P>
<P>
Some businessmen, startled by the idea of selling shares to cooperatives, hope 
Suharto's suggestion was a pep talk rather than a new government policy of 
divestiture. 
</P>
<P>
As explained by Radius Prawiro, coordinating minister for economy, finance and 
industry: "This is an appeal and not an entirely new policy. Helping one 
another must not be spelled out by legislation. This is an appeal to the 
private sector to give cooperatives a chance to own part of the equity." 
</P>
<P>
Prawiro and other senior officials said private companies would not be 
compelled to sell stock to cooperatives, but it was not made clear how such 
transfers might occur without compulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Business analysts said few privately held companies would voluntarily sell 
shares to cooperatives or lend money to finance the purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Suharto's proposal followed months of statements by economists, politicians and 
educators that efforts to deregulate the economy in recent years benefited big 
enterprises at the expense of small ones, especially of cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
There were complaints that many of Indonesia's largest companies are controlled 
by ethnic Chinese, who make up less than 5% of the population but have great 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
Any belief that the Suharto proposal would fade away ended with a major 
presidential gesture March 4. On that Sunday, he was host on his farm at Tapos, 
45 miles south of Jakarta, to 31 of Indonesia's business leaders, most of them 
ethnic Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
"A more equitable distribution of incomes should be developed, together with 
growth and stability, otherwise social jealousy and upheaval may break out to 
annihilate all our achievements," the Jakarta Post quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
He said conglomerates were useful in fighting tough international competition, 
but should not become domestic monopolies because "they can also manipulate 
prices, causing the people to suffer," the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
Antara, the national news agency, quoted Suharto as saying: "The government 
hopes the selling of shares to cooperatives will proceed smoothly. . . . If the 
transactions do not run smoothly, the government will take measures to see to 
it that they do. 
</P>
<P>
"If this fails to proceed, the existing gap will only give rise to social envy 
and social upheavals," Antara quoted him as saying. "There will thus be no 
winners." 
</P>
<P>
Suharto told the businessmen that the government would prepare a list of worthy 
cooperatives deemed to have the necessary financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
"That way," he said, "you would not have to look for such cooperatives."

BUSH DECLARES KILAUEA'S PATH A DISASTER AREA

President Bush Friday declared a major disaster on the island of Hawaii, where 
Kilauea volcano has destroyed 139 homes and caused an estimated $61 million in 
damage, Gov. John Waihee announced. 
</P>
<P>
The President's action makes federal funding available to affected individuals 
and local governments. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will coordinate 
the effort and designate specific areas eligible for aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Assistance can include temporary housing, grants, low-cost loans to cover 
uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business 
owners recover from the effects of the disaster," the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
"Federal funding also is available to eligible local governments on a 
cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged 
by the lava," the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
Waihee hailed the President's action and said the state would link up 
immediately with federal and county officials to coordinate recovery operations 
on the "Big Island." 
</P>
<P>
Waihee said he was also grateful that the action was made effective Jan. 24, 
1983, when the volcano started its devastation, and that officials had 
recognized that this had been "a unique, slow-moving disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's letter to Waihee said "We will also be asking the state to develop an 
appropriate mitigation solution to prevent future damage." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, civil defense authorities ordered the evacuation of some of the few 
remaining homes in Kalapana as a new lava flow snaked down the volcano's slopes 
and completely cut off the Kalapana Gardens housing area. 
</P>
<P>
Civil defense spokesman Lanny Nakano said the molten rock crossed Highway 130 
about 7 p.m. Thursday, followed the road for about 15 yards, and then headed 
downslope into the deserted housing area. 
</P>
<P>
He said the lava crossed Lokelani and Leilani streets at about 11 p.m., 
Lokelani was the final entrance to Kalapana Gardens that had been untouched by 
the flows that destroyed most of the development.

INDIANS SEE DEITY SHIVA IN TREE THAT BURST INTO FLAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
A 50-year-old tree that suddenly burst into flames in a municipal park in 
January and has become a Hindu shrine. 
</P>
<P>
For believers, it is the home of the Hindu deity Shiva the Destroyer, who wears 
a cobra as a necklace. 
</P>
<P>
The tree's transformation to divine repository was sudden. It caught fire in 
January, and after the blaze was put out, bystanders were astonished to see 
through a split in the trunk that inside was a stone object resembling a 
lingam, the phallic symbol of Shiva. 
</P>
<P>
It was too big to have been placed in the tree trunk through the aperture, and 
people believed it had materialized from within. 
</P>
<P>
Harendra Nath Patra, a gardener who has lived for several years in a tiny house 
in the shadow of the tree, witnessed the fire and the tree's seeming 
transformation into a Hindu shrine. 
</P>
<P>
"It suddenly caught fire on Jan. 21. We called the fire brigade and it began 
spraying water to put out the fire. Then we saw a white snake come out of the 
crack. We looked inside and found the Shiva lingam," Patra said. 
</P>
<P>
As word spread about the lingam, worshipers of Shiva began to gather in the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
"People began to say, 'God has emerged' and the prayers began. I also pray 
here," Patra said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first were wealthy businessmen from the Marwari community, originally 
from the desert lands of Rajasthan. They came to pray that their ventures be 
blessed with success. 
</P>
<P>
Women and children also began daily rituals of prayer. 
</P>
<P>
They poured milk through the crack and offered coins in homage, much as they 
would have done in a temple. 
</P>
<P>
The park's security guard, Mahtab Alam, a Muslim, also saw the fire and the 
snake. 
</P>
<P>
"The stone Shiva lingam was not inside the tree earlier. The strange thing was 
that when the fire brigade poured water to put out the fire, the tree swallowed 
all the water," Alam said. 
</P>
<P>
"Strangely, the fire did not destroy the leaves, which are still intact." 
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Munna, a jobless young man, said: "The Shiva lingam has come out of the 
tree. You can see it has not been planted inside. I believe it is a genuine 
Shiva lingam."

VIDEO COURTROOMS INCREASE -- BUT SO DO PITFALLS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: TRAILBLAZING METHOD OF REPLACING PAPER WITH VIDEO HAS CREATED NEW WAYS FOR 
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO GO AFOUL. FOR EXAMPLE, A JUDGE ACCIDENTALLY TAPED OVER 
PREVIOUS TESTIMONY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Judicial mistakes come in almost inexhaustible variety, but Judge Ellen B. 
Ewing found a novel one: She erased the only record of eyewitness testimony in 
a manslaughter case. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing is the chief judge of the Louisville circuit courts, the only major court 
system in America that has completely eliminated paper and gone to videotape 
for trial transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
When she forgot to turn off the videotape during a noon recess soon after the 
system was installed in 1985, the cameras whirred steadily as she ate lunch, 
then automatically rewound and accidentally taped over the morning's record 
with new testimony in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing's inadvertent erasure represents only one of the perils of video 
courtrooms, which have spread from Kentucky to 60 courtrooms in 11 states in 
the last five years. Judges have forgotten to turn on the cameras, testimony 
has been inaudible, appeals have taken months to prepare as lawyers struggled 
with unfamiliar video records and court reporters have lost their government 
jobs. But the use of video transcripts is growing dramatically from Maryland to 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel as if any system is perfect," said Judge Laurence Higgins, who 
has been on the bench 14 years, "but this is the greatest thing that has 
happened to me as a trial judge in my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky, having worked out many of the bugs in its trailblazing system, 
preserves the official record of 40% of all trials on videotape. It saves 
money, provides faster service and more accurate transcripts, according to 
Kentucky Chief Justice Robert F. Stephens. The number of video courts is 
growing as fast as Kentucky finds $50,000 per courtroom to install the 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
In Kentucky courts where it is used, videotape provides the only official 
record; when a case is appealed, the appellate lawyers hand the state Supreme 
Court tape, not paper. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia has a pilot project under way in one courtroom in Roanoke, and 
Maryland has installed cameras in the Prince Georges County circuit court of 
Judge Darlene Perry. The District of Columbia is not using video. Nationwide, 
four federal courts are expected to begin an experimental program within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The National Center for State Courts, after an exhaustive survey, concluded 
that "video recording is a viable method of court reporting that compares 
favorably with traditional court reporting." 
</P>
<P>
But as a steadily growing number of state and federal courtrooms are wired for 
cameras, some appellate lawyers and judges question whether videotape is too 
time-consuming and cumbersome to review, and court reporters -- fighting hard 
to save their jobs -- are demanding that the supposed advantages of video be 
seriously examined. 
</P>
<P>
"If a court is having personnel problems, just bringing in a machine is not a 
creative approach," said Marshall S. Jorpeland, communications director of the 
National Shorthand Reporters Assn. "Video is just another tool, it looks great 
and sounds fantastic, but 50 years from now reporters will still be needed and 
courts will still have the human element involved to make sure everything's 
working." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there have been problems. Curtis Clay, convicted of slaying his 
live-in girlfriend in Lexington, Ky., won the right to a new trial in 1989 when 
courtroom videotape ran out unnoticed while he was being questioned by his 
lawyer and cross-examined by prosecutors. The judge ruled that a reconstruction 
of his testimony did "not constitute a record of sufficient completeness for 
appellate consideration." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Gilbert S. Merritt called his first 
experience handling the appeal of a burglary conviction using a Kentucky 
videotape transcript a "dismaying encounter." He said it did not provide an 
"adequate basis for review . . . it was marginally audible." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the lack of a written transcript, "the parties could not engage with 
the bench in resolving simple factual questions about what happened at trial," 
Merritt said. "Oral argument about the events of the trial became, at times, an 
exercise in futility." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we jumped into this a little too soon," said Kentucky Court of Appeals 
Judge Charles B. Lester. "I think this can be developed eventually." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, however, he said: "It takes a lot more time to sit and watch a trial 
than to scan a typed transcript. . . . It has shifted costs up to our level; we 
are paying lawyers to sit and watch television. We just have to grind through 
and waste an awful lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Lester said in an interview, because the voice-activated system 
focuses on the loudest noise, "every time a spectator walks in, I get a 
beautiful segment of doors. I could prepare quite a beautiful ad for doors, 
every kind of door that exists in a trial courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing, in accidentally erasing testimony, provided novel grounds for appeal. 
But the Kentucky Supreme Court refused to grant a new trial, saying a narrative 
statement reconstructing the record from trial notes was sufficient to give the 
convicted man a "full and fair appellate review." 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky officials say updated equipment in the voice-activated system has 
eliminated many of the mechanical and sound problems. Human error has been 
minimized, they say, by new devices that prevent erasures and alert the 
courtroom audience when the cameras are not operating by the installation of 
two lights on the front of the judge's bench. Even so, the Curtis Clay case 
still occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"My feelings have changed over the years," said Frank Heft, chief of the 
appeals division of the Public Defender office in Louisville. "In the beginning 
there were a lot of technical problems (and) it was particularly difficult 
hearing bench conferences. Most technical problems are now resolved, it is 
rare. . . . The biggest problem is the time involved in reviewing transcripts. 
We've adjusted." 
</P>
<P>
Three factors fuel the move to video -- money, time and convenience. The 
National Center for State Courts found that Kentucky, which paid low 
court-reporter salaries before the introduction of video, reduced court 
reporting costs by 15% in actual dollars over a 4-year period, not counting the 
fact that salaries would normally have increased with inflation over the 
period. The state has spent the savings on video equipment for new courtrooms 
and hiring law clerks to help the judges. 
</P>
<P>
Other states, which have kept more detailed cost records, say video-recording 
costs are "roughly one-half as much as traditional reporting," according to the 
National Center for State Courts. 
</P>
<P>
Court reporters say both costs and delays have merely been shifted around among 
the parties involved in litigation. "Court reporters are much less expensive" 
than video, said Laura Kogut, immediate past president of the Kentucky 
Shorthand Reporters Assn. If a case is appealed, "you're paying attorneys $150 
hour to watch TV." 
</P>
<P>
Court reporters say that instead of having to wait for transcripts to be 
prepared, delays have been shifted to the appeals process as attorneys take 
longer to study video records to prepare their briefs. "Attorneys have been 
cited by the (state) Supreme Court for not getting their briefs in in a timely 
matter," said Teri Hockersmith, a Louisville court reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins said Kentucky became a trailblazer in courtroom video because 
"necessity is the mother of invention." 
</P>
<P>
Higgins said he volunteered to have cameras installed in his courtroom and 
turned them on one morning after he had delayed a trial for three days because 
of the absence of a court reporter. It was not the first time video recording 
had been tried -- it had been started and abandoned in Ohio and Tennessee -- 
but new, unobtrusive, inexpensive equipment that could be operated by a judge 
made it a more attractive proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't done out of spite or meanness," he said.

CORRUPTION, SEPARATISM ISSUES SWAMP INDIA FBI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
India's version of the FBI, already swamped by corruption investigations, has 
stretched itself thinner by joining the fight against separatist movements. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Investigation has been in the news most often for probing 
deals made while Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was in office. Gandhi lost his job 
in November's elections to anti-corruption candidate V. P. Singh. 
</P>
<P>
Now the bureau also is handling routine murder cases in troubled Jammu-Kashmir 
state, pursuing anti-terrorist investigations in violent Punjab and looking 
into a tribal revolt in faraway Assam. 
</P>
<P>
The man with his finger in the dike is Rajendra Shekhar, director general of 
the bureau, a 55-year-old career police official from the western desert state 
of Rajasthan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm losing weight," he said in an interview. "We're the busiest we've ever 
been." 
</P>
<P>
Shekhar looked worn out. These days he drinks jasmine tea with lime, which is 
supposed to improve his appetite. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with local police forces that are too busy, too frightened or too 
partisan, Shekhar directed his agents to take over investigations in Kashmir. 
At least 300 people have been killed in the northwestern state since the 
government cracked down on a Muslim separatist movement in January. 
</P>
<P>
Just south of Kashmir, bureau agents are investigating separatist violence by 
Sikh extremists in Punjab state. 
</P>
<P>
Many Punjab police are virtually confined to their barracks because they are 
favorite targets of Sikh extremists, who have killed more than 5,800 people in 
Punjab since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In Assam, a remote northeastern state, bureau agents are looking closely at the 
Bodos, an animist tribe that believes spirits live in rocks and trees. The 
Bodos want a separate state within India and have attacked Assamese Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
The real work of Shekhar's agency, however, is fighting corruption. 
</P>
<P>
India's British colonial rulers established the Central Bureau of Investigation 
soon after World War II to investigate links between Indian businessmen and the 
government. That work continued after independence in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,200 cases filed by the bureau's 3,907 agents every year, about 1,000 
are corruption-related, Shekhar said. 
</P>
<P>
Corruption is the grease of South Asia's wheels. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic cops routinely take "baksheesh," small cash payments, to ignore 
violations. Businessmen consider payoffs and kickbacks part of the job. 
</P>
<P>
Shekhar said the problem has been growing. 
</P>
<P>
Industrialization, inflation, development, unemployment -- all contribute to 
it, he said, and "the facets that give impetus to corruption are getting more 
and more pronounced." 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary charges have been filed in three cases involving members of 
Gandhi's government. Two concern alleged payment of bribes by Europe's Airbus 
Industrie consortium and Hawaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, a West German submarine 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
A former high-level civil servant was charged in connection with a 
$1.47-billion Airbus deal for 38 planes and a former defense secretary was 
named in a case involving four West German submarines worth $334 million. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also has filed preliminary charges related to a $1.4-billion 
artillery contract with the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. Bureau 
investigators have charged Bofors with cheating India out of $37 million and 
Indian government officials, not identified, with criminal misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Charges related to an alleged political dirty tricks campaign against the son 
of Prime Minster Singh are expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats say the growing scope of bureau responsibility is a sign 
local police cannot cope with the level and complexity of crime in India. 
</P>
<P>
It also indicates, they say, that the central government does not trust local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances, it's easy for the law enforcement process to break 
down," a diplomat said, on condition of anonymity. "The bureau is stretched too 
thin. They don't have good relations with local police, and the crooks keep 
committing crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say many of the bureau's investigations are politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Charges of corruption haunted the Gandhi administration. Singh, formerly 
Gandhi's finance minister, quit the government when his corruption 
investigations were stymied. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats say there appears to be vindictiveness in the investigations, and 
cite the one concerning the prime minister's son. 
</P>
<P>
By forcing the bureau to concentrate on what many consider a minor case, 
Singh's administration is using law enforcement to fight its political battles, 
another Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Shekhar denied that his bureau could be used for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"Our work has nothing to with politics," he said. "If we think the case is 
legitimate, we investigate." 
</P>
<P>
Shekhar made his mark late in his career when he led the investigation of one 
of India's biggest bank robberies, the theft of $3.35 million from the Punjab 
National Bank in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the original 24 suspects wound up dead, but Shekhar says the police 
didn't kill them. 
</P>
<P>
Several others disappeared and only a few were convicted and jailed. In the 
Indian context, the case was considered a success. 
</P>
<P>
The director general looks at his current post in a similar light: Incremental 
steps can be taken, but no major changes should be expected. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can set an example with one or two corruption cases, I suppose we are 
doing our job," Shekhar said. "But, then again, nobody could pay any 
attention."

BITTER DISPUTE RAGES AROUND BULLETPROOF VESTS; 
</P>
<P>
BODY ARMOR: SOME PROTECTIVE CLOTHING HAS BEEN FAILING STRICT GOVERNMENT TESTS. 
THE ISSUE IS, WHO SHOULD SET THE STANDARDS? 
</P>

<P>
Slowly, deliberately, Richard Davis loads his .44-caliber magnum revolver. He 
grasps it with both hands, points it at his abdomen and stares ahead grimly. He 
fires; his body jerks with the impact. 
</P>
<P>
A grin spreads over Davis' weather-beaten face. "Nothing to it, folks!" he says 
with the satisfaction of a man who has shot himself more than 130 times in 
sales pitches for the bulletproof vests his company manufactures. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the demonstrated confidence in his product, federal body armor 
standards that he and other manufacturers consider unreasonable are being 
imposed. The dispute has become so bitter that some police groups, for whom 
quality armor is a life-or-death matter, are asking Congress to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) said he will introduce a bill to establish 
standards this month. Sen. Carl Levin, (D-Mich.) has asked Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh to mediate a compromise. "The increasing uncertainty can only hurt 
law enforcement officers," Levin wrote Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The highly technical debate boils down to four issues: how such vests should be 
designed (particularly the amount of baffling needed to stop bullets), how the 
garments should be tested; who should set the standards and whether they should 
be voluntary or mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Justice, a branch of the Justice Department, has set 
quality guidelines for the vests and tested them since the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
A vest is tested by mounting it on clay blocks firing at it from various ranges 
and angles. To meet NIJ standards, a vest must not only stop bullets; it must 
prevent them from making an excessively large dent in the clay. That's because 
the impact of some rounds can damage internal organs even without penetrating 
the armor. 
</P>
<P>
The standards were upgraded in 1987, to keep pace with changes in weapons and 
ammunition, said Lester Shubin, science and technology director for the 
institute. Suddenly, more than half the vests being tested were flunking. 
</P>
<P>
The makers -- including Davis' employer, Second Chance Body Armor of Central 
Lake, Mich., -- cried foul. They said the only way to make sure their vest 
would pass every test would be to make it so thick and bulky that police 
wouldn't wear them. 
</P>
<P>
"Police officers don't really want to wear the stuff, anyway. Give them any 
excuse to take it off and they will," said Ed Bachner, ballistics manager for 
E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., which makes Kevlar, the synthetic insulating 
material used in most bulletproof armor for the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Police are dying because they aren't wearing vests, not because the vests are 
bad," Bachner said. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys have found that only about 30% of police officers wear armor even 
though many departments require it, said George Austin Jr., national executive 
officer of the Fraternal Order of Police. Manufacturers say the number of 
wearers may be even lower. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont has documented more than 1,000 incidents in which wearing Kevlar body 
armor prevented death or serious injury, Bachner said. Most were shootings but 
many were stabbings or auto accidents, and there were even a couple of bull 
gorings. 
</P>
<P>
A single vest retails for about $350, Davis said; he recently sold 4,000 of 
them to the Detroit police at a unit price of $175. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Gates, executive director of the Personal Protective Armor Assn., said no 
vest has ever failed to protect a wearer from bullets it was designed to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"They've performed flawlessly in the field, where it counts," he said, "but in 
the laboratory tests under the NIJ standards, over half the vests fail. The 
test is flawed . . . but the NIJ won't budge." 
</P>
<P>
Shubin said the vests have a good field record because the agency's tests have 
kept inadequate products off the market. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe a lot of their armor is marginal," he said, "but we believe if it 
passes our standard, it's going to work 100% on the street, and it has. We're 
being faulted for being successful." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Du Pont and the Personal Protective Armor Assn. established their 
own standards, which they say produce more consistent test results without 
sacrificing the wearer's comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Shubin and many police leaders aren't reassured, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I could put up with a little discomfort in exchange for extra protection," 
said Austin, the FOP officer and a Poquoson, Va., beat cop. "And I'm the one 
out there on the street getting shot at." 
</P>
<P>
Police generally have sided with the government in the dispute, but not 
unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
New York City Police Commissioner Lee Brown, who favors the NIJ standards, 
called the debate over vest design and testing procedures a "smoke screen." 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is who's going to develop the standards," Brown said. "I want them 
developed by someone who has no interest in selling a product." 
</P>
<P>
The Fraternal Order of Police wants Congress to assign a disinterested body, 
such as the NIJ, to set the standards, and the International Assn. of Chiefs of 
Police has taken a similar position. 
</P>
<P>
The State Assn. of Chiefs of Police, a division of IACP, voted in April to 
oppose legislation and to ask the manufacturers and the NIJ to accept binding 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
One vest manufacturer that supports government standards is Point Blank Body 
Armor of Amityville, N. Y. Its president, Richard Stone, said the industry's 
primary motive is to protect the dominance of Kevlar. 
</P>
<P>
"This is basically a commercial situation," Stone said. "Du Pont's had a 
virtual monopoly on body armor for 20 years, and they want to keep it that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont's Bachner disagreed. He said the controversy arose before the recent 
emergence of competitive synthetic fillers. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell police if they can find a better product, they ought to buy it," he 
said.

WITH FREE-LOVE GURU DEAD, INDIA COMMUNE GOES MAINSTREAM 
</P>

POONA, India 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buffeted by the recent death of its god and a drop in donations, the commune of 
the late free-love guru Osho Rajneesh is trying to save itself by going 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Emphasis has shifted from mystical sex to meditation exercises. Primal 
screaming was banned after neighbors complained of the noise. Deals have been 
signed with prominent companies for distribution of videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are mellowing," said Swami Tatahgat, an Indian board member of Rajneesh 
Foundation, the trust that controls the commune. "Before, we used to wear our 
rebelliousness on our sleeves." 
</P>
<P>
It appears to be a kinder, gentler commune now than at Rajneeshpuram, Ore., 
where, according to commune residents and spokesmen for the Poona press office, 
members administered barbiturates and other drugs to rivals they considered 
"negative." Rajneesh called himself Bhagwan, or God, in those days. 
</P>
<P>
No longer do disciples prance half-naked through the halls of the local 
five-star hotel, the Blue Diamond. The hotel recently welcomed them back, but 
only for meals. 
</P>
<P>
The lush 11-acre campus, with its miniature waterfalls, outdoor Japanese 
restaurant and high-tech workout rooms, seems more like a summer camp for 
adults than a focus for worldwide revolution in consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
All visitors are required to produce the results of an AIDS test no more than a 
month old. Westerners seen groping at one another's bodies on Poona's streets 
may get a dressing down by other followers. 
</P>
<P>
Osho meditation is taught at the Tata Management School, a Poona business 
college. The commune has a contract with CBS/India to distribute videotapes of 
Rajneesh's lectures, and another with Pocket Books to publish his writings. 
</P>
<P>
Day breaks at the Osho International Commune. 
</P>
<P>
Disciples gather for a meditation session in Lao Tzu Hall, where the guru's 
ashes are housed in a small vault kept on his marble bed. 
</P>
<P>
Pattering into the house, they pass through a marble room furnished only with a 
plush dental chair. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where Osho had his teeth fixed," Swami Subhuti, a commune spokesman, 
intones reverently. He used to be Peter Waight, a newspaper reporter in London. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the mausoleum, once Rajneesh's bedroom, disciples move close to the 
vault containing his ashes. "Never born, never died," reads the epitaph on 
black marble. 
</P>
<P>
A stocky guard flicks a remote-control switch. Lights in an ornate glass 
chandelier dim. A chime rings and meditation begins. 
</P>
<P>
Osho Rajneesh, the mesmerizing guru of quick-fix enlightenment, died Jan. 19. 
At the height of his popularity, the 58-year-old former teacher of Sanskrit 
amassed 500,000 followers, 87 Rolls-Royces, diamond-studded watches, and gowns 
fashioned from gold thread. 
</P>
<P>
Rajneesh started his movement in India in the late 1960s, preaching a blend of 
Eastern mysticism, free love and pop psychology. Among his 650 works are such 
titles as "Take It Easy" (Volumes I and II) and "Ya-Hoo." 
</P>
<P>
He changed his name numerous times, adopting Bhagwan, Zorba the Buddha and 
finally Osho, "the one the heavens shower with flowers." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Rajneesh moved his band of red-robed followers to a 
64,229-acre ranch in the hills of central Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Rajneesh disbanded after the master was kicked out of the United States 
in 1985 for immigration fraud, and the American movement degenerated into a 
miasma of poisonings and costly court cases. 
</P>
<P>
Ma Anand Sheela, Rajneesh's former chief aide, was sentenced to 4 1/2 years in 
prison for arson, attempted murder and masterminding a food-poisoning outbreak 
that made 750 townspeople ill. Other aides avoided prosecution by cooperating 
with police. 
</P>
<P>
Rajneesh advocated breaking with all social conventions through meditation, as 
he defined it. 
</P>
<P>
Through meditation, he said, his followers could destroy the family, the church 
and the state, structures he said were destroying humanity. 
</P>
<P>
He developed or synthesized several techniques, including one in which 
followers jump up and down, yelling "Hoo, hoo, hoo!" 
</P>
<P>
Unlike gurus who demand that disciples reject worldly goods, Rajneesh 
encouraged his followers to revel in sensual pleasures, including sex, drugs 
and good food. 
</P>
<P>
"Only by this way will you ever rise above them," he said in one of his famous 
discourses, which he peppered with bathroom humor and intriguing riddles. 
</P>
<P>
Those who succeeded in meditation, the guru said, would attain "Buddhahood," or 
enlightenment; they would be able to live in the world unaffected by its 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
"What Osho taught is that the next jump for humanity is not changing the shape 
of your nose or face, but changing the shape of your inner space," said Swami 
Amrito, a British doctor who was with Rajneesh when he died. 
</P>
<P>
Rajneesh returned to India in 1986, and problems followed the movement home. 
</P>
<P>
After his death, the Indian press speculated that Rajneesh was murdered or died 
of AIDS. His followers denied the claims and accused the United States of 
poisoning their god while he was in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Indian newspapers claimed that Westerners were trying to seize control of the 
movement. The commune also rejected that claim. 
</P>
<P>
A mysterious team of 21 people, called the "Inner Circle," runs the commune. An 
American, Swami Jayesh, and the British doctor, Swami Amrito, are believed to 
be in charge. 
</P>
<P>
Negative publicity has hurt donations, which routinely reached millions of 
dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
Swami Tatahgat, the Indian board member, said the commune does not plan to 
expand its campus because "we don't have the funds." Last year, the commune 
lost a court case and was forced to pay the Indian government $2 million in 
back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Be there or be square," says a Californian with pigs riding surfboards on his 
shorts. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the White Robed Brotherhood is the centerpiece of meditation at 
the commune. Every evening, hundreds of followers don cotton robes and gather 
in the Gautama the Buddha Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Disciples pass a metal detector, then a duo of sniffing women whose job it is 
to detect those who are wearing perfume or haven't bathed. 
</P>
<P>
"Osho doesn't like weird smells," says one olfactory guard. Like other 
followers, she speaks of Rajneesh in the present tense. 
</P>
<P>
His empty chair sits on a marble stage between two air-conditioners set at 52 
degrees Fahrenheit, his preferred temperature. 
</P>
<P>
A screen drops and a video of the master is shown. 
</P>
<P>
As the discourse ends, a young Frenchwoman whispers: "He is still with us."

<P>
Fifteen years after the end of the Vietnam War, which left parts of that 
country a wasteland, a 60-year-old Vietnamese ornithologist is fighting to 
revive the lush forests of his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Professor Vo Quy is campaigning at home and abroad for resources to help 
reclaim vast tracts of devastated forest and fields. It's an uphill struggle 
because more forest continues to be destroyed each year than is replanted, 
despite his tireless efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But Vo is confident that he and nature will win. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic," he said during a trip to Geneva to drum up support. "I 
would like in the very near future for half of our country to be covered in 
forest again." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1940s -- before fighting, first against French colonial control, 
then against the United States, which continued until April 30, 1975 -- 
paralyzed the country, 46% of Vietnam's 83 million acres was forest. 
</P>
<P>
That fell to 29% in 1975 and has dropped further under population pressure and 
logging activities to only about 20% now. 
</P>
<P>
An astounding two-fifths of the country is just barren wasteland, Vo said. 
</P>
<P>
Although other factors have played their part in the destruction, much of it 
was caused by heavy bombing and the U.S. use of the defoliant Agent Orange 
during the war. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops sprayed the chemical on infiltration routes, such as the Ho Chi 
Minh Trail, and large areas of forest from which Viet Cong and North Vietnamese 
soldiers launched assaults. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Kemf, an environmentalist at the World Wide Fund for Nature who has 
worked with Vo and visited Vietnam several times in the ast few years to survey 
the damage, said the poisoned forests are still wastelands, unable to recover. 
</P>
<P>
Kemf described what she found in Vietnam in her just-published book, "Month of 
Pure Light: The Regreening of Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
"On both sides of the valley the hills were stripped bare, their ridges lined 
with the fragmented trunks of dead trees. They jutted upon the horizons like 
the decaying masts of rotting ships," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Huge American bulldozers also cleared broad swathes of forests along roads and 
canals -- a total area of about 800,000 acres -- to minimize guerrilla attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is pocked with 25 million bomb craters. Some have been turned into fish 
ponds or vegetable patches, but water often drains into them, making them 
unusable for normal agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Vo had his first vision of what needed to be done when he sneaked south across 
the Demilitarized Zone dividing North Vietnam from South Vietnam during 
fighting in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Appalled by what he saw, he immediately started planning to repair the damage. 
</P>
<P>
"I dreamed, 'We can recover this,' and I have pursued this dream until now," 
the Chinese-educated ornithologist said. 
</P>
<P>
He drafted Vietnam's National Conservation Strategy, encouraging the replanting 
of entire forests. He also visited village chiefs to discourage further 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
"He awakened them to the fact that there is an environmental crisis," Kemf 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 the World Wide Fund for Nature awarded Vo its annual Gold Medal for his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently a half a million acres of forest were being lost each year, 
while only half that area was being replanted. 
</P>
<P>
Under Vo's guidance the area being reforested each year has painstakingly been 
increased to 375,000 acres. He said he hopes eventually to increase that figure 
to 750,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
But it is very expensive to reclaim the inhospitable land, some of it now 
rock-hard, some still covered with wreckage from the war, some smothered with 
tall grass that is too tough for livestock and difficult to remove. 
</P>
<P>
It is particularly hard for an impoverished country like Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Vo insists that environmental problems affect the entire world and urges 
governments and private groups alike to help the restoration process. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmental protection doesn't benefit this country (Vietnam) alone. It 
benefits all countries," he said.

RUNNING OUT OF BALLPARKS; 
</P>
<P>
LITTLE LEAGUE: WITH 672 PLAYERS, THE MOORPARK YOUTH PROGRAM IS EXCEEDING THE 
CAPACITY OF ITS DIAMONDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark's fast-growing Little League has just about run out of playing room. 
</P>
<P>
The junior baseball program, the membership of which has jumped 25% in each of 
the last three seasons, had to turn away a dozen players this year due to a 
shortage of diamonds -- and, says league President Joe Bravo, that's just the 
start of the squeeze play. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year, it looks like we'll either have to turn down dozens of boys and 
girls who want to play ball, or we'll have to split up and play our games in 
different parts of town," Bravo said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of parents would hate to see that happen. The logistics can be next to 
impossible for a family that has children playing in more than one location." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, there are 672 youngsters playing Little League ball in Moorpark. 
They range in age from 6- and 7-year-olds playing T-Ball, in which the batter 
hits the ball off a tee, to players as old as 15 in the senior-major division. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to Bravo, whose association with Moorpark Little League 
goes back to 1960, when he was a 10-year-old player, is that the current total 
of 52 teams cannot be expanded at the league's fields at Chaparral Middle 
School and across the street on the former site of Moorpark High School. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using those fields all day Saturday and every weekday from 5 p.m. until 
dark," he said. "There's no possible way we can get any more playing time on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Bravo and other league officials launched "Field of Dreams," a drive 
to raise $50,000, which will help move them to a larger location. Among other 
things, they plan to sell sweat shirts and T-shirts bearing logos designed by 
Mike Bailey, a graphic artist whose son, Jackson, 6, is a member of the 
Indians, a T-Ball team. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the players' parents have received mixed signals from Moorpark 
officials and others in their efforts to line up a new site. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to get the City Council to promise us some reserved time on the 
softball diamonds in a new 69-acre park that's on the drawing boards," said 
Gary Anfang, league board member and chief umpire. "Personally, I think the 
council is dragging its heals." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardo M. Perez, a councilman who became the city's mayor Wednesday, said he 
backs the league's request for using part of the new park, to be called Arroyo 
Vista Community Park. "I would favor letting them set up some fences during the 
season, so they could get more games in," he said. The park's first phase is 
expected to be completed in two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said he sympathizes with the league leaders' hopes to be allowed to lease 
part of a Southern California Edison Co. right of way adjoining the park. 
Combined with the park diamonds, this would give the league the 10 diamonds its 
board members believe it needs. 
</P>
<P>
But Christina Bradley, Edison's area manager for Moorpark and Simi Valley, said 
company policy wouldn't permit allowing Little League to use the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
"There are high-voltage lines over that area carrying 220,000 volts of power," 
she said. "We wouldn't allow what we call stationary use of the area. Don't 
forget -- people keep talking about the big quake." 
</P>
<P>
Bravo, however, noted that Edison has allowed Little Leaguers in Thousand Oaks 
to set up diamonds under similar power lines. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo said one of his chief concerns is prompted by reports that Chaparral 
plans to increase the number of temporary classrooms that have already reduced 
the space available to the league. "We've heard they're going to add to the 
blacktop. We've also heard they're going to install a new track. If they did 
that, it would wipe us out completely." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hopkins, Moorpark Unified School District building inspector, said no such 
expansion is planned at the school. In fact, he said, the district hopes to 
build a new middle school elsewhere in the city, which would relieve pressure 
on Chaparral.

TRANSIENT HELD IN SLAYING OF SIMI RESIDENT 
</P>

<P>
A Simi Valley man was shot to death in his home in a fashionable condominium 
complex one block from the police station, but shocked neighbors said Saturday 
that they heard nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory D. Minor, 37, a Blue Cross insurance employee, died of two gunshot 
wounds to the head between 4:30 and 7:45 p.m. Friday, Deputy Coroner's 
Investigator Jim Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first homicide of the year in the city and the seventh in Ventura 
County, Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 4 a.m. Saturday, police arrested a 22-year-old transient who was 
sleeping in his van about a mile from the home Minor shared with Donna 
Richardson in the 3200 block of Darby Street, Simi Valley Police Sgt. Ken Tacke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Barrascout was booked at the East Valley sheriff's station on suspicion 
of murder, Tacke said. Barrascout's bail was set at $1 million, an East Valley 
deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Oscar was the last person to see him alive," Tacke said. 
</P>
<P>
Police released no information on the motive of the shooting. Detectives were 
still at the home Saturday trying to piece together the events of the killing 
that left neighbors upset and saddened. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary," said one neighbor, who requested anonymity because she feared for 
her safety. "I thought Simi was a nice place to live." 
</P>
<P>
"I was very shocked when I heard," another neighbor said as she rocked her 
month-old infant. "My two older kids were here alone." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Richardson arrived home after work shortly before 7:45 p.m. Friday 
to find blood spots on the entryway carpet and in the hallway. There was no 
sign of forced entry, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Upset and unable to find Minor, Richardson went to a neighbor for help, said 
Dave Sobel, who lives upstairs next door. 
</P>
<P>
"She came and got my wife and she went down there and they looked through the 
whole condo again," Sobel said. "They looked in closets and everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The two women found nothing, and one of them called police. Officers arrived 
soon after and searched the home again. They discovered Minor's body under the 
bed in the master bedroom, Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
Tacke said Barrascout had been an acquaintance of Minor's. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel said he saw a young man outside Minor's home shortly after 5 p.m. Friday. 
The man had gone to Minor's door and then returned, leaving his backpack in the 
seat of a white Corvette that Minor had been trying to sell. Sobel said he 
assumed that the man had come to buy the car. 
</P>
<P>
Minor was known to his neighbors as a friendly man, who played with his young 
son when the boy came to visit. Minor is survived by his wife, Thyjuan Minor of 
Northridge, and a son described by neighbors as about 4 years old.

BONSALL DOESN'T BEAT AROUND THE BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: IF YOU'RE TALKING RURAL, THIS COMMUNITY'S SOPHISTICATED CITIZENS GROUP

<P>
Gee, you would think a couple of neighboring North County communities would get 
along better than this. 
</P>
<P>
But there just isn't any ambiguity these days in the relationship between the 
city of Vista and Bonsall, its rural, unincorporated neighborhood to the north. 
At least there isn't any among their leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Consider what Vista Mayor Gloria McClellan has to say about a Bonsall resident 
who happens to preside over that community's citizens activist group and who 
personally monitors the Vista City Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"He attacks us constantly, and not nicely. The man is rude. He's not a very 
nice person when he gets up there (to the microphone). He's constantly at it." 
</P>
<P>
The target of McClellan's criticism is Marshall Byer, who has his own thoughts 
about Vista: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like their politics, their restrictions and their cronyism, too." Adds 
his wife, Dot: "They've got the dirtiest politics this side of Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
The Byers, who moved from Upstate New York to Bonsall six years ago so the wife 
could nurture her collection of cactus and succulent plants, don't consider 
themselves at all rude. They say that, like others who live in this North 
County underbelly between Interstates 5 and 15, along the San Luis Rey River, 
they're simply passionate about preserving their region's storied rural 
ambience. 
</P>
<P>
Bonsall is a place of rolling hills punctuated by rambling ranch houses and 
white picket fences. There are golf courses and thoroughbred horse training 
facilities. There are strawberry fields, avocado groves and a mushroom farm. A 
one-time animal petting farm has a sign that still boasts: "Our Donkeys Don't 
Wear Pants." And then there's the river -- sometimes but a trickle, but a river 
nonetheless, with banks of cottonwoods and oaks and, oh, all those birds. 
</P>
<P>
Bonsall has remained mostly unaffected by the explosion of growth in North 
County. Granted, there's the hillside of condominiums next to San Luis Rey 
Downs Resort and Country Club but, heck, those were built years ago, before 
local residents banded together to oppose such complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there's the small tract of homes alongside California 76 that lookes like 
-- egads -- a residential neighborhood. But that's in the so-called town center 
and, by city standards, the back yards are downright spacious. And yeah, 
there's the new shopping center under construction at the intersection of 76 
and Mission Road -- called, quaintly enough, River Village -- that will even 
feature a six-screen movie theater, if you can believe it. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bonsall has come a long way in 10 years, when the community's most 
notable landmark was, next to a real estate office, an outhouse with the 
half-moon window that bore the sign "City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
But Bonsall is still mostly just countryside, and most of its residents want to 
keep it that way -- so much so that back in the '70s they formed a community 
group known for its endearing acronym, BARC. 
</P>
<P>
As in trees? Maybe more as in bite. 
</P>
<P>
It stands for the Bonsall Area for a Rural Community, so it's clear what they 
hold as their vision for tomorrow. Keep it like yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
BARC is the closest thing this town has for an organized voice among residents. 
It's got 430 dues-paying members (and a mailing list of 1,800 families) and 
foremost on its agenda these days is to fend off threatened annexations by 
neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
The logic goes something like this: We're in the county and even though it may 
be underfinanced and understaffed and underserviced, it still beats the unknown 
bogey man of cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
So far, they've been successful. 
</P>
<P>
BARC was formed 13 years ago, initially to stave off the city of Oceanside to 
the west, which wanted to move its city boundaries eastward up the San Luis Rey 
River Valley. BARC organized, its members complained loudly and articulately, 
and Oceanside backed off. Today, Bonsall is as much a boundary to Oceanside's 
eastern expansion as the Pacific is to its western expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's San Marcos to the southeast, which hasn't shown too many 
aggressive tendencies toward Bonsall and is considered mostly benign by 
Bonsallites. 
</P>
<P>
So all eyes in Bonsall these days focus on Vista, which, to hear Bonsall say 
it, has a voracious appetite something akin to a pit bull with a tapeworm. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say that annexation, maybe into Vista, is inevitable," says Byer. 
"But we don't think so. The majority of us don't want to be in a city, and, for 
the indefinite future, we will remain in the county." 
</P>
<P>
County rule is prized, Byer and others in Bonsall say, because it is more 
likely to preserve the current land-use zoning in the region, which, in most 
cases, requires lots of at least two acres for each home. Anything more dense 
than that would destroy the very rural ambience that makes Bonsall what it is, 
Byer says. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Vista tried to move in on Bonsall by claiming it had a sphere of 
influence up to where Gopher Canyon Road dead-ends at the river, and where 
Ormsby Road dead-ends at East Vista Way, which is the main drag for Vistans 
heading out of town toward Fallbrook and I-15. 
</P>
<P>
But the Local Agency Formation Commission, a government panel that rules on 
such things as city boundaries, told Vista to back off, and today Vista's 
technical sphere of influence along East Vista Way comes short of Ormsby Road. 
</P>
<P>
Vista attempted to annex an area known locally as Strawberry Hills a few years 
ago, saying it wanted to authorize a housing development there. Again, LAFCO 
said no, mostly because there was no clear means of providing city water to the 
proposed neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But Vista won't say die, and that's what's got Bonsall worried. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still trying to get land along East Vista Way as it leads to Bonsall, 
and if they get it, they'll put a lot more housing along there," says Byer. 
</P>
<P>
Is he exaggerating? 
</P>
<P>
Well, even McClellan says her city wants that strip of land so it can raise the 
residential density over what the county has now authorized. One-acre lots 
would seem reasonable without jeopardizing a rural lifestyle, McClellan 
insists. 
</P>
<P>
"We're interested in having that area as beautiful as they are," she said. "But 
we also feel there's got to be some affordable housing in the area -- if you 
can call one-acre lots 'affordable housing.' If everyone has estate homes 
(minimum two-acre lots), where are our kids going to live? Are we saying this 
is an elitist world?" 
</P>
<P>
Bonsall residents fear, though, that once Vista gets its hands on Bonsall, it 
will continue to up-zone the property to allow greater and greater residential 
density. 
</P>
<P>
McClellan answers: "That couldn't happen under our General Plan, though. Any 
changes to the General Plan would have to be by vote of the people." 
</P>
<P>
But the only people Bonsall people trust are other Bonsall people. 
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming consensus of the community is that we'll grow, and the land 
will develop, in accordance with the rural county plan as it now exists -- so 
long as we stay under the protection of the county of San Diego," says Bill 
Ferrante, an attorney and BARC member who also serves as chairman of the 
Bonsall Community Planning Group, a panel of citizens appointed by the county 
Board of Supervisors to advise on planning and land-use issues. 
</P>
<P>
"If ever we are annexed into an adjacent city that has a different view of how 
our land should be developed, then those areas would be lost, and our lifestyle 
would be lost. Instead of having one house on two acres, we might end up with 
five houses on one acre. That's the risk. We recognize it as a real imminent 
one, and both BARC and the planning group are doing all in our power to hold 
the line," Ferrante said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Bonsall planning group and BARC typically work hand-in-hand on 
local land-use issues. Almost without exception, the planning group has 
recommended planning and land-use guidelines with the support of BARC -- which, 
as an organization, will rent buses to cart loads of people from the community 
to downtown San Diego like so many reinforcements for the planning group. 
</P>
<P>
"While the sponsor (planning) group is one of the most sophisticated ones that 
we have in the county, BARC preceded it, and they were the ones that really 
began to demand that the county maintain the rural atmosphere of Bonsall," says 
county Supervisor John MacDonald, whose 5th District includes Bonsall. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about BARC is that they don't oppose all kinds of development. You 
don't always hear them saying, 'We don't want it, period.' They didn't, for 
instance, oppose the new shopping center. Instead, they worked very hard with 
the developer to come up with plans that would fit in with the area. They were 
very, very demanding of quality." 
</P>
<P>
Added Dana Smith, a staff analyst for LAFCO, "They are a tenacious and 
relatively sophisticated community group, as active as any in the county." 
</P>
<P>
BARC hasn't limited itself to issues of zoning and annexations -- where it has 
been successful in protecting two-acre lots and thwarting Oceanside and Vista. 
The various directors of BARC have their own specific assignments. One is 
charged with monitoring the county's decision of where to put a landfill in 
North County. Others monitor the city councils of the various neighboring 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
One of BARC's most ambitious projects was in conceiving, financing and 
producing a video showing how the San Luis Rey River has been ravaged in parts 
by sand mining. In the video, BARC proposed the formation of a so-called "river 
authority" to coordinate the various public agencies that are supposed to 
monitor sand mining in the river, because of criticism that the bureaucracy has 
not successfully regulated the extraction of sand from the river. 
</P>
<P>
The video cost about $2,000 to produce, and more than 100 copies have been sold 
or distributed to residents, politicians and bureaucrats throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
State officials are now considering the formation of just such a river 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to show the river -- and what's happened to it because of sand 
mining -- that people had never before realized," crooned Dominic Savoca, who 
served as BARC president for five years. 
</P>
<P>
But, even with Savoca, who has put the mining issue foremost on his action 
agenda, the discussion still comes around to Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here just don't have any faith and confidence in the city of Vista, 
based on what has happened to that city over the years," he said. "Vista would 
screw everything up in Bonsall. Somehow they'd figure a way to screw up our 
hills."

CASE AGAINST MD SADDENS, SHOCKS TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When word spread through the country town of Ramona that one of its longtime 
favorite physicians, Dr. John DeKock, had been arrested on accusations of child 
molestation, the reaction was swift and sure. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be true that he has a problem," offered Andrew Palleson, who has known 
DeKock since the early 1960s. "But I feel terribly deprived, because I've lost 
who I consider to be an exceptional family physician." 
</P>
<P>
"He has a fantastic following here," Ellie Whitcomb said. "I'd be willing to 
say, if they'd allow him to come back to his office today, things would go 
along like they did before all this happened." 
</P>
<P>
Said another patient, Fran Gefken: "I'd have no qualms going back to him 
today." 
</P>
<P>
This outpouring of support from longtime friends and patients of the 
62-year-old general practitioner -- some of whom knew of his background -- came 
despite growing allegations that DeKock, a registered sex offender who was 
convicted of molesting a young boy in 1961, has not changed his ways. 
</P>
<P>
DeKock pleaded innocent May 8 to 23 counts of molesting, sexually exploiting 
and having oral copulation with a minor. The alleged victim is an 11-year-old 
boy, a relative of DeKock's who looked upon the distinguished older man as a 
grandfatherly figure, even though there is no blood relationship between the 
two. On May 11, after being held for nearly a week in County Jail downtown on 
$250,000 bail, DeKock put up $600,000 worth of property as collateral and went 
home. 
</P>
<P>
But, as sheriff's detectives pored over the evidence they had taken from 
DeKock's home and office -- as they compared more than 20 scrapbooks containing 
hundreds of pictures of naked or scantily clad young boys, as they viewed hours 
upon hours of videotapes, as they leafed through such books as "Show Me," 
"Tender Cousins" and "Boys Will Be Boys," and as they turned page by page 
through the doctor's diaries listing boys' names -- others began coming forward 
to tell police that they too had been molested by the town doctor, authorities 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a pedophile. There's no doubt about it," said sheriff's Detective 
Michael Radovich, who is investigating. "I've seen people with those 
characteristics, but Dr. DeKock is a true pedophile. You don't need to be a 
psychologist to realize he's got serious problems. He's a danger to all 
children in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Neither DeKock nor his attorney, Jack Phillips, responded to requests for 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Since news of the doctor's arrest hit the town, more than 10 people, including 
the alleged victim's own father, have added their voices to the prosecutor's 
case. Eight are adults who say DeKock molested them as children. Two are 
preteen boys. A few callers were so distraught that they could not bear to give 
their names. Detectives say these allegations may lead to more charges against 
DeKock. 
</P>
<P>
Each additional allegation has put more strain on the relationship DeKock had 
so carefully nurtured with his townspeople, many of whom knew his past but 
decided to look the other way. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, however, many continue to rally to his side. The reason: They say 
DeKock, a quiet and unassuming man who is one of five local doctors in Ramona, 
possesses qualities of caring, warmth and generosity that are sometimes lacking 
in modern medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all aware of his record, but, you know, second chance and all that," 
said Thelma Stansbury, a longtime Ramona resident. "But, you know, he never 
molested women, so I didn't personally worry. Is that awful?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, to many Ramonans, it was no secret that, in 1961, state physicians 
diagnosed DeKock as a "sexual psychopath." Indicted in El Cajon on three counts 
of oral copulation with minors and two counts of child molestation, DeKock had 
pleaded guilty to one count: fondling a 7-year-old boy in his medical office. A 
psychiatric examination revealed that DeKock, then 33, "readily admits to 
homosexual interests," which he said he first developed in 1953, court records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
DeKock told doctors he had had sexual contact with other small boys, ages 7 to 
9, but never forced himself on children. He said the alleged incidents had been 
blown out of proportion. He knew he had a "psychological problem," but said he 
was involved in psychotherapy and that he believed he would "never commit any 
such offense in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The first two state doctors who examined DeKock concluded, "In view of this 
man's obvious pedophilia, homosexuality, he should be considered a sexual 
psychopath." But later, another state doctor reversed that finding, saying 
DeKock was "without mental disorder." 
</P>
<P>
DeKock was disciplined by the state medical board and placed on 10 years' 
probation. Under the terms of his probation, he was not permitted to associate 
with minors under the age of 18 unless he was accompanied by a responsible 
adult. He was forbidden from drinking alcohol and required to continue his 
psychotherapy. And he was told to move out of the El Cajon area "as soon as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Scorned and carrying one of society's greatest stigmas, he moved from El Cajon 
to the North County hamlet of Ranchita -- a blink of a settlement on the way to 
Borrego Springs -- and his patient list was dominated by the Indians and 
backcountry folk of nearby Warner Springs and Santa Ysabel and Julian. He soon 
married Bea Crawford, his fiancee of 18 months. Crawford told investigators 
that, despite his conviction, DeKock had "all the qualities she wanted in a 
husband." Her young son and daughter from a previous marriage had become 
devoted to him, she reported. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, word of DeKock's medical practice -- of a qualified doc who 
didn't seem to care that much about being paid on time and who would make a 
house call any time of day or night -- had spread down the highway to Ramona, 
which sometimes had no local doctor its several thousand residents could call 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
DeKock built up his patient list among Ramonans, and relocated to the town, 
which seemed to welcome him with open arms. Even those who knew of DeKock's 
admission of child molestation just a year or two earlier lined up at the front 
door of his Main Street office, next to the old hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Here was a town with a grapevine as nourished as any, where secrets were shared 
as long as the next person promised to keep it a secret . . . and the next 
person, and the next. 
</P>
<P>
One old-time Ramona real estate agent, Jim McWhorter, known as Old Jim to 
distinguish him from his son, said knowledge of DeKock's 1961 conviction 
preceded him when he established his practice in Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt bad that they'd spin this story before the guy even moved here," 
McWhorter said. "It was like they were prepared for this children's ogre. They 
were afraid of him." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, the paucity of medical care in Ramona worked to DeKock's 
benefit. "People were just so pleased to have him here as the doctor," recalled 
Don Haught, the school district superintendent, "they didn't ask a heck of a 
lot of questions. And those who knew decided to let bygones be bygones." 
</P>
<P>
Soon enough, DeKock's skills and charming bedside manner won him fierce allies. 
</P>
<P>
"You probably wouldn't be talking to me today if it wasn't for John DeKock," 
said McWhorter, who said that when he suffered an apparent heart attack during 
a vacation in Florida, it took DeKock to properly diagnose the problem after he 
returned home. 
</P>
<P>
"John has an intuitive ability to tell when people had a medical problem. He'd 
worry about them. He'd stop my wife and kids on the street, just to ask how I 
was doing. . . . People all over town will tell you they're alive because of 
John DeKock." 
</P>
<P>
Palleson agreed. "My own wife had a problem with cancer, and she went through 
the entire process -- from the cancer clinics in Tijuana to snake oil peddlers, 
from Laetrile to horse's urine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the frightening procedures, DeKock was there to offer counsel, 
Palleson said. "Here was a local physician who cared as much as anyone, who 
would even just listen to us, who would sit down with us and even cry with us." 
</P>
<P>
Palleson first met DeKock when he sold him his office building. Then he became 
DeKock's patient, and next became his friend. Even back then, he said, he knew 
DeKock's background. "But I never talked to him about it. I felt that the 
regulatory bodies -- the courts and the medical profession -- had looked at it 
and levied whatever punishment or chastisement that was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, the punishment DeKock received did not impede his 
professional and personal progress. In 1962, less than a year after his 
conviction, the state Board of Medical Examiners allowed DeKock to resume his 
practice. Three years later, at his psychiatrist's recommendation, the San 
Diego County Superior Court allowed DeKock to stop his psychotherapy sessions. 
Probation-related travel restrictions were lifted in 1967, and then, in 1969, 
his probation was terminated altogether -- nearly two years before the 10-year 
term expired. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, some Ramona residents say the short-lived punishment wasn't 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're licensed to practice as a physician, that establishes a sense of 
trust between you and the public," said Dan Plough, a member of the Ramona 
school board and an educator at El Capitan High School in Lakeside. "You 
wouldn't think you'd have to ask your doctor, 'Have you ever been convicted of 
child molestation?' But now you have to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"Why was the man still allowed to practice medicine? If a teacher gets in 
trouble that way, he never gets to teach again. But here's a physician, 
convicted of this, who was still practicing." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Cooke, a regional supervisor for the California Board of Medical Quality 
Assurance, which reviews doctors' licenses and conduct throughout the state, 
said he could not say why DeKock was allowed to resume his practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't speak for the 1961 board," Cooke said, pointing out that at that time, 
the board was structured differently. "In 1961, it was the Board of Medical 
Examiners. Things operated under a different set of rules." But if DeKock were 
convicted today, Cooke said, "there's a high probability that there would be a 
revocation" of his medical license. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, DeKock's practice grew comfortably. He did extensive volunteer work, 
helping give cursory physical examinations to Boy Scouts at Camp Mataguay, 
their summer camp between Santa Ysabel and Warner Springs. (Conducted in the 
presence of a nurse, these examinations were judged not to violate his 
probation.) 
</P>
<P>
For several months in 1964, he signed on as the medical director of the Rancho 
San Felipe School for Mentally Retarded Boys, but he resigned after the 
probation officer pointed out that, given DeKock's record, "any publicity 
regarding him acting as medical director for a boys' school . . . would be 
extremely poor for all concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Still, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, DeKock volunteered as the team 
physician at Ramona High School and was a common fixture along the sidelines, 
ready to tend to sprained ankles or winded athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Haught, who became superintendent of the school district after DeKock quit 
serving as the high school volunteer physician, said he's "been asking around, 
to see if anybody has any complaints about him, and I can't find any," Haught 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout these years, adults and children alike sought DeKock's care in his 
storefront office on Main Street, with its small lobby decorated with pictures 
of military aircraft circa the Korean War. This was a family place; his second 
wife, Louise, and one of his stepdaughters worked the front counter. They did 
the bookkeeping, the reception, the office management. In one of three or four 
small examining rooms, usually with either his wife or his nursing practitioner 
present, often with the doors of the examining room wide open, DeKock would 
care for patients. 
</P>
<P>
Most patients never even saw the inside of DeKock's personal office, which was 
hidden behind a door that appeared to lead to the back parking lot. It took 
sheriff's investigators two inspections of the premises to realize that behind 
that door was another door -- one that opened onto an office and its safe, 
allegedly full of scrapbooks and videos documenting his liaisons. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say they have not yet completed their review of all the 
scrapbooks' pictures, or the contents of videocassettes they retrieved from 
DeKock's office and the home where he and his wife live in San Diego Country 
Estates. But already, investigator Radovich says, he has catalogued several 
scenes of young boys, either naked or clad in bikini trunks, posed in various 
suggestive positions. On the videos, Radovich said, DeKock's voice can be 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
"In reading his diaries, you saw he had a real craving for boys," Radovich 
said. "If he went more than a few days without them, he became very depressed. 
He used that word -- depressed -- several times." 
</P>
<P>
Radovich said he is frustrated in trying to track down some of the possible 
adult victims -- whose identities he has learned through the evidence seized so 
far -- because some have moved out of state. But, in talking to others, he 
said, he learned of DeKock's method of winning the boys over. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes he'd take them outdoors, into the backcountry, anywhere he could get 
away with it," Radovich said. "But his favorite place seemed to be his office, 
usually when no one else was around. 
</P>
<P>
"He would befriend these kids. Sometimes he offered them money. Sometimes it 
was just the companionship," Radovich said. "In hindsight, the victims said 
they probably could have stopped it. But at the time they were children, and 
they were used and manipulated and controlled by Dr. DeKock. He had built up a 
position of trust with these children, and they had no control over what was 
happening to them." 
</P>
<P>
"They said DeKock took pictures of them, too -- but we haven't found those 
pictures yet." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the 11-year-old boy came forward, and law enforcement 
officials say the boy seemed eager to tell how DeKock had promised to buy him 
gifts in return for sex, how DeKock made him promise not to tell anyone "our 
secret" and how he had forced himself upon the boy for four years -- since he 
was 7 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was relieved to have said what happened, and relieved that this 
wouldn't happen again to him," Deputy Dist. Atty. Eugenia Eyherabide said of 
the boy. "It's my feeling that (the boy) did this out of love. There apparently 
wasn't any coercion or force. But as he got older and started making his own 
decisions, he probably started to realize, 'Hey, I don't know if I should be 
doing this.' 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be surprised why victims of molestation don't talk," Eyherabide said. 
"Especially boys. They're supposed to be macho. They're embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
To school board member Plough, the allegation that DeKock took advantage of 
that childlike tendency is troubling. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who violates a child -- especially if it's a teacher or a doctor -- is 
unforgiveable," he said. "But there are two types of people in Ramona -- the 
old guard, who have a different outlook on this, and the new people -- people 
like me, who have lived here for 10 or 15 years or less -- and among us there 
is outrage." 
</P>
<P>
Palleson acknowledges that the news of DeKock's arrest sent him looking for 
someone else to blame. "First I was angry at the Sheriff's Department because 
they've destroyed the guy in the media. . . . Then I got mad at the school 
officials because they all seemed to be trying to cover (themselves), saying, 
'Well, he wasn't the team physician when I was around.' " 
</P>
<P>
But now, Palleson said, he is no longer looking for a scapegoat. "If these 
things are true, that he (DeKock) did these things, then I can't get mad at 
anybody but him." He paused. "Society can't tolerate the loss of a child's 
innocence. And I can't." 
</P>
<P>
But Fran Gefken, a longtime patient and family friend, said the allegations 
don't change her affection for the man who has ministered to her children and 
grandchildren for years. "I had heard the rumors about him before, but I chose 
to ignore them," she said. Indeed, she said, she sent her own children and 
grandchildren to DeKock for medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very upset when I heard the news," she said. "Very upset. How did I deal 
with it? Well, I hate the disease, but I love the man."

OBJECTION TO ARTICLE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read your article pertaining to the alcohol-driving science fair project that 
was disqualified for the Greater San Diego Science and Engineering Fair 
(GSDSEF) for failure to meet regulations ("The Science Project That Was Put on 
Ice," May 11). I feel your slant was unfair and that the GSDSEF coordinators 
made the correct decision. 
</P>
<P>
This project dealt with drugging people! The four drinks given to the subjects 
put them well over the legal driving limit, and yet there was no medical 
supervision. This is a clear breach of the rules of the GSDSEF, and thus the 
project was not allowed to participate. 
</P>
<P>
While you wrote a long article about one student who did not get into the fair, 
you never reported the results of the fair itself. Over 800 top science 
students from around San Diego and Imperial counties followed the rules and 
were allowed to participate. These students deserve recognition. Your choice in 
printing this article was nearly as poor as your decision to say nothing about 
the results of the fair.

LISTEN TO CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The voters of all San Diego County will shortly have the opportunity to express 
themselves in the most momentous criminal justice system decision in two 
decades. In selecting the leadership for the Sheriff's Department in the June 5 
primary, they may well be setting the tone for law enforcement leadership for 
the county in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been made over the leadership style of John Duffy. Whatever one thinks 
of that style, it cannot be denied that, during the very difficult governmental 
time of Proposition 13 management, he has led the department to a position of 
national preeminence in several areas. 
</P>
<P>
If what we wish to change most is the personality at the top, we would do well 
to listen to not only what the candidates say, but also how they say it. Jack 
Drown has been termed a Duffy "clone," but in his statements he sounds 
reasoned, ethical and responsible. The candidate from the city school board 
sounds more political, more confrontational and more childish.

Methinks Jim Roache doth protest too much.

PROPS. L AND M WOULD PROVIDE NEEDED CARLSBAD SCHOOL FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it's time for the entire student body at Carlsbad's Valley Junior High 
School to assemble, a strange thing happens. Teachers and administrators herd 
the 950 students three blocks to Carlsbad High School, usually in two separate 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
That's the nearest place with a room big enough to hold even half the school's 
seventh- and eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition M, on the local ballot June 5, would put an end to this unfortunate 
and potentially dangerous situation. The measure would allow the Carlsbad 
Unified School District to borrow $2.5 million to build at the junior high a 
multipurpose center and expand a library that school administrators say is 
small and inadequate for their still-growing student population. It deserves 
voter support. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important Proposition L would raise $7.5 million to build and equip a 
new high school science building and a combination library and administration 
center. Built for 1,200 students in 1957, the high school now holds 1,750 
ninth- through 12th-graders and is being reconstructed to house as many as 
2,500 by the turn of the century. Library and lab space are scarce.

<P>
The measures need only a simple majority for approval because they are based on 
bonds passed by voters in 1975 and 1977, before Proposition 13 imposed the 
two-thirds-vote requirement for authorization of new borrowing. The school 
district is asking for the right to use its previously granted bonding 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the two propositions would add just $22 annually in taxes per 
$100,000 assessed valuation on a home over the next 10 years. That seems a 
small price to pay to provide Carlsbad's children with up-to-date science labs, 
libraries and auditoriums.

NEIGHBORS NEAR SLAYING SITE USED TO GUNFIRE

The stream of humanity from south of the border continued to cross behind Eddie 
and Betty Cuen's back yard along Monument Road in San Ysidro on Saturday, a day 
after their 21-year-old son was arrested on suspicion of killing a 12-year-old 
Mexican boy with a high-powered rifle from the balcony of the family home. 
</P>
<P>
In groups of 2 or 5 or 10, the aliens scrambled, tripped and ran down the 
hillside, seemingly oblivious that just 24 hours earlier, one of their youthful 
compatriots was slain by a single rifle bullet to his head. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Leonard P. Cuen, known as Paul to his friends, was being held 
without bail in the County Jail downtown on suspicion of murdering Emilio 
Jiminez Bejinez. The youngster had been standing 350 yards up the hill from 
Cuen's home, accompanying three other family members as they stopped to catch 
their breath before continuing their sprint down the well-beaten path into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
With the crack of the rifle, the youth fell to the dirt. His 22-year-old uncle 
tried to carry him back across the border into Mexico but gave up as U.S. 
Border Patrol agents converged on the scene, drawn by the commotion. 
</P>
<P>
At first, all eyes looked for border bandits -- armed thugs who hide in the 
ravines and scrub of the border hills and prey on their own for cash and other 
possessions. A sheriff's helicopter flew overhead, police scoured the hillside 
and neighbors looked inside their outbuildings and garages to see if anyone was 
hiding. 
</P>
<P>
But a witness -- another Latino who was sharing the hillside -- said he saw two 
men standing on the second-floor balcony of a brown house, and that one of them 
had a gun. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police went to the house, in the 2400 block of Monument Road, 
questioned Paul Cuen and by evening had booked him into custody. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the shooting was unknown, but there was no evidence that it was 
racially motivated, Police Department spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors speculated, and others complained, that gunfire had been coming 
from the Cuen home all day Friday. 
</P>
<P>
They said Paul Cuen had grown increasingly irritated by the aliens who brazenly 
paraded down the hillside past the two-story house, where his parents have 
lived for some 20 years. Cuen's irritability worsened, said one neighbor, after 
his twin brother, David, was killed in a motorcycle accident a couple of years 
ago. The tolerance he shared with other neighbors toward the migrants began to 
sour, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
"They liked to scare them," Elizabeth Rex, one of the neighborhood kids who 
lives a couple of doors down from the Cuens, said of Paul Cuen and a friend. 
"They'd throw firecrackers -- teeny-weeny little bombs -- at them as they ran 
by. They'd throw other stuff at them, too." Sometimes, she said, Cuen and the 
migrants would shout back and forth, taunting one another. 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, John Ferrari, spent Friday at the home he and a friend own 
next door to the Cuens. He said he was annoyed, as he always was, by the 
gunfire coming from the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I got here about 10:30 Friday morning, and I heard the first gunfire about 
10:45," he said. "I hollered at them to stop. I said, 'You son of a bitch, 
knock it off! You're crazy!' It was scaring the horses, and one of them kicked 
his way out of the corral." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrari said he couldn't see who was doing the firing because of thick 
shrubbery between his corrals and the Cuen home. "But you could hear them 
firing off and on, all day Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrari and his partner, Tony Minniti, said gunfire from the house was not 
uncommon and that it apparently came from target practice at bottles set up in 
the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday, Ferrari said, he heard a more distinctive sound -- that of a 
high-powered rifle, at first in the morning and again later in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Minniti said he arrived at the house about 4 p.m. Friday, after the youth had 
been shot and just as law enforcement officers were scouring the neighborhood. 
"I pulled up into my driveway just as a Border Patrol agent did, and we both 
heard another shot. The Border Patrol guy even drew his own weapon. He thought 
it was a border bandit." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, police arrived at the Cuen home and took the 21-year-old into 
custody without incident. 
</P>
<P>
People at the Cuen home refused comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
While Ferrari and Minniti complained about the gunfire spooking the horses, 
other neighbors said they were not bothered by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
"I target-shoot myself," said Jeff Leigh, who lives next door to the Cuens. 
"They're nice people. They don't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol officials say they had not received previous reports of gunfire 
coming from any of the homes along Monument Road, a rural, equestrian 
neighborhood between Interstate 5 and the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear gunfire pretty regularly," said Border Patrol spokesman Ted Swofford, 
"but we're usually too far away to tell where it's coming from. And there had 
been no citizen reports of shots coming from that particular house. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, our first assumption is that gunfire comes from the border bandits."

SQUABBLING CONTINUES OVER CONSERVATION DISTRICT'S ASSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the state dissolved the Northwestern Los Angeles Resource Conservation 
District in 1985, the agency's assets were to be divided between the county's 
two remaining conservation districts. The amount involved -- about $95,000 -- 
was a paltry one by big-government standards, and the players were not exactly 
political high rollers either. 
</P>
<P>
But more than five years later, the obscure and problem-ridden agency's assets 
have yet to be dispersed between the two surviving districts, and bitterness 
continues to mar relations between just about everyone involved in the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Although a lengthy legal dispute has finally been settled between the county 
and former directors of the defunct government agency, other conservation 
officials now anticipate a new battle over which programs will be favored when 
the cash is at last meted out. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are leftover funds from the Northwestern Los Angeles Resource 
Conservation District, which was abolished by the state Legislature in January, 
1985, after years of infighting, alleged mismanagement and a district 
attorney's investigation that ultimately cleared agency directors of criminal 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
After the district disbanded, the County Board of Supervisors was supposed to 
divide any remaining assets between the Antelope Valley and Topanga-Las 
Virgenes resource conservation districts. Both agencies promote the 
preservation of natural resources such as soil and water, a service created 
after many farms were destroyed by soil erosion in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Northwestern district was dissolved, some of its directors formed a 
private group -- the Foundation for Resource Conservation -- to carry out the 
district's mission and then transferred the title of a district-owned house 
into the foundation's name. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan B. Crane, the deputy county counsel who negotiated a settlement last 
May with the foundation after a five-year lawsuit to obtain the house, 
characterized its members as "well-intentioned but misguided zealots" who 
mistrusted the county and wanted to ensure the money's use on conservation 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Crane said he was happy with the outcome of the case, noting that the delay 
enabled the district's Granada Hills house to more than double in value -- 
leaving between $180,000 and $190,000 for conservation programs after expenses. 
The district purchased the house for about $95,000 in January, 1984, he said. 
It was transferred to the foundation in November, 1984, and it sold in March 
for $207,500. 
</P>
<P>
But bitter foundation directors still blame the dissolution of the district on 
a conspiracy by politicians, developers and the media and expressed lingering 
doubts about settling out of court with their archenemy -- the county of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the dissolving of the district was a treasonous act by a conspiracy to 
dissolve it," said Daniel Cooper, a former director now working as a 
conservation consultant. "All subsequent court cases were just part of the 
effort to impede conservation on the part of the people in the county." 
</P>
<P>
But directors of other districts say it took the county far too long to gain 
control of the assets. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an ongoing situation that no one was controlling," said David Gottlieb, 
a director of the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation District. "Our 
resource district runs nationally known programs like our education program, 
and we desperately need the money. . . . It's a shame that the funds have been 
tied up for so long," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the years the foundation owned the house at 17175 Chatsworth St. in 
Granada Hills, it maintained a small library there of environmental magazines 
and newsletters, hosted occasional meetings and rented out a bedroom to a 
college student to pay for property taxes, said Crane and Glenn Bailey, the 
foundation's chief spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb said Cooper and others in the foundation intermittently lived in the 
house "rent-free" -- an example, he charged, of their ongoing misuse of public 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
But Bailey and other foundation members denied the charge. Cooper said he had 
served as the house's caretaker but did not actually live there. Crane said he 
had found no evidence that they used any district assets for personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
"None were dressing nicely, driving a spanking car, eating steak and lobster," 
Crane said. "There wasn't any acting like Richard Pryor in the 'Superman' 
movie, where he takes a penny out of everyone's paycheck and shows up the next 
day in a Ferrari." 
</P>
<P>
To the added chagrin of Gottlieb and other conservationists, the settlement 
agreement gives the foundation a powerful voice in determining how the old 
district's money will be spent, stating, "these funds shall only be allocated 
to mutually agreeable programs." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement gives priority to conservation programs in the areas once served 
by the Northwestern district, including the Santa Clarita Valley, Chatsworth 
Reservoir, Pierce College and the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys were so corrupt they led to the dissolution of their own district, 
and now they're coaching us and telling us they have a say in whether we get 
these funds. I mean, it seems absurd," Gottlieb said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Campbell, a Lancaster-based conservationist for the U.S. Soil 
Conservation Service who has worked with all three districts, said he thought 
it was important for the surviving districts to have ultimate say over how the 
money is used. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of funny we'd let a district go down the tubes and then let its 
directors form another agency," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Topanga-Las Virgenes district, which runs on a yearly budget of about $200,000, 
has proposed several uses for the money, including reforestation of Santa 
Catalina Island and a study of the effects of development on geese wintering in 
the San Fernando Valley. The list of proposed projects is still being revised, 
and Gottlieb and other directors complained of conflicting instructions from 
county and foundation officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley district, which spends about $100,000 a year, has proposed 
expanding its windbreak program. The program raises trees on a 20-acre, 
district-owned nursery and sells them to farmers and other landowners to 
prevent erosion. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley district may soon obtain another source of cash -- from the 
planned sale of 60 acres it owns west of Lancaster. Ray Krueger, president of 
the Antelope Valley district board, estimated that the land could bring in $2 
million and provide the district with a healthy income from interest. 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb and other Topanga-Las Virgenes directors said the Antelope Valley's 
land sale should entitle their district to a greater share of Northwestern's 
assets. But Krueger said the money should be evenly split, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"They have their programs, and we have ours, and technically, we're all equal."

NEW BIT OF SCHOOL SECURITY: PARENT PATROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 8:15 a.m. at Morningside High School and teen-agers with book bags slung 
over their shoulders are streaming past the sentry at the front gate. The 
warning bell for the first class of the day is minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
"Good morning, young lady," the man known to many as "Super Dad" calls out to 
one girl. She immediately breaks out a smile. Then the Rev. Charles E. Frazier 
delivers his real message: "If you hurry, you can beat the tardy bell." 
</P>
<P>
Frazier, a minister at Victory in Christ Ministries in Inglewood, is stationed 
at the main entrance to Morningside every morning urging students, one of whom 
is his son, to get to class. He likens himself to a shepherd, rounding up 
students who are used to hiding out in the wide-open spaces of Morningside's 50 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
"Get to class," he said to a tall boy wearing a baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
"Why aren't you in class?" he asked a boy and a girl telling jokes by the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not ditching class?" he asked a student wandering the central quad 
without a pass. 
</P>
<P>
One of seven members of the new Parent Aid Corps at Morningside High, Frazier 
is paid $6.50 an hour to patrol the sprawling campus searching out violations 
of school rules. Six other parents, all carrying walkie-talkies and wearing 
denim aprons emblazoned with the letters P-A-C, are stationed at nearby Monroe 
Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
The fledgling program, approved by the school board in January, is part of a 
wider effort by the Inglewood Unified School District to get parents more 
involved at their students' schools. But unlike programs that use parent 
volunteers to perform clerical duties, chaperon school dances or accompany 
students on field trips, the patrol program is aimed at better securing the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the patrol program said they met some resistance from wary teachers 
and students at the two campuses when the program began. However, that 
opposition is declining, they say, as students get used to the patrols and 
teachers see that some of the volunteers are quite adept at controlling 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the kids, including my son, still don't want us here because we're in 
the way of what they want to be doing," said Frazier, who is regarded as one of 
the most successful campus watchdogs. "But we're earning their trust." 
</P>
<P>
Although organizers are still ironing out scheduling difficulties and other 
problems attributed to the program's newness, those overseeing the effort 
maintain that the pilot project is working well and may be expanded to other 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators welcome the additional eyes and ears on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside Principal Mallory Matthews credits the parents with reducing the 
number of students who cut class and says they have been dedicated employees 
because of their "vested interest in the school." 
</P>
<P>
He said the parents fill a void caused by a decline in the number of security 
guards assigned to Morningside High over the years. He said the parents are not 
considered security guards, however, and are instructed in their training 
session to report altercations to campus police officers and not to intervene 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
At Monroe, Principal Lacy Alexander said having even a small number of parents 
visible on campus shows students that parents are interested in the school and 
"generates an attitude that the school belongs to the community." 
</P>
<P>
During one recent sweep of the school grounds, Frazier escorted to the office a 
group of girls who were in the process of skipping their first class. Then, 
around another corner, he caught two boys forging tardy notes from their 
parents. They went to the office too. 
</P>
<P>
Using skills refined as a minister, Frazier later negotiated with a teacher who 
had just kicked a student out of class. The teacher told Frazier that the 
student was being disrespectful. Frazier struck a deal. He would contact the 
students' parents if the boy acted up again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a peacemaker some of the time," he explained later. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the kind of interaction and savvy Frazier brings to the job was an 
encounter he had toward the end of his three-hour shift. Two athletes 
approached him on a walkway, both with their hands over their left ears. 
</P>
<P>
"You both have ear aches?" he asked, explaining later that they were removing 
their earrings before he spotted the dress-code violation. 
</P>
<P>
"Every one of them has the ability to be devious," Frazier said with a shake of 
his head. "I tell the kids that there's no way in the world they, at age 17, 
can match wits with me, a 49-year-old minister. No way."

The Santa Paula City Council will hold a public hearing Monday on an assessment 
district to maintain open space in the new Hillsborough tract. 
</P>
<P>
The tract of upscale housing in north Santa Paula, where houses cost at least 
$395,000, is in the first phase of construction. 
</P>
<P>
The open space, including a flood-control basin and a grove of trees, must be 
maintained under an agreement made between the developers and the city when the 
69-house project was approved in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of maintaining the basin and landscaping is to be borne by homeowners 
in the tract. An assessment of about $100 annually would appear on the property 
tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson emphasized that surrounding homeowners would not pay for the proposed 
assessment district. JANET BERGAMO

BURGLARY SUSPECT IN AIR SHAFT LANDS IN JAIL CELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A burglary suspect wedged himself inside the air shaft of a central Los Angeles 
restaurant early Saturday and remained trapped for three hours until 
firefighters rescued him by sawing apart the metal shaft, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, unharmed during the ordeal, was then arrested, said Los Angeles 
Police Sgt. James Markloff of the Rampart station. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Felipe Garcia, 21, was charged with burglary, Markloff said. 
</P>
<P>
Police responded to a 5:30 a.m. report of a man screaming in the vicinity of 
Shella's restaurant in the 300 block of North Glendale Boulevard. When police 
entered the restaurant, they saw a man stuck midway through the restaurant's 
L-shaped air shaft. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect apparently had used a rope to climb down into the restaurant 
through the air shaft. After allegedly trying to pry open a cash register, "he 
tried to shimmy back out, but he couldn't quite make the turn in the L-shaped 
shaft," Markloff said.

About 40 domestic flights were canceled and international traffic was delayed 
up to three hours after air traffic controllers refused to work overtime 
Friday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment it is impossible to say for how long this situation will 
continue," said Rune Andersson, chief of air traffic control at Arlanda airport 
outside Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
The controllers are negotiating for higher pay for the extra hours, saying they 
are short-staffed because authorities failed to anticipate increased air 
traffic.

DIAL PHONES EMPLOYED IN WAR ON DRUGS

ST. PAUL, Minn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A telephone company is taking a technological step backward in trying to curb 
drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
US West has replaced its push-button pay phones with rotary dial models at 18 
locations here. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to make it difficult for drug dealers to conduct business via 
telephone pagers, since most pagers work with calls only from push-button 
phones, Mike Breda of the phone company said. 
</P>
<P>
Pagers have become an important tool of dealers trying to avoid telephone lines 
that may be tapped. "Everybody's got them," said Lt. James Singer of the St. 
Paul police narcotics unit. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs are ordered by calling a dealer's pager and then punching in a phone 
number or a prearranged code, police say. The dealer responds by calling back 
or showing up with the order. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Minneapolis and St. Paul police regularly asked the telephone 
company to remove pay phones in certain areas or to adjust pay phones so they 
did not accept incoming calls. Removing public phones, of course, can hurt 
residents who cannot afford private telephones and inconvenience other 
law-abiding people. 
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed a decrease in traffic in at least a couple of locations where 
we changed the phones," said Minneapolis Council member Jackie Cherryhomes. "I 
don't think it is going to win the battle against drugs, but if you can affect 
it in any way, that's important." 
</P>
<P>
US West's tactic may not work for long, however. One paging service now offers 
a pager that works with any type of phone. 
</P>
<P>
Another company is trying to discourage the use of its pagers for illegal 
purposes. Steven Miorana, general manager of MinnComm Paging in Minneapolis, 
said that a drug dealer may receive more than 1,000 pages a month, so MinnComm 
is charging an extra 20 cents for each call after the 500th.

THERE IS A LAW; IT SHOULD BE ENFORCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Blandford's May 14 column documenting the behavior of the young Dana 
Point surfers was a disgusting example of what goes on every day beneath all of 
our noses. Not surprising, unfortunately, or even unusual. 
</P>
<P>
All of Orange County seems to be up in arms about the wearing of Bart Simpson 
T-shirts, afraid of impressing bad things on children. Let's talk about sending 
dangerous signals: The wearing of a T-shirt bearing the image of a cartoon 
character is pure poison, but full-on racism is an afternoon's recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Why do these young and expert fascists feel free to express their most fondly 
held beliefs right out loud and have no compunction against physically invading 
the privacy of families on the beach? The disinterest of bystanders observed by 
Blandford is perhaps part of the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Far more revealing, however, is the picture of the Orange County sheriff's 
deputy, unable to bring himself to action even in his institutional role. Do 
you think a couple of non-Caucasian boys could have gotten away with defacing a 
place of business on that sunny day in Dana Point? Would the gun-toting 
Sheriff's Department representative have had trepidation in handling that 
situation? 
</P>
<P>
When one of the intended victims takes action and defends his family, the boy 
squeals what must be his standard response: My daddy will sue you. Blandford is 
so right in pointing out that these suntanned pipsqueaks wouldn't last a minute 
in a situation where they might have to stand up and account for strong 
feelings. Real men in training, right? 
</P>
<P>
These hoodlums are confident that parents generally support their actions, and 
they (and we) see here that at least one sheriff's deputy does too. They have 
been given tacit permission to revel in their ignorance and hatred -- the sum 
total of what they find when plumbing the shallow depths of what might loosely 
be called their humanity.

CURBING NOISE OF LEAF BLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine has set its sights on the ozone layer, dreamed of monorails and 
subsidized housing, and paid attention to the plants that developers place 
around their commercial sites. It has banned chemicals and quarreled with noise 
in the skies overhead. 
</P>
<P>
It should come as no surprise, then, that after drawing national attention, 
this planned community would engage in a consummate exercise in social 
engineering. It has passed an ordinance that restricts noise levels on the 
city's corps of 6,000 leaf-blowers. 
</P>
<P>
Those noisy motorized gardening tools have proven to be a nuisance in other 
communities too. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 California cities now have laws restricting hours that leaf blowers 
may be used. These include Irvine's neighbors Newport Beach, Costa Mesa and 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Eight cities in the state have gone a step further to actually ban the machines 
outright. Anyone who has had the quiet silence of a Saturday afternoon 
interrupted by the sudden acceleration of a leaf-blower's motor will understand 
a city's concern. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, after much discussion, became the second city in the nation to require 
that the machines meet acceptable decibel standards. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance prohibits the use of blowers from operating within 10 feet of 
residences, and limits on their use to between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays, 
and 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Saturdays. So far so good. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is how deep into its pockets Irvine is prepared to go to enforce 
this ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is spending $70,000 to take a number of steps. 
</P>
<P>
It is hiring a part-time inspector to work at an outdoor test station as well 
as purchase an instructional videotape and print brochures in five languages 
that will be sent to local landscaping and gardening services to notify them of 
the new law. But this is going a little far. 
</P>
<P>
After all, how many languages does a city really need to convey the idea that 
something's too loud?

AHIMSA'S CARING ROLE AS A SKILLED FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article "Laguna AIDS Refuge Cited" (May 3) is an example of blaming the 
provider who has taken the risk to provide a most needed, yet feared service. 
The information provided was taken largely from three disgruntled individuals 
and through innuendo constructed to paint a negative and very inaccurate 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
In the past week, I have received countless hugs and numerous calls from 
angered families who know the true experience of Ahimsa. We are not a refuge 
but a skilled nursing facility and in-patient hospice. As such, we are required 
to maintain compliance with more than 500 regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In that context, while the deficiencies noted require and have in fact been 
corrected, it hardly warrants the printed suggestion that Ahimsa's license is 
in jeopardy or that "substandard" care is provided. 
</P>
<P>
What is truly newsworthy is that since November, 1988, we have cared for nearly 
70 AIDS patients, 40 cancer patients and successfully integrated these into a 
skilled nursing environment with geriatric patients. 
</P>
<P>
Further, to suggest that the opinions of three represent a rift in the AIDS 
community is absurd and destructive. Those of us in the trenches who witness 
daily the assault on the bodies and psyches of people with AIDS have gotten 
beyond our idiosyncrasies and egos to join hands in a united front to provide a 
continuum of care to people living with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has been a model community in this regard, and the media should 
be applauding its efforts, not creating an artificial problem. This type of 
reporting only serves to promote the stereotypes and fears, which interfere 
with our progress in addressing a national health crisis.

THERE IS A LAW; IT SHOULD BE ENFORCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the article "Golden Boys, Princes of Darkness" (May 14): The raw 
emotions this touched in me were beyond belief. 
</P>
<P>
As a resident of Dana Point, a member of the Chamber of Commerce and a 
supporter of both schools and youth functions, I was flabbergasted to learn 
that behavior such as was discussed in this article is allowed to persist. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever are the adults thinking to allow this kind of behavior to exist? 
Certainly no one would advocate that these students be physically accosted for 
their show of physical and mental force against "the Establishment"; however, 
neither would any thinking adult espouse leaving the situation alone to 
escalate. 
</P>
<P>
Something must be done. It reminds one of the "Hitler Youth" so criticized by 
the world for their inhumane tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff, let's get on the ball and do your job with the irresponsible youth as 
well as with adults who act outside the law. The time to act is now -- before 
someone gets hurt.

LANE VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the editorial (May 14), there was another blurb about the efficacy of 
car-pool lanes, and as usual, you follow the other do-gooders who think they 
know best how to make people lead their lives. 
</P>
<P>
If you really want to see what an added lane does to reduce traffic, then open 
the car-pool lanes to all traffic during rush hour to see some real reduction 
in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
All pool lanes, no matter what name they go by, infringe on my constitutional 
rights by using my taxes discriminately. I have been, for the last 40 years, in 
the construction equipment business. I drive, on an average, 40,000-plus miles 
per year. I doubt that 1% of the time there is more than one person in my car. 
I am one of several hundred thousand people in business whose car is the means 
to a living. 
</P>
<P>
I pay exactly the same amount of gas tax as the car-pool lane automobiles. 
Because of the large number of miles per year that I drive, I pay far more than 
the average car using the pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet my taxes are used in a manner that restricts my use of the gasoline tax 
that is designed to provide better and more roads and freeways for me to use. 
</P>
<P>
Unless my logic is totally incorrect, that places me, and the previously 
mentioned hundreds of thousands of salespeople whose automobiles are their 
means for a livelihood, in the position of being taxed in a discriminatory 
manner.

AUTHOR OF PLAN TO BAN GILL NETS DECRIES THE WASTE THEY CREATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Steven Burklund's letter "Moves Against Use of Gill Nets Is 
Overreaction" (May 13), as a senior citizen and lifetime resident of the 
Southern California coast, I must take issue with him. 
</P>
<P>
Before the advent of the gill nets, both commercial and sport fishing was far 
more prolific than it is now. 
</P>
<P>
First they depleted the white sea bass off Palos Verdes, then the halibut from 
all up and down the coast, then the marlin, and in the last few years, the 
local bass, barracuda and bonita. 
</P>
<P>
Burklund sounds like an honest, responsible commercial fisherman. But, 
unfortunately, there are so many cheaters out there that the honest ones are 
being forced out. The dishonest ones don't care about permits or mesh size 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the gill-net fishing I've come across is occurring in the black of 
night. I've found nets as small as half the legally required gauge being used, 
thereby wiping out many of the smaller game fish and even bait fish. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem with gill nets is that they're indiscriminate; they wipe 
out total areas of all fish especially when used by dishonest fishermen who 
don't care how many unwanted fish or mammals they kill, just so they can make 
the maximum profit. 
</P>
<P>
When these nets break loose, as they often do, and are lost, they become 
floating massacres, destroying everything in their paths for who knows how many 
years; their nylon composition never deteriorates. 
</P>
<P>
There's really no viable solution, except to completely ban them.

STUDENT ACTIVISM IS BACK IN VOGUE, BUT NOT LIKE IN THE '60S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK, Jon Nalick is the editor of UC Irvine's campus newspaper, the 
New University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A funny thing happened on the way to the '90s -- "student activism" lost its 
status as an oxymoron. 
</P>
<P>
Since around 1987, campus protests have grown bigger, more frequent and better 
organized than in years past. At UC Irvine, a campus known better for its 
apathy than activism, protests and rallies drawing hundreds of students are no 
longer the rarity they once were. And in recent months, smaller protests have 
become almost routine. 
</P>
<P>
As protests have become more frequent, protesters have grown more tenacious. 
They are more inclined to get themselves arrested for acts of civil 
disobedience than before and to endure physical hardship during round-the-clock 
vigils, protests at remote locations and inclement weather. 
</P>
<P>
For these reasons, some people contend the '60s have returned to college 
campuses for an encore of student political involvement. They cite the recent 
surge in high-profile activism as evidence that the pendulum finally has swung 
back. 
</P>
<P>
However, that's probably reading too much into recent events. Student activists 
are still a small minority on most campuses, and even with their considerable 
vigor, there is no evidence that their ranks have swelled. The real change is 
that they are pursuing their goals with much greater sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
They have formed stable, efficient groups with clearly defined objectives and 
methods. Because these groups often support several causes and maintain a loose 
affiliation with other activist organizations of a similar political bent, they 
can produce consistently sizable demonstrations even without energetic support 
from the majority of students. 
</P>
<P>
Few details are now overlooked in planning protests. How signs should be 
phrased and precisely what will be said to the media are decided beforehand to 
ensure the group appears unified in purpose. These procedures, coupled with the 
desire for advance publicity to guarantee a large turnout, all but preclude 
spontaneity at many student protests. 
</P>
<P>
In several recent cases, protest leaders have gone to the point of conferring 
with the police on the time and place acts of civil disobedience will take 
place and the number of protesters who wish to be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the police, who wish to appear reasonable and avert potential 
violence, are often cooperative to the point of appearing as willing 
participants. One recent protest at UCI appeared almost scripted. Having 
discussed the arrest procedure with the activists beforehand, police allowed 
protesters to block the entrance of a building for 10 minutes before giving the 
first verbal warning. After the first 10-minute delay, police read a statement 
warning students that arrests would be made in 10 minutes if they didn't 
disperse. 
</P>
<P>
If '60s-style activism has returned to college campuses, it's back with an 
'80s-style self-consciousness -- and an acute awareness of the media's role in 
shaping public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, during a protest at a Nevada nuclear test site, activists purposely 
scheduled their action hoping to make it convenient for a Los Angeles Times 
reporter working on deadline to get their protest into the next day's edition. 
Soon after, a last-minute proposal to move the protest to another site prompted 
the group to ask reporters whether that would interfere with their ability to 
cover the demonstration. Reporters refused to aid in the planning of the 
action, and protesters decided not to gamble on changing locations. 
</P>
<P>
While some activists pride themselves on creating considerable public awareness 
of their causes, others remain ambivalent and question whether the methods 
cheapen the message. A few students have suggested that their demonstrations 
may be in danger of becoming "McProtests" -- triumphs of slick packaging with 
scant substance. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, though, demonstrations do seem to be contagious. Students who do 
not generally identify themselves as activists are now more likely to organize 
one-time protests to publicize their gripes. But these are geared more often 
toward venting frustration over crowded classrooms or dormitories, for example, 
than effecting political or social change. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime student activists are probably indirectly responsible for the 
increased number of one-shot protests by fostering an environment in which 
demonstrations are considered a conventional method of addressing problems. 
Ironically, because of this, some previously inactive students who chafed in 
silence at the demands made by activists have begun to stage counter-protests 
of their own. 
</P>
<P>
As the '90s begin, the number of activists is sure to grow, but whether they 
ever become a majority or even a sizable percentage of the student population 
is doubtful. However, their impact will continue to be felt as long as 
demonstrations call attention to issues many students would otherwise ignore. 
</P>
<P>
And although the '90s may earn a deserved reputation for its own brand of 
student activism, the '60s won't be back this way for a while.

PASTOR'S DRUG ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I want to thank the Los Angeles Times for reporting the arrest of Pastor Gary 
Kinzer for drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
Because the parishioners were told the "very-ill-and-needs-rest" story, I think 
it's fair to say the diocese would not have shared the allegations with the 
Catholic community. 
</P>
<P>
It is not fair for the Diocese of Orange to treat this drug scandal as an 
internal personnel problem. This type of alleged criminal activity corrupting 
the priesthood must be purged publicly. Anything less seriously undermines the 
trust all people have in our church and its moral authority.

CABLE COMPANIES' MONOPOLISTIC ROLE CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable companies in Orange County have 15-to-20-year contracts with the cities 
in which they operate. 
</P>
<P>
These companies are subject to no regulation whatsoever! They may not like the 
increase in their tax assessments, but there is no reason why the taxpayers 
should bear their burden further. We already put up with the cable companies' 
ridiculous rates and horrible service. That is hardship enough!

CROW TO HANG IN THERE AS LONG AS SOCKERS DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If they are to be bounced out of the playoffs before the championship series 
for only the second time in nine years, Kevin Crow won't be sitting around 
watching it happen. 
</P>
<P>
Crow remains an inspiration for a Socker team that is up to its ears in trouble 
and beginning to show signs of wear and tear with bickering and 
finger-pointing. The Sockers trail the Dallas Sidekicks, 2-1, in the 
best-of-seven MISL Western Division finals, with Game 4 at 6:05 tonight in the 
San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Crow, who suffered an abdominal strain in Game 2, was unable to practice last 
week, but when Game 3 started Friday night, he was on the field for his 81st 
consecutive playoff game. The Sockers have played exactly 81 playoff games 
since Crow joined the team in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible," midfielder Brian Quinn said. "Since Kevin and I started here 
together, I think he's played, like, 70 more games than me." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn has missed his share with injuries. Crow keeps playing and doesn't think 
much about it. Picking up a regular paycheck is reason enough for him to be out 
there, unless he is hurt so badly that he feels he is a detriment to the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have the simple philosophy that you're paid to play," Crow said. "If 
you can go out and help the team without hurting it, then I think you're 
obligated to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in that blue-collar work ethic. If you do work hard, the rewards are 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's as good a summation as any as to why the Sockers have tripped in 
this series. There hasn't been enough blue-collar hard work. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman and other members of the team are becoming increasingly 
concerned and impatient with the punchless play of midfielder Branko Segota, 
who has only five points in seven playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
After Friday's loss, Newman indicated he might consider replacing Segota with 
someone who would play more aggressively. That isn't likely, but whatever 
happens, the Sockers need to find their offense. Soon. They have scored just 
two goals in the past two games. 
</P>
<P>
Segota's latest analysis of his problem is that his teammates aren't creating 
chances for him. Last week, he said he didn't want to play more physically for 
fear he would wind up in the penalty box. It could be that he has no real idea 
why he isn't up to par and that thinking about it is bogging down his game. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, the Sockers don't have any consistent scorers. It appeared forward 
Damir Haramina might help fill that role after he had a strong finish in the 
regular season, but he has played sparingly in this series and made no 
significant contributions. Forward Paul Wright had two goals in Game 1 but 
missed on several opportunities Friday in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
To top it all off, midfielder Waad Hirmez is now questionable for the rest of 
the series with a right hamstring strain. Hirmez led the team in goals during 
the regular season with 29 and helped them eliminate St. Louis with a hat trick 
in Game 4 of the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The sum of the problems is that the Sockers aren't as dangerous offensively as 
they were last season, when Segota was more in command of his game, veteran 
forward Steve Zungul was healthy and contributing and since-traded Zoran Karic 
was providing a threat from the top of the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game will likely set the tone for the rest of the series. Losing 
another in San Diego would mean they would have to win both in Dallas, which is 
highly unlikely considering their history of inconsistent road play. 
</P>
<P>
And as the series draws closer to an end, each game gets a little bit more 
tense, particularly for the team that is behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when it gets from four on," Quinn said, "it's time to stop drinking 
coffee."

UNSER RUNS DRY ON TRY FOR INDIANAPOLIS 500 POLE;

AUTO RACING: DRIVER DOESN'T COMPENSATE FOR WEATHER AND WILL START FROM THIRD 
ROW. FITTIPALDI'S TOP SPEED STANDS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rain didn't come Saturday to Indianapolis Motor Speedway -- and neither did 
Al Unser Jr.'s anticipated challenge to Emerson Fittipaldi for the Indianapolis 
500 pole. 
</P>
<P>
An unexpectedly dry day allowed the 33-car field to be filled for next Sunday's 
$6-million race whether it rains today -- as predicted -- or not. 
</P>
<P>
Equally as unexpected was the relatively slow qualifying speed of Unser Jr. -- 
a four-lap average of 220.920 m.p.h. -- which left him on the inside of the 
third row. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Unser had a series of practice laps above 225 m.p.h., with 
a top speed of 226.729 making Fittipaldi's six-day-old pole-qualifying record 
of 225.301 appear vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
When the day was done, Arie Luyendyk was on the front row with Fittipaldi and 
Rick Mears instead of Unser. Luyendyk, a Dutchman who lives in Brookfield, 
Wis., averaged 223.304 for four laps just as Unser was pulling onto the track 
in his Lola-Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't think my speed was good enough for the front row," Luyendyk 
said, "not with Little Al coming up right after me. I hate to say it, but I 
thought it was great when I saw that his speeds were down on his first lap." 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi, who qualified last Sunday and had to wait nearly a week to find out 
if he had won the $100,000 PPG Pole Award, had similar feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"I was expecting Junior to go faster, even after his first lap (220.718)," 
Fittipaldi said. "It wasn't until his second lap (220.843) that I was sure he 
was having problems and the pole was ours. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning was very emotional for me, not getting in my race car, waiting 
and watching to see what would happen. When I heard that he had run 226 in 
practice, I was a nervous wreck, much more nervous watching than if I had been 
running myself." 
</P>
<P>
Unser, who had the year's fastest unofficial lap of 228.502 a week ago Friday, 
was at a loss to explain what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Something happened and the car pushed real hard," he said. "I had to lift (the 
accelerator) in all four corners, and during the morning I didn't have to lift 
at all. What happened was we should have changed the car as the day went on and 
anticipated the qualifying run. 
</P>
<P>
"The track changed. My mistake was in not realizing it changed as much as it 
did. We had set it up for the one run and we missed a little. It's tricky when 
you don't run in an hour to get the car adjusted right and we just missed it. 
That's all that happened." 
</P>
<P>
A.J. Foyt made changes that hit right on the mark. He qualified for his record 
33rd consecutive Indy 500 with a center third-row speed of 220.425. It was the 
fastest he has ever qualified and is 77 m.p.h. faster than he ran in his rookie 
year of 1958. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the track heats up, so we put a little bit more wing in the left front 
and right front, took the wicker bill off (the rear wing) and I towed the left 
rear in and the right rear in to give it a little more bite so I could hang it 
out if I could," Foyt, 55, explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie Cheever was behind me in line and he said, 'You mean you changed 
everything like that and haven't even tried it?' and I said yeah. He just shook 
his head, he couldn't believe it. I knew it could have gone the other way. We 
just rolled the dice." 
</P>
<P>
Cheever became the fastest of five rookies with a 217.926. He is an Indy car 
rookie even though he has 10 years' experience in Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, the term rookie fits me very well," Cheever said. "I'm used to 
showing up at a track on Thursday, practicing Friday, qualifying Saturday, 
racing Sunday and packing up and going home. I couldn't believe that it was 
necessary to run a month here, but now I wish it was three months. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I had never seen an oval in my life before, and, believe me, an oval 
has some pretty big teeth. When I came here the first week, it terrorized me. 
Now, I'm almost embarrassed to say I'm enjoying it." 
</P>
<P>
Other rookies who qualified included Dean Hall, a downhill skier from Olympic 
Valley, Calif., 216.975; Scott Goodyear of Canada, who made it last week at 
213.622; Buddy Lazier of Vail, Colo., whose father, Bob, drove in the 500 in 
1981, in a vulnerable 33rd spot at 209.418; and Jeff Andretti of Nazareth, Pa., 
Mario Andretti's youngest son, 210.268. 
</P>
<P>
When Jeff qualified, it made the Andrettis the first family to have four 
drivers in the 500. In addition to Mario, Michael and Jeff, there is also John, 
whose father is Mario's twin brother. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great feeling to see that checkered flag and realize it was a dream 
come true," Jeff Andretti said. "I had always been a spectator here before. Now 
I can appreciate what my father and Michael have gone through here over the 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Another rookie, Mike Groff, the American Racing Series champion from Los 
Angeles, was in the field for a few hours with a speed of 203.643, but he was 
bumped by Jim Crawford, who had spun out or crashed three times this month 
before making it into his fifth 500. 
</P>
<P>
Three-time winner Johnny Rutherford, who accepted a speed of 204.801 in a 
two-year-old Lola Cosworth, found himself bumped for the second year in a row 
when Stan Fox, who is better known as a midget-car driver, finished a 
surprisingly quick 213.812 run seconds before the 6 p.m. track closure. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-car field average speed is a record 217.252 m.p.h., 0.664 faster than 
last year.

SOVIETS LEARN LANGUAGE OF BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some men go to the Soviet Union to establish business relations, others to 
enhance diplomatic understanding. But there was Lou Frank detailing the infield 
fly rule and why it's illegal to tag up and leave a base before the ball is 
caught. He was getting the message across with the help of an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
The book of baseball rules, especially the complex aspects, can be equated to a 
foreign language. It was literally that for Frank when he went to the Soviet 
Union to instruct classes in how to be an umpire. For 26 days, he talked, 
demonstrated and critiqued the work of the officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was there to do the teaching, it became a learning experience for 
him, too. Surprisingly, he found the Soviets were acquainted with the 
accomplishments of Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Stan Musial and Lou Gehrig, plus 
contemporary players. 
</P>
<P>
"They even knew the major leagues had experienced a lockout because of labor 
contract problems and wanted to learn more about it," he said. "There must have 
been a million toasts between us. That's the Russian way. They were gracious, 
and the hospitality was superb. 
</P>
<P>
"As loyal Americans, we emphasized we loved our country dearly. Then we 
mentioned if Russia ever defeated the United States in baseball that it would 
have the same feeling we knew when our Olympic ice hockey team defeated theirs 
in 1980. Another point we tried to make is that to understand the American mind 
you have to understand baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Frank, a retired vice president of the Hecht Co., has been an amateur umpire in 
the Baltimore area for 15 years. A nephew, who is an exchange student in the 
Soviet Union, is a friend of an American, one Richard Spooner, who is involved 
in Soviet baseball. Spooner provided the contact that brought Frank to the 
Soviet Union for the purpose of explaining umpiring techniques. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't necessary to send umpires from organized baseball. Frank's awareness 
of the fine points of umpiring so exceeded the limited knowledge of the Soviets 
that he was regarded as the second coming of Bill Klem and Jocko Conlan. They 
use four umpires for all games, lacking uniforms and standard equipment but 
officiating more by committee than individual decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept telling them how they had to be more assertive and to end those 
committee meetings," explained Frank. "All the umpires had other jobs but most 
of the players were doing it full-time as a profession. They made around 350 to 
400 rubles, which translates to around $40 to $50 a month on the exchange rate. 
The umpiring has a long way to go, but they are earnest and conscientious and I 
believe are going to improve." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Willen and Larry Silverman, two Baltimore businessmen, provided some of 
the funds for Frank's trip. He took baseballs as gifts from the Orioles and 
reports that the Toronto Blue Jays bought a set of uniforms for one of the 
teams. "The players use gloves from Japan and Korea. Most of the balls came 
from Cuba and they complained about them. There's only one true baseball field 
in all of Russia. That's at Moscow State University and was built by a Japanese 
ambassador who loved baseball. It's an artificial turf field, with a wire fence 
around it, a press box and locker rooms." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the games, however, are played on soccer fields, which means either 
right or left field is abnormally short. They pitch without the benefit of a 
mound and the throwing speed is remindful of American batting practice. Often 
the balls they use are scuffed from wear and black as a lump of coal. 
</P>
<P>
Games were played in Simferopol and Eypretoria. Frank would observe and make 
suggestions as to the positioning of the umpires and how they went about making 
the calls. All the players used aluminum bats, and Frank quickly recognized 
Soviet baseball is a "hitter's game." 
</P>
<P>
Disputes with umpires would last all of two seconds because it's not in the 
Russian nature to argue and the players admitted they didn't know enough about 
the rules to offer a challenge in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing they did do when they were unhappy with a decision was to change 
their facial expressions to mirror disgust. So if looks could kill, some 
umpires would be stone-cold dead for calling a runner safe at the plate. But 
there are no vocal insults exchanged because in the Soviet Union, an umpire is 
afforded the same respect as a judge. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Durocher and Earl Weaver would have had to change their ways.

NO. 2 UCLA ELIMINATES USD, 5-1

<P>
The second-ranked UCLA men's tennis team defeated No. 17 University of San 
Diego, 5-1, in the second round of the NCAA Championships Saturday at Indian 
Wells. 
</P>
<P>
USD's Jose Luis Noriega, ranked sixth in the country, beat Jason Netter, 6-3, 
6-3, at No. 1 singles for USD's only victory. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (26-3) advanced to the third round today. USD finished 22-6. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed we didn't win any of the four, five or six singles 
matches," USD Coach Ed Collins said. "If we had won one of those, and with 
Noriega winning at No. 1, that would have helped our momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked and undefeated Tennessee lost the first two singles matches but 
rebounded to beat No. 19 UC Irvine, 5-2, and move into the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the second round, No. 3 Stanford, the two-time defending champion, 
breezed past Oklahoma State, 5-1; No. 4 Georgia eliminated No. 23 Northwestern 
from its first NCAA tournament, 5-2; Texas upset No. 5 Pepperdine, 5-3; No. 8 
and host Southern Cal beat South Carolina, 5-2; Miami, Fla., beat No. 15 
Arizona State, and No. 6 California beat No. 11 LSU, 5-3, in a match that 
lasted 6 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee was one of the 12 teams that drew first-round byes. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned before the match because we knew Irvine is a very good 
team," Tennessee Coach Mike DePalmer said. "We hadn't played in three weeks. 
When we were up, 4-2, after singles, I was a little bit more at ease because we 
haven't lost three doubles matches in about two years." 
</P>
<P>
The only doubles match the Volunteers needed was at No. 2, where Coenie de 
Villiers and John Gibson beat Carsten Hoffman and Mike Roberts, 2-6, 6-4, 6-2. 
The other two doubles matches were suspended when the Volunteers clinched the 
match.

CAL LUTHERAN FALLS IN CHAMPIONSHIP OF NAIA REGIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dream baseball season for Cal Lutheran came to an abrupt end Saturday in the 
NAIA Area 1 baseball championship in Portland, Ore., when host Lewis &amp; 
Clark throttled the Kingsmen, 20-6. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran had defeated Lewis &amp; Clark, 8-4, in the first game of a 
must-win doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of its victory, Lewis &amp; Clark advances to the NAIA World Series. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen (35-16), who went 7-3 in postseason play, won their first District 
3 title and advanced to the championship game of the double-elimination Area 1 
tournament despite losing the first game of both tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
With his team trailing, 3-1, in the fifth inning of the first game Saturday, 
CLU's Brian Lovelace pounded a two-run double. The Kingsmen scored two more 
runs in the inning on a sacrifice fly and a walk. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran's Pete Washington, who finished second in the district in home 
runs, went five for 10 on the day and hit his 13th and 14th homers. He drove in 
three runs and scored three more. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Rooney and reliever Chris Matkin allowed Lewis &amp; Clark 12 hits in the 
first game but combined to strike out five. 
</P>
<P>
Blake Babki seemed to typify CLU's efforts -- he went two for three in the 
first game and zero for five in the second. 
</P>
<P>
In the decisive game, Lewis &amp; Clark (31-14) scored four runs in the second 
inning, nine in the fourth, and five in the ninth and pounded out 20 hits.

ARNOLD LEADS MORNINGSIDE TO CIF TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
PREP TRACK: SOPHOMORE SPRINTER WINS 100-METER DASH IN MEET SHE MISSED LAST YEAR 
BECAUSE OF INJURY. 
</P>

<P>
Sophomore sprinter Santeshia Arnold led the Morningside High girls' track team 
to the CIF 2-A Division title at the Southern Section championship meet Friday 
at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold won the 100-meter dash, finished second in the 200 meters, anchored the 
Lady Monarchs' runner-up 400-meter relay team and ran on their victorious 
1,600-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Although results won't be official until Tuesday, pending the finish of the 
triple-jump competition, Morningside clinched the championship Friday by 
outscoring co-favorite Irvine Woodbridge, 83-46. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said Morningside didn't lose confidence despite being upset by St. 
Bernard in the 400-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some problems with the (baton) exchange between the second and third 
legs and we still were right there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold, who won the 100 and 200 meters at the Bay League championships last 
spring, missed the 1989 Southern Section finals because of a stress fracture in 
her foot, apparently caused by running on her toes too much. 
</P>
<P>
This season Arnold learned a new running style and said it was easy to get 
motivated for Friday's meet. 
</P>
<P>
"You think, 'I've got to get first so I can get the 10 points for the team,' " 
she said. "And (as an individual) you want to go to the state meet." 
</P>
<P>
The only other South Bay girl to win an individual event Friday was 
Morningside's Lisa Leslie, who won the high jump at 5 feet, 5 inches and was 
second in the long jump at 17-6 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard's Lisa Moxley anchored the winning 400-meter relay team and 
finished fourth in the 100 meters and fourth in the 300-meter low hurdles. She 
was responsible for eight of St. Bernard's 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
Moxley said the relay victory was a career highlight. "It meant something extra 
to us to beat Morningside," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's boys had their second consecutive strong outing in the 
1,600-meter relay, taking second with a time of 3:23.53 after a season-best 
3:21.74 last week. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Travion Harris, who is also recovering from a stress fracture, ran 
the anchor leg. "Although we have a few injuries, everybody did their best and 
performed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside finished second in the 400-meter relay with a time of 43:10.3. 
</P>
<P>
South Torrance hurdler Steve Smith finished second in the 110-meter high 
hurdles at 14.87 and fifth in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles at 40.23. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' 4-A Division, Torrance's Jennifer Tully took second in the long 
jump at 17-7 3/4, and Hawthorne was second to Pasadena Muir in the 4-A 
400-meter relay at 47.69.

<P>
CITY BASEBALL SEEDINGS PRODUCE BITTER FRUIT FOR POLY IN FIRST-ROUND UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To hear Jerry Cord tell it, Taft High should not have been sharing the same 
field with Poly. 
</P>
<P>
At least not in a first-round game of the City Section 4-A Division baseball 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Taft's competence was not in question: The Toreadors proved they were worthy 
Friday, upsetting top-seeded Poly, 7-6, in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Cord, Poly's coach, takes exception only to what he says was a last-minute 
switcheroo by City Section officials. By Cord's understanding, Poly was to open 
against North Hollywood, the second-seeded wild-card team. Taft, seeded No. 1 
among the four wild cards, was to play El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Poly and North Hollywood are both in the East Valley League and had played each 
other three times this season; El Camino Real and Taft are in the West Valley 
League. In an effort to add variety to the playoffs, the seeding system was 
scrapped and the pairings were changed to pit Poly against Taft and El Camino 
Real against North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Cord, who scouted the North Hollywood-Granada Hills game Wednesday, did not 
learn of the new pairings until he got a call from El Camino Real Coach Mike 
Maio on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"He called and asked me who I thought we were playing Friday," Cord said. 
</P>
<P>
Maio said he learned of the rescheduling when he called City officials Thursday 
to confirm his opponent and site. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew nothing about Taft," Cord said Saturday, clearly aggravated. "We 
didn't care because we were told we weren't going to play them." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Cord offered no excuses for the loss. Poly (22-3) stranded 16 runners, 
including two in the 10th and 11th innings. The Parrots also yielded six 
unearned runs, each of which scored with two out. 
</P>
<P>
"When you can't make that third out you don't deserve to win," he said. "We 
hadn't played like that all year long, not even close to that." 
</P>
<P>
Add Poly: Cord might consider the playoff format a form of gerrymandering, but 
City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness is largely unsympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness said the decision was made by the coaches in a meeting May 9. 
</P>
<P>
"(The coaches) were adamant that they wanted to play teams that were not in 
their own conference," he said. "We said if the wild-card teams work out that 
way, then we'll do it. 
</P>
<P>
"We seeded to their wishes. The bottom line is, what difference does it make 
who you play in a first-round game? Baseball is baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"If the wild-card situation continues to be a problem, then we'll eliminate the 
wild card from the playoffs and just take the first- and second-place teams." 
</P>
<P>
Puffy-eyed prognosticator: Maio, who is also co-coach of the El Camino Real 
football team, played fortune teller last fall when he informed the football 
team of his three dreams. In each, the Conquistadores upset mighty Granada 
Hills. Lo and behold, the team defeated the Highlanders in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
No predictions for baseball, however -- the soothsayer is sleepless. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm just staying up all night," he said. "I haven't had time to 
dream." 
</P>
<P>
Walk on the wild side: Kate Stoll hurled a no-hitter Friday to lead Ribet 
Academy to a 7-3 defeat of Oakwood in a Southern Section Small Schools softball 
playoff game. No one could touch her pitches, including, at times, her own 
catcher. Stoll walked 14 batters, which explains Oakwood's three runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Kate's not a pitcher and she does it because we have nobody else," Ribet Coach 
Judy Howard said of the converted catcher. "She's doing this because she's 
naturally talented." 
</P>
<P>
Natural talent or not, you can bet Stoll wouldn't want to catch those pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Absolute absolution: It seems Westlake third baseman Todd Preston redeems 
himself more often than a recycled aluminum can. Three times this season, 
Preston has committed a crucial error in a game and come back to drive in the 
winning run in that game. 
</P>
<P>
Preston is batting a cool .197 with 13 hits in 66 at-bats. He has, however, 
made the most of his precious few hits, driving in 15 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Friday against Mira Costa, Preston committed errors on the game's first two 
ground balls, which led to two unearned runs. Later, Preston absolved himself 
by rapping an RBI double in the sixth that broke a 4-4 tie. Westlake won, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Preston executed similarly against Camarillo and Thousand Oaks this season. 
</P>
<P>
Noted Coach Rich Herrera: "When he does get the hit, he does do the damage." 
</P>
<P>
Thriving on diving: John Kiani and Katie Savage, seniors at Granada Hills High, 
plunged to City diving championships recently at Venice High. Both Highlanders 
are used to success, however. 
</P>
<P>
This was Kiani's third consecutive City title; he has not lost in high school 
competition. Kiani won this year with a score of 491.90 for 11 dives. 
</P>
<P>
This was Savage's first City title but it helped erase the disappointment of a 
fourth-place finish last year. She posted an upset this year with a score of 
492.00. 
</P>
<P>
"In warmups she was missing every dive," said Tom Wagner, the Granada Hills 
swim coach. "But her first dive was outstanding and from then on she did 
fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Kiani and Savage are members of the Los Angeles Diving Team and receive expert 
instruction from Coach Van Austin. Savage is also coached by Dennis Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"Van Austin comes to our meets and actually coaches them even though he isn't 
connected with the high school," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
Their hard work has paid off in diving scholarships. Kiani will attend 
Michigan; Savage is headed for Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Although Birmingham has long been a City diving power, Granada Hills has been 
best off the board for several years. Savage followed in the footsteps of Janet 
Lautenschlager, who won the City title in 1988. Lautenschlager, now at Arizona 
State, finished seventh in Division I this year.

The Moorpark College Lady Raiders were damned if they did and damned if they 
didn't in the state softball championship. 
</P>
<P>
Each win would bring them closer to the title but would also mean at least 
seven more innings for overworked Robin Thomas, their only starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas (28-8) finally ran out of gas Saturday late in an 8-3 loss to Golden 
West that eliminated Moorpark from the tournament. The Lady Raiders finished 
30-11. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other schools in the eight-team field were armed with two quality 
pitchers, the importance of which was not lost on Moorpark Coach Will Thurston. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to have two strong pitchers, or one that is considered a bionic 
woman," Thurston said. "I haven't seen a team at this level that's been able to 
do that. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary goal is to win the state championship. We're knocking at the door, 
but we haven't had enough ammunition." 
</P>
<P>
Thurston couldn't fault his offense Saturday. The three runs marked Moorpark's 
best output of the tournament, and the Lady Raiders rallied twice to tie the 
score before Golden West (35-15) scored five runs in the top of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West took a 1-0 lead in the top of the second, but Moorpark rallied in 
the bottom of the inning. First baseman Chris Singer led off with a single off 
Pam Fogg and advanced to second on a single by catcher Missy Cress. After a 
sacrifice bunt by shortstop Gina Duarte moved the runners to second and third, 
Denise White hit a sacrifice fly that scored Singer. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the sixth, Lisa Kaufman belted Thomas' first pitch over the 
left-field fence for a two-run home run and Golden West led, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark rallied in the bottom of the sixth against Kaufman (24-8), who had 
replaced Fogg to start the inning. With one out, right fielder Tami Harp 
reached base on an error, stole second, and moved to third when center fielder 
Jamie Heggen beat out a grounder along the first-base line. Heggen, however, 
sustained a pulled hamstring and had to be replaced by pinch-runner Melissa 
Maples. 
</P>
<P>
After Thomas struck out, Singer walked to load the bases and Cress followed 
with a two-run single to shallow left that tied the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
But Golden West sent 10 batters to the plate in the seventh and turned five 
hits, a walk, and an error into five runs.

<P>
VALLEY'S CLARKE MAKES HER POINT -- 5,000 TIMES -- IN HEPTATHLON

<TEXT>
<P>
Melanie Clarke had difficulty concentrating Saturday during the second day of 
the heptathlon in the state junior college track and field championships at 
Santa Barbara City College. 
</P>
<P>
Her problem wasn't caused by nervousness, but rather by soreness in her lower 
back from an injury sustained in the high jump during the first day of the 
heptathlon. However, the soreness proved to be about the only challenge the 
Valley College freshman faced. 
</P>
<P>
The former El Camino Real High standout amassed 5,034 points to become the 
first athlete in five years to surpass the 5,000-point plateau in the state 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
Edwina Ammonds of King's River finished second with 4,698 and Donna Lee of Long 
Beach City placed third with 4,528. 
</P>
<P>
"(My back) hurt, but I just tried to block it out," said Clarke, who began the 
day 135 points ahead of Ammonds. "I couldn't focus on the long jump. I wanted 
to jump in the 18s, but I was just out there jumping. My mind wasn't on the 
meet." 
</P>
<P>
In the team competition, Taft won the men's title, outscoring Long Beach, 
96-90; Mt. San Antonio outpointed Long Beach for the women's title, 85-74. 
</P>
<P>
While Clarke was dominating the multi-event competition, several area athletes 
in individual events were having their problems. In the 400-meter intermediate 
hurdles, for example, Larry Sanders of Taft handed Glendale's Marty Beck his 
first loss of the year, running 51.06 seconds to Beck's 51.22. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's Dave Swanson placed second in the high jump (6 feet 11 3/4 inches) 
and Simone Cain of Ventura finished third in the 400 (55.36) and fourth in the 
200 (24.23). 
</P>
<P>
However Marji Gilles of Glendale, who tied for fifth in the heptathlon, came 
back to win the triple jump, bounding 37-3 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Carrillo of Moorpark (6,359) and Ryan Rapoza of Ventura (6,267) placed 
fifth and sixth in the decathlon and fifth and eighth in the open javelin with 
throws of 189-9 and 184-8. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Galindo of Ventura placed fifth in the 5,000 in 14:52.41. Noureddine 
Morceli of Riverside, the 1,500 winner in 3.47.65 and the national junior 
college record-holder at 5,000, won the longer race in 14:13.45. 
</P>
<P>
After posting the top marks in three of Friday's four events, Clarke, who has 
qualified for next month's TAC junior nationals in the 400, high jump, long 
jump and heptathlon, failed to place first in the long jump, javelin, and 800 
meters on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But she finished well enough. Clarke leaped 17-9 in the long jump, the 
second-best mark in the field, and recorded a personal best in the javelin at 
111-9, the fourth-best toss in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the 800, the final event, Clarke held a commanding 272-point lead over 
Lee and 328 points over Ammonds. 
</P>
<P>
Lee needed to beat Clarke by 25.9 seconds to win the competition, which proved 
to be too much. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke led through the first lap and went on to place second in 2:22.12. 
Ammonds was third in 2:22.7 and Lee took seventh in 2:41. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to win, but I would have liked to have been in the other events 
too," said Clarke, who had to pull out of several individual events after 
hurting an ankle in the Southern California meet. Clarke cleared 5-8 in the 
heptathlon high jump Friday -- a mark that would have won the open high jump by 
more than two inches.

DIGEST: DICKMANN, ERICKSON WIN DIVISION II HONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Debbie Dickmann and Lisa Erickson of Cal State Northridge have been named to 
the All-NCAA Division II women's softball team. 
</P>
<P>
Both seniors were first-team selections in voting by the National Softball 
Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Dickmann becomes the first Lady Matador player to be named to the first team 
four times. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Kathy Slaten was a first-team selection for Northridge from 1984-86 
after being named to the second team in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second year in a row that Erickson has been named to the first 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Dickmann is 27-7 with an 0.64 earned-run average, has struck out 174 batters 
and has walked 35 in 241 1/3 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Erickson, who is six for 12 with four runs scored in postseason 
play, is batting .382 with a team-high 41 runs and 45 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
The day his Moorpark College season ended, Mike Suarez began another chapter of 
his career by signing a letter of intent to play baseball at Arizona on a 
partial scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
A second baseman at Moorpark, Suarez expects to play third at Arizona, which he 
said was his top college choice. 
</P>
<P>
His scholarship is contingent on his earning an Associate of Arts degree, for 
which he needs two summer-school courses. 
</P>
<P>
Suarez hit seven home runs to set a Moorpark single-season record, and during 
the regular season he led the team in runs batted in (36) and in doubles (11). 
</P>
<P>
John Swanson, a sophomore center fielder from Oxnard College, has signed a 
letter of intent with Oklahoma State for a partial scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, from Rio Mesa High, batted .376 with 15 doubles and led Oxnard with 
six home runs and 15 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Giacoma of Notre Dame High and Rick Mekemson of Camarillo High have 
verbally committed to play soccer next season for Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
Giacoma, a midfielder, was an All-Southern Section pick last year. 
</P>
<P>
Mekemson, a fullback, was the Marmonte League defensive Player of the Year last 
season.

HILLTOP'S HILL THROWS 4TH NO-HITTER OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hilltop's Jackie Hill became the fifth pitcher in San Diego Section history to 
throw four no-hitters in a season, leading her team into the second round of 
the 3-A softball playoffs Saturday with a 5-1 victory over Mira Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, a junior, walked three and struck out seven. She had previous no-hitters 
against Lincoln, Grossmont and Montgomery.

The Lancers committed two errors, one of which allowed Mira Mesa to score an 
unearned run in the top of the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Hill dominated offensively as well with four of her team's six hits.

TERRY'S RECORD LIST GROWS BY TWO

<P>
The events and the years change, but the results are always the same for 
USDHS's Alison Terry. In every individual event she has entered in the San 
Diego Section swimming finals, she has not only won but set a record. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, a junior, went into Saturday's swimming and diving championships at Mt. 
Carmel High having already set section marks in four events, two as a freshman 
and two as a sophomore. This year, Terry set her sights on two new events -- 
the 200-yard individual medley and 100 butterfly -- and broke the records in 
them, too. 
</P>
<P>
Terry's was not the only repeat performance -- the Poway boys and girls swam 
away with team championships for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Poway had four individual boys' winners and scored 322 points to second-place 
Mt. Carmel's 205. The girls won the first event of the day, the 200 medley 
relay, and had 11 entries in the individual finals. None of its swimmers 
finished higher than second, but all of them either held or improved qualifying 
positions as the Titans defeated Rancho Buena Vista, 254-199. 
</P>
<P>
Terry swam the 200-yard IM in 2 minutes 5.71 seconds, bettering the 2:06.02 set 
by Hilltop's Tami Bruce in 1985. Later, Terry swam the 100 butterfly in 57.24, 
more than two seconds faster than any of her opponents, to bring down the 
longest-standing girls' mark of 57.52 set by Point Loma's Leslie Mendez in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman in 1988, Terry set marks in the 50 freestyle (24.09) and the 100 
backstroke (58.55). Last year, she broke records in the 200 freestyle (1:49.62) 
and 100 freestyle (50.56). She now owns section records in six of the eight 
girls' individual events. About the only question that remains: Will Terry come 
back as a senior and attack the 500 freestyle and 100 breaststroke? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't decided yet," she said. "I already swam the 50 and 100 back faster 
than the record times. I hear there's a freshman coming to our school next year 
that does a 1:52 in the 200 free. If that's the case, I might do that. I like a 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that would challenge Terry, who competed for the U.S. Junior National 
team at an event in East Germany during the winter, is the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a goal to be there in '92 (in Barcelona) or '96," she said. "No pain, 
no Spain. That's my slogan." 
</P>
<P>
Poway's boys got two victories each from Marc Fairon (1:58.03 in the 200 
individual medley and 59.0 in the 100 breaststroke) and Trevor Jamison (51.84 
in the 100 butterfly and 21.72 in the 50 freestyle). Of the 11 Poway swimmers 
to reach the finals, seven placed in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked tired the last couple of events," Poway Coach Dennis Moore said. 
"They're so competitive. I think a lot of our kids used most of their energy in 
the prelims (Wednesday and Thursday). They don't like to lose." 
</P>
<P>
USDHS's girls, who finished fourth with 151 points, won five finals. Leah 
Schraeder qualified third and sixth in the 50 and 100 freestyles, but won both. 
USDHS's 400 freestyle relay, anchored by Terry, qualified third but won in 
3:39.34. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
Alison Terry's time in the 200 individual medley qualified her for All-American 
honors from the National Interscholastic Swim Coaches of America. . . . Mira 
Mesa's Mike Picotte, who set section records in the 200 freestyle (1:38.44) and 
100 freestyle (45.21) last year, won both races again this year but was slower: 
1:40.47 and 45.64. . . . San Dieguito's Kari Lyderson claimed championships in 
the girls' 200 freestyle (1:51.5) and 500 freestyle (4:54.17).

<P>
So much for doctor's orders. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook's Brent Noon showed up at the San Diego Section preliminaries at 
Poway High Saturday and competed in both the shotput and discus despite being 
advised by a sports medicine specialist Thursday to wait at least another week 
because of a strained left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
Noon didn't listen, not because he didn't trust Dr. Dan Robertson, but because 
if he hadn't competed, he would have been forced to skip the section finals and 
state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Just 10 inches behind the national high school record in the shotput, Noon, a 
senior, was not about to let his last chance get away. 
</P>
<P>
So he taped the hamstring, threw the shot -- though he did so at half speed -- 
and . . . finished first at 61-feet- 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
This after he "walked through" the discus and won there at 168-5. 
</P>
<P>
Two throws, two firsts. 
</P>
<P>
Noon said he will reopen his challenge to Michael Carter's national record of 
77-0 at Saturday's section finals, taking the maximum six throws. Noon' best is 
76-2. 
</P>
<P>
Noon hopes it will take just one throw in the section discus to qualify for 
state and keep alive his chance to win two gold medals there. His best of 199-7 
leads the state. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Martz of Orange Glen came closest to Noon in the shot at 55-0. Jerry 
Gallardi of Carlsbad placed second in the discus at 162-8. 
</P>
<P>
On the track, Allison Dring of Mt. Carmel ran the 400 meters in 54.93, 
second-fastest ever in the section. Her previous best was 55.6. 
</P>
<P>
She also ran the third-fastest 200 in section history (24.43, improving her 
previous best of 24.6) and was a member of the 1,600-meter relay team that 
turned in the best time in the section this year, 3:58.38. 
</P>
<P>
There were two big disappointments, and the result is that the two best 
hurdlers in the county will not go head to head in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Williams of Escondido, nursing a strained right hip flexor, felt a pull 
at the start of the 110 high hurdles and pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
In the 300 intermediate hurdles, Eric Bell was leading his heat by five meters 
when his left foot got caught under the last hurdle. He tumbled to the ground 
and got up but finished fifth at 41.08 and did not qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Both did qualify in their specialties. Bell was the top qualifier in the 110 in 
14.46; he leads the section at 14.3. Williams leads the county in the 300 at 
38.4 and was the third fastest qualifier at 39.40. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's 400-meter relay team (Dwayne McAfee, Charles Brown, Marvin Green and 
Scott Hammond) turned in the fastest time in the county this year at 42.02. . . 
. Darney Scott of Kearny ran the fastest boys' 200 in the county this year, 
21.55. . . . Latasha McKinney of Monte Vista ran the fastest girls' 100, 11.90.

NO. 2 HOPES TO CATCH NO. 1 IN BEACH VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a deceiving game of tag. In pursuit is most of women's pro beach 
volleyball. Being pursued is the top-ranked and seemingly unstoppable team of 
Brazil's Jackie Silva and San Juan Capistrano's Janice Opalinski. 
</P>
<P>
But one pair is drawing closer than the rest. 
</P>
<P>
In the first two stops of the Flamingo Hilton Women's Pro Beach Volleyball 
Tour, Silva and Opalinski went undefeated in the double-elimination format for 
back-to-back championships. Losing twice in each stop -- all four times to 
Silva and Opalinski -- were second-ranked Patty Dodd of Colombia and Karolyn 
Kirby of San Diego, who have finished second each time. 
</P>
<P>
The hunt continues today at the San Diego Open, the third stop on the tour. 
After Saturday's opening rounds at Pacific Beach, only four teams remain in the 
championship bracket. Dodd-Kirby and Silva-Opalinski are among them. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the semifinals at 9:30 a.m., Dodd and Kirby will attempt to 
break what has become routine: make it to the final of the winner's bracket, 
lose to Silva-Opalinski, win the consolation final and lose to Silva-Opalinski 
again in the championship final. Last week in Santa Barbara, Silva-Opalinski 
won, 15-13. It was the most points anyone has scored against them. 
</P>
<P>
"Patty and I have the ability to beat them," said Kirby, 28, one of the newest 
and most successful members of the beach tour. "In time, we can be the best 
team on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
How much time is anyone's guess. Kathy Gregory, a tour veteran and ESPN 
commentator, said they have all the physical talent -- it's the mental 
preparation they need to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"They have all the tools," Gregory said, "but it's hard to go against Jackie 
and Janice. Their mental game is so much better than anyone else. You have to 
be hungry, and I don't know if they're as hungry as Janice and Jackie are." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kirby: "A lot of what we've done is on athletic ability only. The mental 
game is such a big part of it. Jackie and Janice go out to win. A lot of teams 
go out trying not to lose. They are so intense. We're trying to get to that 
point." 
</P>
<P>
It is the first season together for both Silva-Opalinski and Dodd-Kirby, but 
after Silva's total dominance of the tour last year -- she won 11 of 14 stops 
with two different partners -- and with Kirby still learning the finer points 
of the beach game, Dodd and Kirby have more catching up to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Karolyn's a great athlete," said Dodd, a five-year veteran. "She's 
complete in all her skills, but she's not at the peak of her game." 
</P>
<P>
Before Dodd-Kirby get another shot at Silva-Opalinski, they must first get past 
a pair of former Olympians, the No. 6 team of Linda Carrillo (Van Nuys) and 
Angela Rock (San Diego). They sent the only all-San Diego team, third-ranked 
Lori Kotas and Gail Castro, to the loser's bracket with a 15-5 victory.

CLAREMONT POET POST MORE THAN A SPOT TO FIND RHYMES

<P>
Four years ago, Charles Chase called police to report a theft. 
</P>
<P>
Chase told them someone had taken his "poet post." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators asked Chase to state its monetary value. None, Chase replied. 
"Only cultural." 
</P>
<P>
Thus ended the official investigation, although Chase did recover the post 
after a Claremont McKenna College student responded to his offer of a $50 
reward. 
</P>
<P>
Beloved by some, unnoticed by others and even disdained by some sidewalk poetry 
critics, over the last decade or so the post in its own small way has become a 
local institution, forever associated with the 75-year-old Chase and the 
eclectic, exotic folk music store and instrument museum he and his wife, 
Dorothy, have operated for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
There, Chase has put up poems by anyone who wants to write them for the reading 
pleasure of passers-by along Yale Avenue in this eastern San Gabriel Valley 
college town that's stereotypically called the city of trees and Ph.Ds. 
</P>
<P>
"The poet post means that, in Claremont, culture is not dead, at least in one 
part of Claremont," said regular post contributor James Pomeroy. He noted that 
auto rows and shopping malls loom ominously close to the bookshops, espresso 
bars and boutiques of the post's home in Claremont Village. "The fact that the 
poet post is there is a good sign, a good omen." 
</P>
<P>
Bookstore owner Charles A. Goldsmid agrees. "It reflects something special 
about Claremont," he said. "Sometimes when you read it, you get interesting, 
varied perspectives. Other times you walk away shaking your head." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Ellsworth, president of Pitzer College, one of the six Claremont 
Colleges, said: "I like the symbolism of it. It's the world of art writ large." 
</P>
<P>
The other day, as Chase stapled up two new poems, a gentle wind mussed his long 
and wispy white hair. With beard, leathery, wrinkled face and brow framed in 
white hair, he has the 19th-Century look of one of his favorite poets, Walt 
Whitman. 
</P>
<P>
"The poet post is not so much for the content as it is for the expression," 
Chase said as the sound of someone playing a hammered dulcimer inside the 
store, which is chock-a-block with instruments from around the world, filtered 
out to the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
No more thefts, except of poems, have occurred since Chase replaced the old 
post with a more secure one three years ago. A long, four-sided, rectangular 
box made of redwood now spins on a metal axis bolted to the storefront. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of times people see a poem they like on the post and they tear it off. 
That's quite all right," Chase said. "It's flattery to the poet." 
</P>
<P>
For 11 years, Chase has attached thousands of poems to five incarnations of the 
post in front of the Folk Music Center, which he and his wife opened after they 
moved from their native New England. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really critical of what the poets write, and I don't know anything 
about them or their personal lives," Chase said. "But I want them to write. 
They're feeling the muse, and there's no place they can get published or 
exposed except here." 
</P>
<P>
Current offerings include "Curtain Call," a tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier. 
Another, about welfare mothers and crack babies, ends with the phrase: 
"lifestyles of the poor and infamous." 
</P>
<P>
A third begins: 
</P>
<P>
 He thought he was being very profound 
</P>
<P>
 but it was really hard to reach him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kind of like the oil filter in my Plymouth: 
</P>
<P>
 down and under and behind and back. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for a post originated with Nancy Wing, a member of Chase's Claremont 
poetry critique group and a founder in 1959 of the Laguna Poets, a thriving 
group that sponsors weekly readings and occasional festivals in Orange County. 
"This was something we thought of doing in Laguna and never did," said Wing, a 
marriage and family therapist who writes, gives readings and sometimes has 
Chase tack her work to the post. 
</P>
<P>
"We have readings at Nick's Caffe Trevi once a month in Claremont," Wing said, 
"but the post is there every day." 
</P>
<P>
Chase knows of no other such poetry bulletin board, although he said that, 
occasionally, visitors from throughout the nation and the world declare that 
they plan to put one up when they return home. 
</P>
<P>
He is certain that the post has inspired submissions from people who have seen 
it on travels to Claremont. Once he got a poem from South Dakota, and an 
Anchorage man sent one inspired by the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill. Two lines 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 We only wanted a little oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a sewer the size of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 In the store's back room, where guitars, mandolins, violins and banjos awaited 
repair, Chase recently sifted through a sheaf of submissions. 
</P>
<P>
Voices of the poets resonated from the pages as Chase read a line here and 
there. Poets mused about smog, the Chinese rebellion in Tian An Men Square, and 
loves lost and won. 
</P>
<P>
One, signed by Capt. I. A. Coca and Scuddles, was written in longhand on brown 
wrapping paper. Another, about whales, was written on green-lined bookkeeping 
ledger paper. A poem about a black South African titled "Zantedeschia 
Aethiopica" (the scientific name for calla lily), was neatly typed on 
stationery from the Ontario Airport Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Chase said he doesn't know or care whether the post has launched poetry careers 
or been the springboard for publication in poetry reviews. Many poems appear on 
the post anonymously. Chase himself has never submitted his poems for 
publication, but he did self-publish three chapbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, poets whose work has appeared on the post say it means a great 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely got my start on the poet post," said Wade Stanley, 28, of 
Claremont, a Cal Poly Pomona senior majoring in English. "It was the only place 
I could put my poems and know that people were reading them." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley said he once found a note on the post that said: "Dear Wade, Call me 
and I will explain the universe to you." Stanley said, "For one moment, I 
thought: 'Wow! Women are putting their phone numbers on my poem. Me and Dylan 
Thomas.' But I called and she was completely against my poem." 
</P>
<P>
Regular post contributor Pomeroy, who works in a Harley Davidson motorcyle shop 
in Upland and at 23 wants to complete his undergraduate education so he can 
teach English, found a welcome audience. He lives nearby in the tract housing 
world of Rancho Cucamonga where, he said, poetry is not the talk of the town. 
</P>
<P>
"Claremont is such a beautiful community when it comes to arts, and somewhat 
bohemian," he said. "It helped me to feel included in a community where it was 
more likely that people would appreciate my poems."

WOO AIDE GETS HOLLYWOOD BLVD. CONSULTING JOB; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: CRITICS CHARGE CONFLICT OF INTEREST AFTER CONTRACT IS AWARDED 
WITHOUT BIDS OR MUCH ADVANCE NOTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded a $56,000 contract Thursday to an 
aide to City Councilman Michael Woo to organize Hollywood Boulevard merchants, 
prompting charges of conflict of interest and trickery. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, approved that morning by the city's Community Redevelopment 
Agency, which provided the funding, was given to Woo aide Nina Greenberg 
without competitive bidding and with little advance notice or fanfare. Chamber 
President Larry Kaplan, a top Woo aide until last year, said he selected 
Greenberg for the contract at the urging of Woo and CRA officials. Kaplan added 
that competitive bids were not required. 
</P>
<P>
The move fueled a longstanding conflict in which critics have charged that Woo, 
who represents Hollywood, and the CRA and chamber with working in concert to 
plan the massive Hollywood Boulevard revitalization effort, disregarding the 
needs and wishes of local merchants and residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice deal. That is so political I can't believe it," said Robert Goldfarb, a 
local merchant and member of the chamber's board of directors. He said the 
board had no prior knowledge of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, who will leave Woo's employ to take the consulting job, will be 
responsible for carrying out the chamber's contract with the CRA to organize 
business owners to carry out the objectives of the Hollywood Redevelopment 
Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants expressed outrage that one goal of the new consultant, as 
approved by the CRA, is to set up an assessment district in which merchants 
will be asked to pay for area improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The boulevard, said CRA Administrator John Tuite, has "unique needs that the 
city can't fully address," but that the consultant could, particularly by 
creating the assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan, however, said the CRA misstated the chamber's position, and that the 
assessment district is just "an option we are considering seriously." 
</P>
<P>
The $56,000 will pay salary and expenses for Greenberg, Woo's crime issues 
deputy, who will work in the chamber office full time, Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said she is "excited about the job," but refused to discuss her new 
or old salary. The City Controller's Office said Greenberg's annual salary is 
$32,427, and she joined Woo's staff in October, 1988. Her contract with the 
chamber will be renewed for another year "if services are satisfactory," the 
CRA said. 
</P>
<P>
Woo was on vacation, and not available for comment. But Greenberg, Woo 
spokeswoman Julie Jaskol, CRA spokesman Marc Littman and Kaplan all defended 
the selection of Greenberg and the way in which it was done. 
</P>
<P>
"I can predict what (critics) are going to say, that it's a scam," Kaplan said. 
"This is the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, and I can sole source (a contract 
without bidding) when I want. And Nina has proven that she can do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
"It became clear that a (consultant) might be a really efficient way to get 
done what everybody wants done; the cleanup, the anti-crime improvements," said 
Jaskol. "It's not like everybody got together and crowned her." 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb, manager of the McDonald's restaurant on Hollywood Boulevard, echoed 
some other merchants who complained that they were not notified of the 
impending contract, Greenberg's hiring and the possibility of assessment fees. 
In fact, Greenberg and CRA officials said nothing of the plans during a meeting 
they attended at McDonald's on Tuesday, in which about 40 merchants complained 
bitterly about area conditions and the ineffectiveness of Woo and the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
"This just shows, again, that we can't believe them, we can't trust them, we 
get open promises and we are being led down a primrose path while the entire 
machinery of the city infrastructure is broken," Goldfarb said. 
</P>
<P>
For years, many merchants have been critical of the city's response to the 
crime, graffiti and other urban blight in Hollywood, particularly the failure 
to get increased police foot patrols on the boulevard to make tourists feel 
safer. As Woo's crime deputy, Greenberg should have done more, Goldfarb said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a manipulative move to control merchants on the boulevard. That is what 
this is about," said Ruth Goulet, a member of the Hollywood Project Area 
Committee, an elected body that Woo replaced as the official citizen advisory 
group on the redevelopment project in favor of his own group last year. 
</P>
<P>
Marguerite Power, owner of Hollywood Celebrity Florist, said she was especially 
disturbed that the CRA said merchants were going to be asked to pay "for things 
we are really entitled to. I am very disturbed by it and wondering what 
recourse there is to take on this." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, said Power, "who is (Greenberg) to be getting so much money? She's no 
elected official." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Doreet Hackman and an aide to Woo set up the Hollywood 
Merchants' Assn. at the councilman's request. Hackman, now the elected 
president of the association, said she was "let down" because merchants were 
left out of the selection process and will get none of the money. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so outrageous and so terrible that it is hard to understand," Hackman 
said. "It's so clear that no benefit will be there for the merchants. They will 
be used to please whatever Michael Woo has in mind."

THE BOYS OF THE BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
It was midnight, and the driver of the late-model blue Mercedes had spent a few 
minutes cruising Santa Monica Boulevard before pulling up near one of several 
young male prostitutes beckoning from the curbside. 
</P>
<P>
The youth leaned into the car, his face just inches away from that of the 
middle-aged driver. A moment later, he scurried around to the passenger side, 
hopped in, and the sedan slid off into the night. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario would be repeated many other times that night along a stretch of 
the boulevard that runs from the eastern fringes of West Hollywood well into 
Hollywood, and on other nights and days as well. 
</P>
<P>
It is happening so often these days, in fact, that residents and merchants are 
up in arms, and police are sending vice reinforcements to the area to combat 
what they say is a rising incidence of male prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
For years, it was the female prostitution trade flourishing along Hollywood and 
Sunset boulevards that disrupted the business community and residential 
neighborhoods, and heavily taxed law enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Hollywood vice officers say, male prostitution has become a far worse 
blight. Even more worrisome, they say, are the public health implications, 
because male prostitutes are far more likely to be infected with the AIDS 
virus, and because some unsafe homosexual sex practices are far more likely 
than heterosexual encounters to transmit the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities and social service agencies estimate that as many as one in four 
male prostitutes are already carrying the AIDS virus. And they say a sizable 
percentage of the male prostitutes add to the AIDS risk by being drug abusers, 
sometimes injecting drugs with shared needles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are signing some death warrants," said Lt. Peter Durham, head of 
the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood vice unit. "It scares the hell 
out of me, and it scares the hell out of my men." 
</P>
<P>
Many of Durham's men fear arresting male prostitutes, who they say bite, 
scratch and spit at them. "One officer was bitten, and the guy said, 'I've got 
AIDS and I hope you die,' " Durham said. He said the deputy had to undergo 
monthly tests for the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Durham stressed that prosecution of male prostitutes "is not a gay issue" and 
that most prostitutes he has encountered say they are not homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the prostitutes are young runaways, looking for quick food and drug 
money and a way off the harsh streets of Hollywood, even if just for the night 
or a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I quit last year," said Dave, 18, "because I got tired of having middle-aged 
men looking at me like I was a piece of garbage, and having to sleep with them 
just for a place to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Dave, who said he worked the streets through most of his teens, has seen the 
number of male prostitutes rise and fall with the seasons, sporadic police 
enforcement efforts and other factors. One constant, he said, was that the male 
prostitutes show few, if any, signs of practicing safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
"These are kids who are self-destructive. They are committing a slow suicide 
out there," said Ann Donahue, executive director of Covenant House California, 
a shelter for runaway and homeless youth. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems amazing to me that in the era of AIDS there are johns willing to pick 
up these kids knowing what a high risk they are," Donahue said. "And yet they 
still do. It doesn't seem to have abated in any way." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, added Jack Allen, who coordinates the street outreach program for the 
Gay and Lesbian Community Service Center, many customers are willing to pay a 
prostitute more for engaging in unsafe sex practices, such as forgoing a 
condom. 
</P>
<P>
Allen spends a few hours a day talking to the prostitutes, trying to direct 
them to shelters, job training programs and medical centers and giving them 
free condoms and bleach for their needles. 
</P>
<P>
"It is really frightening when you think about it, the rate of the disease 
spreading in this particular population," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A recently passed state law requires that anyone convicted of prostitution be 
tested for the AIDS virus. They must be notified if they test positive, and any 
further arrests for prostitution are prosecuted as felonies, said Durham, the 
LAPD vice unit chief. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, police keep arresting the prostitutes, and they keep returning to 
the streets, often within hours. "It is a society problem, and I don't see a 
police solution," Durham said. 
</P>
<P>
That has not stopped police from trying. On a recent sweep, LAPD officers 
arrested more than 60 prostitutes, the vast majority of them men. And more 
enforcement efforts are in the works, Durham said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Prostitution) is up currently on Santa Monica (Boulevard), and I don't have a 
real good reason for it," Durham said last week. "There is no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
According to LAPD statistics, the Hollywood area has had more prostitution 
arrests, male and female, than any other part of the city this year. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. John Fletcher, in the LAPD's citywide vice enforcement office, said the 
four worst city areas for prostitution are Hollywood, MacArthur Park, the 
Newton Division south of downtown and the Figueroa Street corridor. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, police made 117 prostitution-related arrests in March, the most 
recent month for which figures are available. The total was 443 for the first 
three months of the year. (They do not break down prostitution arrests by sex.) 
Last year they made 431 prostitution-related arrests through March, and 1,975 
arrests the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for what he expects to be a very busy summer, Durham said he is 
diverting many of his vice officers down to Santa Monica Boulevard, even though 
the hot weather also is bringing out more female prostitutes. With the gamut of 
other vice-related offenses occurring around the clock in Hollywood, his 
enforcement teams will be stretched very thin, Durham said. 
</P>
<P>
One explanation for the increase in activity in Hollywood is that many of the 
male prostitutes have moved eastward as a result of a crackdown in West 
Hollywood earlier this year. An all-night hamburger stand there that was a 
haven for drug dealing and prostitution was shut down as a nuisance. And the 
city of West Hollywood evicted a free-meal program from Plummer Park and banned 
sleeping in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to find greener pastures, I guess you'd call it," said Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Sgt. H. Snyder at the West Hollywood sheriff's substation. 
Deputies, who provide police services to West Hollywood, still arrest about 20 
male prostitutes a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder estimated that there are several thousand male prostitutes in Los 
Angeles and that many roam back and forth between West Hollywood and Hollywood. 
That way, when they become too familiar to police and judges in Los Angeles, 
they can move across the city line and start over with a new police force and 
new judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
"You can literally stand there and watch them troop across from Hollywood into 
West Hollywood to work the streets," said Edward Riney, a member of the Eastend 
Community Action group and the West Hollywood Crime Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
While Riney and dozens of other residents held a rally last Saturday night to 
call for increased police action, about 18 male prostitutes loitered on the 
opposite street corner. Some of them cursed the residents; others watched out 
of curiosity and indifference. 
</P>
<P>
On several recent nights, patrol cars seemed to be everywhere on and around 
Santa Monica Boulevard. But the instant they passed, male prostitutes would 
emerge from the shadows, from behind bus benches or alleys, or from side 
streets and go back to their preferred waiting spots. Many never even bothered 
to hide their street-walking activity. 
</P>
<P>
It is that brazenness that has irritated the merchants along the popular 
thoroughfare and the residents on the side streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally out of hand," said Maxine Weinman, owner of Maxine's Seafood Cafe 
in a mini-mall at Santa Monica and Highland Avenue. Weinman said a dozen or so 
male prostitutes work out of the parking lot and a nearby doughnut shop day and 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"They have made it their little home. They hang out in front of it, on the side 
of it, in the parking lot," Weinman said. "They have hurt my business -- there 
is no question about it. And they accost my customers, who don't want to get 
out of their cars." 
</P>
<P>
Things have gotten so bad at that corner that the property owner hired a 
security guard, Mario Vasquez. Attired in a snappy black-and-white uniform, but 
without a gun, Vasquez on a recent afternoon was poking around the parking lot, 
looking for loiterers. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking mostly in Spanish, Vasquez said he is afraid of male prostitutes 
because they fight him when he tries to force them off the property. "Sometimes 
my job is difficult," he said, displaying a knife wound and saying a male 
prostitute had slashed him. "Even in the afternoon it is terrible -- a lot of 
people come looking for the prostitutes." 
</P>
<P>
Weinman and others say that a security guard and heightened police presence in 
the area are useless and that even the countless arrests don't help. 
</P>
<P>
"The jails are overcrowded now, so they pay their fines and they're right back 
out on the street," Weinman said. "I don't know who to complain to at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
William Hasley and residents of Curson Avenue are complaining to police. 
</P>
<P>
On Curson just north of Hollywood Boulevard is a row of million-dollar homes 
that has become a popular spot for the prostitutes to bring customers. Hasley 
and 40 other residents met with Durham one night last week to express their 
anger and concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been walking my dog, and they'll be going at it right there in the car, 
day or night," said Hasley. "I rap on the window and a businessman looks up 
like he's having a heart attack. . . . But (such intervention) could get 
dangerous. One of them could have a gun." 
</P>
<P>
Durham said his officers have arrested 24 people on Curson recently, mostly 
males. He said he sympathized with the residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about you, but if that was happening in my neighborhood I'd be 
mad as hell. How do explain to your kids what those two people in the car are 
doing to each other, whatever it is they are doing?" 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, merchants and residents praise the police for their efforts. 
But Durham told the Curson crowd what police have been telling residents for 
years when they complain about prostitution: that authorities depend on 
organized watch groups to call them when illegal activity is spotted. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants along Sunset and Hollywood boulevards even chipped in a few years ago 
to buy police a computer to keep track of female prostitutes so their rap 
sheets could be accessed immediately. Otherwise, those using aliases often 
escaped the harsher sentences given to repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Now the computer has 15,000 names in it, Durham said, adding that police 
efforts to clean up female prostitution were aided by the opening of a 
Hollywood division of Municipal Court and by pressuring motels to stop offering 
rooms at hourly rates. 
</P>
<P>
Durham remembers being a Hollywood vice officer in 1980 and spotting 175 
prostitutes one night on a stretch of boulevard between Normandie Avenue and 
Crescent Heights Boulevard. "I'll buy you a steak dinner," he said, "if you go 
down there today and see 20 whores." 
</P>
<P>
The female prostitutes are still around, but are a much less visible and 
chronic problem. Increasingly, Durham said, they are traveling to Las Vegas 
when there is a big-ticket fight or other event, and even to Hawaii, taking 
advantage of low air fares and the booming tourist business there. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents say the confrontational nature of the male prostitutes and their 
mobility will require more cooperation between city and county officials. 
</P>
<P>
A few years back, police cleaned up a male prostitution problem on Santa Monica 
Boulevard with help from Weinman and other concerned merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"Now there is just a total infestation of them again," Weinman said. "They've 
got to find some way to put these people in jail. The problem is they all know 
they can get away with it, and that I am helpless."

NOW, DRUMMOND IS ACCUSED OF CONFLICTS

<TEXT>
<P>
City Council candidate James Serles tried last week to turn the tables on his 
3rd District opponent, Doug Drummond, accusing Drummond of aligning himself 
with wealthy development interests. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond, a dark-horse candidate greatly outspent by Serles in the primary, 
forced Serles into the June 5 runoff largely on the strength of 
conflict-of-interest allegations linking Serles' votes as a planning 
commissioner with developer contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Now Serles, a dentist who has twice before sought the 3rd District seat, is 
complaining that Drummond's political consultant, Tim Carey, heads a 
pro-development political action committee funded by wealthy business and 
development interests. 
</P>
<P>
Serles also said the developers' committee, the Southern California Caucus, has 
targeted him for defeat because he supports developer fees and has voted to 
lower the density of the city's residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Drummond should be asked to explain why he has decided to seek an alliance 
with the executive director of the largest pro-development PAC in Southern 
California," Serles said in a prepared statement, later adding: "It just 
doesn't make sense that Mr. Carey is handling Mr. Drummond's campaign and is 
the key player in the Southern California Caucus." 
</P>
<P>
Both Drummond and Carey denied that the caucus was in any way involved in the 
race for the 3rd District seat, left open by Jan Hall's decision not to run for 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about it. What is the Southern California Caucus?" asked 
Drummond, a retired police commander. "I have never received any outside 
support in the form of mailers, supplies, materials, money or anything that is 
not in my campaign statement." 
</P>
<P>
Drummond said he hired Carey to design his campaign mailers after deciding that 
he could use professional help with that task. "I'm upset that I have a guy who 
raised $175,000, and he's pointing to me and saying I'm running some kind of 
wham-bam Madison Avenue campaign," Drummond continued. "I wish someone would 
come in and point out where these Madison Avenue folks are.' 
</P>
<P>
Carey said it is absurd to conclude that just because he was executive director 
of the caucus, the caucus was working to elect Drummond. "The caucus is not 
involved in that election," Carey said. "We were not involved in the primary, 
and we have not made any effort to be involved in the general. Nor are our 
members." 
</P>
<P>
Carey described his mailer work for Drummond as a free-lance job he is doing 
through his small political consulting firm, Carey &amp; Associates of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Founded three years ago with the support of Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum, the caucus has poured money into the campaigns of pro-development 
candidates throughout Southern California. Rather than contributing directly to 
the candidates or working with them, the caucus mounts independent campaigns on 
their behalf and in that way escapes spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
Serles, asserting that Drummond's mailers fit the pattern of hit pieces written 
by the caucus in other local races, also pointed out that Drummond's campaign 
has accepted a $1,000 donation from Mola Development Co. of Orange County, 
which has also contributed to the caucus. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond said Mola gave money to his campaign because he is a friend of one of 
the company's executives, Peter von Elten, who is running for the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond added that he is not supporting Von Elten or any other candidate in 
that race. 
</P>
<P>
During the primary, Drummond accused Serles of violating the state Political 
Reform Act by accepting hundreds of dollars in campaign contributions from four 
developers and businessmen, then voting for projects they brought before the 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach city prosecutor later cleared Serles of wrongdoing, saying that 
although two of those votes were improper, they were not made with criminal 
intent. 
</P>
<P>
Serles has said the votes, which remain under investigation by the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission, were oversights. He has since sued Drummond, 
asserting that Drummond's mailers about the votes were libelous.

RENT CONTROL SEEN AS UNJUST, HARMFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why is there such turmoil with Santa Monica rent control and its board? Very 
simple, it doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
As much as (Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights) and the proponents of this 
unjust system proclaim that it works, the results are obvious. 
</P>
<P>
We have deteriorating apartment buildings, under-the-table bribes for vacant 
units (which are going to wealthy tenants), an out-of-control Rent Control 
Board whose budget is greater than the Los Angeles board's. 
</P>
<P>
This uncontrolled monster, rent control, forces some of our elected officials 
to push for unwanted projects, like the airport development, for the sole 
purpose of increased revenue for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The political pendulum is swinging, and a needed change in an archaic system is 
about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has lived with decontrol-recontrol for over 12 years. The results 
there are a competitive rental market, with effective rents staying the same 
for the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
Rent subsidies are important for the truly needy. But they should be handled 
like food stamps so that all taxpayers subsidize the program, not a select few 
landlords.

UCLA SHOULD BUILD A SCHOOL AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would be a real boon to Santa Monica to have UCLA build an elementary school 
at Los Amigos Park or at either of the present elementary school sites in Ocean 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the thought of having a school built on a park appalled me, until I 
realized that there will be a school built there anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Having UCLA build it not only saves the Santa Monica school district the task 
of building a school, but provides the community with higher quality and more 
progressive education for our children. The money saved will allow the school 
district to spend more on other schools in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, it eliminates the school district's need to develop or sell the 
John Muir and Washington schools' sites to raise money to build the much-needed 
new school. Thus, those sites have a good chance of maintaining some open space 
and, in the case of Washington school, possibly a park. 
</P>
<P>
All other open areas near Washington School on 4th Street in the southwest 
section of Ocean Park have recently been built on by the city. We need open 
space more than we need more condominiums. It seems that the best way to do 
that and to provide our children with a valuable new school environment is to 
welcome (University Elementary School) to our community.

<P>
The subjects were diaper rash and American geography. 
</P>
<P>
The setting: Room 9 at Bassett Adult School, where baby bottles and health 
posters get equal billing with textbooks and maps. 
</P>
<P>
The program, called Genesis, was started in September to provide a transitional 
classroom setting where pregnant girls and adolescent mothers and fathers could 
finish high school. The state Department of Education pays the school $6,000 a 
year for each student. The 18 students bring their babies with them to morning 
classes in "parenting and life skills" and independent study of standard high 
school subjects in the afternoon. No one has dropped out, and five of the 
students are to get diplomas next month. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go to college and support myself," said Shirley Miranda, 17, who 
will graduate in June. 
</P>
<P>
"With programs like this, there is just no excuse not to continue school," 
added Miranda, who has a 2-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Genesis is one of five such programs in the San Gabriel Valley, which had an 
estimated 18,000 teen-age mothers at the time of a 1986 survey conducted by 
Planned Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
"Since that study, there has probably been an increase of 20% or 30%," said Pam 
Garcia, education director of the Pasadena branch of Planned Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
About 20% of girls who get pregnant drop out of high school, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, students who find out they're pregnant, or after they start showing, 
drop out of school because they feel awkward," said Vicky Rossier, one of the 
teachers in the Genesis program. "While the students in the regular school 
worry about parties and football games, these girls have to worry about diapers 
and midnight feedings. It's nice to have others who share these same 
responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Genesis students attended Bassett High School. A few had gone to 
West Covina High, which does not offer a program for mothers, or to Covina 
High, whose program is for mothers-to-be only. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, the Genesis program has only female participants. "We really 
didn't target teen fathers this year," Rossier said, "but that's definitely 
something for the future. A coeducational type of program would be great. It 
would balance the responsibility between the father and the mother." 
</P>
<P>
The adult school had previously offered a "Parent Links" program, in which 
teen-age mothers could take a one-hour parenthood class in an otherwise 
standard high school curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
The Genesis program, which includes child care next to the classroom, is more 
practical, students and administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
"This program is a lot better," Miranda said. "It allows you to be with your 
child more." 
</P>
<P>
Rita Laroux, Bassett Adult School principal, added: "With this program, the 
students can bond with their children, get a lot of support from each other and 
have a curriculum that is tailored to their particular needs." 
</P>
<P>
One of the main issues discussed in class is sexual responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"There are students here who wanted to get pregnant," said Susan Briscoe, who 
teaches the morning sessions. "They were in unhappy situations and thought that 
a baby would give them unconditional love. What they didn't think about was the 
24-hour responsibility that comes with having a baby." 
</P>
<P>
Antoinette Ballesteros, 16, said she and her boyfriend decided to have a baby 
in order to cement their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going to move away with his parents, so we thought a baby would bring 
us closer and keep us together," Ballesteros said. "We were supposed to move in 
with his parents and everything was going to work out fine, but all our plans 
backfired." 
</P>
<P>
Her boyfriend moved away after all, she said. Her daughter, Ashley, is a year 
old. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros said that she loves Ashley and doesn't regret having her but that 
she now believes she should have waited until after high school graduation to 
become a mother. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Ballesteros, Antoinette's mother, said she wishes she had been more 
candid with her daughter about sex and relationships. "Things have been real 
hard for her," she said. "She had to grow up so fast and take on a lot of 
responsibility. . . . You just can't help but blame yourself and think of all 
the things you should have done. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a lot more open with my other daughter now," she continued. "What we all 
have to realize is that things are so different now. When I was growing up, you 
waited until you were married . . . but we are living in a whole new world." 
</P>
<P>
Rossier said another problem among students is ignorance about contraception. 
</P>
<P>
"We have girls here who have had babies, but they don't fully understand how a 
baby is conceived. There are still girls out there with the mentality that 'It 
won't happen to me' or that you can't get pregnant your first time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia of Planned Parenthood said parents and teachers need to do more to 
inform teen-agers about sex. "We have to educate parents and schools to talk 
openly about sex," Garcia said. "We have to teach these kids that sex isn't 
free, that there is a price to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is that we still don't feel comfortable talking to our 
kids about sex." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said that mothers in their teens are in danger of becoming pregnant 
again but that programs such as Genesis can help prevent this. 
</P>
<P>
Rossier agreed. "We see the changes in the students. They have more 
self-confidence, they have more hope for the future, they are more 
goal-oriented. They are much more responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the students have spoken to classes at local junior high schools about 
the realities of pregnancy and parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want my daughter to have a baby when she is a teen-ager," 
Antoinette Ballesteros said. "I am going to be very open with her. I don't want 
her to be afraid to talk to me about sex or anything else."

$9.2 MILLION FOR UNITED WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley Region of the United Way has raised a record $9.2 
million in its 1989-90 fund-raising drive. 
</P>
<P>
The total represents a 7.3% increase over last year. Dr. Larry Papay, campaign 
chairman, said special credit goes to 400 businesses and individuals, many of 
them Latino and Asian Pacific, who contributed this year for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley Region's campaign was part of the Greater Los Angeles 
United Way effort that raised more than $95 million. The San Gabriel Valley 
Region of United Way supports a local network of 65 health and human service 
agencies, funding programs to fight illiteracy, substance abuse and AIDS, and 
to help children and the elderly.

ALL-SEX TALK SHOW WINS AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From tiny KFOX-FM in Redondo Beach, JoAnn Woodward -- no relation to Paul 
Newman -- tells Los Angeles whatever it wants to know about sex every Wednesday 
morning on "South Bay Sex." 
</P>
<P>
Although other programs feature doctors or psychologists who dispense advice 
about sex and other topics, hers is the only radio talk show in the Los Angeles 
Basin devoted exclusively to sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward, a certified nurse practitioner, said she began the show, which is 
oriented toward women, three years ago because "women have a lot of questions 
that they need answered." Since then, the program has attracted a small but 
devoted audience that includes counselors who advise their clients to tune in. 
</P>
<P>
The program is aired from 8:30 until 9 a.m. on KFOX (93.5 FM), a station that 
sells time to people who want to produce their own broadcasts. The eclectic mix 
on KFOX has included a feminist businesswoman's program, fundamentalist 
religion and a dating service. 
</P>
<P>
The station, with offices just off the Redondo Beach Pier, reaches an area 
stretching from Malibu to Laguna Beach and inland as far as downtown Los 
Angeles, the San Fernando Valley and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Although Woodward's breezy presentation, intermixed with advertisements for her 
nursing practice, is not the polished professional format found on larger 
stations, she has dealt with topics many others would not touch. 
</P>
<P>
Some recent programs have been devoted to masturbation, the role of the 
clitoris in society, sexually transmitted diseases (with graphic descriptions 
of symptoms), and the latest in condoms, a model designed for women. 
</P>
<P>
"I swear I'm not making it up," she said of the last topic. "They call me the 
Dr. Ruth of the South Bay." 
</P>
<P>
Although she speaks frankly on the air, Woodward said she has not been a target 
of obscene or abusive phone calls, even after a program devoted to the subject 
of abortion. "I have never gotten calls from fundamentalists," said Woodward, 
who described her program as a "pro-choice show." 
</P>
<P>
This week, Woodward's guest was Shelley Lessin Stockwell, a former airline 
stewardess and author of the forthcoming book "Sex and Other Touchy Subjects." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll keep all the flight attendant jokes out of this," Woodward told 
Stockwell in opening the program. "What got you interested in the field of 
sexuality?" 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised in the school of the double standard," Stockwell said. "It was 
very clearly brought home that my job in life was to remain a virgin, go to 
college, snag myself a nice, professional man using my sexuality as the bait 
and have lots of children and live happily ever after." 
</P>
<P>
Stockwell said that plan was derailed in the 1970s "when people were going hog 
crazy wild." She recalled once going with her gynecologist to "some people's 
house, and they were having an orgy. I was horrified. It was so opposite to the 
way I have been raised. That was my first sexual eye-opener to how people were 
behaving in the 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
Some time later, she said, she made love to her boyfriend "in a very loving 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, she said, "all I could think of is, 'They lied to me. They told me 
-- they meaning society, my parents -- that if you made love before you got 
married, that a man would use you, he wouldn't respect you and the relationship 
would end, basically, because you had to be a virgin. 
</P>
<P>
"And what I found was that we were closer and more bonded and more intimate, 
and I felt so cheated that I had wasted all that time when I could have been 
intimate because of that obscure rule that didn't make any sense to me." 
</P>
<P>
At this, Woodward interjected: "However, we don't recommend that you have 
sexual activity until you are ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Stockwell took a call from a woman identifying herself as 
Camille. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been involved in a monogamous relationship for years, for well before 
AIDS became a household word," Camille began. 
</P>
<P>
"And recently that relationship ended and I started to date again. I would like 
your perspective on how to approach the subject of AIDS with a prospective 
lover . . . how soon in a relationship it should be approached, and in a way 
that it is not calculating." 
</P>
<P>
Stockwell responded: "Well, I don't think at hors d'oeuvres at your first 
dinner date would be appropriate. 'Gee, it's so nice to meet you. What a lovely 
suit, and by the way, do you have AIDS?' 
</P>
<P>
"But somewhere early on, maybe after the first smooch or something. I don't 
know. What do you think, JoAnn? You're an expert on this." 
</P>
<P>
Woodward advised posing the question early in the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never too soon to approach it," she said. "It's important for you to talk 
about it because it's on everybody's mind. I think that a person who hears you 
talk about it will have a lot of respect for your self-esteem and how highly 
you value your health and safety." 
</P>
<P>
Camille seemed a bit dubious about this. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'll give it a wing," she said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
Stockwell took one more call, from a woman who wanted to know how to put aside 
workday worries when she gets home from the office. 
</P>
<P>
The answer: Visualize a shelf attached to the outside of your house and imagine 
yourself making a tidy package of "work." Place the package on the shelf and 
ignore it until it's time to leave for work the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days of the program, Woodward confided in an interview, she asked 
friends to call in questions, but she said that is no longer necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first did this show three years ago, I had 'prepped' callers, but my 
friends have long since stopped calling. You can't ask someone every Wednesday 
morning, 'Do me a favor. . . .' It ended a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
Although KFOX does not subscribe to the Arbitron radio audience rating service, 
Woodward and others say "South Bay Sex" has a devoted audience. 
</P>
<P>
Brooke McIntyre, South Bay Free Clinic's services director, said Woodward is 
serving a useful purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot more people are coming in for checkups as a result of her show," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She added: "People I know as friends comment about her show and how informative 
it was and how wonderful it was for them." 
</P>
<P>
Cam McCarthy, a licensed marriage, family and child counselor in Manhattan 
Beach, advises her clients to tune in to Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
"She will answer things over the air that everyone wanted to know but never had 
the guts to ask. You can listen to it while you are washing the dishes or 
driving a car or whatever. . . . It reaches people who aren't going to be 
reached in other ways."

HOT PROPERTY: 'SHE-DEVIL' BUYS BRENTWOOD TUDOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROSEANNE BARR, star of the ABC-TV sitcom "Roseanne" and the movie "She-Devil," 
and her husband of four months, comedy writer Tom Arnold, have purchased a 
Tudor-style home on about an acre in Brentwood. She paid in the $3-million 
range, sources said. Escrow closed last week. 
</P>
<P>
"She got a good buy," said a realtor who did not participate in the transaction 
but is familiar with the property. "You can't buy another tennis court property 
for that in the area." 
</P>
<P>
The two-story, four-bedroom, five-bath home is behind gates and has a wine 
cellar and a guest house, besides a tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Barr apparently got a good price is that the 17-room home was for 
sale for some time. "It came on the market at a much higher price with another 
firm, then sat there for quite awhile," the realtor said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the reason it didn't sell is because it has a lot of small rooms 
running into each other, and Tudor is not the preferred style here. 
Mediterraneans, colonials, Southwest and country homes are more popular. 
</P>
<P>
"Even so, the house Roseanne bought is charming in terms of curb appeal; it has 
lovely frontage and looks very traditional with its Old English look and tennis 
court off to the side." The nearly 7,000-square-foot home was built eight years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"She's planning to do extensive work on the interior of the house, remodeling 
it and creating a large projection room," said Bruce Nelson, of the newly 
formed John Bruce Nelson &amp; Associates. Raymond Bekeris, in the firm's 
Holmby Hills office, had the $3.9-million listing. 
</P>
<P>
Until she bought the Brentwood home, Barr was renting a country-style house 
with a pool and a tennis court in the Beverly Hills Post Office Area at $20,000 
a month, another source said. 
</P>
<P>
ELIZABETH TAYLOR'S Puerto Vallarta hacienda is being purchased by a couple who 
live in La Costa for about $100,000 more than its $350,000 asking price, 
according to a source not involved in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Escrow is expected to close later this month on the two-house compound, which 
came on the market again in February. It was first listed a couple years ago at 
$1 million. 
</P>
<P>
When it was reported in this column that it was for sale again but at a reduced 
price, listing agents Elaine Dannenberg and Roger Wall with Fred Sands Realtors 
received more than 500 phone calls from all over the United States and Canada 
and a number of offers. All offers were submitted to the actress through her 
business manager, a spokeswoman for Sands said. 
</P>
<P>
The buyers, Frank and Toy Holstein, plan to turn the hacienda, which Taylor and 
actor Richard Burton purchased in the early '60s, into a luxurious 
bed-and-breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"They rehab and revive properties," the Sands spokeswoman explained. "They have 
a gentleman's ranch in Blossom Valley (near Rancho Bernardo in the San Diego 
area) where they did the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
The 5 1/2-acre ranch, which the Holsteins bought about two years ago, has a 
tennis court, riding track, waterfalls, swimming pool, barn, servants quarters 
and a four-bedroom, four-bath, 4,000-square-foot main residence. Now the 
Holsteins have listed that property with Dannenberg and Wall at $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. and Mrs. Holstein had been spending half their time in Puerto Vallarta 
before making their offer, and they love it there," the Sands spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
JEAN SMART, who plays Charlene on the CBS-TV sitcom "Designing Women," and her 
husband, RICHARD GILLILAND, who stars in the reoccurring role of Ellen's 
married lover Jeffrey in the ABC-TV hit "Thirtysomething," have bought a home 
with a tennis court in Encino for nearly its asking price of $1,395,000. 
</P>
<P>
The pair moved from their Los Feliz home, which is on the market in the 
$400,000 range, because it was too small for them, sources said. The couple has 
a 6-months-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
Built about 40 years ago, their ranch-style Encino home has three bedrooms and 
maid's quarters in a nearly 4,000-square-foot main house and a 700-square-foot 
artist's studio. The property is two blocks from singer Michael Jackson's 
family home. 
</P>
<P>
The Encino home had been owned by an internist/nephrologist and his artist 
wife, who bought a four-unit apartment building in Venice that they are 
rehabbing into an artist studio and living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwin Swartz of Asher Dann &amp; Associates represented the doctor and his 
wife, and Kathy Roach of Mike Glickman Realty represented Smart and Gilliland. 
</P>
<P>
The rock group VAN HALEN, which opened its own nightclub and bar in Cabo San 
Lucas in late April, and its partners, Van Halen's business manager and a 
Mexican investor, spent about $1 million to build the project, it has now been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
Lead vocalist SAMMY HAGAR, who oversaw most of the construction, was reported 
as saying in April that he originally intended to spend $150,000, but wound up 
going "far beyond." 
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-square-foot Cabo Wabo Cantina, named for a song co-written by Hagar, 
has indoor seating for 280 and an outdoor bar that seats 70. Van Halen 
performed there on opening night and plans to participate in future jam 
sessions with house bands and visiting celebrity musicians. 
</P>
<P>
A Bel-Air home built in 1966 by car dealer FLETCHER JONES and later owned by 
Sylmar pacemaker manufacturer Alfred E. Mann is on the market for $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 11,000-square-foot residence, with a pool and tennis court, was built on 
the 4-acre site of a home that burned to the ground during the 1961 Bel-Air 
fire. That home was owned, at the time, by the late JUSTIN DART, an adviser to 
President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The house built by Jones, on one of the highest peaks in Bel-Air, has been the 
home for nearly 10 years of German industrialist Carl E. Press, who owns radio 
stations and vineyards in West Germany and prawn and alligator farms in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"His son graduated a year ago from (nearby) Harvard School, and now Press is 
only spending four to six weeks out of the year here, so he's selling," 
explained Cecelia Waeschle, who shares the listing with Joyce Rey at 
Rodeo/Prudential Realty.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: BOARD IGNORES SIGNALS IN NO-TRUMP BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Allocation Board this Wednesday will once again consider the request 
by the Los Angeles Board of Education for more than $73 million to become, in 
effect, developers of the Ambassador Hotel site. 
</P>
<P>
The board has doggedly, some would say pigheadedly, pursued the 23.5-acre site 
in the Mid-Wilshire District for a new senior high school since the landmark 
hotel was closed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit took on an added dimension earlier this year when the Donald Trump 
organization bought an interest in the site and announced plans for an 
ambitious commercial development there, topped by the world's tallest 
skyscraper. (Happily, the scheme has since shrunk considerably.) 
</P>
<P>
Although Trump has selected the local firm of Johnson Fain &amp; Pereira, known 
for its sensitive urban design work, planning efforts to come up with an 
acceptable mix and scale of uses for the site have been placed on the back 
burner as the school board plays its hand. 
</P>
<P>
The involvement of the controversial Donald Trump, and the excitement it caused 
among those championing a real estate renaissance in the area, apparently has 
strengthened the resolve of the board to acquire the site through condemnation 
and, as they say in development circles, become a player. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to concerns that the well-located and valuable site could be better 
used to generate income to offset the acquisition cost, the board has proposed 
that the high school be combined with a 30-story office tower, a retail mall 
and three department stores. 
</P>
<P>
According to the scheme yet to be made public, the commercial development would 
be focused on Wilshire Boulevard, most of the educational facilities on 7th 
Street, and the athletic fields and gymnasium on 8th Street, bordering the 
residential district to the south. 
</P>
<P>
A public library, police station, 120 units of housing perched on one of the 
department stores and parking in a variety of structures for nearly 5,000 cars 
also is included in the scheme drafted by the firm of Leidenfrost/Horowitz 
&amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Although the board has declined to discuss the plans, at least with me, it has 
been hawking the concept to various developers. Most are said to have viewed 
the mix with apprehension, the planning and design with reserve, and the 
board's entrepreneurial posture with embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
"Unmarketable," was the conclusion of one prominent developer. "Unfeasible," 
said another. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the proposal was in theory marketable and feasible, there is a real 
question whether the board could make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, numerous local and state laws on school construction, allocation of 
real estate taxes and public leasehold arrangements would have to be amended, 
as would zoning ordinances and building and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
The process, no doubt, will take years. As for the children the board says it 
wants to serve, they will once again be shortchanged, while the lawyers, 
politicians and bureaucrats have a field day. 
</P>
<P>
In New York City, where such combined public school, and housing and commercial 
projects have been built, it took on the average six years for each to move 
from concept to completion. 
</P>
<P>
And that happened only after four years of studies and lobbying on the local 
and state levels to create a special, nonprofit public benefit corporation to 
carry out the task independent of the city's school bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles School Board last February passed a well-worded and 
well-intentioned resolution to explore, among other things, the planning, 
financing and legal implications of a more imaginative facilities program, 
including possible multiuse developments. 
</P>
<P>
But words do not make a program. Repeated efforts by me through the board and 
through a concerned mayoral aide for education to track what was happening and 
discuss possible demonstrations were to no avail. Meetings were scheduled and 
canceled, then scheduled again, only to have the district's representative fail 
to appear. 
</P>
<P>
I was disappointed but not surprised, especially having witnessed the board's 
insensitive attempts at land grabs over the last several years. When it comes 
to planning and design, the board gets a major "F." 
</P>
<P>
It is therefore hard to take seriously the board's proposal for the complex 
multiuse development of the Ambassador site. You just know it is going to be a 
boondoggle. 
</P>
<P>
If the board in the past had not displayed so little imagination in its 
construction program, be it for even the simplest addition, let alone a major 
high school, perhaps the proposal could be labeled presumptuous. 
</P>
<P>
If the board, after announcing its intentions for the site nearly two years 
ago, had not heard from a bevy of local interests, or had not reviewed various 
planning reports for the area, the proposal could be dismissed as simply 
insensitive to community concerns. 
</P>
<P>
If the board's draft environmental impact report for a high school on the site 
had not received from the city's Planning Department a year and a half ago such 
a pointed response -- the report was politely deemed inadequate -- the proposal 
might be excused as poorly conceived. 
</P>
<P>
But put in the broader perspective of the failure of the city's public 
education system, as judged by test scores, class sizes, dropout rates, campus 
crime and teacher and administrator ratios and salary discrepancies, the 
request to allocate such an excessive sum for such a dubious project has to be 
labeled irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
Adding all this up it becomes depressingly evident that the proposal for the 
Ambassador site is a perversion of the board's condemnation powers and its 
school planning and construction program. 
</P>
<P>
And it raises the question of whether a program so vital to public education, 
and therefore the future of the city, should be entrusted elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
There is little argument that we need new public schools to replace inadequate 
and unsafe facilities, and to handle the present overcrowding and the 
anticipated increase in students. 
</P>
<P>
But this need will not be met by the board by going to the mat over the 
Ambassador site. Rather, it should be met by the development of more flexible 
and shared facilities, not unlike what has been done by some very successful 
private schools here and experimental public schools in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The board should also explore the possibility of adapting commercial and 
industrial spaces for classrooms and theaters for auditoriums, making better 
use of present school properties, shifting administration into inexpensive 
office buildings, and generally becoming more imaginative and flexible. 
</P>
<P>
As for Trump's project, an opinion on whether it will meet the architectural, 
economic, and social needs of the Wilshire District and the city must await the 
unveiling of the anticipated plans. One just hopes that Trump will benefit from 
the mistakes of the school board.

TOPIARY: THE ART OF HAVING ANIMAL FORMS COVERED WITH LIVE PLANTS HAS NOW SPREAD

<P>
To most gardeners, topiary is the art of shaping plants into figures of animals 
or geometric forms by trimming and pruning them, or by making wire frames and 
planting them. 
</P>
<P>
During the Renaissance, the art of trimming and pruning flourished in the 
gardens of France and Italy, and today we're all familiar with the wire-frame 
topiary creations at Disneyland and Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
But you needn't own a villa or a theme park to have a green menagerie. And you 
don't even have to have a back yard. Small, truly artistic, whimsical and 
amusing indoor topiaries are beginning to pop up for sale in Southland 
nurseries and flower shops. 
</P>
<P>
And, better yet, if you want to have some fun and save some money, it's 
relatively easy to make your own. 
</P>
<P>
As far as buying ready-made topiaries is concerned, many nurseries and florists 
carry them, many don't. If you like hunting, take an afternoon off and stalk 
the elusive topiary through the jungles of the vendors in your neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Or take the easy way and just hunt through the Yellow Pages. You're liable to 
bag an elephant covered with creeping fig or spot an ivy-covered monkey. I 
uncovered these specimens and more in three places during a nursery-hopping 
safari on the Westside: Armstrong's Nursery on Sawtelle, Barrington Florist on 
San Vicente, and Culver Center Flowers on Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The figures I encountered also included jasmine-covered circles, single and 
two-tiered ivy-covered globes, cats and swans. Armstrong's even has a few 
pensive, moss-filled Homo sapiens, which can be purchased either planted or 
unplanted. Prices ranged from $40 to $260 for the contemplative human figures 
at Armstrong's. 
</P>
<P>
An even easier way to buy a ready-made topiary or a topiary frame is to contact 
O'Farrior Topiary in Glendora. Owned and operated by Jennifer O'Farrior and her 
sister, Tischa, the O'Farriors have been creating topiary figures for both 
indoors and outdoors for seven years, from 15-inch rabbits to a 25-foot 
giraffe. 
</P>
<P>
You can see examples of their larger topiary work at Ambassador College in 
Pasadena, where there are plant-covered figures of a lion, lamb and a child 
lurking by the auditorium and at Giorgio in Beverly Hills, where they have 
seven fantasy topiary trees of various geometric shapes on display. 
</P>
<P>
Among the smaller, perfect-for-indoors figures that are available at O'Farrior 
are swans, cats, rabbits, monkeys, horses, moose heads (cleverly topped by 
staghorn fern antlers), turtles, and a fabulous Pegasus, whose wings, mane and 
tail are "feathered" with flowing variegated Hedera ivy. 
</P>
<P>
Depending upon size, completed topiaries can range in price from $56 for the 
little rabbit all the way up into the thousands of dollars for custom orders, 
and the available unplanted frames, which are somewhat larger in size (the 
rabbit frame is 2 feet tall, for instance) are $75 and up. Shopping at 
O'Farrior is by appointment only, and the telephone numbers are (818) 963-3568 
or (818) 335-4556. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to venture into the limitless field of your own imagination -- and 
save a bunch of money while you're at it, making your own topiary is lots of 
fun and easy to do. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jennifer O'Farrior, there are three basic types of topiary frames: 
One-half-inch aviary wire being preferable to chicken wire because you can get 
greater detail and definition with it; welded or soldered frame sculptures 
usually planted with hedging plants, such as boxwood or eugenia or vines, or 
both -- No. 10 galvanized wire is best for this method -- and one-half-inch 
aviary wire lined with moss, soil and then planted. 
</P>
<P>
This latter method is seen most frequently. "Making topiary that way is 
somewhat like being a seamstress," say Jennifer O'Farrior, who is the artistic 
member of the pair. (Tischa is the botanist, with a degree from Cal Poly 
Pomona.) 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer O'Farrior makes her frames, and you can do the same, by drawing 
patterns on the aviary wire for individual body parts (arms, legs, bodies, 
heads, whatever), cutting them out, shaping them, stuffing the individual parts 
with damp sphagnum moss, then stitching the various parts to the body with wire 
to form the shape she's set out to make. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually," O'Farrior says, "you could buy a pattern to make a stuffed animal 
and use it to make a topiary." 
</P>
<P>
Whichever method you choose, once you've finished shaping and stuffing your 
frame, get several creeping fig (Ficus pumila) plants or grape ivy (Cissus 
rhombifolia) plants to use to cover the moss. (I recommend creeping fig or 
grape ivy because they're easy to grow indoors and will cover the frame very 
quickly.) 
</P>
<P>
However, many of the commercial topiaries are sold with English ivy (Hedera 
helix), so be sure to keep those in bright sunlight and spray daily. 
</P>
<P>
O'Farrior also uses various herbs such as rosemary and thyme as well as the 
traditional weeping fig and ivy. Make holes at least an inch deep for each 
plant in the damp moss with your finger or a pencil, then take individual, 
rooted strands of creeping fig or ivy and tuck them through the wires of the 
frame into these holes. Pin each plant into place with pieces of wire shaped 
into clips similar to hair pins. 
</P>
<P>
You can, if you wish, cover the moss-filled shape completely, using as many 
plants as it takes. Or you can cover it sparsely and let nature take its course 
until the figure is completely covered. 
</P>
<P>
A slightly less complex, but equally rewarding way to make a topiary is to bend 
a piece of wire, or even a coat hanger, into a relatively simple shape such as 
a circle or a heart, then cover it with a climbing plant such as wax plant 
(Hoya carnosa). For example: 
</P>
<P>
Buy a 6-inch or 8-inch pot of H. carnosa with lots of nice, long, trailing 
vines. 
</P>
<P>
Next, bend a piece of wire or a coat hanger into a circle, leaving about 2 or 3 
inches of wire unbent at each end. Stick these straight ends into the pot, 
right up against the sides, and then, strand by strand, wrap the wax plant 
around the wire circle. Wrap some green thread or invisible fishing line around 
the plant to hold it in place. Make sure you trim and prune the plant regularly 
to keep it from growing off wildly from its circular frame. 
</P>
<P>
How you care for your topiary depends on which plants you use. In almost every 
case -- whether you use grape ivy, English ivy, creeping fig, wax plant or an 
other small-leafed, low-growing, vining indoor plant -- you must spray your 
topiary every day to keep it from drying out; water it once a week by dunking 
it in a sink or tub, and feed it once a week by mixing liquid plant food with 
water and then spraying the mixture onto the leaves of the plant.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Divide crowded clumps of bearded iris after the bloom is finished. 
</P>
<P>
This should be done every third year or so. 
</P>
<P>
If you have bedding plants waiting to be transplanted into the garden, remember 
to keep them watered. 
</P>
<P>
Garden-fresh herbs can add more flavor to your outdoor barbecuing. Plant them 
in pots near the barbecue area to have them close at hand while cooking.

GARDENING Q &amp; A: REASONS FOR FLAT-TASTING MELONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOC ABRAHAM and KATY ABRAHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Last year, our muskmelons had a flat taste. We grew them near 
cucumbers, and we wonder if the cucumbers crossed over and gave the melons a 
bad flavor. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Cucumbers cannot cross with muskmelons, watermelons, or squash. There 
is no way for the bitterness of cucumbers to get into the melons. Flat, 
tasteless melons can be due to a lack of magnesium or boron in the soil. It has 
been found that such fruits can be sweetened by giving them a dose of Epsom 
salts and borax. For home garden use, use about 6 1/2 tablespoons of Epsom 
salts and 3 1/2 tablespoons of household borax, all added to five gallons of 
water. Spray the plants when the vines start to run and again when the fruits 
are between one and two inches in diameter. Weather can also affect flavor. 
Rainy, cold days cause flat, tasteless melons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bark Mulch Can Help Enhance Tree Growth 
</P>
<P>
Q: As we drive by homes we often see trees ringed with a bark mulch of some 
sort. Is this a good thing to do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, it's good business for various reasons: 1 -- Grass around a tree is 
highly competitive with tree roots. Killing the grass removes this competition. 
2 -- The bark mulch makes an environment more favorable to root growth. 3 -- It 
also prevents "bang bang" disease -- lawn mowers banging against the bark. 4 -- 
The mulch is attractive. 5 -- It helps retain soil moisture, keeps weeds out 
and creates a friendly environment for soil organisms. Make the mulch mound at 
least 2 or 3 feet in diameter and not over 6 inches thick. The practice of 
building up a mound 12-inches high is not prudent because these materials, in 
the decay process, liberate toxic materials which can injure the bark. Leave a 
depression around the trunk so the bark will not come in contact with the 
mulch. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
New Double-Flowering Geranium Worth a Try 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read about a new geranium variety called Floribunda, described as double 
and having stocky stems. Have they been around long, and are they worth 
growing?" 
</P>
<P>
A: Your garden center probably has the new Floribunda geraniums. These are 
double-flowering and are available for the first time this year. We are growing 
them in hanging baskets, window boxes and patio planters, all for the first 
time. They make a stocky plant, are heat tolerant and aren't as messy as some 
geraniums. By all means try some. They take the same care as regular geraniums, 
and in a hanging basket, you can use about three small plants per 10-inch 
container. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hitting Tree With Bat Won't Produce Nuts 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have a walnut tree, which produces hardly any nuts. Someone said that if 
you pound on the trunk with a ball bat, it will cause the trees to bear nuts. 
True? 
</P>
<P>
A: False. This is an old wives' tale. Nut trees fail to bear nuts because of 
bad weather, lack of pollination, age of trees, etc. All the beating in the 
world won't force a tree to bear nuts. By the same token, driving nails into 
the trunk of a tree will not make it fruit or bear nuts.

HOME IMPROVEMENT: PAVING: ALMOST AS EASY AS ROLLING OUT A LOG; 
</P>
<P>
WALKWAYS: IF YOU WANT A RUSTIC-LOOKING PATIO OR PATH, USING WOODEN 
STEPPINGSTONES IS AN INEXPENSIVE ANSWER. BUT THEY DON'T LAST AS LONG AS STONE 
OR CONCRETE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking for an easy way to pave a rustic walk or patio? Consider log rounds, 
simple slabs you cut yourself from logs or unused firewood you might have lying 
around. Log paving won't last as long as stone or concrete, but it's cheap, and 
it's easy to remove if you ever change your mind. 
</P>
<P>
In its simplest form, log paving needs no border. You can, for example, make an 
informal steppingstone path by placing your rounds individually, each on its 
own bed of sand and gravel. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, however, you'll be paving a patio or walkway, and some kind of 
edging will be in order. Two-by-fours set on edge serve the purpose quite 
nicely. The sketch shows one simple way to go. 
</P>
<P>
Start by laying out the borders of your paving. Dig narrow trenches to a depth 
of about 3 inches to accept the 2-by-4 edging. This will place the edging at a 
level one-half inch above the ground. Set your edging boards in place (use 
pressure-treated lumber or redwood for this) and then secure them with stakes, 
also of pressure-treated lumber. You can nail the stakes to the edging, but I 
prefer to use screws. Driving nails tends to bang things out of position. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure the tops of your stakes are about 2 inches below ground level. If 
they stick up any higher than this, they may interfere with the placement of 
your logs later on. 
</P>
<P>
Once the edging is in, dig a depth of about 4 inches over the entire area to be 
paved. Then cover the area with a 2-inch layer of sand and tamp it down firmly. 
At this depth, a cubic yard of sand will cover 18 square yards, or 162 square 
feet. Figure your needs accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Over the sand, rake a half-inch layer of pea gravel and tamp this down. Figure 
on buying about one-third as much gravel as you do sand. Your bed is now ready 
for the paving rounds. 
</P>
<P>
You can cut the logs with a chain saw. Diameter isn't critical, but larger logs 
(10 inches and up) get the job done faster. You can use any species of wood you 
like, or mix and match. 
</P>
<P>
Untreated, your log pavers will probably last two or three years, depending 
upon the type of wood and climate. Brushing on a coat of preservative will add 
a couple years of use to the logs, but it is best to soak them in preservative. 
Even with treatment, the log rounds won't last as long as stone. On the other 
hand, they are easy to replace as needed. 
</P>
<P>
Cut all your rounds 1 1/2 inches thick. Make sure your saw is sharp, and try to 
make each cut in a single smooth motion. This will produce the neatest looking 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Lay your logs in any pattern you like. If all are roughly the same size, you 
can stagger each row and get a fairly snug and regular layout. If you have a 
variety of sizes, a random layout may be better. You can split rounds in half 
to produce straight edges to run along your border if you like, but this isn't 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
After the rounds are in place, use a straight board to check that they are set 
at the same level. Adjust the low ones by adding a bit more gravel, dig out a 
bit for the high ones. Then tamp everything down. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, finish the job by dumping pea gravel onto the paving and working it 
into the gaps between rounds with a stiff broom. This will lock the rounds in 
place and give your paving a finished appearance. 
</P>

<GRAPHIC>
<P>
Drawing, EASY RUSTIC PAVING 1. Dig narrow trenches 3 inches deep to hold the 
2-4 edging. The top edge of the pressure treated 2-4 should be 1/2 inch above 
the ground. 2. Next to the edging, drive pressure treated stakes into the 
ground so the tops are 2 inches below ground level. Use wood screws to secure 
the stakes to the edging. 3. When the edging is finished, dig to a level of 
4-inches over the area between the edging. Fill this area with a 2-inch layer 
of sand and fimrly tamp it down. Then add a 1/2/ inch layer of pea gravel over 
this and tamp it down. 4. Cut your logs 1-1/2 inches thick and lay them on the 
gravel in any pattern desired. Tamp them down firmly and add pea gravel bewteen 
the logs to lock them in place. Los Angeles Times

DESIGN SOLUTIONS: ADDING FIREPLACE TO EXISTING HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I want a fireplace in an existing house. What are the requirements 
and costs? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: There are a number of styles of fireplaces from which to choose, such 
as corner, Swedish or a three-faced model. The final choice should reflect the 
architectural character of your home. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the costs of adding a masonry fireplace to an existing house, I am 
going to recommend a zero-clearance unit. A zero-clearance fireplace has an 
insulated metal fire box and flue that can be placed directly adjacent to a 
wood-frame structure and chimney. The popularity of these fireplaces has 
increased due to their low construction cost as compared to masonry fireplace 
and chimney construction. 
</P>
<P>
Zero-clearance fireplaces are available from a variety of manufacturers. Prices 
range from $400 on up, not including installation. Construction and 
installation costs will depend on the placement of the fireplace and the 
specific home. Consult with a licensed contractor to install the fireplace 
unit. It is very important to verify actual installation requirements with the 
vendor's specifications and the local fire marshal or building code guidelines.

How to Make Studio Apartment Cozier 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm a single guy in a studio apartment. I have no flair for decorating, and 
my women friends tell me my place isn't cozy. Help! The king-size bed is on the 
floor and I have only one lamp plus a ceiling fixture. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your apartment can be significantly more comfortable by including a sitting 
area separate from the sleeping area. Therefore, create a separation by using a 
movable screen or wall unit. Screens are available in Oriental motif, casual 
wicker or one simply painted in your favorite colors. The screen should help 
set a theme. 
</P>
<P>
Your sitting area may include overstuffed lounge chairs and a coffee table with 
extra pillow cushions pulled up to it informally. Flexibility in the furnishing 
arrangement can allow you to set various moods. Softly illuminate the area 
indirectly with a torchiere lamp. 
</P>
<P>
Your artwork can be playful, yet dramatic, such as designer fabric stretched 
onto a frame. Shape and size of artwork is up to you. A variety of textures in 
your fabrics will appeal to the senses. For a warm, snug look, choose a soft 
wool throw blanket or a chenille pillow. Add a rustic pot in the corner with 
silk tree (easy for maintenance). Hardcover books are a natural for adding to 
the relaxed atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Your sleeping area needs a nonconventional night stand. Try a pot with a custom 
made glass top or a chest. Be sure your studio apartment reflects who you are 
and that you feel comfortable in it. The rest will follow.

Secret of Mixing Patterns and Florals 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the secret of mixing geometric patterns and florals? I love the 
look, but meet with disaster when I attempt to do it myself. 
</P>
<P>
A: The secret of mixing geometric patterns and florals is in the size of the 
pattern and the colors. The colors of the two different patterns must blend. 
For instance, if green is one of the common colors in the patterns, be sure 
both greens are blue-greens. Not one a blue-green and one a yellow-green. Also, 
if the geometric pattern is a very large check or plaid, the flower can have 
the same colors in it, but must be a very small all-over design.

Who Can Advise on Structural Changes? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I want to combine several small rooms into one large room, but I'm afraid it 
might affect the structural soundness of the entire house. Who should I call to 
help me determine what walls are safe to remove? 
</P>
<P>
A: Confer with your qualified interior designer to draft plans showing 
structural design changes. As with any structural change, you must consult a 
licensed architect and/or structural engineer, normally provided by your 
architect. 
</P>
<P>
I recommend that your interior designer be present at your meetings in order to 
retain the integrity of your design. If structural soundness is in jeopardy, 
your architect will draft plans and the structural engineer will check and sign 
off the prints. Only after city building department approval may you proceed.

Where to Install a Wine Storage Area 
</P>
<P>
Q: Wine storage is a major problem in any size kitchen especially one with no 
floor or counter space. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: A cool and dark "cave" for the storage of wine is best. So choose a base 
cabinet and insert one of the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A ready-made wire or wood bottle rack(s) which can be found in most kitchen 
supply stores. Note: If possible, vent the cabinet to bring up cool air from 
the basement or under the house. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Order through your local kitchen cabinet company a custom wine rack 
accessory unit, to insert into an existing cabinet, from Amrock or comparable 
company at an approximate price of $250. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If there is enough space and electricity, an under-counter refrigerated 
wine storage unit can be ordered from a commercial kitchen appliance store. 
</P>
<P>
To use your wine storage as a focal point, choose an upper cabinet and 
spotlight it from outside the cabinet. If the cabinet divides the room, open 
both sides and insert bottles in alternating directions.

BACKS FLEXIBLE ZONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I appreciated the remarks made by Sam Hall Kaplan in a recent column about West 
Hollywood's new courtyard housing regulations ("Welcome Mats Out for New 
Courtyards," May 6). 
</P>
<P>
We strongly believe that Los Angeles developers can provide better housing than 
they have been, and we will try to demonstrate that belief with our rules. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, we view West Hollywood as an urban design laboratory for Greater 
Los Angeles. We do not believe that zoning regulations should be rigid and 
unalterable for decades, but rather should be viewed as fluid and reflective of 
new knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
We view every project that comes into the office as an experiment in that urban 
design laboratory, and the Planning Commission and City Council are committed 
to revising the rules as they learn from those laboratory experiments. 
</P>
<P>
This philosophy will drive developers crazy because we cannot offer them the 
complete predictability of some other cities. However, it is the only way that 
we can guarantee the residents (of all income levels) that we will work to 
provide better housing. 
</P>
<P>
On a more important note, although I appreciated Sam Kaplan quoting me, the 
majority of the courtyard work was done by Tim Gawronski, the city's brilliant 
urban designer. He deserves the real credit.

E. CONTINI'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was deeply saddened to learn of Edgardo Contini's death. He was far more than 
an architect. 
</P>
<P>
He was a colleague from the UCLA campus. In a development community 
characterized by glitz and slickness, he personified charm and class. It was 
always a delight to interact with him, even when he was on the other side of 
the bargaining table. He brought intelligence, dignity, patience, wit and a 
quiet strength to the process of development. He will be sorely missed.

E. CONTINI'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with deep sadness of the passing of Edgardo Contini, FAIA. Edgardo was a 
towering presence in the Los Angeles design community whose pioneering efforts 
in residential land planning and design in the 1950s and 1960s created the 
innovative Crestwood Hills tract in Brentwood and residential prototypes as a 
part of the famous Case Study Houses program. 
</P>
<P>
His humane design principals touched thousands of lives. 
</P>
<P>
Edgardo was a valued friend and adviser to Architects/Designers/ Planners for 
Social Responsibility, this nation's largest pro-active group of designers 
(2,500 members). We at ADPSR will work hard to create a living memorial of 
action and commitment to the enduring principles of environmental renewal and 
responsible development that were the hallmark of Edgardo's life.

MORE TO HONG KONG THAN EATING AND SHOPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, Turan, a Los Angeles free-lancer, writes frequently about 
film and is on the board of directors of the National Yiddish Book Center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HONG KONG 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as you announce a trip to Hong Kong to friends who've already been, you 
will find the city airily dismissed as rather a bore. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing to do there," you'll be authoritatively told, "except eat and 
shop." It's as if a biblical curse had been put on the place, dooming it to be 
forever barren in every other area because it was so fertile in those two. 
</P>
<P>
Eating and shopping are fine in their places, and while Hong Kong's fame as an 
epicenter of those activities is nothing if not deserved, most people would be 
hard-pressed to fill up 24 hours doing nothing but one or the other. 
</P>
<P>
So I'm delighted to be able to report that Hong Kong has all kinds of 
unexpected pleasures and sites. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that but the city has a model subway system, dirt-cheap, clean and 
neat, scandalously efficient and splendidly air-conditioned, even on the 
steamiest of days. Use it to investigate any or all of the following 
activities: 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's biggest secret is that it is a breathtakingly beautiful city, 
ravishing in a way that puts San Francisco to shame. 
</P>
<P>
Built straight out of rock and landfill on the thin edge of both Hong Kong 
island and Kowloon across the water, this is a city of astonishing vertical 
density, a forest of cutting-edge architecture by the likes of I. M. Pei and 
Norman Foster. 
</P>
<P>
That alternates with concrete toothpick residential towers that are so narrow 
that a journalist wrote that the city's developers "could probably build 
50-story dwellings on a sixpence if there was enough of the crinkly green stuff 
in it for them." 
</P>
<P>
There are any number of ways to view all this, the most traditional being the 
less than 15-cent ferry ride, which will not seriously dent anyone's budget, 
and a tram to Victoria Peak, the city's highest point. 
</P>
<P>
That ride has been a top tourist attraction for more than 100 years, but don't 
let that stop you. As my mother used to say, "If so many people go, there must 
be a reason." 
</P>
<P>
The most stunning way to see the city, however, is to return on a boat from 
nearby Macao. 
</P>
<P>
After passing open water and deserted islands for close to an hour I got my 
first glimpse of Hong Kong (an island that by rights should have been as empty 
as all the others) and its massed buildings, towering citadels glistening in 
the sun like Oz's Emerald City. It seemed so astonishing that I understood for 
the first time what it must be like to experience the most beautiful of 
mirages. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is scheduled to revert to China in 1997, the June 4 uprising in 
Beijing hit Hong Kong extremely hard, and visiting the city now has the extra 
drawing impetus of being able to witness history being made. 
</P>
<P>
Every day seems to provide a new chapter in this continuing drama. When I was 
there, the extensive pro-democracy demonstrations that had just ended were on 
everybody's lips and were almost immediately followed by a near-riot outside 
the Singapore Commission when that country relaxed its emigration criteria. 
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong English language paper, the wonderfully named South China Morning 
Post, provided excellent blow-by-blow coverage of those events, and its letters 
page, in which the city daily pours out its rage and uncertainty, was the first 
thing I turned to in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger Balm Gardens: The entrepreneur behind the Chinese version of Ben-Gay 
spent $16 million Hong Kong dollars in 1939 on this boggling collection of 
garishly colored, larger-than-life statues that curve around steep, narrow 
paths and fill artificial caves and grottoes in Aw Boon Park. 
</P>
<P>
Come face-to-face with the Dragon King, the Wedding of the Pig and the Rabbit, 
the Laughing Buddha and Master Hui-neng, the Sixth Patriarch, who was said to 
have survived without food or water for 24 years -- and looks it. 
</P>
<P>
In case all this sounds impossibly frivolous, it should be noted that each and 
every grouping is intended to teach a moral lesson. One astonished guidebook 
calls it "three hectares of grotesque statuary and appalling bad taste," but 
hey, what are vacations for? 
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court: Sit in on any one of several trials in progress, everything from 
murders to stock manipulation, in a courtroom so completely British, from 
bewigged barristers to frowning judges, that you'll feel you've walked into an 
Oriental version of "Rumpole of the Bailey." 
</P>
<P>
Look on in awe as the minions of the law say things such as, "There seems to be 
an element of arbitrariness and capriciousness which is totally unexplained." 
Don't worry about choosing which courtroom to go to because the guard at the 
building's entrance will be more than happy to steer you to what's hot and 
what's not. 
</P>
<P>
Bird Street: The Chinese people love birds with a marked intensity, even taking 
care to spray them carefully from tiny atomizers on particularly steamy days. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Lok Street on the Kowloon side is the mecca of the bird trade, with all 
kinds of tweeters, large and small, for sale and singing their little hearts 
out. Also for sale are hand-painted bird feeders and the most delicately and 
elaborately carved wooden cages, objets d'art every one. 
</P>
<P>
Movies may seem like the kind of stuff one could just as well get at home, but 
viewing one in a foreign environment, as I discovered when I saw Woodstock 
treated as a skin flick in a neighborhood theater in East Jerusalem, tells you 
a surprising amount about the culture that you're visiting. 
</P>
<P>
If possible, catch something by Jackie Chan, the hottest box office star in 
Asia. I was able to experience Chan's latest blockbuster, "Mr. Canton and Lady 
Rose," an amiable period piece set in old Hong Kong, with the star as a 
bumbling gangster with (what else?) a heart of gold. 
</P>
<P>
Its shrewd cross-pollination of sentiment and action came out as if Jimmy 
Stewart had a joint production deal with Bruce Lee and was exactly what the 
audience wanted. English subtitles made it all understandable, but the 
Chinese-only commercials that preceded the feature were truly inscrutable. 
</P>
<P>
The Terrace at the Hotel Bela Vista: Macao, the site of this hotel and a 
one-hour jet foil trip away, is a ne'er-do-well version of Hong Kong, so 
down-at-the-heels it's rumored that although Portugal is eager to give it back, 
the Chinese aren't at all sure they want to take it. 
</P>
<P>
And if you've ever read Somerset Maugham or Joseph Conrad and longed to visit 
the exotic East as it used to be, this crumbling 100-year-old relic, redolent 
with the fragrance of colonialism gone to seed, is just the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
I stumbled onto the terrace overlooking the harbor, exhausted from a morning's 
sightseeing, and as I relaxed over my drink while watching the ceiling fans 
slowly turn past peeling wooden shutters and pockmarked columns, I felt I was 
truly inhabiting a dream. 
</P>
<P>
Walk, walk, walk: Because so much of Hong Kong's commercial life takes place on 
the street, strolling around the older districts puts you as close to the 
traditional Chinese as you will want to get. 
</P>
<P>
Both Yau Ma Tei on the Kowloon side and the Central and Western districts on 
the island side have been graced with walking tour maps produced by the Hong 
Kong Tourist Assn., and both are excellent starting points. 
</P>
<P>
Among the sights are herbal medicine emporiums, street barbers, snake shops 
(snake dishes are reputedly good for toning the blood), coffin corners for the 
dead, and, for the living, food markets both bloody and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Read the phone book: How diverting can that be? Plenty, and informative, too. 
Looking through Hong Kong's, you discover two full pages of bone setters, four 
pages of herbalists and herb teas, 47 pages of restaurants, 32 pages of 
contractors (lots of building going on) and a whopping 65 pages of importers. 
</P>
<P>
Also of strictly academic interest are the 23 pages of massage services, with 
ads for the likes of China Girl ("Eastern Way to Ease Western Stress") and Miss 
Desiree ("All Fantasies Satisfied") given prominent display. A cup of that nice 
herbal tea would no doubt be a safer way to unwind. 
</P>
<P>
Ohel Leah Synagogue: The Sassoons, Sephardic potentates of the first water, 
donated this building and the land it sits on in 1902 in memory of their 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the city's cacophonous bustle, to rest awhile in this tranquil 
old building, graced with that rarest of local commodities, a quiet, leafy 
site, is to remember once again that Hong Kong has pleasures above and beyond 
what know-it-all Occidentals may expect.

thick comforters on the beds. The hotel's restaurant features fresh baked 
breads/pastries, turbot, bass, salmon, rack of lamb, quail, pheasant. Manager 
David Broadhead, formerly of Claridge's and the Savoy in London, offers 
individualized service. 
</P>
<P>
The Close Hotel &amp; Restaurant, Tetbury, Gloucestershire, England GL8 8AQ. 
Doubles from $156 U.S. per night, including morning tea, a continental 
breakfast, newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado Inn: Readers continue to praise Colorado's Eagle River Inn near Vail. 
Dates from 1894. Adobe walls, a dozen guest rooms, Santa Fe-style furniture, a 
beehive fireplace. Decks overlook the river. Guests soak in a hot tub on chilly 
evenings. Fresh flowers throughout the home. Marvelous views of the Rockies. 
Wine/cheese by the fireplace each evening. The breakfast menu includes granola, 
yogurt, croissants, fresh fruit. For lunch/dinner, guests visit Chili Willy's, 
the Turntable and other restaurants in Minturn. Activities: hot-air ballooning,

</P>
<P>
Maui Hideaway: On Maui there's a hideaway up-country from Wailea on the flanks 
of Haleakala (the extinct volcano that dominates the island's skyline), where 
the air is cool and the pace is laid-back. It's called Makawao. No swaying 
palms, no big hotels, no fancy restaurants. This is a cow town that resembles 
the set in a Hollywood Western. Cowboys (paniolos) with plumeria in their hat 
bands roam the main drag, and women wear jeans rather than string bikinis. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of action at Kau Kau Korner, a tiny cafe that serves saimin, rice, beef 
hekka, salted pork cabbage and pork tofu. Seats only a dozen customers. 
Meanwhile, islanders drive for miles to buy fresh bread and pastries at 
Kimodo's Store &amp; Bakery. The lineup begins at 6 a.m. Sometimes they're sold 
out by noon. 
</P>
<P>
Makawao was settled by Portuguese ranchers at the turn of the century. During 
World War II, U.S. Marines claimed it as their turf. (More than one leatherneck 
returned after the war to take up permanent residence.) Makawao is a low-gear 
town. A good destination for day-trippers. 
</P>
<P>

to Cabo San Lucas) for guests booking rooms for four nights at Hotel Cabo San 
Lucas. Failed, however, to mention the offer is good during July only. Rates 
begin at $112.50 per guest, double occupancy, including breakfast, lunch,

IN BERMUDA, IT'S THE WATER AND A BIT MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the drinking water in Bermuda starts to taste a little, well, out of the 
ordinary in the coming months, don't be surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Because the island is in the midst of its worst-ever drought, plans are being 
made to import fresh water from Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
The Bermudan government has contacted a Florida-based tanker company to explore 
the possibility of shipping water to the island from Canada if the drought 
lasts into the summer. 
</P>
<P>
That's where the catch comes in. 
</P>
<P>
The firm ships rum from Barbados to Halifax, but its tankers return to the 
Caribbean empty. Under the contingency plan they'd bring back drinking water 
for Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
And if it should taste a bit like rum, who's going to complain? 
</P>
<P>
Dyeing to Know?: Ever wonder about the source of the colors in genuine Moroccan 
leather? Well, the yellow dyes come from pomegranate skin, dried and crushed 
and mixed with palm oil; the russet and fawn hues are derived from date 
kernels, while the red dye comes from poppy flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Rials and Dinars: Those are the monetary units in Iran, and if you didn't know 
that, you probably aren't concerned that Tehran has been judged to be the most 
expensive city in the world. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest of those international surveys that compare cities by 
the cost of goods and services, the Iranian capital came in first for the 
second year in a row, largely because of an overvalued currency. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran is followed by Tokyo and Libreville, the capital of Gabon in West 
Africa, according to a survey by Corporate Resources Group, a private 
consulting firm. Oslo remained Europe's most expensive city for the third 
consecutive year, followed closely by Helsinki, Zurich, Geneva and Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a continuous decline in currencies that tended to neutralize soaring 
inflation, Latin American cities rank among the least expensive. 
</P>
<P>
About a decade ago, Buenos Aires was the world's most expensive city. Today it 
ranks among the cheapest, only slightly above Quito, Ecuador, which the survey 
said is the world's least expensive city. 
</P>
<P>
Point of Entry: According to the Boston Globe, more than 40% of all living 
Americans -- or about 100 million people -- can trace their roots to an 
ancestor who disembarked on Ellis Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Unbuckled: Wearing seat belts became mandatory for drivers in Italy last 
summer. By fall, Italians had devised a number of gimmicks to avoid using them.

Bear Necessities: Scientists at the University of Sydney have developed a 
biscuit that they claim will replace eucalyptus leaves. This might not sound 
like much of an achievement, but zoos around the world are hailing the 
breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is simple: Koala bears live on eucalyptus leaves, specifically on 
the types of leaf that grow only in Australia. As a result, leaves have to be 
shipped out daily to hungry koalas worldwide, which makes exhibiting the 
animals an expensive proposition for a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
If the bears find the biscuits to their liking, more koalas could go on display 
in zoos, and seeing them will not necessarily involve a trip to Australia.

OUT OF AFRICA -- KENYA'S OWN WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ELLIS VAN DE WATER, Van de Water is a free-lance writer who lives in 
St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.

<P>
LAKE NAIVASHA, Kenya 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a place in the heart of Africa's Great Rift Valley where wine grapes 
grow. The Masai named this place E-Nai-Posha, "that which is heaving; that 
which flows to and fro." 
</P>
<P>
It is perhaps an old ancestral way of describing Lake Naivasha, a remarkably 
beautiful spot and the home of Kenya's first commercial winery, Lake Naivasha 
Vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
My sister-in-law, Elli, a native of Los Angeles, and her husband, John D'Olier, 
a Kenyan farmer, started the vineyard in 1982, planting vines from California 
on the shores of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Elli's letters were full of stories about her new life and the progress and 
perils of the young vineyard. She wrote about the giraffe that wandered through 
the vineyard, dining on the tops of thorn trees, and about the hippopotamus 
that chased her from the lake to the steps of her veranda. Her letters 
contained as much real-life drama as any that Karen Blixen sent out of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Naivasha Vineyard, 60 miles northwest of Nairobi, may be one of the 
world's strangest locations for a winery. But the reasons that make Lake 
Naivasha such a special place also explain why a vineyard 50 miles south of the 
Equator can thrive here. 
</P>
<P>
As you approach Naivasha, riding over the crest of the escarpment, you have a 
breathtaking view of the Great Rift Valley and Mt. Longonot rising 9,000 feet 
above sea level. But the immensity of mountains is diminished within the vast, 
endless plains of the Rift Valley. This enormous seismic fault in the earth's 
crust provides the sandy volcanic soil that nurtures the vines. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of two rainy seasons, most days in the valley are hot and 
dry. Naivasha has cool evening temperatures because of its high altitude, 6,200 
feet, and moist breezes off Naivasha, the highest of Kenya's Rift Valley lakes. 
It is also the Rift Valley's only freshwater lake, and its waters are used to 
irrigate the vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
It was harvest time at the vineyard, John and Elli's busiest season, when my 
husband and I arrived. We had come to Kenya to go on safari, but for a few 
weeks we ended up harvesting wine grapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Habarai asubuhi." The melodious Swahili greeting rang out from the workers 
gathered outside the winery ready to begin the day's tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"Jambo sana," I answered, enjoying the opportunity to use the Swahili phrases I 
was learning. 
</P>
<P>
The harvests take place in the early spring and fall. The grapes are picked in 
the cool morning hours between 6 and 10 when they are freshest. In the weeks 
before I arrived, the crop of Sauvignon Blanc grapes had been harvested and 
were fermenting in 1,000-gallon fiberglass vats inside the winery. But there 
were rows and rows of vines (13 acres in all) burdened with clusters of 
green-gold Colombard grapes waiting to be picked. "Kazi mengi," the workers 
said, and I knew that had to mean "lots of work." 
</P>
<P>
As the sun rose over the vineyard, there was singing and laughter. The men sang 
comical songs about women and love, often raising their voices in falsetto, 
mimicking the women they were singing about. 
</P>
<P>
I looked forward to my mornings with the harvest because it was a chance for me 
to become acquainted with the people who live and work in the surrounding 
villages. With the exception of a few women who took time off from their 
domestic and gardening chores around the farmhouse, the harvest was done by 
men, the majority of whom are from the Luo, Kikuyu and Kamba tribes. 
</P>
<P>
They were curious about the cost of things in the United States, everything 
from T-shirts and blue jeans to a plane ticket to Kenya. I told them the 
kikapus (straw bags) we were filling with grapes sold for as much as $25 in 
many stores. For these men who earn a small wage as grape pickers and farm 
laborers, America seemed like a place where only millionaires could live. But 
they couldn't believe anyone with much money could be happy. 
</P>
<P>
During the harvest, the winery was a hub of activity. Every piece of equipment 
was in use, from the mechanical crusher that destemmed and crushed the grapes 
as they were brought in from the vineyard, to the wine presses that strained 
every last drop of free-run juice from the grapes. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the crusher, imported from Italy, all the equipment, including the 
fiberglass vats, was manufactured locally following D'Olier designs. Even a 
refrigerated stainless dairy tank was converted for use in the winery. A local 
artist was asked to design the labels for the wine bottle, and Alfred, a young 
Kikuyu from a nearby village, was hired and trained to manage all aspects of 
the winery. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Nairobi-based Kenya Wine Agencies Ltd., which handles all 
bottling and distribution for Lake Naivasha Vineyards, production is up from 
3,000 bottles in 1985 to a record yield of 300,000 bottles this year. 
</P>
<P>
News of the vineyard and winery has traveled quickly through the, uh, 
grapevine. John and Elli are hosts to many guests who stop by on their way to 
or from safaris, balloon rides over the Rift Valley or camping trips in the 
Aberdare Mountains. During my stay, a crew from CNN came to report on the 
winery. Later, a family who own a small winery in Bonny Doon, California, spent 
a few evenings talking shop with the D'Oliers. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to Kenya, Robert Mondavi and his wife discovered Lake 
Naivasha wine at the Mt. Kenya Safari Club and later paid the vineyard a visit. 
</P>
<P>
After sampling Kenya's alternative to the domestic papaya wine, it's no wonder 
visitors find a bottle of Lake Naivasha Sauvignon Blanc, Colombard or Carnelian 
(a nouveau style red wine) a coveted souvenir among the kikapus, copper 
bracelets and brightly colored kanga cloths that they bring home from Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
My own adventures in Naivasha often began as part of the day's work. One of the 
chores around the homestead was to collect firewood and straight branches that 
could be used to stake the vines. This job took a couple of men away from the 
harvest for the day. We rode in a trailer hitched to a tractor to Kedong Ranch, 
a communal Masai farm that spreads for many miles below the slopes of Mt. 
Longonot. Hudson, a Kamba, was our driver and unofficial guide. 
</P>
<P>
Over the tractor's loud engine, Hudson would shout, "Twiga!" and point to a 
giraffe. He would frequently stop so that I would take pictures of zebra herds 
galloping across the brown grassy plains or catch a glimpse of a gazelle 
darting into the bush. When we stopped for the men to clear away the bush for 
wood, Hudson warned I should look out for simba mkubwa, big lion. But his 
smiles told me he was only teasing. 
</P>
<P>
The ride on the tractor pulling a trailer full of wood was slow and rough 
across the unpaved trails. At the end of the day, every muscle ached. Safaris 
no doubt were more comfortable cruising in a Land Rover. 
</P>
<P>
At Naivasha, I was surrounded by the beauty that people come to Kenya to see. 
On Sundays, the family made excursions to nearby game reserves. For example. we 
occasionally had picnics at Lake Nakuru, 40 miles from Lake Naivasha, where we 
watched flocks of pink flamingoes feeding and bathing on the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Naivasha is also famous for its exotic bird life. Blue herons were a familiar 
sight along the shore, and it was thrilling to watch fish eagles swoop down out 
of the sky. Just a few miles from the vineyard is Hell's Gate, a national game 
park and Masai reserve. Its name suggests the ominous rugged cliffs that open 
to Lake Naivasha and the mists of steam that rise from fractures in the Rift 
Valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
A short rowboat ride took us across Lake Naivasha to Elsamere, the memorial 
home of Joy Adamson, the author of "Born Free." If you arrived in time for 
lunch, a cast of black and white colobus monkeys welcome you and usually hang 
around until you share some of your lunch with them. On neighboring Crescent 
Island, I wandered through abandoned thatched huts and walked among kongoni, 
gazelle, zebra and giraffe, all roaming wild and free on this tranquil 
sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
My walks along the lake were always enjoyable, although I managed to cut them 
short whenever I spotted a dark gray hump in the shallow waters. I couldn't 
help remembering Elli's encounter with a hippo and her warnings that despite 
their size hippos are very fast. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning before our departure, we took one long last look at Lake 
Naivasha from the top of Mt. Longonot. It was a spectacular view. High upon her 
peaks, we walked along a narrow path that circled dual craters and discovered a 
densely wooded forest in one, a sprawling green pasture in the other. 
</P>
<P>
My husband carved his impressions of Naivasha onto a sign that stands at the 
gates of Lake Naivasha Vineyards. Etched in the wood normally used to support 
the trailing grapevines is a jagged outline of Mt. Longonot, leading into a 
cluster of grapes chiseled into the shape of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Our Kenya trip is just a series of memories now -- the faraway roars that haunt 
the night, giraffes striding with their long-necked gait, roadside markets 
crowded with barefoot women, their babies slung in kangas across their backs. 
</P>
<P>
But how easily the memories come over a glass of Lake Naivasha wine.

IT PAYS SENIORS TO FARE-SHOP WHEN SEEKING AN AIRLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SHEA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If senior citizens seem to be getting younger, one reason may be that golden 
age discounts are kicking in at lower levels. 
</P>
<P>
Once the magic number was a firm 65, and then it started dropping -- to 62, 60, 
55, 50. 
</P>
<P>
Now a newsletter called The Mature Traveler reports on "travel bonanzas for 
49ers-plus." 
</P>
<P>
Hotel discounts usually are pretty straightforward: Just state your age and ask 
the reservations clerk how you'll be rewarded for having lived so long. 
Frequently, it's 10% to 50% off regular rates. 
</P>
<P>
Airline senior discount programs, however, can be as bewildering as Medicare 
regulations. Travel is usually restricted on specific days or during certain 
holiday periods, but not always. 
</P>
<P>
A few airlines insist that you join a dues-paying club to become eligible for 
perks; others require membership in a no-fee group similar to a frequent-flier 
plan; sometimes you merely have to show proof of age at the check-in counter. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, fares are slashed a flat 10% for passengers over 62 or 65, and for 
traveling companions of any age. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a sampling of what is around and some hints on what to look for when 
you're fare-shopping: 
</P>
<P>
Special senior rates pop up sporadically, usually during slow periods. 
</P>
<P>
Few foreign airlines offer transoceanic senior plans, but there are a few 
pace-setters. 
</P>
<P>
El Al offers a 15% discount on all flights to anyone over 60. British Airways' 
"Privileged Traveller Card," also available at 60, offers 10% off certain 
hotels and packages as well as fares; the airline also waives pre-trip 
cancellation penalties for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Finnair offers travelers 65 and over a fare of $496 round trip good any day all 
year, from New York City. While it can't be booked more than three days in 
advance -- which means seats won't come easy in high season -- it represents a 
$323 saving from the best midsummer fare of $819. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. airlines that also fly overseas should always be grilled for details about 
how their senior plans apply to international trips. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's "Freedom Passport," for example, allows a year of domestic travel 
for $1,599, but global add-ons for optional international trips to Europe, the 
Caribbean, Mexico, Hawaii and other Pacific destinations start as low as $150 
per round trip. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar plan, Eastern offers first-class travel for $1,599; coach is 
$1,199. Destinations include San Juan, St. Thomas, St. Croix and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Another common way to compensate seniors is with coupon books. They usually are 
good for a year but sometimes restrict such things as total mileage per trip or 
number of trips. However, most allow the purchase of unlimited coupons. 
American, USAir and Delta Air Lines sell books of four coupons for $420, eight 
for $704. Coupons can be used for most flights. Northwest's and United's 
cheapest books are $384 but restrict travel days; Eastern's, also restricted, 
are $368. 
</P>
<P>
TWA's restricted four-coupon book, $379, includes a certificate redeemable for 
a round-trip ticket from New York City to Europe at a peak-season rate of $649. 
</P>
<P>
All require advance booking except Northwest, which also throws in added 
discounts for travelers who register for the "WorldPerks Senior" plan. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, you may be getting older, but the deals are getting better.

FOOTLOOSE: WEAVING THROUGH SCOT ISLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYER and ED RABEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TARBERT, Scotland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you've ever had the desire to go crofting in the Outer Hebrides, the region 
of Harris on the Isle of Lewis is just the place to have a go at 
sheep-shearing, birthing lambs, hay-making or cutting and storing peat. 
</P>
<P>
Hardscrabble farming has been a way of life for island crofters since anyone 
can remember, so much so that many have taken to weaving the famous Harris 
tweed or fishing as a second source of income. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the economic vagaries of life here, islanders remain in Harris for its 
rolling landscape of spring wildflowers, summer blanket of mauve heather, 
beautiful lochs and great beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The air is alpine in its purity, crowds are unheard of and, even if you're out 
in the boondocks, a mobile bank, butcher, baker and grocer call at your croft 
regularly. There's also a play bus loaded with goodies to help keep the 
children happy. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly Northwest, British Airways, Air Canada or American to 
Glasgow, then British Airways or Loganair to Stornoway on the Hebrides' Isle of 
Lewis. From there it's an hour's drive down to Tarbert. The Los Angeles-Glasgow 
leg will cost between $827 and $1,002 round trip, based on advance purchase, 
month and day of week flown. Glasgow-Stornoway round trip is about $148. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? You need at least three days here to begin to appreciate the 
rugged beauty of the island and adjust to its leisurely pace. We found lodging 
and dining costs very reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The British pound recently sold for $1.64. Come here any time 
from May through August, with May-June getting the least rain. Still, it rains 
two out of three days on a yearly basis, so bring waterproof clothing and foot 
gear for mucking about on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: MacLeod Farm (Hillhead, Scadabay; $38 B&amp;B double, 
shared bath) is one of the farms participating in Scotland's "Crofting Life 
Holidays" program. It's about 10 minutes south of Tarbert on the east side of 
the island, and has three bedrooms and two baths, with hot and cold water in 
each room. An evening meal, which could be Scotch broth, lamb or cod, lots of 
vegetables and dessert is about $9. 
</P>
<P>
The Harris Hotel (Tarbert; $83 B&amp;B double, $73 without bath) is family 
owned and a very typical country hotel with a good measure of charm. Bedrooms 
differ in amenities -- some are modest, others have velvet draperies and 
antiques. 
</P>
<P>
Most rooms have views of Loch Tarbert or a small waterfall and kitchen garden. 
A "residents' wee bar" off the lobby has the best selection of single-malt 
Scotch whiskys in these parts, 50 by our count. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few B&amp;Bs within town is Dunard House (main street; $41 B&amp;B 
double, shared bath), a simple but comfortable place. There's hot-and-cold in 
each room, self-catering coffee- and tea-making equipment, and only breakfast 
is served. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Breakfasts are always hearty and generous affairs in 
Scotland, and usually include a selection of juices, hot porridge (oatmeal), 
eggs, bacon, ham, black pudding (don't ask about the offal ingredients), 
oatcakes, toast, coffee and tea. It should hold you until lunch. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find plenty of lamb and mutton on menus, perhaps venison in the fall, 
but the island's tables come into their own with marvelous seafood. Try the 
poached salmon, herring with oatmeal, delicious lemon sole, lobster, mussels or 
broiled scallops. 
</P>
<P>
Whiskey is spelled this way in Britain and it always means Scotch. Local lager 
is the nearest thing to what Americans call beer, but it's much stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Good local dining: The Harris Hotel sounds the gong before dinner (about 7:30), 
and the dining room is a cheerful place with a gas fireplace and fresh flowers 
on the tables. A four-course menu for about $20 may include smoked salmon, 
trout or mussels; delightful turnip-and-almond soup or Scots haggis with neeps 
(turnips); roast haunch of venison with red currant jelly or chicken Balmoral 
(chicken breasts pan-fried with a sauce of whiskey, cream and mushrooms). 
Dessert could be homemade shortcake or oatcakes with cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Rosevilla Tearoom (main street) is a good spot for a crofter's lunch (about 
$4), high tea or a plethora of pastries. 
</P>
<P>
An Clachen Restaurant and Crafts Center (Leverburgh) is on the west side of the 
island, above a grocery store and beside a crafts shop. It's a real 
chips-with-everything place, simple and devoid of frills. The menu gives you a 
wide choice of such items as fish and chips, chicken and chips, shrimp and 
chips, sausage and chips and, no joke, pizza and chips. Or you can just have 
the chips. The craft shop is interesting but terribly overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Crofting Life Holidays are offered by regional tourist boards on 
the mainland of Scotland and in the Hebrides for periods of three, five or 
seven days. You live in the croft house with the owners and can participate in 
chores or local activities if you choose. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those mentioned above, you might also help sow crops, make 
cheese, gather shellfish on beaches, fish for trout and lobster, make bread or 
just relax with a little key bird watching. 
</P>
<P>
A typical cost, for MacLeod Farm above, would be $88 per person for three 
nights, $134 for five and $174 for the week, which includes lodging, breakfast 
and the evening meal. 
</P>
<P>
Harris Tweed has been woven here for more than four centuries, with very strict 
rules governing its spinning, dying and weaving. Due to the tautness of the 
loom and weight of the cloth, the weaving is usually done by men and always in 
their own croft, then left by the house gate for pickup. 
</P>
<P>
A five-minute boat ride takes you to the Isle of Scalpay, where a knitters 
cooperative provides an outlet for sweaters, scarfs, socks and such, knitted by 
ladies of the island from the Blackface sheep wool used in the tweed. A rich 
and heavy hand-knit sweater should cost about $57. 
</P>
<P>
If perchance you feel that your forebears may have sprung from the Outer 
Hebrides, pop over to the Genealogy Research Service at Northton and let Bill 
Lawson, its director, do a rundown on your Gaelic heritage. Lawson is all charm 
and good cheer, and his old-schoolhouse home is a true oasis of fine books and 
paintings. 
</P>

CRUISE VIEWS: BROCHURES TELL MORE THAN THEY PERHAPS INTEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's that cruise ship you're thinking about sailing aboard really like? 
</P>
<P>
It isn't difficult to figure out if you know how to read the brochure. That's 
where a cruise line tells you the truth about itself, whether it means to or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
First, flip quickly through the brochure to get an overview. What did you 
notice most? 
</P>
<P>
If it was a Carnival Cruise Lines brochure you saw young people in bathing 
suits dancing, exercising, laughing and drinking pink drinks; casinos with and 
without people, Las Vegas-type showgirls in pink feathers and a huge midnight 
buffet with toque-topped chefs from central casting. 
</P>
<P>
In Society Expeditions' current brochure you see photos of passengers 
hobnobbing with penguins and primitive tribesmen with spears and feathers, but 
very little about food, drink and gambling. The line knows its passengers care 
more about a close encounter with flora and fauna than a rendezvous with 
surf-and-turf. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Cruises, on the other hand, displays an inordinate amount of food and 
drink in its 1990 Caribbean brochure, interspersed with an occasional 
photograph of someone exercising or relaxing in the sauna. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Viking Line features handsome, successful-looking, mature individuals 
doing whatever it is that handsome, successful-looking, mature individuals do. 
Princess, meanwhile, splits its focus between fitness, food and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
All brochures from all cruise lines are designed so as to appeal to a 
specialized audience. Thus the choice of photographs can tell a lot about the 
type of cruise. 
</P>
<P>
Next, study the handsome, well-groomed models that beam at each other happily 
in picture after picture. They represent the way in which that cruise line 
visualizes its ideal passengers. Then see if you can find in the background any 
slightly out-of-focus passengers who actually bought passage aboard that ship. 
A few companies, notably Royal Cruise Line and Carnival Cruise Lines, do not 
separate the real passengers from the models, which is one version of honesty 
in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most successful of all cruise photographs is in the Sea Goddess 
brochures. A waiter in a white jacket and swimming trunks is serving glasses of 
champagne from a silver tray to two laughing couples in the surf off Virgin 
Gorda. Everyone who sees it knows immediately whether the Sea Goddess 
experience is for them. 
</P>
<P>
When you've finished with the photos, take a look at the itinerary. Where two 
cities are listed, one in parentheses, such as Civitavecchia (for Rome) or 
Livorno (for Florence), that's a clue that you may have a long bus ride from 
the port city to the destination. 
</P>
<P>
Check your calendar to see which day of the week you are in port if there's a 
shopping opportunity; you don't want to arrive in St. Thomas on Sunday when 
most places are closed. 
</P>
<P>
An asterisk or the words "cruise by" lets you know that the ship does not call 
in that port, but if you have your binoculars along you can get a glimpse of it 
as you pass. 
</P>
<P>
If the text extols an island where you get a breathtaking view from atop a 
dormant volcano in the island's center and your itinerary shows that you dock 
at 9 a.m. and sail at noon, there's no way you'll be able to see that view. If 
your Greek Islands cruise arrives at Hydra at 9 p.m. and departs at 10:30 p.m., 
you won't get many slides to show the folks back home. 
</P>
<P>
A deck plan can tell you as much about the ship as a good travel agent, once 
you learn to decipher it. Look for the extras the cruise line doesn't promote, 
such as self-service laundry, library, card room, sauna. 
</P>
<P>
Colors on the cabin diagrams correspond with price categories in the brochure, 
so you can tell easily how much a certain cabin will cost. Find those cabins 
you do not want -- those immediately above or below a disco, casino or theater 
if you're a light sleeper, those adjacent to elevators or lounge areas, those 
that are squeezed into narrower areas toward the ship's bow. 
</P>
<P>
Dining room diagrams can tip you off as to how close together the tables are 
and whether there are any tables for two. 
</P>
<P>
Cabin size, too, can be determined more easily from floor plans than 
photographs, In the latter, the photographer is usually standing in the hallway 
or crouched in the shower, shooting with a wide-angle lens to make the modest 
stateroom look as big as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, spend some time carefully reading the fine print in the back of the 
brochure before signing up for your dream vacation. Amount of deposit, method 
of payment and cancellation regulations are spelled out, as well as the 
company's policy on refunds, the "will not be responsible for" disclaimers, and 
details on special diet requests, facilities for the disabled, minimum age of 
children permitted on board, and whether or not the air fare to catch the ship 
is included. 
</P>
<P>
Most cabin prices are based on a "per person/double occupancy" rate, which 
means that persons traveling alone who want a private cabin may have to pay a 
surcharge. Some ships offer "guaranteed roommate" plans, meaning they will 
match you with another person of the same sex. Failing that, they will allow 
you to occupy the cabin alone at the per person/double occupancy rate. Third 
and fourth passengers in a cabin occupying pull-down upper berths usually 
travel at a lower fixed rate or sometimes, in the case of children, free. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, beware of brochures bearing sketches instead of photographs. Unless 
the ship is still under construction or undergoing major remodeling when the 
brochure was issued, you're right to suspect that the line is trying to hide 
something from you.

TRAVEL VIDEOS: A COUPLE OF WAYS OF VIEWING 'THE ETERNAL CITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rome is filled with countless historic, artistic and architectural treasures 
that support its claim to the title, "The Eternal City." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a city of elegant shops, outdoor markets, museums, cappuccino bars, 
trattorias, gelaterias, sidewalk cafes and monumental traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
In two diverse Rome videos, each of which is less than an hour and reviewed 
below, the producers capture its essence very well. 
</P>
<P>
"Rome" (International Video Network, Video Visits, 55 minutes. 1989). 
</P>
<P>
Most of the historic attractions in this mosaic are at the numerous piazzas 
that dot the city. At the piazzas, Romans are usually surrounded by tourists 
attracted by the classical palazzos, churches, monuments and fountains. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the many popular places are the Piazza del Popolo, with its huge 
Egyptian obelisk; the Piazza di Spagna with the Spanish Steps and the piazzas 
Barberini, Navona and Trevi, with their wondrous fountains. 
</P>
<P>
Other stops include the Palazzo dei Conservatori (city of hall) on Capitoline 
Hill, where viewers are guests at a wedding, and the impressive Pantheon, the 
oldest and best preserved of Rome's ancient buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In the shadow of Capitoline Hill is the ancient Forum, where scenes include the 
Colosseum, the site of the Circus Maximus and the ruins of Palatine Hill, where 
Rome was founded. A side trip follows the Appian Way to the historic catacombs. 
</P>
<P>
The video also makes visits to the beautiful Borehese Gardens, lake and art 
gallery; the Mouth of Truth sculpture, which is said to bite the hand of a liar 
who puts his hand in it; the island of Tiberina, and the old Left Bank 
Trastevere district, with the lovely 3rd-Century Church of St. Cecilia. 
</P>
<P>
The segment on Vatican City includes the Ponte Vittoria Emanuele (bridge), 
Castel Sant-Angelo and St. Peter's for scenes of the Pope, the Vatican Gardens 
and museums and the Sistine Chapel dominated by Michelangelo's monumental 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Other churches to see include the basilica of St. John Lateran, St. Peter in 
Chains and St. Paul's Outside the Walls. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with scenes of Rome at night, the Via Veneto at sunset and 
lighted views of fountains. 
</P>
<P>
Although it holds no surprises, this is a well-photographed and well-narrated 
traditional travelogue that will appeal mainly to the armchair traveler. 
</P>
<P>
It offers no tips or travel recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
A tape is available from International Video Network, Video Visits, 2242 Camino 
Ramon, San Ramon, Calif. 94583, (415) 866-1121. Price: $24.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Rome" (VPI/AC Video, produced by Robin Williams, 50 minutes, 1988). Travel 
film maker Williams' video focuses on the cultural attractions found in Rome, 
concentrating on classical art, architecture and ancient history. It should 
have a special appeal for armchair travelers, and if used in conjunction with 
the above "Rome" video, should enrich the trip of a vacationer. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' interest in the piazzas of Rome centers on the fountains created by 
such artists as Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini and on the history and architectural 
significance of the surrounding churches and palazzos. 
</P>
<P>
A few that he examines include the charming Tortoise Fountain in tiny Piazza 
Mattei; the Boat Fountain and the Spanish Steps in the Piazza di Spagna; the 
Triton Fountain in the Piazza Barberini, and the impressive Fountain of the 
Four Rivers, the Moor and the Neptune in the Piazza Navona. Others are the 
Fountain of Trevi and the elegant churches of the Piazza Quirinale. 
</P>
<P>
On an extensive tour of the Vatican, Williams describes the design of St. 
Peter's Square and basilica and singles out the famous "Pieta" by Michelangelo 
and "The Throne of St. Peter's" by Bernini, for special attention. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight is a visit to the Sistine Chapel and its ceiling for close 
studies and a history of Michelangelo's magnificent work. Also studied is 
Raphael's "School of Athens," as well as many of his other paintings in the 
Papal quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican visit concludes with a history and film on the Swiss Guard and a 
tour of the Vatican Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
A segment of interest follows the journey of St. Paul from the time he landed 
in Italy through his trial, death and burial, including scenes of the Appian 
Way, the Forum (with drawings as it looked then) and the Basilica of St. Paul's 
Outside the Walls where he is buried. 
</P>
<P>
The video and narration also describe the founding of Rome, the building of the 
Colosseum and give a detailed examination of the Forum and its ruins, including 
the Arch of Septimus Severus that Napoleon used as a model for the Arc de 
Triomphe in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Other ancient sites include the Palatine Hill, the Circus Maximus and the 
Trajan Markets and column. 
</P>
<P>
Two pleasant side trips visit the tower of Tivoli with the Villa d'Este and its 
beautiful gardens and fountains and to the lakeside summer retreats of Nemi and 
Albano in the Alban Hills. 
</P>
<P>
It seems as if Williams' video was filmed by two cameras. The scenic shots are 
often fuzzy, but the artworks are good and the musical score is effective. It 
will be helpful to those interested in an aesthetic view of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
No tips or travel recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
A tape is available from VPI/AC, 381 Park Ave. South, New York 10016, (212) 
685-5522. Price; $24.95.

NO DIPLOMACY NECESSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My Sunday morning ritual of reading the Travel Section of The Times was ruined 
by the front page article "Hidden Venice: The First Jewish Ghetto," (May 6). 
The article describes a group of Italian tourists visiting the old Jewish 
ghetto in Venice, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The following dialogue takes place: "Why did people discriminate against Jews 
in the first place?" asks one woman. "Because they killed Christ," says a 
second. "But that was a Roman proceeding. The whole thing was done by the 
Romans. Isn't that right?" a third demands. . .the guide responds 
diplomatically: "Perhaps it would be better to talk with a rabbi." 
</P>
<P>
My points are the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why does the guide have to respond diplomatically? Doesn't he know that the 
Jews did not kill Christ and that the Vatican declared this officially years 
ago? If he doesn't, he should not be in the position of educating 
impressionable people. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the article, no rabbi is ever consulted. The debate is left unsettled in 
the minds of the tourists and in the minds of your readers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why even print such out-dated anti-Semitic rhetoric in the first place?

SOMETHING PERSONAL

<TEXT>
<P>
When we moved to Orcas in 1980 and I told my friends that we were moving to the 
San Juan Islands, they thought we were going to the Caribbean. When we arrived 
it was as you described it in Jerry Hulse's charming article, "Personal Bests" 
(April 8). Today, not so. 
</P>
<P>
The travel writers discovered us. Clippings from our local weeklies illustrate 
the conditions that you travel writers have helped to create with your articles 
raving over the beauties of our islands. 
</P>
<P>
Of course I'm being a bit facetious, but I'm sure I speak for more than half of 
the population of San Juan county when I say please do us a favor -- for Pete's 
sake shut up about our islands.

5 STATE OFFICES REGULATE VARIOUS ESCROW AGENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. KINCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California escrow providers are regulated by five state agencies -- the 
departments of Corporations, Insurance, Real Estate, Savings and Loans and 
Banking. 
</P>
<P>
The agency regulating escrow companies in California varies with the escrow 
firm's organizational structure and the type of escrow the company is permitted 
to handle. 
</P>
<P>
The state's 1,212 independent escrow companies are regulated by the Department 
of Corporations, with the Federal Trade Commission also handling consumer 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Escrow departments of real estate brokers are under the jurisdiction of the 
Department of Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
Savings and loan associations holding transactions in escrow are under the 
jurisdiction of the Department of Savings and Loan, Office of Thrift 
Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
A California licensed bank acting as an escrow agent is regulated by the 
Department of Banking, while consumer complaints regarding escrows handled by a 
federally licensed bank can be directed to the Comptroller of the Currency. 
</P>
<P>
Escrow transactions handled by title companies are regulated by the Department 
of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies: 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Closing costs are the charges paid by a buyer and the seller when property 
changes hands. 
</P>
<P>
While certain charges are customarily paid by the seller -- the real estate 
agent's commission, for instance -- and others by the buyer -- loan origination 
fee, for example -- there is no law requiring that specific closing costs are 
the responsibility of the seller or the buyer, according to Robert J. Bond, 
writing in "California Real Estate Practice." (Scott, Foresman &amp; Co., third 
edition, 1988). 
</P>
<P>
The only exception is with government-backed loans, where regulations prohibit 
the buyer from paying certain closing costs, such as loan discount points, Bond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The seller pays only one-time or nonrecurring expenses, such as the real estate 
commission or the transfer tax, while the buyer has both nonrecurring costs -- 
the loan origination fee and the appraisal fee, for example -- and recurring 
costs, such as the property tax proration, hazard insurance and the impound 
account -- also called the tax and insurance reserves or, in some parts of the 
country, the escrow account. 
</P>
<P>
The time to negotiate who pays what is when the seller submits the Real Estate 
Purchase Contract and Receipt for Deposit -- the full name of what is often 
called the deposit receipt, according to veteran escrow officer Diana L. 
Stewart, president of Brentwood Escrow. 
</P>
<P>
"All the escrow instructions are a direct result of the deposit receipt, so 
make sure you agree on everything at that time," she said. "Read the escrow 
instructions to make sure they agree with the information in the four-page 
deposit receipt. If it isn't in the escrow instructions, it won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
You shouldn't have many surprises about how much you'll pay as a buyer or 
seller when the escrow closes, thanks to "Truth in Lending" laws and the Real 
Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) administered by the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
</P>
<P>
RESPA, in effect since 1976, requires specific procedures and forms for closing 
costs, including the Uniform Settlement Statement, HUD-1, according to the 
"Reference Book" published by the Department of Real Estate. Since RESPA covers 
FHA and VA loans and loans from financial institutions with federally insured 
deposits, the HUD-1 statement is almost universal. 
</P>
<P>
Your escrow agent or real estate agent should be able to give you preliminary 
estimates of the closing costs long before the escrow closes, according to 
Robert Irwin ("Tips &amp; Traps When Buying a Home," McGraw-Hill, 1990). If you 
have any questions, just ask the real estate agent well before the closing 
date, Irwin said. 
</P>
<P>
The accompanying chart lists the charges customarily paid by the seller and the 
buyer, as well as items -- usually property taxes and hazard insurance -- that 
are prorated so that both the buyer and seller pay their share.

When you fall in love with a house at first blush, deep inside you don't want 
to hear there is something wrong with it. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph V. Scaduto, university lecturer, author and professional building 
inspector, recalls one recent case in which he checked out a house for a couple 
who wanted to buy it: 
</P>
<P>
"In the middle of the inspection, the wife came up to me and said: 'Please stop 
telling my husband about the problems with this house. We love it.' 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, they don't want to hear the bad news," says Scaduto of Lynnfield, 
Mass., founder of the Society for Professional Real Estate Inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
Except for cursory checks for termites, independent inspection of homes during 
real estate transactions was virtually unheard of 15 years ago. Now, about 60% 
of the homes sold get top-to-bottom inspections paid for by the potential 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
"The broker really represents the seller. The only true friend the buyer has is 
the real estate inspector. You need an investigator who is not emotionally 
involved in the transaction," Scaduto says. 
</P>
<P>
A good inspection of an average three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath home should take 
about two or three hours and cost between $150 and $300. It should include a 
typewritten report identifying all actual or potential problems, include 
suggestions, maintenance tips and a priority list of what the owner can do to 
prepare for or avoid problems in future years, Scaduto says. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll frequently get back the money you paid in the form of some compromise 
in repairs from the owner. Home inspection is probably the cheapest insurance 
policy you can get," Scaduto says. 
</P>
<P>
"With the high cost of homes today, people are more and more leery of spending 
a tremendous amount of money and ending up with a dump. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, buyers of property try to save a few dollars and skip an 
inspection. They'll rationalize it by saying: 'Well, it has a nice new kitchen 
and new bathrooms. What do we need an inspector for?' 
</P>
<P>
"The kitchen and bathrooms are not as important as the foundation and the 
attic," Scaduto says. "The foundation is the heart of the house and the attic 
is the soul, the place to look for leaks and vermin." 
</P>
<P>
If an inspection turns up major deficiencies, the potential buyer has two 
choices: either negotiate a better price or walk away, Scaduto advises. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of home buyers are naive. They feel that just because they signed a 
purchase agreement for a specific price, they're set at that price," Scaduto 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"If we give them a list of several thousand dollars in deficiencies, this is a 
negotiable point. If the owner is adamant about not lowering the price, he 
should should correct the problems, or be stuck with the house." 
</P>
<P>
Scaduto, author of "What's It Worth: A Home Inspection and Appraisal Manual," 
(Tab Books), offers these tips on finding a qualified inspector: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't ask the broker for a recommendation. He has a vested interest in 
selling the property and may recommend a lenient inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ask your lawyer, bank or a professional organization. Check the Yellow 
Pages for building inspection services. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make sure the inspector has errors and omissions insurance and general 
liability insurance. If he makes an error in his report or damages the home 
during the inspection, both policies protect the buyer and inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ask about his qualifications, what he will look at, how long the inspection 
should take. Will he check all appliances, attics and crawl spaces? Does he 
activate all mechanical systems? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What kind of report will you get? You want an easily understandable 
narrative report, not a checklist. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The home buyer and perhaps the broker should be present during the 
inspection, but Scaduto said the homeowner should not. They tend to be overly 
defensive. 
</P>
<P>
Scaduto said his book is intended primarily for buyers in areas that have few 
real estate inspectors. It gives guidelines about what the purchaser should 
look for in the condition of the house and the life expectancies of various 
systems: how soon a roof may need replacing, how much time a heating system has 
left, how to conduct a radon test. 
</P>
<P>
Scaduto developed and coordinates a first-in-the-nation certificate program for 
building inspectors at Northeastern University in Boston. Most of the people 
taking the seven courses required for certification have backgrounds in 
building trades or general contracting, he said.

JAIL SUICIDE SOUGHT REDEMPTION AND GOT IT -- A LITTLE TOO LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early in the morning of May 7, while most of Los Angeles County Jail was still 
asleep, Arthur James Crespin sat in the dark of Cell D-17 and methodically 
braided his bedsheet into a noose. 
</P>
<P>
The former La Puente construction worker, who by his own count had been 
arrested 32 times, was once again behind bars -- this time for trying to 
procure $4,000 in cash with the help of a stolen American Express card. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine years old, he was distraught, confused and headed back to state 
prison to serve a two-year sentence for forgery. When guards passed at 5:20 
a.m., they found him hanging from a piece of iron jutting out of the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
His suicide did not make the newspapers. There was no obituary and no funeral. 
In many ways, Crespin, a slim, red-headed man with gold aviator-frame glasses, 
was just another career criminal who had met a sorry end. 
</P>
<P>
But those who knew him were left wondering what might have been. They say his 
life had taken a dramatic turn in the preceding weeks, with the spiritual 
strength that had long eluded him finally within grasp. 
</P>
<P>
As he sat in jail awaiting sentencing, Crespin had been placing ads in The 
Times appealing for fellowship and forgiveness. He feverishly read the Bible, 
completing long lesson plans in which he proclaimed himself reborn. And every 
day he telephoned declarations of love to a 21-year-old Amtrak dining car 
attendant from Hesperia whom he hoped one day to marry. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so much compassion for him," said his fiancee's mother, Regina Maggio. 
"All the recognition he had ever got was negative. Now, for the first time in 
his life, I think he was feeling a lot more inner peace." 
</P>
<P>
While it's not rare for a convict -- much less a con man -- to say anything he 
believes might help his case, Crespin did take some unusual steps in his quest 
for salvation. For four consecutive days in April, he placed a classified ad in 
The Times announcing that he had found God. 
</P>
<P>
"I've prayed to the Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus for a second chance," he 
wrote, urging members of the Christian community to correspond with him in 
jail. "I need your guidance and prayers." 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 ministers and church folk responded, their letters wrapped in a 
bundle with other religious texts later found in his cell. He wrote back in 
neat, tiny strokes on yellow, legal-size paper. 
</P>
<P>
The beautiful penmanship was the first thing that the Rev. Dale Scott noticed 
about the letter, which he read several times before running to share his joy 
with colleagues at the Church at Rocky Peak in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so pleased because it really seemed like he had found forgiveness in his 
own heart and peace from the Lord," said Scott, associate pastor of the church. 
"He even asked to come speak to our congregation when he got out." 
</P>
<P>
As Crespin's May 3 sentencing neared, a friend placed another ad in The Times. 
Under the classification of "Personal Messages," it urged Christians everywhere 
to attend his 9 a.m. hearing in Pasadena Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"If you believe in Jesus . . . and the forgiveness of sins and the eternal life 
we receive from Christ, then your presence is needed. Come one, come all." 
</P>
<P>
Although only a couple of believers showed up, Crespin's fiancee, Lisa Wheeler, 
was there in the second row of the courtroom. She had met met him two years ago 
through yet another ad that he placed in The Times while serving a federal 
prison term for counterfeiting. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Pasadena Superior Judge Harold E. Shabo denied his request for 
probation, Crespin called Wheeler and her mother collect from jail every day to 
report his spiritual progress. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the most romantic, caring people you could ever imagine," Wheeler 
said at the time. "I love him and he knows I'll support him as long as he helps 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
But Crespin's demons had been at work too long for redemption to come easily. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Maggio after his sentencing, he attributed most of his troubles 
to abuse he suffered as a child, when he lived on a U.S. military base in 
Europe with his Army father and German mother. 
</P>
<P>
At 12, he said, he beat up a neighbor boy who made fun of the way he talked, 
thinking this would make his dad proud. Instead, he was arrested and placed in 
a mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I did everything I could to make him say he loved me," Crespin wrote of his 
father, who Maggio said died 10 years ago. "All I ever wanted from life was 
love." 
</P>
<P>
The family later moved to the San Gabriel Valley, where Crespin attended La 
Puente High School and as a teen-ager found work at a construction company in 
Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
At times, his life seemed remarkably average: swimming, bowling, back-yard 
barbecues and miniature golf. At others, he would sink into depression, doing 
drugs or turning up drunk and penniless on the doorstep of a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"The troubles he had came when he was lonely and didn't really know where his 
life was headed," said Jose Amaya, 33, an Industry warehouse worker who is one 
the few friends who stood by Crespin over the years. "Then he'd start spending 
most of his time figuring out a scheme to make a quick dollar. He had caviar 
wishes on a dime budget." 
</P>
<P>
One of his first schemes entailed breaking into the home of a La Puente couple 
in 1980, making off with a wedding ring and an antique pearl-handled pistol. 
Later, he robbed a college administrator in Hacienda Heights and a pipe company 
in South El Monte. Then, while working for a Covina-based carpet-cleaning 
company, he filched jewelry while shampooing rugs for three customers at their 
homes in Walnut and Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
In those cases and others detailed in court files, Crespin -- whose many 
aliases included A. J. Wheeler and Maurice J. Tost -- confessed to the crimes 
almost as soon as he was confronted. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time he got to me, there wasn't anything I could do -- he had told 
everybody everything," said Richard E. Orozco, a Montebello lawyer appointed to 
defend him on the carpet-cleaning case. "He seemed almost submissive. I kind of 
felt sorry for the guy." 
</P>
<P>
After several stints behind bars, he eventually drew a three-year sentence at 
Terminal Island for counterfeiting U.S. Treasury checks. There, he came to know 
Wheeler, who said she was feeling low and answered his pen-pal ad in search of 
companionship. She found his letters witty and sincere. 
</P>
<P>
"He was real intriguing," she said. "I thought if he could just apply his 
intelligence to something positive he would be OK." 
</P>
<P>
At first her mother burned Crespin's letters as soon as they arrived, but 
Wheeler persuaded her that he could be reformed. When Crespin was released last 
December, he went to live with them in their one-story brick home in the high 
desert of San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
He was a meticulous housekeeper and spent long days working in the flower bed 
and making plans to build an extra room for him and his future bride. But, as 
in times past, the lure of the bottle and easy money sabotaged the 
tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
On March 23, just three months out of prison, he fought with Wheeler and left. 
The next she and her mother heard, he had been arrested by Pasadena police 
after American Express security personnel discovered that he was trying to get 
cash with a stolen credit card at one of their branch offices. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason he got caught was because he got real sloppy, and he got real 
sloppy because he wanted to get caught," Maggio said. "He really thinks the 
Lord had him arrested just to save his life." 
</P>
<P>
Behind bars again, Crespin found a copy of the New Testament and began his 
apparent conversion. At his sentencing, however, he kept quiet about the 
details of his new-found faith. He made only a plea to be placed in a drug 
diversion program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame he didn't tell the judge he was having some emotional problems," 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Nancy D. Aronson said. "Unfortunately, he was just a career 
criminal as far as I could tell." 
</P>
<P>
In his last letter to Wheeler, Crespin said that she and her mother gave him 
the love he had always searched for but that it had came too late in his 
troubled life. He said he no longer wanted to lie to them, yet was afraid they 
would not stand by him if he revealed more details of his past. Without their 
love, he wrote, he believed he could not survive. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to be happy, but with me in jail, you're only in pain and so am I," 
his letter said. "Please pray I make it to heaven."

ONE HAND, ONE SHOT -- DISABLED GOLFER HAS CARDED 8 ACES SO FAR

Richard Saldana was on the seventh tee at the Catalina Island Golf Club, ready 
to try for another hole in one; he had shot his eighth a few weeks ago. They 
marvel at that in the barbershop down the hill. And they say a steel helmet 
saved Saldana's life when his right hand was blown off in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Saldana stood in a right-hander's position and held a 3-iron with his left 
hand. He used the stump at the end of his right arm to steady the club. As he 
swung, he pulled the stump away just before hitting the ball, and followed 
through with his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
The ball soared toward the flag 203 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
"Not another one!" said Gil Voci, who was in the foursome. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, the ball stopped 12 feet short of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
"You realize," playing partner Buddy O'Jibway said, "how amazing this guy is?" 
</P>
<P>
A short man with a stomach he admits beer has greatly expanded, Saldana wore a 
baseball cap, shorts and a T-shirt with the crossed-swords insignia of his old 
Army unit, the 11th Armored Cavalry. 
</P>
<P>
"A little more and that thing goes in," he said in a matter-of-fact tone as he 
got back in his cart. Sipping from a can of beer, he drove down a fairway 
bordered by fat palms and overlooked by mountain ridges that touched clouds. 
</P>
<P>
This is the easygoing Saldana's island, where, like the 10 brothers and sisters 
before him, he was born and reared. This is the course where he caddied as a 
boy and learned the game from his brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 44, his amazing golf feats have made him the talk of the town in 
Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel like I can do something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After a moment's thought, he added, "This is about all I do." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Saldana thought he would never do much of anything again. 
</P>
<P>
He was a 24-year-old specialist fourth class when, during a midday Viet Cong 
ambush in 1969, a rocket grenade hit the ammunition can in the personnel 
carrier he was driving. In the blast's aftermath, his right hand dangled from 
his wrist; it was later removed at a field hospital. The muscles in his left 
arm were severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Reminders remain. His left arm is scarred, and he says the stump throbs and his 
ears ring constantly. 
</P>
<P>
After the ambush, Saldana spent 3 1/2 months in a Veterans Administration 
hospital in San Francisco, then returned to Avalon. "I was all bummed out," he 
said. "I didn't want to go out." 
</P>
<P>
A 1963 graduate of Avalon High School, Saldana had been a volunteer fireman 
before he was drafted, and had hoped to join the Avalon Fire Department after 
the service. "I didn't think about it after that, didn't think it would work 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He had also worked at the Catalina Bird Farm. But the farm, a home to the 
exotic birds he fed, had closed by the time Saldana returned from the war -- 
not that he would have had much interest in working there again. 
</P>
<P>
"For three years I didn't want to do anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he had the support of many friends and his close-knit family. "All I did 
was hang around them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Martan Saldana, a gardener, moved to Santa Catalina Island from Mexico in 1919. 
He met Margarita Mesa a year later, and they soon were married. All of their 
children have stayed on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Angie Romo, 65, and Isabel Lopez, 64, are homemakers; Margarita Ponce, 58, is 
an employee of the Catalina By the Sea souvenir shop; Ruth Sampson, 55, works 
at Leo's Drug Store; Frank Saldana, 53, works at Abe's Liquor Store; Herman, 
51, helps take care of the island's interior; Joe, 50, is the golf club 
champion; Sylvester, 48, owns a landscaping business, and Lolo, 60, runs the 
barber shop. The oldest brother, Martan, 61, died last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody cares about everybody here," Richard Saldana said. "When I was in 
the hospital, I got a shoe box full of letters from the island. All of my 
family and friends visited me." 
</P>
<P>
Sampson recalled the time her brother came home from San Francisco: "We felt 
worse than he did. I took care of the wounds; he had a lot of shrapnel in his 
arms." 
</P>
<P>
The sweet smell of a green liquid called Osage Rub, which Lolo applies to the 
heads of his customers, filled his barber shop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty much all over town," he said about his brother's latest ace. 
"Bobby Piacentini was in here the other day and said, 'Geez, I've played golf 
for 35 years and haven't got one.' " 
</P>
<P>
The walls of the sports-oriented shop are busy with pennants, photos and 
paintings, as well as rosters of youth baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Saldanas have stayed on Catalina, Lolo said, because of its slow pace and 
their sense of belonging. "We're all involved in community activities," said 
the barber, whose son, Gilbert, is a former Avalon mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Jordan, whose hair was being cut, is the handicap chairman at the golf 
course. He assessed Richard Saldana's golfing ability: "An excellent putter. 
Not really long on his drives, but steady. Nerves of steel." 
</P>
<P>
"He's proud," Lolo chimed in. "What he does, he likes to do right." 
</P>
<P>
During his long rehabilitation, Richard Saldana had figured that he was through 
with golf. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to play," he said. "I had a hook screwed into my stump and it was 
attached to a golf club, but it didn't work right. So I forgot about it. Gave 
my clubs away." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Cadman, 40, who cleans fish at the Avalon Fish Market, remembered the day 
during that period when he tricked Saldana into showing him how to hit a golf 
ball. "He hit the ball well with his left hand," Cadman said. "I think he was 
surprised. It got his confidence up." 
</P>
<P>
Saldana, who has an 11 handicap, shot his first hole in one eight years ago. 
Two years later, he got two in a week. All of his aces have occurred at the 
Catalina course: two on the 114-yard second hole; two on the 124-yard sixth; 
three on the 159-yard ninth, and one -- the most recent -- on the 203-yard 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
He finds it hard to pinpoint a reason for such stunning success. "Yeah, it does 
surprise me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday afternoon, Saldana was teamed with O'Jibway, Gil Voci and Jim 
Wright in a best-ball match. 
</P>
<P>
"The town hustler, we call him," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I just play," Saldana said, laughing softly. Nonetheless, Saldana, who 
gets a monthly veteran's disability pension, gladly pocketed his winnings after 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
He lives with fiancee Kathy Emerson in the same three-story house, with its 
post-card view of rooftops and the harbor, that he has lived in since he was in 
the sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
He appreciates it when the Catalina Islander weekly newspaper runs a little 
item on him now and then, but he does not believe he is considered a celebrity. 
"I doubt it," he said. "I'm just around here." 
</P>
<P>
He usually takes a walk in the morning, then goes to the nine-hole course to 
play two, sometimes three rounds of golf a day. But the best time comes late in 
the afternoon at Silky's, a bar near the course named for Silky Reyes, who was 
the pro there when Saldana was a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, there was a baseball game on TV, the mountaintops could be seen 
through the small square windows up near the ceiling, and the beer and sports 
talk flowed in liberal amounts. 
</P>
<P>
Saldana kept his hat on and sat at a table with a group that included Voci, 
O'Jibway, Jordan and Joe Machado. 
</P>
<P>
"He's such a nice person," said O'Jibway, a short-haired, red-faced man who 
rents boats. "He does anything to help you out." 
</P>
<P>
Teri Gill, a regular at Silky's, came over to the table. She looked at Saldana 
and said to a visitor, "He's one of the most special guys in the world."

MEET 'BIG RED,' THE MYSTERY TOMATO; 
</P>
<P>
GARDENING: GROWN FROM SEED OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN, THESE TOMATOES ARE AS BIG AS A 
BABY'S HEAD AND TASTE GREAT. THE TALL PLANTS REQUIRE STURDY SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're as big as a baby's head, these tomatoes that came from seed passed over 
the fence. John Wasulko of La Palma got them from a friend in Anaheim, who got 
his from a friend in Pennsylvania, who got them from who knows where. John says 
he thought the name was Russian Beefsteak, and they certainly are a 
beefsteak-type, and one of the biggest I've seen -- a real county fair winner. 
</P>
<P>
One slice smothers a hamburger bun, hanging well over the edges. They are so 
heavy, and the stems so thick that Wasulko needs a sharp knife to cut them from 
the vine. And the vines are nothing to kick sand at -- they're trained to 
7-foot steel poles. 
</P>
<P>
Says Wasulko, "If I didn't cut off the tops, they'd be over your head, way over 
your head. They were headed over the wall (he points to a solid looking 
concrete block wall) when I cut them back." 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't cut off the side branches however, but simply gathers them up 
against the body of the plant and ties a loop of twine around the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
The trellis he grows them on is a sturdy and clever affair made from threaded 
steel rod. "I have the trellis tied into everything -- the block wall, the 
house, the patio supports. These tomatoes need a lot of support." 
</P>
<P>
"I once grew an 11 1/2-pound cabbage, but these tomatoes are more fun. My 
doctor loves tomatoes, so I brought him a bag and he couldn't believe it. He 
says 'I gotta weigh these' and put them on the baby scale, and they came in at 
around 3 1/2 pounds apiece." 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time to plant tomatoes, even near the coast, because warm weather 
will be here for keeps by the time they start to fruit. Weather that is too 
cool prevents fruiting (and so does late-summer weather that it too hot). 
</P>
<P>
If you want to try growing truly huge tomatoes like Wasulko's, there is one 
promising source -- a seed company devoted to tomatoes only -- The Tomato Seed 
Co. Inc., P.O. Box 323, Metuchen, N.J., 08840. 
</P>
<P>
They list their tomato varieties by size and shape and Group 1 is categorized 
as "huge, over 1 pound." There are 23 kinds in this group, including old 
standbys such as Burpee Big Boy and Burgess Colossal Red, but also some unusual 
and unheard of varieties. 
</P>
<P>
One named Bragger sounds real big, with fruit to 2 pounds; Oxheart is said to 
get to 2 pounds plus; Mortgage Lifter might just be the ticket for some of us, 
or how about Jung's Giant Climbing or Watermelon Beefsteak, a pink variety? 
</P>
<P>
Best yet might be Champs of New Jersey, which are actually seeds collected from 
each year's winners at the Championship Tomato Weigh In, held in New Jersey, 
which is close enough to Pennsylvania to maybe include something like Wasulko's 
giants. 
</P>
<P>
(The standard big varieties named Beefmaster, Beefsteak Red, Giant Beefsteak 
and Ponderosa, by the way, are only considered "extra large" by this company, 
and are in their Group 2.) 
</P>
<P>
Or, you might ask around, like John Wasulko did, and see if a friend or 
neighbor isn't growing something extra big. 
</P>
<P>
For any of these a big, strong support is required. The easiest to make is a 
cage of welded wire, the kind with 6-inch by 6-inch openings used to reinforce 
concrete driveways. You can find it at most building supply stores, and those 
6-inch openings are important if you want to be able to reach inside and get 
these huge tomatoes out. 
</P>
<P>
Buy the kind that is 8 feet wide and roll a 5-foot length into a cylinder to 
make a cage about 1 1/2 feet in diameter, enough for one plant. Use two sturdy 
2-by-2-inch stakes pounded into the ground on either side to support the cage. 
Most large tomatoes are "indeterminate" types, which means they don't stop 
growing, so you may have to cut out the top to keep them from going over the 
walls of their cage. 
</P>
<P>
You can also expect any tomato named Oxheart, Mammoth Wonder or Russian 
Beefsteak to have big appetites, and Wasulko fertilizes weekly with a liquid 
fertilizer (appropriately, he uses one named Miracle-Gro). Wasulko started his 
plants from seed sown in pots and planted them in the ground on May 1, when 
they were about 5 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
For those who wonder if bigger is perhaps not better, these tomatoes have few 
seeds and are nearly solid inside. And, they taste great.

'HOUSE-MACHINE' AT HOME ON SOUTHLAND'S HILLSIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESO, Whiteson is a Los Angeles free-lancer who writes on 
architectural topics. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If we eliminate from our hearts and minds all dead concepts in regard to the 
houses and look at the question from a critical and objective point of view, we 
shall arrive at the 'House-Machine' . . . beautiful in the way that the working 
tools and instruments which accompany our existence are beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
With this famous statement, included in his 1923 book "Towards a New 
Architecture," the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier sounded the rallying cry 
of a radically new manner of design that came to be called the International 
Style. 
</P>
<P>
The International Style, also known as Modernism, was a deliberate and total 
break with the traditional fashions in house design -- such as the local 
preference for Craftsman bungalows or Spanish Colonial Revival styles -- that 
prevailed in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its austere ideology, its penchant for plain flat roofs, large glass 
windows, Cubist white stucco shapes and open floor plans, the International 
Style was soon adapted to a more livable mode to suit Southern California's 
easy climate and relaxed folkways. 
</P>
<P>
Modernism was introduced to Los Angeles and adapted to its ambience by Richard 
Neutra and Rudolph Schindler, two gifted emigre Viennese architects. Schindler 
built Los Angeles' first purely Modern house in 1922 on Kings Road in what is 
now West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
A series of low pavilions intimately linked to outdoor spaces through glass 
walls, the design of the Kings Road house fused the garden with interior rooms 
in a manner that became a major characteristic of the Southland version of the 
International Style. 
</P>
<P>
For a time the Schindler and Neutra families shared the Kings Road house, which 
became a meeting place for a generation of young Angeleno architects such as 
Gregory Ain, Harwell Harris and Raphael Soriano, who would further gentle the 
Modernist severity to our topography. 
</P>
<P>
Neutra's own early 1930s house in Silver Lake, sponsored as a research project 
by the Dutch industrialist C. H. Van der Leeuw, embodied many of the standard 
characteristics of the style. 
</P>
<P>
A two-story oblong in white stucco with ribbon windows, the VDL House, as it 
was known, had an open plan and a rooftop solarium. A sleeping porch 
overlooking Silver Lake reservoir opened off the living room. 
</P>
<P>
Both Neutra and Schindler designed landmark International Style houses for 
Philip and Leah Lovell, a Los Angeles physician and his wife, who were 
prototypical Californian health faddists and political radicals. 
</P>
<P>
Schindler designed a beach house for the Lovells at Newport Beach in 1926; 
Neutra finished a house for the Lovells in the hills overlooking the Silver 
Lake reservoir in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
Neutra's Lovell House exemplified another Californian characteristic of the 
International Style -- a fondness for dramatic sites, often on a steep slope. 
</P>
<P>
The 1937 Ernst House, designed by Gregory Ain in the Ferndell section of Los 
Feliz, is a fine example of dramatic siting. Perched on the edge of a ravine, 
the house is a Cubist composition of flat, off-white stucco and wraparound 
glazing with spectacular long views toward downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Bob Tollefson, who bought the house in 1963, said he is an unexpected 
convert to the International Style. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife, Donna, and I were looking for a Spanish house, but as soon as we 
walked through the front door we were dazzled by the simplicity and openness of 
the spaces here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many Modernist houses set on slopes, the Ernst House inverts the living 
room and bedroom levels. The bedrooms are below the living room, which is 
entered off the street level. 
</P>
<P>
All of the main rooms share vistas opened up through floor-to-ceiling corner 
windows that make the landscape seem part of the house's interior. 
</P>
<P>
The simplified details, built-in closets and flush surfaces typical of the 
style reinforce Le Corbusier's notion of a house as a "machine for living in." 
</P>
<P>
Following this mechanistic metaphor, the movable furniture found in 
International Style houses was often restricted to the barest minimum -- so 
much so that there's a feeling in many Modernist homes that if the architects 
had had their way, the clean-limbed rooms would be free of all objects and the 
occupants would sit cross-legged on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
All the purists permitted might be a solemn array of Mies van der Rohe's famous 
chrome steel-and-black-leather Barcelona chairs, or maybe a laminated bentwood 
chaise designed by Finland's Alvar Aalto. These carefully placed pieces could 
be accompanied by Marcel Breuer's elegant cantilevered tubular metal chairs 
arranged around a Le Corbusier dining table made of plate glass floating on a 
light steel frame. 
</P>
<P>
The decor might permit a painting by the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian, whose 
abstract geometric canvases were much favored by International Style 
architects. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s and '30s, the dictum of "form follows function" -- coined by 
turn-of-the-century Chicago architect Louis Sullivan -- became the slogan of a 
movement in Europe and the United States that expressed a visionary faith in 
the beauty of machines as an ideal of social and aesthetic perfection free of 
fake historical nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
The name International Style was coined at a landmark 1932 exhibition of modern 
architecture at New York's Museum of Modern Art that introduced Modernism to 
the United States, barely a year before Adolf Hitler closed the famous Bauhaus 
School in Dessau, Germany, and its most influential teachers were forced to 
flee to America. 
</P>
<P>
In 1945, John Entenza, editor of the Los Angeles-based Arts &amp; Architecture 
magazine, sponsored a Case Study House program that experimented with an 
evolution of the International Style in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six Case Study houses designed by local Modernists -- including Charles 
Eames, Raphael Soriano, Craig Ellwood, Quincy Jones and Neutra -- epitomized 
the International Style at the height of its post-World War II popularity 
through the 1950s and early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Case Study House No. 22 in the Lookout Mountain area of Los Angeles, designed 
by Pierre Koenig in 1959, is one of the program's most dramatic residences. 
</P>
<P>
A light steel I-beam frame supports a deeply cantilevered roof plane covering 
an L-shaped plan wrapped around a pool on the edge of a precipice. The living 
room, with floor-to-ceiling glass on three sides, offers spectacular nighttime 
views over the lights of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After the Case Study House program petered out, several International Style 
architects continued to design in the Modernist manner. 
</P>
<P>
Soriano and Ellwood persisted with the purity of Modernism's expression for 
another decade, while others, including Neutra, began to play around with less 
hard-edged materials such as wood and natural stone, and with more romantic 
plan forms. 
</P>
<P>
Modernist maverick John Lautner elaborated Modernism's rectangular geometries 
with the dramatic addition of swirling circles and lush curves in a series of 
striking houses that continues to this day. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, a fourth generation of local Modernists further domesticated the 
International Style to Southern Californian conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Kappe, Calvin Straub, Douglas Honnold, Rex Lotery, Bernard Zimmerman, James 
Pulliam, Thornton Abell, Quincy Jones, Whitney Smith, Ed Killingsworth, Carl 
Maston and many others developed the simple post-and-beam Modernism first seen 
in Schindler's Kings Road house into a series of sophisticated and humane 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
But the International Style's severe abstractions, much admired by avant-garde 
architects and a few adventurous patrons, never really caught on with the 
public. No tract developer ever adopted Modernism for the mass market. 
</P>
<P>
These machines-for-living-in may have elevated the occupants' sense of living 
on the cutting edge of innovation, but they offered little comfort to the body 
or the soul. 
</P>
<P>
In an International Style house there are no gloomy corners or "unhealthy" 
nooks and crannies where curious cobwebs or compelling dark thoughts might 
lurk. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even in our comfort-seeking, historically nostalgic Postmodernist times, 
the ghost of the International Style will not die. The abstract purity of 
Modernism appeals to many designers by comparison with the convoluted, often 
sentimental gestures of the fashions that have followed the International 
Style. 
</P>
<P>
The image of Le Corbusier's classic 1931 Villa Savoye at Poissy, France, haunts 
the imagination of contemporary architects. 
</P>
<P>
A stark white stucco cube topped by Platonic cylinders, floating clear of its 
greensward on slender columns, the Villa Savoye stands as a superb and enduring 
icon of Le Corbusier's credo that, "starting from conditions more or less 
utilitarian, you have aroused my emotions; this is architecture." 
</P>
<P>
RECOGNIZING AN INTERNATIONAL-STYLE HOUSE 
</P>
<P>
A preference for horizontal, rectangular, flat-roofed shapes composed of white 
stucco and large areas of glass. 
</P>
<P>
Frequent dramatic siting on hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
Open interior floor plans with a minimum of internal divisions and an emphasis 
on clean lines, with most furniture built in. 
</P>
<P>
Fusion of indoor and outdoor spaces through sliding-glass walls. 
</P>
<P>
Smooth surfaces, with an absence of purely decorative details inside or out and 
free of color, except for a very occasional use of primary reds, yellows or 
blues.

More tenants vacated West Los Angeles office space than moved in during the 
first quarter of 1990, marking the first time in more than five years that the 
now-overbuilt area has posted a negative absorption rate. 
</P>
<P>
Most local developers and brokers thought that the pricey Westside was "immune 
to troubles like high vacancies, overbuilding and lack of tenants that have 
plagued other areas," said John Carpenter, a senior vice president at Grubb 
&amp; Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services. 
</P>

"What we're seeing is a much more moderate leasing cycle, and one that is 
accompanied by a profusion of new development," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, along with the fact that two major 
players in the Beverly Hills market -- Columbia Savings and VMS Realty Partners 
-- are seeking buyers for their portfolios, has thrown an element of 
uncertainty into the market." 
</P>
<P>
So too has the fact that about 15 million square feet of office space is in 
various stages of development on the Westside -- with not enough tenants in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
Office-space absorption, equal to newly leased space, less vacated space, 
totaled a negative 30,500 square feet in the first quarter of this year, 
according to Grubb &amp; Ellis. This is in contrast with the 300,000 to 500,000 
square feet of quarterly absorption that has heretofore been typical on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
The latest trend, predicted Westside watchers, suggests lower rental rates, 
fewer upbeat developers and a host of unemployed office brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting at a conference of the Westside Real Estate Group earlier this 
month, Richard Hollander, president of the Signature Group in West Los Angeles, 
said that "as liquidity continues to dry up in the near term, we will see a 
shakeout in the market. Investors working with equity and cash will stay in the 
game; those operating from debt won't make it." 
</P>
<P>
The picture isn't all bleak, however, said Marc Danziger, a vice president at 
Julien J. Studley Inc. in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
"While the perception of the market may be negative, the reality will be far 
better," he said. "Well-capitalized buyers who are knowledgeable about markets 
will continue to invest successfully in Southern California."

Work Resumes on Hotel Stalled for 2 Years 
</P>
<P>
Nikko Hotels International will manage a new 304-room hotel project along La 
Cienega Boulevard near the Beverly Center, which is rising out of the ground 
after a series of troublesome construction delays. 
</P>
<P>
Stymied by the bankruptcy of a former owner, lack of financing and plenty of 
neighborhood competition, the project has been nothing but a deep hole in the 
ground for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Southmark Pacific Corp. of Pasadena started construction in 1987 on what was 
originally slated to be the 395-room Beverly Park Hotel. Problems at parent 
Southmark Corp. of Dallas -- which filed last July for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection -- helped stall and eventually stop construction. 
</P>
<P>
The company sold out last spring to Beverly Park Hotel Associates Ltd., which 
is now a U.S.-Japan partnership of Kawasaki Enterprises, Japan Airlines, Garden 
Homes Development, the Nakash Family Interests (owners of Jordache Enterprises) 
and other limited partners, most of which are represented by New York-based 
hotel investors Udi Toledano and Joseph Mizrachi. The new owners are planning a 
four- to five-star hotel with fewer rooms and more suites than what Southmark 
originally had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Any hotel that is completed at the site is likely to face stiff competition. 
Such nearby hotels as Ma Maison Sofitel, Four Seasons and several owned by 
hotelier Severyn Ashkenazy already report relatively high vacancy rates. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to analysis by KPMG Peat Marwick of Los Angeles, the Nikko Hotel 
owners will have to charge an unlikely $300 a night per room just to break even 
on their $90-million project. Originally, the estimated cost of finishing work 
at the 400-by-200-foot site was about $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Partner Joins Up for Trade Center Hilton 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita Real Estate has become a financial partner in the $80-million, 
393-room World Trade Center Hilton Hotel, joining developers IDM Corp. and 
Kajima International Inc. in the Long Beach hotel, set to break ground in May. 
</P>
<P>
The $550-million Greater Los Angeles World Trade Center includes a 27-story, 
558,000-square-foot office tower and is eventually planned to total 2.5 million 
square feet of commercial development space.

County Retirement System Buys Gateway 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Gateway Plaza has been sold to the Los Angeles County Employees 
Retirement System for $55 million by Los Angeles-based builders Trenton 
Development Corp. and H.T. Greene &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Located at the southeast corner of Lake Avenue and the Foothill (210) Freeway, 
Pasadena Gateway Plaza includes 300,000 square feet of office space on 14 
levels, plus a separate 200,000-square-foot parking structure. The Beverly 
Hills office of Chicago-based Heitman Financial Services Ltd. acted as the 
retirement association's asset and financial manager in the transaction, while 
John Alle Co. represented the sellers.

Developers Raffi Cohen Industries and Melvin Simon &amp; Associates recently 
"topped out" their 300,000-square-foot twin to the Imperial Bank Tower at 2nd

estimated value of $246 million when completed, and include 600,000 square feet 
of office space in two buildings connected at their bases. The new North Tower 
is reportedly 32% pre-leased, with law firm Lewis D'Amato, Brisbois &amp; 
Bisgaard committed to 100,000 square feet.

Messenger Investment Co. of Irvine and Mission Land Co. of Brea have started

on 9.6 acres at the northwest corner of Joy and Rincon streets in Corona. Phase 
I of the three-phase, $25-million development will be a two-story, 
45,000-square-foot building that has been about 50% pre-leased to a division of 
the Allstate Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
Also in Corona, developer Nathan J. Leanse of Beverly Hills is completing a 
12-acre, $11.8-million light-manufacturing and distribution business park 
within the Corona Spectrum. The business park includes three buildings totaling 
234,460 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Pacific Realty will relocate at the end of this year from Brea to a 
four-story office building under construction at its PacifiCenter Anaheim -- a 
$100-million mixed-use office and commercial development in northwest Anaheim. 
The 26-acre project will also include two other office buildings, a 140-room 
hotel and a 23,000-square-foot retail center, which began construction this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
SDC Development of Newport Beach has acquired 31 acres of land for construction 
of the Archibald Freeway Center -- a $40-million project slated to break ground 
in the first quarter of 1991 in Ontario, just off the Pomona Freeway at 
Archibald Avenue. The project is expected to encompass 18 industrial buildings, 
along with a furniture showroom and a small retail component.

NEARING 80, OLD-TIME EXPLORER DWELLS IN TWO WORLDS, AFRICA AND BRITAIN; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: WILFRED THESIGER HAS WRITTEN TWO CLASSIC BOOKS ON THE ARAB WORLD AND AN 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY, 'THE LIFE OF MY CHOICE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tucked almost out of sight under Wilfred Thesiger's jacket was a belt of 
colored beads made for him by Lawi, his Kenyan foster son. 
</P>
<P>
The belt, an impish contrast to his understated brown morning attire, reflects 
the two worlds inhabited by Wilfred Thesiger, explorer, naturalist, traveler in 
the Empty Quarter of Arabia, dweller among the mysterious Marsh Arabs of Iraq 
and -- on his annual visit to London -- thoroughly English gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
Thesiger, who will be 80 on June 3, is often called the last of the old-time 
explorers, having led a life redolent of Rudyard Kipling and Lawrence of 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
He has written two classic books of travel and exploration, "The Marsh Arabs" 
and "Arabian Sands," and an enthralling autobiography, "The Life of My Choice." 
</P>
<P>
Having walked about 40,000 miles in jungle, desert and mountain range, he has 
chosen to put up his feet in Maralal, a remote Kenyan town were he spends most 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In London, Thesiger lives in his late mother's book-lined Chelsea apartment and 
spends much of his time at the Travelers Club, a hide-out on Pall Mall for 
diplomats, travel writers and others of a peripatetic bent. 
</P>
<P>
He is a tall, slightly stooped man with pale blue eyes, a strikingly long nose 
and a leathery face that looks freeze-dried by blazing days and icy nights in 
the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was always a fit person," he said in an interview. "All this stuff 
about boiling water or putting sterilizing tablets in the water -- I've never 
boiled or sterilized water anywhere in my life and I've drunk it out of every 
ditch and drain that I've been to." 
</P>
<P>
That is part of the Thesiger ethic of exploration. Wherever he has traveled -- 
in Africa, Arabia or the Hindu Kush -- his goal has been to meet the people "on 
level terms." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted no concessions," he said. "All I wanted then was to live and be as 
near to them as I could possibly be. I've no desire to be an Englishman when 
I'm traveling about." 
</P>
<P>
Harold St. John Philby, another great explorer of Arabia, "told me that he 
always took a radio, wireless, whatever you call it, along with him so that he 
could listen to the (cricket) test matches," Thesiger said. "Well, this to me 
would wreck the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with that outlook is an abiding dislike for change -- all change. Cars 
and airplanes have "diminished the world and robbed it of all diversity," he 
said, and pop music, which now reaches the darkest corners that he has 
explored, "exasperates me." 
</P>
<P>
Man's landing on the moon, Thesiger has written, filled him "with a sense of 
desecration, and of despair at the deadly technical ingenuity of modern man." 
</P>
<P>
His love of the wild began in Ethiopia, where his father was a diplomat. At age 
6 he watched the homecoming of the Ethiopian tribes from battle and was 
reminded of Homer's Iliad. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote that it "implanted in me a lifelong craving for barbaric splendor, for 
savagery, color and the throb of drums, and . . . a lasting veneration for 
long-established custom and ritual." 
</P>
<P>
Sent home to Eton, he became a solitary boy, knowing nothing about cricket or 
the English way of life, pining for Ethiopia. He went back after Oxford 
University, and at 23 discovered the source of the Awash River, roaming among 
the Danakil people, who measured their bravery by the number of men they killed 
and castrated. 
</P>
<P>
Thesiger crossed the dunes of Arabia's Empty Quarter on foot and camel both 
ways, subsisting on a pint of water a day. He ran secret desert missions in 
World War II, then spent seven years on and off with the Marsh Arabs, living 
among the reeds of the Shatt-al-Arab delta, emerging every six weeks or so for 
a hot bath. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy, he accompanied his father to Aden and stood in a trench watching 
Turkish shells bursting. In Africa, he was wakened one night by what he thought 
was snoring, shook the supposed offender lying beside him and found it to be a 
lion. 
</P>
<P>
He leads a simple life in Maralal, about 150 miles northwest of Nairobi, with 
Lawi, Kiberiti and Laputa, local men who attached themselves to him as boys, 
grew up as his foster sons, and now have families of their own. 
</P>
<P>
When in England, he said, "I conform to all the rules. You've found me dressed 
like this because I haven't been out, but normally I should be in a dark suit 
and going off to my club." 
</P>
<P>
Thesiger sees himself as the explorer who shut the door behind him, in the 
sense that the places he traveled have been tainted since by the cassette tape 
and the charter airline. Travel on foot or camelback, when you can do it by 
jeep, "becomes a stunt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I meet a lot of young people who come along to me and say, 'Look here, we'd 
love to lead your life.' And I'm afraid the only thing one can say is that it 
isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
Thesiger laughs a lot, especially at himself when he stumbles over long 
sentences: "I'm getting all muddled up. This is old age." 
</P>
<P>
He tells funny stories, about grunting at the lions in Hyderabad Zoo so they 
grunted back, or teasing the late Joy Adamson of "Born Free" fame by saying all 
animals belong in zoos. 
</P>
<P>
"She rose to her feet and her hands went like that" -- he made a clawing 
gesture and imitated her Austrian accent -- "and she said, 'How dare you say a 
sing like zzat to me!' . . . She had no sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
Talking about the marshes, Thesiger lapses into fond reminiscence: 
</P>
<P>
"In the evening, we'd be sitting in one of these reed houses and Falih would 
pick up a drum and start tapping like this, and others would get in their 
canoes and come over; the room would be absolutely packed, the walls would 
bulge outwards with people in there. And then, two or three little 14-year-olds 
would start dancing in the middle of the room and everybody would be singing." 
</P>
<P>
In his study are family photos, a string of Syrian worry beads, swords from Abu 
Dhabi and Oman, and a Kenyan snuffbox. 
</P>
<P>
On the floor stands his mother's ancient radio, which he tried, none too 
successfully, to tune to the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't isolated, he insisted; he does know about "strange things" happening 
in Eastern Europe, and that "Gorbachev got hooted at the other day" by angry 
crowds in Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
Thesiger never married, and intends to be buried without ceremony in the garden 
at Maralal. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, he went to the British Embassy in Nairobi to put that desire on 
record, lest people say, " 'Lawi didn't even take the trouble to get him 
properly buried, just shoved him in a hole in the garden.' Which is what I want 
him to do."

Terns Return -- California least terns have come back to nest at Bolsa Chica 
and other local spots, and they are "doing really well," according to biologist 
Esther Burkett of the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
The endangered gull-like birds, which lay their eggs on the sand, had built 21 
nests on Bolsa Chica's south island by the first week in May, 42 by the second 
week and 80 by last week. Last season, there were 115 nests at Bolsa Chica. 
Least terns have also started nesting at Anaheim Bay, in Upper Newport Bay and 
on Huntington Beach (in a fenced area of the sand near the Santa Ana River 
mouth). 
</P>
<P>
One good sign, according to Cal State Long Beach biologist Pat Baird, is that 
the birds are laying two to three eggs per nest, an indication of abundant food 
supplies. In poor food seasons, terns may lay only one or two eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the county, a least tern colony at the south end of Camp Pendleton near 
Oceanside is doing very well, according to Baird. In fact, the colony is 
attracting some birds that normally nest at Bolsa Chica and other local 
colonies. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the first since restoration of the 17-acre Talbert Marsh near the 
Huntington Beach colony, least terns were seen feeding in the wetland's tidal 
waters. But so far this year, they don't appear to be using the marsh; 
construction to widen the Santa Ana River channel may be driving the birds 
away, Baird believes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back at Bolsa Chica, this is the first season that the least terns 
have not nested on the reserve's north island, finally having been pushed off 
by larger terns -- namely Caspian and elegant -- that have been nesting there 
in recent years as they expand their range northward. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, about 70 black skimmers (a relative of the least tern) have been 
counted at Bolsa Chica but have not yet started to nest. About half the 
resident skimmers were oiled in February's American Trader oil spill; while 
they survived, it is uncertain whether the problem will affect their nesting 
success. Some studies have shown that oil ingestion can lead to defective eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers thought the spill "probably wouldn't affect their nesting," Burkett 
said, because "they had enough time to ingest the oil before nesting." 
</P>
<P>
Dolphin Talk -- Dennis Kelly of Orange Coast College will speak Thursday at the 
monthly meeting of the American Cetacean Society's Orange County chapter. Kelly 
has coordinated extensive research into dolphins living off the Southern 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
The talk is free and will be held at 7:30 p.m. in the Costa Mesa Neighborhood 
Community Center, 1845 Park St. Call (714) 651-1825 for more information.

BISHOP TUTU MEETS DISNEYLAND, AND THRILL IS MUTUAL

<TEXT>
<P>
When the "the happiest place on earth" greeted the world's jolliest cleric 
Saturday, the result was mutual glee. 
</P>
<P>
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the moral leader of the anti-apartheid 
movement in South Africa, thrilled Disneyland visitors who recognized him as he 
smiled and chuckled his way through the park, hugging Mickey Mouse, riding a 
carousel with his grandson and dancing in a conga line. 
</P>
<P>
His visit resulted partly from a promise to his grandson, Xabiso Tutu, 3, who 
is learning English while living in Atlanta, where his mother is studying 
medicine. Wearing the traditional black-eared hat with his name sewn on, Xabiso 
solemnly and politely shook hands with Mickey Mouse. But Tutu said he was 
actually "using the child as an excuse." 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to come. Now I can say I have been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu's wife, Leah, who had toured the park once before, said she thought Tutu 
would enjoy the park as much as his grandson, especially the faster rides. 
</P>
<P>
Xabiso sucked his thumb while Tutu held a brief press interview in Fantasyland 
under the watchful gaze of security guards in suits and ties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great fun being here," said the diminutive cleric who won the 1984 Nobel 
Peace Prize for his nonviolent opposition to apartheid and white rule in South 
Africa. "We're all children at heart." 
</P>
<P>
If more people could recapture the childlike innocence represented by 
Disneyland, he said in his lilting accent, "We wouldn't have all these problems 
in South Africa and everywhere else. People would know we're all part of the 
same family." 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Tutu was greeted by Rep. Robert K. Dornan, who described 
himself as "Mickey Mouse's congressman." Dornan (R-Garden Grove) said he had 
voted for economic sanctions against South Africa, despite his Republican 
conservatism. He told Tutu that he had cried during one of the archbishop's 
speeches, in which Tutu said he would resign if bloodshed in South Africa did 
not stop. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, 58, wearing his characteristic dark glasses, a Greek fisherman's cap, 
Reeboks and an Occidental College sweat shirt, posed happily for publicity 
photographs and rode down Main Street USA in a fire truck before joining his 
grandson on the carousel. 
</P>
<P>
Next, they watched the Party Gras parade with 50-foot balloon characters. At 
the end of the parade, a line of conga dancers approached Tutu, his wife and 
grandson and drew them into a serpentine dance around a circle in front of 
Sleeping Beauty's castle. Smiling broadly, Tutu appeared to enjoy the dance. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu was taking a break from a 10-day preaching tour in the Southland, where he 
is also raising funds for South African refugees. He spoke earlier this week at 
Occidental College in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu is scheduled to speak at 7:30 p.m. Monday at Santa Ana High School. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials said they were advised that Tutu likes rum and Coke, favors 
raisin ice cream and dislikes salads. But as they have with other VIPS, they 
provided the entourage a special tour guide, lunch at the Blue Bayou restaurant 
-- which serves no alcohol -- and cuts to the front of the lines. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem proper to have him wait," said Mary Anne Mang, public relations 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Park-goers who recognized Tutu most often used the word "wonderful" to describe 
their feelings toward him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to shake his hand!" said Paula Monarz of North Hollywood. "People get 
excited about movie stars, but here's someone who's made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
"There he is! Desmond Tutu!" shouted a middle-aged man in a red coat, who 
raised his hand in a fist. "Free South Africa!" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a fan!" said Richard Mathews of San Francisco, who videotaped his 
14-year-old son with the world-famous leader. "We've got historic film here!" 
he said, shaking his camera. 
</P>
<P>
But some had no idea who the cleric was. A clerk at the tobacco shop, asked 
about Tutu, replied: "Is that a kind of cigarette? We don't carry it." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, a toddler ran toward Tutu and the accompanying Disneyland 
characters, but he was more interested in the world-famous mouse and yelled 
"Mickey!" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm peeved," the archbishop joked about the youngster's slight. 
</P>
<P>
"But I shouldn't be," he said. "Mickey's older." 
</P>
<P>
The day ended for Tutu and his entourage at 7:45 p.m. They were all given 
Mickey Mouse hats as they left the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all world leaders should come here and recover their childlike 
qualities," Tutu said. 
</P>
<P>
But what, specifically, captured this world figure's fancy? 
</P>
<P>
"We went on everything -- Space Mountain, Peter Pan, Circle Vision, the train 
and Splash Mountain," he said. "Splash Mountain was awful. Once was enough and 
I'll never go on it again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

RURAL PORTOLA HILLS RESISTS CITYHOOD FEVER; 
</P>

PORTOLA HILLS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Debbie Brown moved into her new Portola Hills tract home in the rolling 
foothills of the Santiago and Modjeska peaks to steer clear of the hustle and 
bustle of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Now she's afraid the bucolic lifestyle that she bought into a year ago will be 
spoiled by an El Toro cityhood movement that wants to bring her Trabuco Canyon 
community under its umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing in common," Brown said recently. "We don't share the same 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
Brown is heading a campaign to exclude the semi-isolated neighborhood of 
Portola Hills from a plan to incorporate a wide area in the Saddleback Valley 
-- a move that could conceivably postpone a hoped-for November ballot measure 
until next year. 
</P>
<P>
The El Toro-based Community Coalition for Incorporation wants voters to approve 
the creation of a 21-square-mile city comprised of El Toro, Lake Forest, 
Portola Hills and the yet-to-be-built Foothills Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
But while a growing number of other South County communities are turning to 
cityhood as a way to better deal with local issues, Portola Hills seems to be 
one of the last holdouts, saying no thanks to local representation. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say the 1,000-acre Portola Hills neighborhood of 976 homes, 
townhouses and condominiums at the junction of El Toro and Santiago Canyon 
Roads should be left to follow its own destiny. 
</P>
<P>
"That is why we moved up here," Brown said, noting that the nearest supermarket 
is miles away. In fact, the only business within walking distance is Cook's 
Corner, the landmark bar known best as a hangout for crusty Trabuco Canyon 
residents and bikers. 
</P>
<P>
Although longtime Trabuco Canyon residents have rejected any association with 
Portola Hills, the development's homeowners prefer to be identified with that 
rural community rather than built-out El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Portola Hills was built four years ago by the Baldwin Co. for middle- and 
upper-income home buyers who were courted with a promise that they would live 
in seclusion, far from El Toro's theaters, stores and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"When people think of El Toro, they relate it to the Marine base" and 
high-density development, said two-year resident George Kowalik during an 
emotionally charged residents' meeting this week. "That can't be good for our 
property values." 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, held at the Portola Hills Recreation Center, anti-cityhood 
leaders claimed that a majority of their neighbors backed their movement, and 
they have been soliciting signatures to document the level of local opposition. 
So far, more than 400 signatures have been gathered, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 100 Portola Hills residents at the meeting said they were satisfied 
with county services and did not want to be saddled with another layer of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Still others argued that they would consider forming their own city in the 
future. A few feared that property taxes will be raised under a new city 
government, a complaint denied by cityhood supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just too soon for us to be a city," Brown said. "Each person has his own 
reason (for rejecting cityhood), but we have the same goal." 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood coalition chairwoman Helen Wilson, who is hoping the Local Agency 
Formation Commission approves a November ballot measure, said she would 
consider dropping Portola Hills from the plan if it threatens that target date. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel in my heart that they should be in it," Wilson said. "(But) if it 
continues to be a hotbed, we'll drop it," Wilson said. "We have no problem with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the coalition's steering committee will be meeting over the weekend 
to discuss changing the proposed boundaries. Leaving out Portola Hills will not 
affect the proposed city's financial stability because there are no businesses 
located in that community, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Proposition 13, cities have relied heavily on tax revenue from local 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Carving Portola Hills out of the northernmost portion of the proposed city 
would shrink the size of the city by about one-tenth, Wilson said. "We can live 
with that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said, however, that she will fight a recent proposal by Portola Hills 
community leaders to ask LAFCO to also exclude the Foothills Ranch property 
that is located north of the proposed Foothill Transportation Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Foothills Ranch Planned Community, located between Portola Hills 
and El Toro, will include 4,000 homes, as well as industrial and commercial 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said that she and other Portola Hills residents are eyeing about half of 
the planned community because it will generate commercial tax revenue for 
Portola Hills if it eventually decides to incorporate. 
</P>
<P>
That dispute could cause the cityhood vote to be postponed until March, LAFCO 
executive director James Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
Colangelo said that LAFCO has scheduled a public hearing on June 20. If the 
dispute is not settled by July 11, "there's a pretty good chance it will be a 
March vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Portola Hills residents who support El Toro cityhood said they were 
saddened over the call for excluding their neighborhood, arguing that only by 
joining a city would residents be able to develop a long-awaited park and enjoy 
increased police protection. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry about all this," said Margaret Nicholson, an outspoken advocate of 
cityhood. She said the anti-cityhood group has not taken into consideration 
that more than 200 of the 1,000 registered Portola Hills residents have signed 
pro-cityhood petitions since January. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, who is also president of the Portola Hills Homeowners Assn., scoffed 
at opponents' distaste for politicians and local government, pointing out that 
only 56 Portola Hills residents bothered to vote in the last election. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing that people complain about politicians when they don't even 
vote," Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Bess, another pro-cityhood Portola Hills resident and member of the 
coalition steering committee, conceded that a majority of his neighbors do not 
favor cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally think that the community will be better off as part of a city," 
Bess said. "But it won't do the cityhood campaign any good to drag people in 
kicking and screaming."

It rained here the other day. Actually, it rained three times in the space of 
five hours -- pelting, cuff-drenching rain. But after each deluge, the sun 
somehow appeared and dried out the downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
Between downpours, as I walked down a bone-dry, sun-soaked sidewalk with an 
umbrella and a raincoat clutched incongruously under my arm, it finally came to 
me. Toto, I said, we're not in California any more. 
</P>
<P>
I am not a California native. I spent more than half of my 36 years on the East 
Coast, largely in Connecticut and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
I remember New England winters -- and summers. I recall how to eat a quahog. I 
know that if you ask for a milkshake in Providence, you will be served an 
unpalatable concoction of milk and syrup, without ice cream. (If you want ice 
cream in your milk, you must request a "cabinet.") 
</P>
<P>
Despite this reservoir of knowledge, this collective unconscious of East Coast 
culture, moving to Washington after eight years in Southern California came as 
something of a shock. 
</P>
<P>
I've been here a year now, a year this week. And there is much that still seems 
strange. 
</P>
<P>
The supermarkets, for example. In California, even the lowliest neighborhood 
grocery offers a cornucopia of bright and beautiful fruit and vegetables pulled 
from the trees or the earth only hours before in one of the agribusiness 
capitals of the Central Valley. And it is there all year long. You pay dearly 
for fresh asparagus in January, but it can be had, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
The produce in the markets I frequent in suburban Maryland does not measure up. 
The pickings are thin and the quality is spotty. The oranges are so faded you 
don't even need to put on your sunglasses to examine them. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is public transportation. I no longer have the pleasure of 
sliding behind the wheel of my yellow Karmann Ghia, summoning to life the 
powerful four cylinders and heading out on the freeway to do battle. When I 
arrive at work, I no longer linger with co-workers to share tales of the road 
warriors who cut me off or flipped me off on the hourlong drive to the office. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, I take my seat on the subway for a half hour and read the Washington 
Post. Boring. 
</P>
<P>
The weather, of course, represents the nadir of the East Coast experience. When 
we lived in Topanga Canyon, my wife and I planned outside parties weeks in 
advance without fussing over alternative plans for inclement weather. (That was 
well and good, as the floor space in our cute canyon home measured something 
less than 1,000 square feet.) Of course the sun would shine. This, after all, 
was California. 
</P>
<P>
No more. Now that the cabin fever born of our first real winter in years is 
dissipating, we are venturing outside to discover a brave new world, a world in 
which it can rain, hail, blow or snow at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
The winters in Washington are mild, they said. It snowed the day before 
Thanksgiving. By the last week in March, we were having a heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
It topped out at 90 one day. I was preparing to mow the lawn. By the end of the 
week, it was snowing again. 
</P>
<P>
There now, I've said it. The L-word. The foulest, four-letter curse in the 
English language. 
</P>
<P>
Before I moved to suburban Washington, I had not cut a L-A-W-N in 19 years. I 
went to college. I lived in apartments. And when my wife and I moved to 
Topanga, we bought a house nestled into a hillside that was covered with live 
oaks and large plants from outer space. But there was nary a blade of grass in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
Out in the 'burbs, there are plenty. In fact, blades of grass are everywhere. I 
have to look at them every weekend, as I spend a couple of hours trudging 
across them, back and forth, with a loud, noisy machine that undoubtedly is bad 
for both my back and the environment. The effect, of course, lasts for only a 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
This is not me, I say to myself. This is Ward Cleaver and Jim Anderson and all 
the other fathers of the '50s. I should be using these hours to spend quality 
time with my 2-year-old son. Or perhaps to play golf. But certainly not to mow 
a lawn. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the California experience has suggested a solution. We don't 
exactly have gardeners in Maryland, not the kind familiar to everyone in the 
Southland. We don't even seem to have neighborhood kids looking for pin money. 
But we do have fellows who will cut your grass for about $30 a week. A small 
price to pay for sanity, I say. 
</P>
<P>
I hired one, just the other day.

business litigation; Brian Fisk, a planner for the city of Westminster and 
previously a San Juan Capistrano planner; Robert J. Healey, a retired 
university professor; James E. Olmsted, a real estate development consultant 
and past member of the Laguna Niguel Community Council Planning Committee; and 
Marc W. Winer, a sales manager who also served on the Laguna Niguel Community 
Council Planning Committee.

Businesses handling hazardous materials will report to the city only once a 
year under a revised ordinance that has been approved by the City Council. 
Companies previously updated the city semi-annually on the storage and use of 
dangerous substances. 
</P>
<P>
"We found that the disclosure didn't change," Fire Marshal Edward Rowlett said. 
"What we were getting in effect was a duplicate (report) every six months." 
</P>
<P>
The reports created unnecessary paper work for both the businesses and the city 
staff, Rowlett said. 
</P>
<P>
The revised ordinance follows state health and safety codes, said Anne Bland, 
hazardous material specialist for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Companies using more than 55 gallons, 500 pounds or 200 cubic feet of toxic, 
infectious, flammable or corrosive materials each year are required to file an 
inventory with the city, Bland said.

NCAA TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS;

KRONEMANN NOT ENOUGH; UCI FALLS TO TENNESSEE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Soon enough, UC Irvine's tennis season rested on the wide body of Trevor 
Kronemann. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee, undefeated and ranked first in the country, swept through the bottom 
of Irvine's lineup in straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
With every singles match complete but the contest at No. 1 between Kronemann 
and Doug Flach, Tennessee led, 4-1, one victory short of winning the 
second-round match in the NCAA team tennis championships Saturday at the Hyatt 
Grand Champions Resort. 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann had six match points on Flach. He used five of them before taking a 
6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-4 victory with an ace on double match point and forcing 
doubles play. 
</P>
<P>
But Kronemann's point was ultimately moot. As soon as Irvine lost in doubles, 
Tennessee won, 5-2, canceling the final two doubles matches. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to go into doubles 3-3," Irvine Coach Greg Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they almost didn't go into doubles at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Trevor kept his last dual match exciting," Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's only other point came on Richard Lubner's 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) victory over 
Tim Jessup at No. 2 singles. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine finished the season 19-13. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee, which advanced to today's third-round match against Miami, clinched 
when Coenie de Villiers and John Gibson came back after losing the first set to 
defeat Irvine's Carsten Hoffman and Mike Roberts at No. 2 doubles, 2-6, 6-4, 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"They really played well in the first set," de Villiers said. "They were 
motivated and we were a little timid." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman and Roberts had seemed in control early in the match. Patton's concern 
was focused a court away, where Lubner and Neel Grover had lost the first set. 
But while Lubner and Grover were coming back to split sets, Hoffman and Roberts 
lost the second, and fell behind in the third. When they lost, the other two 
matches were cancelled. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really impressed by the depth of their team," Patton said. "I was really 
confident at No. 1 and No. 2, and hoping we'd be able to do something between 
three and six." 
</P>
<P>
They couldn't. Shige Kanroji lost to Brice Karsh, 6-3, 6-2; Roberts lost to 
Fabio Silberberg, 6-2, 7-6 (7-3); Hoffman lost to deVilliers, 6-4, 6-1; and 
Randy Ivey lost to John Gibson, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 match pitted Kronemann, a 6-foot-3, 228-pound senior, against Flach, 
a 6-1, 150-pound freshman and the brother of professional player Ken Flach. 
</P>
<P>
Watching close by was Tennessee Coach Mike DePalmer, who gave Kronemann his 
first tennis lesson when Kronemann was 7, and who will coach him some this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tedious situation, because I was pulling my heart out for my guy, but 
Trevor is like a little son -- a big son -- for me," DePalmer said. "I wanted 
my guy to win, but I wanted Trevor to play well." 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann took the first set, breaking Flach in the final game to win, 6-4. In 
the second, he had match point on Flach's serve in the 10th game, but Flach 
held with a service winner. Flach eventually forced a tiebreaker. Kronemann 
built a 5-3 lead, but Flach rallied to win, 8-6, with Kronemann flubbing 
another match point when one of his shots hit the net and landed out. 
</P>
<P>
The third set was a lesson in the breaks of the game, with neither player able 
to hold serve against the other in four consecutive games. But then Kronemann 
held to go ahead, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
He had two more match points in the next game before losing, letting Flach back 
to 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew from the very beginning of the third set that it was 4-1," Kronemann 
said. "When I went out to serve for the match at 5-4, I had the jitters. I 
decided I just had to forget it, and I got four big serves." 
</P>
<P>
He won the first two points with service winners, then lost a point on a nice 
shot by Flach. On the next point, Kronemann passed Flach on the sideline to set 
up double match point, and served an ace to win it. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's NCAA appearance was its fifth, and the Anteaters have yet to advance 
beyond the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann and Lubner will play in the NCAA singles championships beginning 
Wednesday, and Kronemann will team with Kanroji in the doubles championships. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the other second-round matches, No. 2 UCLA beat No. 17 San Diego, 5-1; No. 3 
Stanford, the two-time defending champion, breezed past Oklahoma State, 5-1; 
No. 4 Georgia eliminated No. 23 Northwestern from its first NCAA tourney, 5-2; 
Texas upset No. 5 Pepperdine, 5-3; No. 8 and host USC beat South Carolina, 5-2; 
and Miami, Fla., beat No. 15 Arizona State. No. 6 California beat No. 11 LSU, 
5-3, in a match that lasted 6 1/2 hours. . . . Georgia, which has been the host 
school since the team format was adopted in 1977, was playing it its first 
"away" NCAAs. . . . Georgia will play the Trojans today. The Bulldogs and 
Trojans have played five times in the tournament, with Georgia winning each 
time, including in the second round last year. . . . Northwestern's Todd 
Martin, the nation's top-ranked player, beat No. 4 Al Parker, 6-7, 6-1, 6-3. . 
. . Tennessee was one of the 12 teams that drew first-round byes.

SOUTHERN SECTION TRACK CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
SUSPENDED MEET TO RESUME TUESDAY WITH TRIPLE JUMP

Newspaper deadlines came and went, but several events were not completed until 
late Friday night at the Southern Section track and field championships at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
As midnight neared, the stadium was nearly deserted except for a handful of 
high jumpers, shotputters, their coaches, family and friends, and various meet 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Parlin led a first-, second- and fifth-place finish by Esperanza's 
shotputters, helping the Aztecs to a 50-40 lead over Santa Barbara and at least 
a share of the 3-A team championship. Final results will not be announced until 
the triple jump competition, postponed Friday because section officials feared 
it would run well past midnight, is completed Tuesday at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
The high jump ran longest, finishing in odd fashion for Katella's Kevin 
Carlson, who has a share of the Orange County record. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson was declared the 3-A champion after meet officials ordered the 
competition halted at about 11:30. Ten jumpers had cleared 6 feet 6 inches when 
officials told the athletes they would all advance to Friday's Masters meet. 
Carlson was told to go home. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling went against established Southern Section finals procedure. The top 
nine finishers Friday advanced to the Masters meet in every other event. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson, who jumped 6-11 3/4 this season to tie the county record, had jumped 
only four times since the event began at 8 p.m. And because he was the only 3-A 
jumper to clear 6-6, he was awarded first place. 
</P>
<P>
He said it took some of the luster off his championship, but Carlson shrugged 
and said, "A first is still a first." 
</P>
<P>
After the 1-A and 2-A jumpers were dismissed, a jump-off was then held to 
determine the medal winners among the seven left in the 4-A division. 
</P>
<P>
Parlin, a junior, won the shotput with a personal-best of 62 feet 6 1/2 inches, 
the second-best throw in the state this year. Brent Noon of Fallbrook leads the 
state and the nation with a toss of 76-2. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Kinney, a senior at Esperanza, was second (58-0 1/2), and Mike Burns, a 
junior, was fifth (53-7 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
"We needed that," Esperanza shotput coach Bill Pendleton said Saturday. "We 
were down by 10 points going into the shot." 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton said the trio saw teammate Roshawn Sims pull up in the 200-meter 
race, grasping at his injured hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew if they didn't come through and place all three guys we were going 
to be out of it (team championship)," he said. "So the guys came through. I 
figured Parlin would win, but I was happy to see the other guys come on like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Parlin, Kinney, Edison's Lawson Mollica, who won the 4-A with a throw of 54-3 
3/4, and Matt Jordan (second in the 4-A at 54-2 1/2) will advance to the 
Masters meet. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's triple jump will determine the 3-A team champion. Esperanza has a 
10-point lead and the event's winner receives 10 points. Esperanza has Clayton 
Tharrington jumping and Santa Barbara has Mike Thompson.

FISHERMEN SAY BAN ON NETS WOULD DOOM WAY OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed ban on using gill nets for near-shore fishing in Southern California 
has been a hot topic of discussion in recent days at Canetti's Seafood Grotto, 
the traditional early-morning gathering place for San Pedro fishermen. Many 
fear that the proposal, if it becomes law, could end their decades-old way of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"We get accused of raping the ocean," said Joe Cracchiolo, president of the Los 
Angeles Fisherman's Cooperative Assn. in San Pedro. "But we are 
environmentalists too. To kill fish, that is our business, but we more than 
anyone want to maintain the health of the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would bar the use of the nearly invisible monofilament nets by 
1994 within three miles of the coast between the Mexican border and Point 
Conception. Gill nets, which kill fish by immobilizing them, have been blamed 
for the deaths of non-game fish and mammals in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Cracchiolo and others admit that the nets kill sea lions and an occasional gray 
whale, but they say that sea lions are not endangered in this area and that 
their numbers are growing. They also admit that about 25% of what they catch 
can't be sold and is thrown overboard. But they say much of that is alive. 
</P>
<P>
Local fishermen say there are about 250 men who fish commercially out of San 
Pedro and that many of them use gill nets, particularly for halibut. Although 
there are alternatives to gill nets, such as lines and more visible nets, 
halibut are not easily caught by those methods, the fishermen say. 
</P>
<P>
If gill nets are prohibited, Cracchiolo and others say, some local fishermen 
will be forced out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists counter that the nets kill indiscriminately and threaten the 
near-shore marine ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not efficient. They are simply cheap and wasteful," said Scott 
Trimingham, president of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an 
international ocean preservation group.

ELDER CARE: CARING FOR CALIFORNIA'S AGING POPULATION; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES WITH STRONG ETHNIC TIES ENCOUNTER ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a popular belief that the elderly in urban areas of the United States 
are not treated as well as their counterparts in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Many Asian immigrants worry that when they get old, they will not be accorded 
the place of honor in their families that went to their grandmothers and 
grandfathers. Latinos and blacks -- along with Anglos -- fear that, as they 
age, their children will abandon them for the suburbs, leaving them to face the 
ravages of age alone, prey to the crime and poverty of city ghettos. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, recent studies suggest that American city dwellers, whether black or 
white, rich or poor, are not being ignored by their families as they enter 
their final years. Quite the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
One study, conducted by James E. Lubben, a UCLA professor of social welfare, 
found, for example, that elderly Chinese in San Francisco were receiving more 
support from their children than did their counterparts in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in accommodating themselves to the pressures of American life, families 
with strong ethnic ties face special problems in dealing with the difficulties 
of aging, particularly in getting help from government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
For example, many experts have observed that blacks and Native Americans in 
general do not receive nearly as much financial assistance from Social Security 
or Medicare as do other U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are many and complicated, said Fernando Torres-Gil, former staff 
director of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aging, now an 
associate professor of public administration and gerontology at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably because of high blood pressure, improper diets over a lifetime, many 
blacks and Native Americans simply do not live long enough to collect 
benefits," he said. "Even if they do live long enough, many minorities, black 
women especially, have not worked in jobs where they are in a position to 
collect government (employment) benefits." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, there are public and private services that provide personal and 
medical care for all racial and ethnic groups, but because of their particular 
backgrounds and cultural experiences, some ethnic groups are far less willing 
than others to take advantage of what is available. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers have observed that many Asians and Latinos shy away from outside 
help, especially from services provided by government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
One of the barriers is language, Torres-Gil said. But even when language 
difficulties can be overcome, many immigrants harbor fears of and prejudices 
against government intervention into their lives or the lives of their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Jews and blacks, experts say, take advantage of social services 
such as group meals and activities for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly people living in cities seem to be better off than those in rural 
areas, where virtually no support exists outside the family. But residence in 
highly populated areas where there are a large number of elderly people does 
not guarantee adequate support for seniors' services. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that Florida, which has among the nation's highest 
concentrations of the elderly, is among the worst in providing social services 
for senior citizens. One of the states that ranks among the best in services 
for the elderly is Pennsylvania, which has a relatively large population of 
elderly people. But Massachusetts and New York are also highly ranked and do 
not have high percentages of elderly citizens. 
</P>
<P>
California is a relative newcomer in the field of gerontology, and its 
population is also relatively young, according the the American Assn. of 
Retired Persons. Although the programs in California are far from ideal, many 
experts in the state and elsewhere agree that they are above average and seem 
to be improving.

HELP IN MAKING THE TOUGH NURSING HOME DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moving into a nursing home or helping a loved one do so can be a frightening 
and traumatic experience. For many, giving up a home for an institution can be 
nearly as painful as losing a friend or relative to death, according to 
psychologists and psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, taking up residence in a nursing home is not a move most Americans 
will ever have to make. According to various studies, only about 5% of frail, 
elderly people who need assistance end up in nursing facilities. Another 5% 
live with their grown children or other younger members of their families. The 
vast majority live on their own -- albeit with help. 
</P>
<P>
There are situations, however, when the help that is necessary is simply not 
available. In some cases, it is too costly. In others, the logistics are too 
complicated. And in many cases, the psychological burdens are tremendous. When 
the disadvantages begin to outweigh the advantages, institutional care needs to 
be considered, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The first and perhaps the hardest step is to recognize the situation for what 
it is. Sometimes it takes advice from a professional whose emotions won't get 
in the way of assessing what's best for everyone involved, not only for the 
people who need the care but also for those giving it. 
</P>
<P>
Once a decision has been made that institutional care is the least problematic 
of the options, the next step is to find a suitable place for the elderly 
person, either permanently or temporarily. That, too, is not always an easy 
task. 
</P>
<P>
There are a variety of places to turn for help: hospital discharge offices, 
senior citizen centers, private care agencies, churches and synagogues. In many 
communities, there are also government-operated nursing home referral offices 
that will provide information on conditions at homes and whether they have been 
cited for any safety or health violations. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly, however, according to people who have gone through the steps of placing 
a family member in a nursing home, it is a matter of asking many questions of a 
variety of people and doing a great deal of legwork. 
</P>
<P>
The first question to ask: What level of care is needed? 
</P>
<P>
Board-and-care homes typically provide meals, laundry and cleaning services but 
little else. Intermediate nursing-care facilities provide some medical and some 
personal care, as well as other basic services. Custodial-care homes provide a 
full range of services for people who are partly or totally incapacitated. A 
few institutions provide a range of services, so that residents do not 
necessarily need to move as their needs change. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to take a close look at the facility before signing up. Is it 
clean? Does it smell good? Are the residents dressed? Are they sitting doing 
nothing or are they involved in activities? 
</P>
<P>
Location and timing can also be factors. Does the family want to visit 
frequently? If so, having the facility nearby is important. Is it important to 
get a person admitted immediately, or is there time to wait? Some, though not 
all, of the best facilities have long waiting lists, so planing ahead can pay 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Costs are also an important factor for most families. On average, costs run 
$25,000 a year in California, although some families manage on less and others 
spend a great deal more. It is important to find out what the daily charges are 
to determine if there are additional hidden charges. 
</P>
<P>
It is also very important to inquire what happens if a resident runs out of 
money and must rely solely on Medi-Cal or Medicaid to pay the bills. Will the 
resident have to move to a less desirable facility where costs are lower? In 
some states, including California, there are laws prohibiting discrimination 
against low-income residents, but such laws are not always observed. 
</P>
<P>
Once a nursing home has been selected, family members are urged to be vigilant 
in seeing that proper care is provided. If it is not, families should make 
their feelings known, first to the nursing home administration and then, if no 
action is taken, to a nursing home ombudsman who has the power to investigate 
and mediate problems between nursing homes and their residents.

FROM THE HEART: THE JOYS AND TRIALS OF CARING FOR DAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fading sun from an overhead skylight lit the kitchen table where Linda sat with 
a glass of wine. 
</P>
<P>
She says the wine relaxes her. She had spent the day cleaning two houses, doing 
laundry and yard work and wrestling with a pile of her father's medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
There were tears in her eyes as she talked of how her father's health had 
declined since her mother's death five years ago after a lengthy bout with 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Edwin, 74, lives in a guest house less than 100 feet from the back 
door of her San Fernando Valley home. He moved into the house last year, 
reluctantly, after family prodding. 
</P>
<P>
For Linda, 42, the work involved in caring for her father is like a third job 
-- that of care giver -- in addition to work in a medical office as nurse and 
manager and the job of mother and homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Caring for a parent is something that comes from the heart out of love and 
concern," she said. "There is a fullment and sense of inner peace that comes 
from seeing my father smile or respond to a reassuring touch or hug. It makes 
me feel good. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, there are times I just have to cry it out when it all gets too much." 
</P>
<P>
Edwin suffers from emphysema, depression and aging. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't get enough air," he'll say after taking only a few steps. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to think, like being in a fog," he'll respond to a question he is 
unable to answer. 
</P>
<P>
Linda said that when her father retired in 1980, after 30 years with a 
thermostat manufacturer, he busied himself with gardening. 
</P>
<P>
"Now he will only sit on his porch or stand at his window and look at the 
garden," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to involve him in senior activities have been stubbornly refused. "I 
have everything I need right here," he will say. 
</P>
<P>
She said that concern over her father's failing health spurred visits to 
several physicians, including an Alzheimer's specialist, but diagnoses are the 
same: aging and depression compounded by emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm lucky I'm in the medical field," Linda said. "I have come to understand 
what it is like to deal with bill-spewing computers while trying to help 
patients in the office. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, there are times it feels as if I'm being pushed from this 
responsibility to that. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Her thought was cut short. Joshua, her 13-year-old son, crashed upon the scene 
with the announcement that Grandfather's television had just stopped working.

<P>
The Travelers Insurance Co. conducted a survey of its employees several years 
ago and found that 28% of workers over the age of 30 were providing some form 
of care for an older person. 
</P>
<P>
The time spent by employees on such tasks as giving baths, running errands and 
driving elderly relatives to and from doctors' appointments was not trivial, 
the survey found: Nearly 8% of the surveyed employees reported spending 35 
hours or more a week caring for an elderly person -- "nearly the equivalent of 
a second full-time job," according to Andrew E. Scharlach, a USC professor who 
uncovered similar trends at Transamerica Life Companies when he recently 
conducted a study of employee problems at that organization. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Travelers survey, the Transamerica survey and other similar 
studies, between a fifth and a third of employees over 30 are providing 
assistance to one or more elderly people. Workers spend an average six to 10 
hours a week at those tasks, the responsibility for which they typically have 
to shoulder for five years or more. 
</P>
<P>
Employees must shoulder these duties all the time, not just on their days off. 
Workers who care for elderly relatives report a higher than normal number of 
interruptions at work. They acknowledge that they are more likely than their 
colleagues to be on the telephone, to take unscheduled days off and to suffer 
physical and mental problems. 
</P>
<P>
What is corporate American doing about it? 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, not much. If they thought about it at all, top executives 
assumed that care of the old and infirm was, as it had been in decades past, 
the responsibility of family and government. It is government, after all, that 
runs the Social Security program for senior citizens and pays Medicare benefits 
for those 65 and over. And it is government in other countries -- most notably 
Canada and England -- that organized comprehensive, low-cost systems of medical 
and social care for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. system grew up differently, however. Run by local communities, it is a 
fragmented amalgam of services for the elderly in which federal and state funds 
are turned over to local agencies with little overall planning. What's worse, 
as federal and state politicians have cutfunds for social services programs, 
the elderly population of the United States has grown rapidly. The system as it 
existed in the 1970s and 1980s is likely to break down completely by the year 
2000. At least that's what some scholars and policy-makers are beginning to 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
Any number of reforms have been proposed by lawmakers, public-interest groups 
and university researchers. Researchers at UC San Francisco, for example, 
recently issued a report warning that something must be done to raise more 
state revenue -- higher sales taxes on alcohol and tobacco, and income taxes on 
corporations and individuals -- if long-term medical care needs are to be met 
over the next few decades. There are 1.1 million state residents who need 
long-term personal and medical care, the report said, and there will be twice 
that number by the year 2020, many of these elderly. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, bitter disputes in Washington have centered on how to 
finance a new and controversial Medicare catastrophic care program. The 
program, approved last year by Congress, was designed to help the elderly pay 
the costs of prescription drugs and extended medical treatment. In an effort to 
hold down overall taxes, however, lawmakers decided to finance the program by 
taxing only retirees. Many senior citizens saw that decision as an affront to 
the elderly, a grossly unfair system that places far too large a financial 
burden on middle-income people who have to make ends meet on fixed incomes. 
</P>
<P>
If the situation is difficult now, what will happen when the Baby Boom 
generation gets old? Analysts have long predicted that when they retire, 
today's 30- and 40-year-olds will bankrupt the Social Security fund and strain 
Medicare and other government health and social services beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
"All of that is why corporate America may have to do something about the 
problems. They are not getting solved by anyone else," said Roy S. Azarnoff, a 
gerontology expert who has started a private business to help corporations help 
families of the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
If Azarnoff, who lives in Southern California, and a number of other 
entrepreneurs, including Ken Dychtwald, a Northern California expert in 
gerontology, have their way, corporate America will pick up the slack -- and 
then some. Private enterprise may do for tomorrow's elderly what government did 
for the elderly in years past. 
</P>
<P>
By some estimates, American businesses are losing about $15 billion a year 
because of the burden on workers who provide care for their elderly relatives. 
Those losses may increase as the size of the elderly population continues to 
grow and the younger population begins to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
What the future holds for the elderly and their families is anyone's guess. 
Already, however, the burden is beginning to shift: Companies are beginning to 
shoulder some of the problems the aged impose on the younger generation. 
</P>
<P>
Just last summer, for example, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph agreed with 
its two largest labor unions on a contract that includes a series of eldercare 
provisions. Hailed by labor experts as a model for future employee benefit 
programs, the contract guarantees counseling, leaves of absence and so-called 
flexible spending accounts that allow workers to set aside pretax earnings for 
the costs of caring for elderly parents or other relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The company also has to provide referral services so that employees who need 
help in caring for elderly relatives will know where to find it. 
</P>
<P>
Unheard of only a few years ago, such referrals are opening a new service 
industry that is expected to burgeon over the next few decades. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first companies to offer such services is Work-Family Directions, 
just outside Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to create a business that would help families find someone to do 
the things for the elderly that they cannot do for themselves -- drive a car, 
cook meals, clean house and give advice, said Fran Rogers, the company's 
founder and president. 
</P>
<P>
Providing such services was a natural for Rogers' company, which had made 
child-care referrals for IBM employees for several years. A study was done to 
see if it was feasible to provide such referrals for the elderly. When it was 
determined that it was, IBM decided to go ahead with the plan, even though 
there had not been any demand from employees. 
</P>
<P>
Much to everyone's surprise, as soon as an eldercare network was established 
for IBM employees, the demand for eldercare began to overtake the demand for 
child care. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not something people had thought of," Rogers said. "Clearly, 
employers, even forward-looking employers, don't realize the need that is out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
A similar project is under way on the West Coast. Calling themselves the 
Eldercare Management Group, 10 gerontologists and an accountant have joined 
forces in Santa Monica to form a nationwide referral service. Among them are 
Scharlach, who did the Transamerica study, and Azarnoff, who founded the city 
of Los Angeles' Area Agency on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems for the Eldercare Management Group has been to persuade 
corporations that it is in their interest to pay for such services, 
particularly in an era when health-care costs are soaring and most companies 
are trying to scale back employee benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Employers don't pay for the services, Scharlach said; families do. The cost of 
the referrals, he said, is "only a fraction" of what companies say they are 
losing in productivity from employees who are unable to concentrate on their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The service does not give advice directly. Telephone counselors working for 
Eldercare Management try to determine the precise nature of the problems and 
then map out alternative strategies for dealing with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Eldercare management is an idea whose time has come," Azarnoff said. "I 
confess I have heard similar predictions about child care for years and we 
don't have much yet to show for it, but keep in mind there are some fundamental 
differences between child care and eldercare in this country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The care of children has been, and to a large extent continues to be, a 
woman's issue. But the care of the elderly is an issue that affects everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"The head of a corporation, probably a man, is bound to have an elderly parent, 
probably his mother, and he cannot fail to see that there can be very real 
problems with getting old, even if he failed to notice there were also some 
problems when his kids were growing up. Because the company head can't ignore 
his mother and because the problems he has with her are costing him time, he 
surely cannot help but realize that these are issues that are costing his 
entire organization time -- and money as well," Azarnoff said. 
</P>
<P>
While Azarnoff worries about the future, others are dreaming about it. 
</P>
<P>
Dychtwald is one of many businessmen trying to figure out how companies might 
make money on the elderly, rather than just spend it. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Dychtwald started a company in Emeryville, Calif. -- Age Wave 
Inc. -- an education, publishing and consulting firm to encourage the corporate 
world to create and market new products for the aged -- not just for the 
elderly who are frail and sick but for those who are healthy and thriving as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's becoming 'in' to be old," said Dychtwald, 38. "Of all the people who ever 
lived to be 65 in the history of the world, half are alive today. . . . That 
means if businesses are going to continue to succeed in the future, they are 
going to have to start acknowledging that an 'age wave' is about to crash over 
the shores of America." 
</P>
<P>
Which does not necessarily mean a world filled with wheelchairs, rest homes and 
ill-fitting sweaters, he said. It means new products, new services, a new way 
of thinking about aging. 
</P>
<P>
At first no one paid much attention to Dychtwald. Now companies all over the 
country are interested. Time, American Express, Blue Shield, Upjohn, McDonald's 
-- someone is on the phone every week, wanting advice on how to respond to the 
"graying of America," Dychtwald said. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, said James M. Thompson, manager of consumer affairs for the 
American Assn. of Retired Persons, when business assumed that being old meant 
living on a fixed income, if not in outright poverty, and being "brand-loyal," 
sticking to the same products and the same companies no matter what the price 
or the quality. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts now call the 62 million Americans who are 50 and over the "golden 
market." They control half the discretionary income in the United States and 
three-quarters of the financial assets. 
</P>
<P>
And, if predictions hold true, the numbers will increase considerably with 
time. The over-50 group is one the fastest growing in this country, exceeded 
only by two other groups -- those 65 and over and those 85 and over. 
</P>
<P>
Studies used to show that growing old meant becoming chary of making 
unnecessary purchases -- cars, clothes, houses, travel and other luxuries. Many 
experts now believe, however, that the so-called fiscal constipation of the 
elderly is an ailment of generations past. According to a new Washington 
newsletter, "Selling to Seniors," tomorrow's elderly will not only be willing 
buyers, they will be tough and sophisticated consumers, demanding products and 
services that are designed not for the young but for the needs and tastes of 
the old. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Club Med and other popular ski and beach resorts, once viewed as 
"adult camps" for swinging singles in their 20s, now increasingly cater to the 
over-40 crowd. Today, they offer child care. Tomorrow, if they are smart, some 
businessmen believe, they will include care for the elderly as well. 
</P>
<P>
Commercials on prime-time television have already changed. Along with spritely 
commercials for diet colas, there are now advertisements for retirement homes, 
cosmetics and breakfast cereals aimed at the over-60 audience. 
</P>
<P>
Stores and manufacturers are changing as well. Recognizing that many senior 
citizens have both time to shop and money to spend, Saks Fifth Avenue and FAO 
Schwartz have established "grandparents' boutiques" stocked with high-priced 
children's clothes and toys. The manufacturer of Cuisinart has remodeled its 
gourmet food processor with large, bold letters and oversized levers that make 
it easier for failing eyes and arthritic hands to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest change has taken place at McDonald's. Started in the 1960s 
as a hamburger stand for teen-agers on Route 66 in San Bernardino, this 
nationwide fast-food franchise is expanding its golden arches to welcome in an 
older clientele. And it doing more than simply serving early-bird dinners to 
old-timers. 
</P>
<P>
In view of predictions that there will be 15 million new service jobs available 
in the next few years and 9 million fewer young people to fill them, McDonald's 
has started what it calls the "new kid" recruiting and job-training program for 
senior citizens, which company executives believe may well be the nation's 
fastest-growing pool of dependable service workers for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Like the president of Age Wave Inc. many businessmen would like to go ever 
further. Many companies are busy at working trying to create new foods, 
radically new banking systems, never-before-thought-of indoor lighting devices 
-- all of which could radically alter the way older people live. 
</P>
<P>
In a new book, "Age Wave," published in February by Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc. in 
Los Angeles, Dychtwald and co-author Joe Flower list dozens of examples of the 
ways in which various industries are trying to respond to the changing needs 
and tastes of America's senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he said, there are mall-walking associations and Sun Belt retirement 
communities. Tomorrow there will be new kinds of retirement communities -- 
longevity complexes for health-food enthusiasts, mandala villages for 
self-development devotees, tron centers for video addicts, Olympic-style 
villages for athletic competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"When the baby boomers get old," Dychtwald said, "being old just won't be the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
'The American dream promised older people that if they worked hard enough all 
their lives, things would turn out well for them." -- Dr. Robert N. Butler, 
former director of the National Institute on Aging and now chairman of the 
gerontology department at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York. 
</P>
<P>
'When my generation gets old, there will be no negative stereotypes of aging. . 
. . Being old will be 'in.' Just as being middle-aged and having children is 
now. That's the power of numbers.' -- James M. Thompson, manager of consumer 
affairs for the American Assn. of Retired Persons.

A question in the May 6 "Condo Q&amp;A" column asked whether unincorporated 
community associations are exempt from the California law on reserve funding. 
The headline, "State Law Requires Establishing Reserve," was incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
State law does not specifically require that the association set aside reserve 
funds. However, there have been lawsuits in California as well as other states 
resulting in judgments against boards of directors that failed to maintain 
adequate reserve funds. 
</P>
<P>
California law requires that a reserve analysis be prepared by the association. 
All community associations, large and small, incorporated and unincorporated, 
must comply. Full disclosure as to the method of funding for repairs and 
replacement of the major components of the association's property must be 
provided to the association's members and prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Board members must serve in the best interests of the association and make 
sound business decisions regarding reserve funding. Those who fail to do so may 
be held accountable if the association is faced with financial hardship 
resulting from poor financial planning.

HE'S SET TO BE A POINT OF LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foster Webster, clad in his trademark coveralls, calmly swept up freshly mowed 
grass at the curb of his California bungalow in Oakwood, as if this were any 
other day. 
</P>
<P>
The activity swirling around him suggested otherwise, particularly the sight of 
Secret Service types in shirt sleeves and ties peering over fences and checking 
out the neighbors. A temporary telephone trunk line had been strung hastily 
above the street and a big, red fire truck had rolled up, unannounced, to check 
Webster's house for fire hazards. 
</P>
<P>
The President of the United States is to drop in on the 72-year-old, 
semi-retired janitor Monday and personally deliver a "Point of Light" award for 
Webster's work on the Oakwood Beautification Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The group was formed about a year ago at the suggestion of the Los Angeles 
Police Department, which was frustrated in its efforts to clean up the 
crime-ridden streets in the Oakwood area of Venice. Drug dealing in broad 
daylight and shootings between gangs by night had made it one of the city's 
more dangerous neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Relations with the police were marked by years of hostility. Some residents 
complained of what they perceived as sporadic, heavy-handed sweeps through the 
area that had little lasting impact on crime. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, a World War II veteran who bought his Venice home in 1962, is a 
founding member of the committee. He said he was first approached by Borden 
Olive of the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission. "I told him we need 
to organize something concerning drug abuse and the way the people are letting 
the community run down," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a farmer who raised corn and cotton, Webster was reared in Waco, 
Tex., where he began working at 14, after the eighth grade. "My philosophy of 
life is work," Webster said emphatically, leaning forward on a plastic-covered 
chair in the living room where George Bush will meet with him and the rest of 
the Beautification Committee board. "I have never been unemployed." 
</P>
<P>
Webster was a psychiatric aide at a veterans' hospital in Waco, and held a 
similar job with the Veterans Administration in Westwood until his back was 
injured in a traffic accident in Santa Monica and he was forced to take a 
disability retirement. He went on to do janitorial work in commercial buildings 
on the Westside, which he still does part time. 
</P>
<P>
The coveralls are part of a solution to his back pain, Webster said. Wearing 
pants with a belt hurts, he explained, though he will forgo the uniform and don 
his Sunday best to greet the President. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, who sent his two daughters to school out of the neighborhood, said he 
tried to be involved in another citizens' group, but found they only wanted to 
complain, not improve things. He concedes that some members of his community 
resent the success of the Oakwood Beautification Committee, but he was intent 
on bringing them in to work for the common good. "Our goal is to fight drugs 
and not to fight people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he does for fun, Webster repeated what he said he told his wife: 
"Honey, at my age, the fun days is over." He said he derives pleasure from 
church activities and visiting with relatives on holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a rah-rah type," Police Lt. Jerry Szymanski said. "He's a quiet 
leader (who) doesn't need to stand out from the rest but is always there for 
support." 
</P>
<P>
According to Szymanski, crime is down perhaps 44% since the police's Oakwood 
Task Force has been concentrating its resources, including foot patrols, in the 
area bounded by Rose Avenue, Electric Avenue, California Avenue and Lincoln 
Boulevard. Szymanski, who heads that force, said his officers have become part 
of the community and relations have never been better. 
</P>
<P>
Police nominated the Beautification Committee to the White House, which was 
looking for a "Point of Light" that George Bush could personally deliver. 
</P>
<P>
One component of the committee's plan, which they said Bush will inaugurate, is 
the posting of signs with the word DOPE in a circle with a diagonal line 
through it. The caption reads: "Buyers and dealers BEWARE. Your license plate 
numbers are being reported to police." 
</P>
<P>
Committee spokesman Grant Hudson said that when the group got started this 
would have been considered a risky statement to make. Though some in the 
community have criticized the group for not immediately soliciting help from 
veteran community activists, Hudson said the group had to build slowly because 
people were afraid of retribution if their names were associated with a 
fledgling crime-fighting effort. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Hudson said, he has been threatened. One woman's car windows were 
smashed and shots were fired through another man's window. Now that the 
multi-ethnic group is cohesive, everyone is welcome, Hudson said. The group's 
coming-out party was a "Taking Back the Streets" march last month, attended by 
City Atty. James Hahn and Venice Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. Both have worked 
with the group from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime community activist Pearl White said she is one who fears that the 
group's true agenda is to gentrify the neighborhood for high-income whites and 
force poor people out of an area of wildly escalating property values. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson, a renter, said his involvement stemmed from frustration over 
neighborhood conditions that nearly prompted him to move "to get out of this 
hell hole. . . . People are getting involved in it because they will not 
tolerate the living conditions here." 
</P>
<P>
Foster Webster is one of those people. He noted that government housing built 
for low-income families has been abused by people who live there and who treat 
it as a gift instead of their home. "Some people have chances and don't want 
them," he said. "Nobody can keep you from having what you want." 
</P>
<P>
Webster also insisted that the committee is not trying to push people out, only 
to stop drug dealing. One of the things he said he likes best about the 
committee's work is the respect he has gained from the drug dealers themselves, 
who now politely move on when he asks them to. 
</P>
<P>
And, although a few eggs were hurled at the 300 marchers last month, Webster 
said one drug dealer called out to him: "You all are going to march us off 
these streets, aren't you?" 
</P>
<P>
That's the plan.

MIKE PENNER: GRAHAM FINALLY LEARNS TO PLAY THE NUMBERS AT STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During her first season as a Stanford tennis player, Debbie Graham wasn't sure 
if she needed to brush up on her ground strokes or on her math. 
</P>
<P>
She spent half her freshman season ranked No. 1 in the nation. She spent all of 
it undefeated in dual matches. 
</P>
<P>
And she spent nearly all her patience trying to figure out why she was playing 
No. 4 singles at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"I was confused," Graham says. "It didn't make any sense to me. I thought, 'How 
could this be happening?' " 
</P>
<P>
Easy. During her sophomore season, Graham went undefeated in dual matches 
again, extending her winning streak to 52, an NCAA record. 
</P>
<P>
That moved her up to No. 3 singles. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, even when she sat down for lunch, Graham was no better than No. 2. 
Her closest friend on campus, Sandra Birch, was also her longtime doubles 
partner, a Stanford junior, a Cardinal teammate -- and 1989 NCAA Women's 
singles champion. 
</P>
<P>
That's the beauty, and the bane, of playing tennis in Palo Alto. Some 
universities collect the papers of major statesmen and scholars. Stanford 
collects major tennis players. How do you define depth? Two years ago, Lisa 
Green played No. 1 singles for the Cardinal during the NCAA team playoffs. This 
year, she played No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
But Graham is a native Californian who attended La Quinta and Los Amigos high 
schools and still resides in Fountain Valley. She's accustomed to sunshine. 
Life in the shadows isn't good for your tan and even worse for your 
disposition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so easy to get lost when you're playing No. 3 or No. 4," Graham says. "No 
one pays attention to the No. 3 and 4 players. Stanford has a great team for a 
reason, and I wanted people to know that it's more than just one or two 
players." 
</P>
<P>
So on Thursday, Graham did something about it. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Graham won the NCAA singles championship. 
</P>
<P>
That's one way to climb the Stanford tennis ladder. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot I wanted to prove in the NCAAs," Graham says. "After having 
been here for two years, after coming in as the (top-ranked) recruit in the 
nation and after getting stuck at No. 4 when I thought I should be playing 
higher, it was a blow to me. I thought I was better than some of the players 
ahead of me. I beat some of the players ahead of me. 
</P>
<P>
"But I figured that I was the freshman and Coach (Frank) Brennan thought it was 
best for the team to put me there. This year I thought would be different. This 
year I came in thinking, 'Well, last year I was freshman and I deserved to play 
there and now I've paid my dues.' " 
</P>
<P>
This year, Meredith McGrath played No. 1 singles for Stanford. McGrath is a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Graham noticed. 
</P>
<P>
"Meredith came in," Graham says, "and everyone thought she was the hottest 
thing. When people talked about Stanford, it was always Sandra Birch and 
Meredith, the top freshman in the country with a high (world) ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold challenge matches in January and I beat Meredith in a challenge match, 
but it didn't mean anything. She still played No. 1 and I played No. 3." 
</P>
<P>
Graham played No. 1 in the NCAA tournament, defeating Florida's Nicole Arendt 
in a 6-3, 6-3 final, but to get there, Graham first had to pass a philosophy 
test she had always failed: Can you beat a friend and still be friends? 
</P>
<P>
In both the Pacific 10 championships at Ojai and the NCAA championships, Birch 
faced Graham in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never beaten her until we played in Ojai," Graham says. "She's my best 
friend coming into school, we've played doubles forever. It was always 
difficult for me to play her. I'd try to be nice to her. I didn't want to beat 
her because she was my friend. 
</P>
<P>
"Sandra was different. When she played me, she turned into a competitor. She 
treated me like an enemy, in a way. And she'd beat me. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents would get so frustrated. They knew I was as good as her, but when I 
played her, I was like a zombie out there." 
</P>
<P>
At Ojai, Graham finally learned. "If she treats me just like another opponent, 
I have to block out the friendship," Graham says. And she did, beating Birch -- 
and later, McGrath in the final -- to win the Pac-10 title. 
</P>
<P>
That got Graham to thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can beat the No. 2 and No. 1 players in the country, gosh, I can beat 
anyone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a winning way to approach her second NCAA tournament. McGrath did a 
favor by losing early, but Birch qualified again for the semifinals. There, the 
rematch resulted in a rerun and Graham was poised to replace her friend as 
defending national champion. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was match point against Arendt. 
</P>
<P>
"I seriously could not believe it," Graham says with a laugh. "At the awards 
presentation, I couldn't think of anything to say. I was so exhausted and so 
excited, when they asked me to say a few things to the crowd, I didn't have any 
words." 
</P>
<P>
With Stanford also winning the team championship, Graham had a chance to become 
the first woman to sweep all three NCAA titles. All she needed was to win one 
more doubles match with Birch. But in an all-Cardinal final, McGrath and Teri 
Whitlinger rallied for a 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Those little records are neat," Graham says, "but I wasn't even aware of it 
until after the fact. Maybe that's something to look forward to in the future." 
</P>
<P>
There's always next year. Graham says she's coming back for her junior season, 
so a new day awaits at Stanford, along with a new round of challenge matches 
and a new tennis ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe then, they'll bump her up to No. 2.

TENNIS: JELLEN OF CALABASAS CRUISES TOWARD THE TOP OF JUNIOR COMPETITION AFTER 
RECEIVING A PUSH FROM HER PARENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob and Louise Jellen of Calabasas are happy to announce that their daughter 
Stacey, one of the best junior tennis players in the country, has reached an 
important milestone. She's old enough to drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Teen Auto class starts next week," Louise says, a measure of relief in her 
voice as she envisions the day when Stacey chauffeurs herself to lessons, 
practices and tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Bob and Louise have been more than casually involved in their daughter's 
career, making it their life since Stacey, who just turned 15, started batting 
tennis balls off their garage door nearly 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a family effort," Louise says. 
</P>
<P>
The effort has paid off. Thanks to both her own doggedness and her parents' 
backing, Stacey is in the fast lane of junior tennis. When she was 11, she and 
her doubles partner, Jennifer Capriati -- the current Wunderkind on the women's 
pro circuit -- were runners-up in their age group in the national junior 
tournament. Stacey was ranked second in doubles and seventh in singles in the 
14s age group. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey's parents provided more than just moral and logistic support. They also 
had the financial wherewithal to send her to an endless succession of tennis 
clinics and camps, including the country's leading camp for juniors, the Nick 
Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"Players go there from all over the world," says Bob, the president of an 
insurance company. But the camp is primarily known for producing such 
outstanding pros as Andre Agassi, Monica Seles, Aaron Krickstein and Carling 
Bassett-Seguso. 
</P>
<P>
While her parents dealt with the daily complications of having a tennis tot on 
the premises -- all those newspapers articles to clip, trophies to dust, 
airline reservations to make -- Stacey was feeling a few pangs herself. At 8, 
she went to one of Bollettieri's camps in Wisconsin but left early because she 
was homesick. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time she was a teen, Stacey was enough of a camp veteran to feel 
comfortable leaving home for extended periods. For five months last year, she 
resided at Bollettieri's 23-acre, 45-court complex in Bradenton. "It was a big 
decision for her to go," Bob says, "but you have to do those extra things to 
get ahead today." 
</P>
<P>
Stacey spent the last half of eighth grade living in a Bradenton condominium 
with seven other girls, which wasn't the teenie-bopper heaven you'd imagine. 
The girls got up at 6:30 a.m. and attended a small (20 students in the entire 
eighth grade) private school. Then they joined an additional 150 youths and 
played tennis all afternoon. Study hall went from 7:30 to 9:30 at night, and 
before you could say David Letterman, it was lights out at 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
"The camp was completely monitored," Bob says, casting a fatherly glance at his 
5-foot-8 blond daughter. "They don't let the kids wander outside alone. No 
smoking, no drugs. We selected the place because they supervise very well." 
</P>
<P>
Bob, Louise and Stacey -- her brother Scott, 17, was not around -- were inside 
their spacious ranch house discussing her Bradenton experience. Stacey 
remembered that she was able to cope with the separation from family and 
friends because she was able to see them occasionally. But facts tend to get a 
little fuzzy when the last decade seems like one long tennis match. 
</P>
<P>
"Did we go down there?" asks Louise, a petite woman who was raised on Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back once, you went down there once," Stacey says. 
</P>
<P>
"No, twice," says Bob, who grew up in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come home twice," Stacey says. 
</P>
<P>
"You came back to play in a South Bay tournament," Louise points out. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe you didn't actually stay here in this house, but you still came home," 
Bob says. 
</P>
<P>
At this juncture, most kids would have called their father a Poindexter and 
left, but Stacey just grinned. "OK, technically, I was here twice," she 
concedes. 
</P>
<P>
Louise mentions that the family reached out and touched one another when Stacey 
was at camp. "We spoke every day," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey did a double take. "No we didn't," she says, slightly offended that her 
mother would suggest such immature behavior on her part. 
</P>
<P>
Louise was undaunted. "I've got the credit-card bills." 
</P>
<P>
The Jellens went into the family room to show a visitor a videotape on their 
big-screen TV. They had to walk around a massive treadmill -- Stacey needed one 
to work out, and somehow, Louise says with disbelief, "It wound up right in the 
middle of the family room." 
</P>
<P>
The video, a promo for Bollettieri's camp, was some five years old. It showed 
tanned kids taking lessons, doing aerobics, lifting weights and learning 
scientific skills to improve visual acuity. There was a young, short-haired 
Andre Agassi banging a top-spin forehand and a tiny cotton-topped Stacey Jellen 
whacking a two-handed backhand. 
</P>
<P>
"My tennis really improved because of Nick's camps," Stacey says, "because I 
had a lot of really good competition. I still would have improved if I wouldn't 
have gone, but I wouldn't be as developed." 
</P>
<P>
Popping onto the TV screen was a man who had the best tan in camp. It was 
Bollettieri enthusiastically pitching the benefits of his academy, then adding, 
"And remember, fun is the name of the game." Stacey was asked about 
Bollettieri, who has a reputation for driving his students. Fingering her 
"Stacey" necklace, she pondered the question for a few moments before saying, 
"He's really . . . " Then she paused, trying to find the right word. 
</P>
<P>
"Demanding," Louise says for her. 
</P>
<P>
"A good motivator," Stacey says. "Kind of intense. And demanding." 
</P>
<P>
"He stops you immediately if you do something wrong," Louise adds. 
</P>
<P>
Bob and Louise were willing to pay the $1,500 to $2,000 a month to continue 
sending Stacey to Bollettieri's camp last year, but she didn't want to stay in 
Bradenton beyond the five months, as many kids do. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end, I wanted to be home," she says. Aside from friends and family, 
high school beckoned. She was looking forward to her freshman year at Calabasas 
High. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike most freshmen, Stacey wasn't invisible. Playing on the Calabasas 
varsity last fall, she posted a 51-3 singles record, overwhelming older 
opponents with a go-for-the-jugular style. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southern Section 3-A Division girls' championships, she and teammate 
Natasha Pospich won the varsity doubles title and led Calabasas to a 
second-place team finish. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, aside from Teen Auto, Stacey will be taking the usual assortment 
of tennis lessons -- Bollettieri has a camp at Cal State Northridge -- and 
playing in the girls' 16s at the U.S. National Juniors in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
She also will be entering the qualifying rounds of a couple of small pro 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been my dream for as long as I can remember to be a pro some day," Stacey 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Burnout -- a problem with some young athletes -- isn't affecting Stacey. "If I 
didn't enjoy tennis, I wouldn't be playing," she says. Her father agrees. "I 
don't believe in burnout in tennis," Bob says. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe kids stop playing because they get frustrated over not doing well and 
they no longer have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Stacey is a teen-age tennis phenom, Bob says he and Louise "believe 
in making sure she has a well-rounded life." 
</P>
<P>
Like a lot of girls her age, he says, "She has a boyfriend and she dates." 
</P>
<P>
Stacey corrected him. "I don't date," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, right," Bob says. "She has a boyfriend."

HEY, NOW THERE'S A BUM IN THE RADIO BOOTH

<P>
Directions to a man's place of business can often offer insights into his 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
For example: Turn off the two-lane just east of here, go four miles on the 
ranch road and after crossing a one-lane wooden bridge, take a gravel road two 
more miles, cross two cattle guards, drive past fields of grazing cattle and 
turn right when the road dead ends. 
</P>
<P>
Behind a small forest of oaks you'll find Bum Phillips, the former coach of the 
Houston Oilers and New Orleans Saints and now one of the more famous ranchers 
in Fort Bend County. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of herding helmeted behemoths through a football practice, Phillips is 
yelling at a young cattle dog named Andy and coaxing 20-odd head of cattle into 
a covered arena. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips is one of the best-liked figures in Houston sports history, but 
there's little doubt he's from the country and doesn't care to be defined in 
any other terms. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out in ranching and I'm going to end up the same way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips is as much at home on winding country roads, creaky old bridges, 
cattle pens and cutting horses as he was straddling the sidelines in the 
Astrodome and Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
But Phillips won't be home on the ranch on Sundays this fall. 
</P>
<P>
He'll be back in the Astrodome and other NFL stadiums as a color analyst for 
the Oilers' broadcast network on KTRH-AM. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips also will accept a limited number of public appearances and speaking 
engagements on behalf of the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
It will be Phillips' first association with the NFL since he retired from the 
Saints in 1985, saying "I'm just loading up the wagon and not worrying about 
which mule it's hitched to." 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't regretted riding away. 
</P>
<P>
"When I walked away from football I forgot it at that instant," Phillips said. 
"Coaching does that to you. You get your butt beat one week and you've got to 
forget it and play the next week. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidently, I learned that lesson well. I guess I was ready to get out because 
I truly didn't miss it. I got right into the cattle business and I've been 
thinking about that ever since." 
</P>
<P>
So why return now, even to the radio booth? 
</P>
<P>
Because, after the horses have been fed and watered and he's driving home in 
his pickup truck late at night, Bum has memories. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers returning to the Astrodome to 50,000 crazed "Luv Ya Blue" fans 
after losing the AFC championship game to Pittsburgh in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a great feeling to have everyone in town, all on the same page, 
everybody pulling in the same direction," Phillips said. "I'd like to see that 
get started again." 
</P>
<P>
He shook his head and spit tobacco on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect to see 50,000 fans at a major championship game, not coming out and 
to see a team that just got the hell beat out of it." 
</P>
<P>
That was when Bum, speaking through teary eyes, told the fans "This year we 
knocked on the door, next year we'll kick the SOB down." 
</P>
<P>
But the Oilers never kicked down the door to the Super Bowl, and Phillips left 
under less than harmonious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
He was fired on New Year's Eve 1980 after the Oilers were eliminated from the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
He remains the winningest Oiler head coach, with a 55-35 record from 1975 to 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken 10 years and the departure of Ladd Herzeg as Oilers general 
manager to get Bum back in the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't trying to hide out; I just wasn't interested in the people who were 
running it at the time," Phillips said. "I didn't have any ax to grind. I was 
just happy doing my thing." 
</P>
<P>
Even last season after Herzeg's departure, Phillips was conspicuously absent 
from a reunion of Oilers players at a home game. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't put it in words, but it just didn't feel right to be there," Phillips 
said. "It was like there was still a division there. Now it's different." 
</P>
<P>
Oilers owner Bud Adams is glad to have Phillips associated with the Oilers once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"People on the street thought there was animosity between us, but that was 
never the case," Adams said. "There are always going to be personnel changes. 
That's just a part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought he'd be a positive addition to the broadcast team. He'll add 
charisma." 
</P>
<P>
Oilers Executive Vice President Mike McClure, who left the Oilers in 1981 and 
returned prior to last season, wanted to bring Phillips back into the fold. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought it was the appropriate thing to do. He was such a big part of a 
successful Oiler era," McClure said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips will be the third man in the booth with play-by-play announcer Tom 
Franklin and commentator John O'Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
Fans likely will expect to hear the homey style that made Phillips among the 
most quotable coaches. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to take his team to Cleveland early to get accustomed to the cold 
weather because "You can't practice being miserable."

WALESA PAVED THE WAY FOR FREEDOM IN EASTERN EUROPE. BUT WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE

GDANSK, Poland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man who would be president, and who sometimes figuratively refers to the 
office as the "throne," arrived for work as on most weekday mornings: in the 
back seat of a midnight-blue government Lancia, one of a consignment of sleek 
Italian cars ordered by the last Communist prime minister of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Lech Walesa popped out of the door, a cannonball with legs, at high velocity 
and a low center of gravity. His government-hired security man hurried up the 
steps and yanked open the door. 
</P>
<P>
On the curb, a pair of rumpled handymen were having a smoke and admiring their 
work with the display of flags set out to welcome the president of West 
Germany, who was visiting Walesa that afternoon. They grinned with a mixture of 
admiration and amusement as the boss shot past them, a force of nature in a 
brown suit, on the way to hurl thunderbolts from his third-floor office. 
</P>
<P>
The corridors of the Solidarity union headquarters, two blocks from the famous 
shipyards, smell of disinfectant, like a grim Polish hospital. Walesa sped 
along like a squat bear, slightly bowlegged, his shoulders rocking side to 
side, with a distinct tilt to the left. He managed to appear at once a bit 
overfed and yet ready to spring in any direction, take on any confrontation, 
physical or verbal. He looked embattled but ready. As his friends say, Lech is 
always embattled. He likes it that way. 
</P>
<P>
But things had been getting rough lately, even for a man of Walesa's scrap-iron 
will. In Warsaw, they were calling him "Lech the Tiresome." In Warsaw, they 
were asking, "Why doesn't he shut up?" In Warsaw, intellectuals were writing 
coy articles complaining that although a "painted bird" -- Walesa -- may be a 
wonderful phenomenon in its own territory, such a gaudy creature begins to wear 
on the eyes. Finally, in Warsaw, where they were trying to run the government 
as if it were a social-science experiment, they were publishing polls showing 
slippage in his popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa pushed through the frosted glass doors of his outer office, revealing 
three or four men, their timid queries capably fended off by a pair of 
secretaries, telephones in hand. Before any of them could say more than hello, 
Walesa was into his private office. The security fellow pulled the door shut 
after him. 
</P>
<P>
Taped to the door was a poster, cut from a newspaper, depicting Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as Rambo. It was a characterization, his aides 
thought, with which their boss might identify. Walesa was preparing for war. 
</P>
<P>
This seems like a strange turn of 
</P>
<P>
fortune, because for 10 years Lech Walesa easily has been the most admired 
figure in Poland. For the last decade -- in jail, through martial law and the 
chill years of its aftermath -- Walesa, now 46, has been the nation's 
acknowledged, if not officially recognized, political leader. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after negotiating the Communists into an election defeat from which 
they would never recover, it was Walesa -- against much cautious advice to the 
contrary -- who dared to engineer Solidarity's takeover of the Communist 
government, thus ending an era in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But the end of one era suggests the beginning of a new one, and that is exactly 
where Walesa's discomfort began, and continues still. Despite the magnitude of 
his accomplishment in 1989, he has been left in a curious limbo. 
</P>
<P>
The bargain with the Communists gave the presidency to Gen. Wojciech 
Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party leader and the man frozen in the minds 
of Poles as the poker-faced declarer of martial law in 1981. Walesa himself 
handpicked the prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, an old ally. And then he 
went back to Gdansk, triumphant, and in charge of . . . a labor union. 
</P>
<P>
Few people who have watched Walesa over the years expected him to settle 
quietly into the role of a union chief and, predictably, it's been a rocky six 
months in Gdansk since he returned to more routine duties. 
</P>
<P>
From that vantage point, he has had the exquisite anguish of looking on as 
playwright Vaclav Havel became the president of Czechoslovakia, the toast of 
the world, the darling of intellectuals and the chic new representative of the 
brave and brilliant fighters for democracy in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mazowiecki, radiating calm and dignity, soared in popularity. 
Utter unknowns -- Leszek Balcerowicz, the Polish finance minister, for example 
-- lectured him on the principles of market economics. 
</P>
<P>
And now comes grave concern from all the degree-wielding professors, 
journalists, economists, statisticians, linguists, political scientists and 
historians who could not get a serious job without selling their souls until 
the arrival of this trade-school electrician, born in a shack on a Polish bog. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a man who speaks Polish the way it's heard on the factory floor or 
at the neighborhood tram stop, all this massed and judicious intelligentsia now 
has the luxury of saying that, perhaps, Lech Walesa is not exactly 
sophisticated enough to be president of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's the way Walesa's closest supporters see it. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side is the argument of the Warsaw intellectual camp, as yet not 
forthrightly expressed by its diffident representatives. Although they mostly 
resist saying it aloud, to them Lech Walesa is a loose cannon. 
</P>
<P>
Volatile, restless, as covetous of the spotlight as a grand opera diva, Walesa 
as president would be no mild ceremonial figure. The autocratic streak that 
even his allies have long complained of might be given its full, 
shoot-from-the-hip rein, just when continued order, calm and restraint are most 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
This camp argues, so far only in its inner circles, that Walesa might have been 
just the heaven-sent man to lead Poland -- and, indeed, the rest of Eastern 
Europe -- in the long fight against the Communists. (And a strong case could be 
made that without Walesa, Czechoslovak dissidents would still be trying to lay 
their flowers on Wenceslas Square.) 
</P>
<P>
But, they say, that does not necessarily mean he is the best man to lead the 
country from now on -- nor should the country, which has already reserved a 
large place in its modern history for him, feel obligated to reward him with 
the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
These are serious enough questions, dealing with Walesa's suitability for the 
job. Even among his allies, Walesa can be, by turns, a populist demagogue or a 
careful listener to wise counsel. He professes his love of democracy, but 
acknowledges the usefulness of what he calls "a little manipulation on the 
fringes of democracy." To friend and foe, he can be exasperating and often 
incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
"Walesa is the only person I know who can say three different things on three 
successive days and get away with it," said one colleague, in a comment he 
intended as praise. 
</P>
<P>
But the debate so far has been obscured by a diversionary verbal squabble 
suggesting merely that Walesa has fallen out with the intellectuals who now 
populate the government ministries in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
In the resulting comedy, one side complains that Walesa speaks less than 
perfect Polish and knows no foreign languages. Walesa, in response, advises 
audiences not to listen to "eggheads" who want a president who might speak "in 
a language you would not understand." Even Walesa's wife, Danuta, the mother of 
his eight children, seemed unwittingly drawn into the fray, describing her 
husband in a recent television interview as secretive and tough to get along 
with. 
</P>
<P>
She added, "I don't think any other woman could put up with him." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict, however, is fraught with real danger for Walesa. It could tempt 
him into adopting the role of a Polish "know-nothing," making war with old 
allies and drawing into his camp the more virulent nationalist elements of the 
Polish right wing, which contains a full complement of anti-Soviet 
retributionists and hazy anti-Semites -- graceless company for a man who in 
1983 won the Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
It could also lock him into a 
</P>
<P>
head-on competition with Mazowiecki for the presidency, a contest Mazowiecki's 
boosters are already urging. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Walesa's eventual role as president was virtually a foregone 
conclusion in Poland. At the time of his address to a joint session of the U.S. 
Congress last November, he held Poland in thrall. Heads of state, foreign 
ministers and U.S. representatives by the busload came to Poland and trekked 
dutifully to Gdansk, making sure photographers got the handshake with Walesa to 
add to the gallery of framed photos back home. 
</P>
<P>
"So what is Walesa? A tourist attraction?" he asked his staff, referring to 
himself in the third person, as though he were explaining the motives of an 
alter-ego that just happened to share his body. 
</P>
<P>
He had become the rhinoceros of Gdansk. The inner circle was already restless. 
The twin Kaczynski brothers, Lech and Jaroslaw, Walesa's chief political 
operatives, got the message. Although national elections had been set for 1993 
and President Jaruzelski's term does not expire until 1995, there was already 
talk of moving the votes up to the spring of 1991, barely a year away. 
</P>
<P>
Failing that, there was always the possibility of a constitutional revision, 
which could bring the same result. In early April, Jaroslaw Kaczynski and 
Krzystof Pusz, Walesa's aides-de-camp, floated a trial balloon: Walesa was 
running, they told interviewers. Walesa first confirmed and then denied it. 
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, where they could see it coming, they were neither fooled nor 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
On the day that Walesa was to meet West German President Richard von 
Weizsaecker, the lines had been drawn already, and it was clear to his closest 
aides that Walesa, in his solitary way, was spoiling for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa likes to arrive early for meetings, and he was ready at the head table 
in a meeting hall in the union's headquarters 10 minutes before the starting 
time of a session of the union's national commission, held three weeks after 
its national congress. 
</P>
<P>
His table was on an elevated stage, in front of a brown curtain, and he sat 
there alone, shuffling papers, silent except for an occasional word to a 
delegate sitting at the rows of tables below him. About 150 men were jammed 
into the room, from all over the country, most of them veterans of the union's 
earliest days. Despite the crowd, the hall was quiet, like a college classroom 
before the lecture begins. The delegates were dressed casually, mostly in 
jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa had a clear plan for this meeting -- to install two top deputies to run 
the union's day-to-day affairs. For one of them, he had picked Lech Kaczynski, 
his light-footed political aide. The other was a unionist from Katowice, well 
respected but no maverick. Walesa looked at his watch, huffed into the 
microphone and started. 
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, Walesa had held what has come to be known as his "weekly 
press conference," an event that in recent weeks had drawn only thin attendance 
from reporters. That session had been held before a gathering of disgruntled 
public transport workers at a tram yard in Gdansk, and the pattern Walesa 
adopted there was the same he would employ here. He invited questions from the 
floor, called for a discussion, then answered. 
</P>
<P>
The workers stood up, one by one, and, rather than simply ask questions, they 
made what amounted to short speeches, generally a five-minute litany of 
complaint: Their last strike had not been supported, the workers' demands were 
not being heard, prices were going up, times were hard, the government was not 
listening, the public did not care about their troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa listened, with a manner that suggested both patience with their problems 
and an impatience that the workers seemed to be blaming him. The answers were 
characteristic Walesa -- simultaneously understanding, aggrieved, cajoling, 
pleading and placating. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't ask Walesa to solve all your problems," he said. "Don't treat me like an 
enemy. Treat me like one who wants to present your problems to the world. 
Walesa did not come here to pacify you." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it was like a town meeting in which the inhabitants got a chance to 
ventilate their grievances, if not find a solution to their problems. At last, 
when Walesa got back in the blue sedan and left, it was hard to say that the 
workers had been satisfied, but they had been heard. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa opened the national commission meeting by making it clear that he had 
not chosen his deputies as possible successors, but as his assistants. He asked 
for discussion. He used the word "democracy" five times in his first three 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Walesa took a shotgun approach to speaking: sentences running up the 
back of sentences not yet started, elliptic, full of shorthand references to 
the union's history, to past accusations of his roughshod manner of running 
things, to his love of Poland, his respect for democratic method, his hope of 
being understood. 
</P>
<P>
As with the workers before, the stance was at once placating and argumentative. 
It was the standard Walesa way: Invite attack, read the mood, turn it around. 
His audience, like a roomful of trained lions, rose to the whip. 
</P>
<P>
The first assault was on procedural grounds. Walesa said he wanted a democratic 
process, and after settling the issue of deputies, "then we'll immediately 
start democracy. . . ." He was attacked at length for trying "to subjugate the 
interests of the national commission to Lech Walesa." 
</P>
<P>
He listened, his microphone at the ready, as though looking for an opening to 
leap into the discussion. He took off his jacket, revealing white suspenders. 
He picked up the microphone and held it to his lips. He was talking before his 
antagonist's backside hit the chair. 
</P>
<P>
"Different myths are created about me in different places," Walesa said. "Mind 
you, from the very beginning, from the very first day, at the congress, I 
didn't take the floor, not one time. 
</P>
<P>
"Did I not have anything to say? If I had nothing to say, then the people 
coming to visit me in the union would not be coming to see me. But I truly 
believe in democracy, I truly believe that together we are wiser than the best 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
Another question: 
</P>
<P>
"Are you going to stay head of the union, or be president of the country? 
Because if you are going to be president of the country, we don't want to be 
the instrument to help you do it. Could you give us a clear statement on this?" 
</P>
<P>
"How am I to prove to you that truly I don't want to be the chairman and I 
don't want to be the president? Because I have been repeating it a thousand 
times, and you still don't believe me. So I repeat, I didn't want to be the 
chairman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The question about the presidency: What else could I say? I don't want to be 
the president. But what happens in Poland if some 500 parties emerge? You 
already see the chaos, and the chaos will be still bigger, whereas I am able, 
with everybody, to talk, to make compromises, with practically everyone. I am 
able, and I am proud of it, to reconcile with those no one else is able to 
reconcile with. If Poland demands this, if the pluralism demands this, if the 
anarchy demands for me to take this role, then what am I to say? 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, I am a Pole. If a situation like this occurs, I will stand anywhere, 
even against you, to serve Poland. But I don't want it, just as I didn't want 
to be the chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"I am living through all these things like a simple man. But, of course, 
besides all these small games of mine there is Poland, and then I start 
thinking, what is better? But you don't believe me, even if I took my heart and 
showed it to you, you think I want to make a business here, or I want to be the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"You think it is going to be 'easy bread' to be a president in this country 
with 500 parties? I have tasted this bread already. I was very honest saying to 
you, 'Go to my office and see how many propositions I have' -- traveling, 
saying it was me who toppled over communism in Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa leaned forward on the table, his face thrust into the room, his voice 
rising an octave with each accent, punching it at them: 
</P>
<P>
"So I am not here for the money. You fought for my position. It was not me. 
Everyone of you contributed to it, here in this room and outside this room. I 
simply cannot take my suitcase and go. I am living through these dilemmas. So 
stop asking me questions, if I am not going to run. If the country requires it, 
I will run. I won't say, 'No, thank you, I've done enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
It went on after that, but with a decided shift in the tension, as though a 
great sail had fallen limp in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa had not necessarily convinced anyone except, perhaps, of the futility of 
out-talking him. In a few minutes, there was laughter. Walesa said that anyone 
who voted would get a free plastic watch, a gift to the union from recent 
Japanese well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
As the men stood up to file out of the room, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, the Wroclaw 
Solidarity activist who is often at odds with Walesa, nudged one of his 
colleagues, the one who had asked Walesa to give back some authority to the 
national commission. 
</P>
<P>
"You made a fool of yourself, Jan," Frasyniuk said. "You don't ask Walesa to 
please give back some of his power. You have (guts) enough to take it from him, 
or you let it be." 
</P>
<P>
As much a master of symbolism as any Polish politician, Walesa concluded that 
Richard von Weizsaecker was not a man who needed to be met at the front steps 
of the building. Without undue ceremony, the West German president, whose 
countrymen opened World War II by shelling and invading Walesa's adopted 
hometown, could walk up the three flights of stairs by himself to meet the head 
of Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
A German television producer, informed of the arrangement, said she assumed 
this was the first time in his presidential career that Von Weizsaecker had not 
been met by his hosts at the limousine door. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 seconds before Von Weizsaecker, a handsome, silver-haired figure in a 
trim gray suit, bounded up the stairs, smiling warmly, Walesa came out and 
stood before his open office doors. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to the home of Solidarity in Polish Gdansk," Walesa said, shaking 
hands for the cameras. The two men, their aides and translators met privately 
for half an hour, then left to lay a wreath at the shipyard monument. 
</P>
<P>
At the towering steel crosses, erected by Solidarity to commemorate shipyard 
workers who died in a 1970 uprising, Von Weizsaecker paid his respects, stood 
in silent tribute with Walesa and listened as translators explained the 
inscriptions surrounding the memorials. 
</P>
<P>
There seemed to be little else to say. Walesa shook hands with Von Weizsaecker. 
"Do widzenia," Walesa said. "Goodby." He walked away with his aide and security 
man and headed back to the office, while Von Weizsaecker's party looked for 
their cars. 
</P>
<P>
On the way back, Walesa was induced to compare the heads of state he had met. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Weizsaecker's OK," he said. "I invited him to come back to visit, once a 
month, if he can. He's a good man. He's very well respected in his country. 
Heads of state, they're all different. How can you say who is best? It's like 
comparing a boxing champion and a checkers champion. Who is best? A boxing 
champion or a checkers champion? Which one, you tell me? You see? You can't 
say. Bush is very good. Thatcher is very good. It's like that. Champions."

Walesa was back at the Solidarity building then, and hurried up to his office. 
It was now almost 5 p.m. Within two minutes, he was out the door, down the 
steps and headed home.

MICHAEL MCKINNON: DIRECTOR OF ARABIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When one think of Arabia, one visualizes deserts, camels and nomads. But the 
vast country is much more than sand and dust. The mysteries and contrasts of 
the region, which was born out of Africa nearly 35 million years ago, are 
explored in the three-part series, "Arabia: Sand, Sea &amp; Sky," which 
premiered last week on the Discovery Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Episode II-"The Red Sea Rift" -- airs Tuesday at 5 p.m.; the conclusion-"Eye of 
the Camel" -- airs May 29 at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Michael McKinnon, the Australian-born producer and director of "Arabia: Sand, 
Sea &amp; Sky," talked about the making of the documentary series with Susan 
King. 
</P>
<P>
How did the series come about? 
</P>
<P>
I did a series a few years ago called "Treasures of the Gulf," which was shown 
on "Nature." That was six films on the natural history of the Gulf area, the 
sea between the Arabian countries and Iran. In the course of doing that 
research and making those films, I was constantly exposed to the fact that all 
the wildlife was on the other side of Arabia. I then started to do some 
research and found out there were a large population of baboons in the 
mountains and yellow cobras and God knows what. There were all sorts of things 
that no one had seen a single photograph of. 
</P>
<P>
I traveled a lot and talked to a lot of scientists. Just at the point I was 
getting momentum and getting financing together, the Saudi Arabians established 
something called the National Commission for Wildlife and Conservation. They 
themselves pulled together all sorts of studies that different people had been 
doing. All of a sudden, there was this great windfall of having access to the 
work of 50 or 100 scientists who were doing great detailed studies. That's what 
helped make the series come alive. 
</P>
<P>
How long did it take to film the series? 
</P>
<P>
It took us two and a half years of filming and editing and a year and a bit for 
preparations, travel, seeking out locations and tracking down the stories. 
</P>
<P>
The series features remarkable footage of animals, birds and marine life. It 
must have been difficult and time-consuming to get the footage. 
</P>
<P>
One of the characteristics of this kind of filming is that if you move into a 
territory with land crews and tripods and you set up a hide, nothing comes near 
because it's too big and too bulky and too strange. Because we didn't shoot at 
anything and were being reasonably quiet, most of the birds tended to trust us 
after we were there for about four days. So all of our bird material was shot 
without hides, simply because we were able to settle into the environment a 
bit. 
</P>
<P>
If you go down into the marine environment, you take a little bag of fish and 
feed the fish out of plastic bags for a couple of days, and they tend to relax. 
You can get very close. You can take your tripods down. It takes a few days for 
them to trust you, and that takes patience and being very still and keeping a 
fairly low profile. 
</P>
<P>
Much of our filming was done on the run. We were camping a lot and out on 
remote places. When we filmed the Bedouins, because we were traveling 20 miles 
a day with the camels, we were not able to pitch camps. We slept under the 
stars, which was wonderful. We basically lived their life and moved with them. 
</P>
<P>
Before you became a filmmaker you were a painter. Does your artistic background 
give you a different slant on making documentaries? 
</P>
<P>
I suppose if you have been a painter for 10 years you trust your eye. You trust 
the image. If you've got a good image, it will carry most of the burden of the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
So when it comes to choosing cameramen with wonderful eyes, there's a lot of 
agreement between them and myself as to what makes a good image. We are the 
kind of people who would like to make films without having to use words. We 
would like the final cut of the film to tell the story. We really have gone for 
the image. We tried to build sequences which are very powerful in their image 
rather than supportive of words. We haven't tried to use inadequate images to 
support interesting verbal theory. 
</P>
<P>
What is the biggest misconception people have about Arabia? 
</P>
<P>
Because of the age of oil, journalistic focus has been on eastern Arabia, where 
you have got the desert and the Gulf. Historically, the mountain area of Arabia 
has always been the most populated region. The nomadic region is a much smaller 
group of people. But on the other hand, it's more romantic and more attractive 
to the Western imagination. 
</P>
<P>
What was most difficult about shooting the series? 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult thing was judging the seasons right. So much of the life in 
the desert is nomadic. 
</P>
<P>
If birds decide there hasn't been enough rain for the growth to bring on 
insects, they will simply keep moving. What we tried to do with our scientific 
advice was to say, "OK. We are going to film the desert larks in an area of the 
northern desert." 
</P>
<P>
We arrived there on the basis of the seasons for the past three years, but we 
were a month early. Spring only lasts for a couple of weeks, so we had to pick 
up our bags and go away and work somewhere else for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
When we went back to that place, we hit it on peak. The place was just popping 
with life, and a couple of weeks later, it was all over. The story of the 
wildlife has so much to do with hitting it right. 
</P>
<P>
Because Arabia is between Asia and Africa, there are hundreds and hundreds of 
millions of birds flying across it every year. But it all happens within a 
couple of weeks. What we tried to do in the couple of years was to lay out a 
game plan that would take advantage of each of these events, so we could build 
the stories. That's why it took two years to film, because one was trying to 
take hold of this incident and that incident and then slowly build up the 
stories and make the film.

<P>
THE FORMER SWING ERA BANDLEADER TURNS HIS TALENTS FROM MUSIC TO LITERATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artie Shaw, the lone surviving instrumental giant of the Swing Era, stands in 
the sprawling upstairs space of his Newbury Park home that real estate folks 
call a "bonus room," holding a large and colorful proclamation from the City of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the city government put their name on this," he says with a 
subtle hint of levity in his voice. "The weird thing is that they're giving me 
an honor for something I stopped doing 35 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
The "something" is what Shaw, a feisty, vital fellow who this Wednesday turns 
80 -- but looks 60 -- likes to call "The Artie Shaw Business," referring to the 
international celebrity the former clarinetist/bandleader received during the 
'30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw insists that when he quit active playing in 1954, he retired from music. 
But the "business" follows him around like a ghost, though a fairly benevolent 
one. After all, Shaw was, along with Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman, one of the 
three most popular instrumentalists of the Swing Era. He has made countless 
millions from his music -- his records have sold upwards of 50 million copies 
-- and he still gets handsome royalties from the scores of records that are in 
release on Bluebird/RCA, Musicmasters and Musiccraft/Discovery labels. 
</P>
<P>
And, since late 1983, he has lent his name to "The Artie Shaw Orchestra, 
directed by Dick Johnson." He owns the band and has appeared occasionally with 
it, though only as a guest leader, never as a player. 
</P>
<P>
While music pays the bills, Shaw, bald and sporting a bristle-brush mustache, 
no longer wishes to be aligned with it: He wants to be known as Artie Shaw, 
writer. The once-clarinetist now has had three books published, including the 
1952 autobiography "The Trouble With Cinderella: An Outline of Identity" 
(DaCapo), the 
</P>
<P>
1965 novel "I Love You, I Hate You, Drop Dead!" (Fleet) and the 1989 book of 
short stories "The Best of Intentions" (John Daniel and Co.). In addition, he's 
almost completed a 500-600 page novel. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a special burden as a writer, since people know my name as a musician," 
he says. "We have peculiar categories in America, meaning that if he's a 
musician he can't be a good writer. 'Artie Shaw, what's he doing writing?' " 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if he published more often, or had had more success as a writer, might 
people take him more seriously? "Oh, I don't think so," he says pointedly. 
"They might, if my name weren't Artie Shaw. But with any name that's well 
known, people read that person through a layer of preconceptions. It's surely 
true that as a well-known person, it's easier to get published." 
</P>
<P>
John Daniel, who says that "the playfulness and energy of Shaw's writing" were 
two reasons he wanted to publish him, agrees that Shaw's celebrity places him 
at a disadvantage. "Whether, because of his wealth from his music, he has the 
privilege or the luxury of not having to publish, Artie is behind the 
eight-ball because nobody will read him just as a writer," he says. "A 
brilliant clarinetist, or an ex-husband of the stars (Shaw was briefly married 
to Lana Turner and Ava Gardner), that's what they think of first. That's hard 
for an artist to put up with. He's had to live with the onus of his success all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, in Shaw's mind, he's a writer. "I've been mainly living as a 
writer since about 1950, getting up in the morning, writing for four hours, 
etc.," he says, now sitting at his somewhat-cluttered desk in a corner of the 
book-lined upstairs room that looks out on his pool, and then, in turn, the 
suburbs that are located just north of Thousand Oaks, the Ventura Freeway and 
the soft, sloping hills beyond. "Maybe I didn't have any history as a writer 
then, but I'd say I do now. I've done three books and I'm working on a fourth." 
</P>
<P>
"Look," Shaw goes on, an edge in his voice. "I come up here and I do it. I 
write. I feel compelled to. Why would anybody in his right mind sit down and 
write? There's nobody out there clamoring for fine writing. I have a necessity 
to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw started his novel-in-progress, currently bearing the working title of "The 
Education of Albie Snow," in 1978. Though Shaw says he doesn't like to talk a 
book as he's writing it, he does acknowledge that it's about a young reed 
player who goes to New York in the late 1920s to seek fame and fortune in the 
jazz world. The book stops off when the protagonist Snow is 23 years old, in 
the mid-'30s. 
</P>
<P>
The novel, and all of Shaw's writing, he says, is "to some degree 
autobiographical. If it's not, it won't deal with the truth, and by that, I 
mean what's real to me. We are the sum total of our experiences; if they're 
rich, we'll resonate more. I've lived for a long time and I've learned a few 
things that I'm passing on. Some will hear it, some will not." 
</P>
<P>
It's a painstaking process, writing a book. "I'm trying to write the most 
simple, lucid prose and it's hard to write 
</P>
<P>
simply. . . . I work very, very slowly," he notes. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in one of his frequent asides to offer a quote or anecdote that 
illustrates a particular point he wishes to drive home, Shaw reads a quote from 
a typed sheet by writer Kurt Vonnegut Jr. The sheet -- somewhat brown with age 
-- has been tacked, along with several others by the likes of Paul Gauguin and 
Steve Tesich, on a wooden shelf by his desk. 
</P>
<P>
" '(As novelists), our power is patience . . . (writing a novel) is a lot like 
inflating a blimp with a bicycle pump. Anyone can do it, all it takes is time.' 
Isn't that a gem?" 
</P>
<P>
Mostly self-taught, Shaw has taken a few writing classes, such as one in 
creative writing from Columbia University Extension. "They didn't do any good," 
he says. "I thought writing was a matter of how much you knew, but it's about 
having to do it. If you don't have that fire in the belly, you won't do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Though Shaw has no publisher for his novel, he does have an agent, the Scott 
Meredith Literary Agency in New York City, which represents such notables as 
Norman Mailer, Carl Sagan and Arthur C. Clarke. Jack Scovil, editorial director 
at Meredith, is "enthusiastic" both about placing Shaw's book with a large 
publishing house, and about Shaw's work in general. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what he has written in the past, we think he's a marvelous writer, 
particularly his dry wit and verbal play," says Scovil. "He's a fascinating man 
who can really bring to bear the embodiment of the era . . . he's demonstrated 
all of the talents of doing a top-notch novel." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, whose brown eyes shine with a lively sparkle, has been reading 
voraciously since he was 8 and took his first shot at writing a book when he 
was 24. He saw it as a way out of the public life of a celebrity that came with 
his fame in the music business. "I'm by nature a kind of insulated, private 
person and (writing) was something I could do alone, and might be able to make 
a living at," he's said. 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't happened yet, and Shaw, to his pleasure, still makes a very good 
living from his music. "Hell, that's very gratifying. I'm a hustler. I'll take 
the money wherever it is," he cracks, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Born Arthur Arshawsky in Manhattan in 1910, Shaw was raised in New Haven, 
Conn., and left home at 15 -- "I didn't like it there" is all he'll say about 
his early departure. He began to work almost immediately and by age 23 was one 
of the most in-demand studio musicians in New York. In 1934, he retired to 
Bucks County, Pa., to try writing, but soon returned to the music business, 
gaining some attention in 1935 with "Interlude in B Flat," a tune he performed 
with a small jazz band and a string quartet. 
</P>
<P>
This unusual instrumentation didn't pan out, so Shaw formed a more conventional 
big band of saxes, trombones, trumpets and rhythm. In 1938, when he recorded a 
Jerry Gray arrangement of Cole Porter's "Begin the Beguine," Shaw struck pay 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
The tune was a smash hit and Shaw became a superstar. "I was Elvis. I was 
making $60,000 a week and that was 1938 dollars," he says with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw loved music and was unquestionably a remarkable musician -- in his book 
"The Swing Era," Gunther Schuller calls him a "real master of the clarinet, 
virtually incomparable in the beauty of his tone and unique in his flawless 
control." But he had no affinity for the fame that accompanied his rise to 
stardom. "The public is constantly intruding on your privacy. It's something 
you don't know will happen until it does, and then you're not prepared for it," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1938 and 1954, Shaw quit music several times, for both mental and 
physical health reasons. One thing that caused him to quit was that he wanted 
to play something new and different, while his public was constantly hungry for 
his hits, which included "Frenesi," "Stardust" and "Summit Ridge Drive." "I 
could never understand why people wanted to dance to my music," he says. "I 
made it good enough to listen to." 
</P>
<P>
He put his clarinet down for the last time -- he still plays a bit of piano, 
but not in public -- "because I didn't want to play it anymore -- I wanted to 
play this," pointing at his MacIntosh. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw doesn't talk much about music -- he would rather talk about ideas. But 
when he does, it's with the same grit and enthusiasm with which he takes on any 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
For example, consider the word jazz. "Jazz, what is jazz, what are they talking 
about?" he asks with ire. "It's a bad word. I'd rather call it American 
Informal Music, as opposed to European Formal Music." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his supposed rivalry with Benny Goodman, Shaw says, "It's like 
trying to compare Picasso and Braque. Benny, who was every bit as dedicated as 
I was, wanted to be an instrumentalist -- he was a superb technician -- while I 
wanted to be a musician. I think my mind was more complex than his. It 
certainly is now," he adds with a robust laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw's tastes run toward European composers, from Mozart and Beethoven to 
Schoenberg and Bartok. He does like some "jazz," such as Lester Young and Bix 
Beiderbecke, but has little time for boppers like Charlie Parker. "I've heard 
enough of that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
What's his reaction when hears one of his hits, like "Begin the Beguine"? "Ho . 
. . hum," he says. "That doesn't mean I don't like it or I don't respect it. We 
did a very good job at that time. I certainly wouldn't do it that way now." 
</P>
<P>
A typical Shaw day begins at 7 a.m. "First I breathe," he jokes, then he takes 
a brisk one-mile walk, then shower, a breakfast of coffee -- "one cup" -- toast 
and then work on his book. Later, after lunch, he reads. (He's currently 
tackling Richard S. Westfall's "Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton," 
Bertrand Russell's "A History of Western Philosophy" and David Dunaway's 
"Huxley in Hollywood.") Then it's back to the Mac, or maybe a little social 
life -- "though I'm pretty antisocial these days. You can't get anything done 
unless you are." 
</P>
<P>
Notorious for his eight marriages -- Turner, Gardner, Elizabeth Kern (daughter 
of Jerome Kern), Kathleen Windsor (author of "Forever Amber") and Evelyn Keyes, 
among them -- Shaw has no patience for the institution. "It's completely 
outmoded," he says, but does admit to still liking the ladies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm seeing one now, and it's working out pretty well," he says. "We're keeping 
a journal. That's something new." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw figures an epitaph he gave to Who's Who in America pretty well sums up his 
life: "He did the best he could with the material at hand." He smiles 
mischievously, then adds, "Another good one would be, 'Go away.' "

<P>
BEHIND BURMA'S ENCHANTING FACADE, A POLICE STATE TIGHTENS THE SCREWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
THERE IS A SURREAL and, at the same time, ethereal quality to Burma's capital 
city of Rangoon. At dawn, Buddhist monks in rust- or wine-colored robes fan out 
through the city, walking from house to house with shiny, black-lacquered 
begging bowls, silently accepting offerings of rice or fish. They pass through 
streets and parks where palm readers and astrologers unlock the secrets of 
life, where snake oil salesmen and sundry merchants of miracles patiently 
minister to their customers. Throngs of women and children -- their faces 
decorated with smears of yellow makeup made from thanaka bark -- and men in 
striped or checked skirtlike longyis press along crowded sidewalks covered with 
cheap black-market goods. 
</P>
<P>
Rangoon -- and much of Burma -- has the look of an object that has recently 
been removed from a time capsule. Book stalls display texts dating back 40 
years and magazines of only slightly more recent vintage. The satellite dish 
has yet to arrive, and neither has McDonald's. For a capital of more than 2 
million people, there are relatively few automobiles and no skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
Central Rangoon is a spectacular quilt of British colonial buildings painted 
from a dizzying palette of pastels. The tallest building, the 32-story 
Shwedagon Pagoda, looms above the city from Singuttara Hill to the north. A 
massive, bell-shaped, 11th-Century Buddhist shrine, the Shwedagon is said to 
embody the essence of the Burmese soul. It is surrounded by several acres of 
smaller stupas, pavilions and animist icons -- man-eating ogres, lions, 
crocodiles, sphinxes and Buddhas too numerous to count -- "glistening with its 
gold," wrote Somerset Maugham, "like a sudden hope in the dark night of the 
soul." Amid such fantastical sights and against the country's overwhelming 
natural beauty, a visitor may at first be oblivious to the other Burma. But 
behind the country's exotic backdrop, there is a claustrophobic, enervating and 
frequently vicious police state. "This country," one Western diplomat observed, 
"is a fascist Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
Less than two years ago, Burma's military ruthlessly suppressed a nationwide 
pro-democracy movement that came close to toppling Gen. Ne Win's 26-year-old 
dictatorship. During seven months of demonstrations starting in March, 1988, an 
estimated 1,000 people died in Rangoon; as many as 5,000 perished nationwide. 
Thousands of civil servants, pro-democracy activists and students were 
imprisoned; many were tortured. Thousands more fled to Burma's borders with 
Thailand and China, where they joined about 25,000 armed ethnic insurgents 
waging an inauspicious war against the 200,000-member Burmese army. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the unrest in Burma no longer boils up in massive public demonstrations 
but instead seethes in private. Nevertheless, the crackdown has not ended, and 
Burma -- by government fiat now called Myanmar -- is a country where people are 
arrested for imagined crimes and held without charge or trial, where it is 
illegal to criticize the government and its leaders and where nearly everyone 
is, privately, critical of the government and hence anyone is fair game. 
</P>
<P>
Even the concessions offered to the pro-democracy movement do little more than 
divert attention from the tightened state control. Next week, on May 27, the 
government will sponsor a general election for a constitutional assembly -- the 
first multiparty election in 30 years. Virtually everyone believes that it will 
be an unmitigated fraud. But even if the vote is fair, there is little doubt 
that the current government will stay in control since it has the power to 
ensure that any representative assembly will remain impotent. 
</P>
<P>
Many Burmese may still hope that the election will lead to a new government, 
but the past two years of brutal repression have intimidated most people and 
left them resigned to the fact that little is likely to change. "People are 
very afraid," a monk told me in Mandalay, in central Burma. In Rangoon (now 
known as Yangon), a laundryman asked me what I thought of Burma. When I told 
him, lamely, that I liked it very much, he courteously but firmly admonished 
me. He said, "Here we have no freedom." And in a small confectioner's shop, a 
merchant whispered to me, "This country is very dangerous, very dangerous." As 
he spoke, he looked furtively about and politely asked me to leave. 
</P>
<P>
AMID THE IDEOLOGUES, mass murderers, goons, kleptomaniacs and madmen, the 
pantheon of 20th-Century dictators surely will include 79-year-old Ne Win. Born 
Shu Maung, he took the name Bo Ne Win ("Bright Sun") when he became one of the 
so-called Thirty Comrades who were given military training by the Japanese 
during World War II. The Thirty Comrades were leaders of Burma's nationalist 
independence movement, which came into its own in the 1920s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1948, the British departed from their crown colony, and Burma plunged into 
an enormously destructive civil war in which the army of the Karen ethnic 
minority nearly overthrew the government. During the decade that followed 
independence, the nation was thrown into near chaos. Thus, when Ne Win seized 
power in a coup in 1962, many Burmese welcomed military rule. Burmese 
nationalists believed that the country needed time to exorcise demons left 
behind after decades of colonialism and time to create an identity without 
foreign interference. But by the spring of 1988, the Burmese people concluded 
that the dictatorship had long since lost any claim to legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
Like other tyrants, Ne Win had one standard for the nation and another for 
himself. He advocated a return to traditional values and established Buddhism 
as the national religion, but he has never overcome his own reputation as a 
gambler and womanizer. (Ne Win has married seven times, twice to the same 
woman.) 
</P>
<P>
Ne Win slammed Burma's doors to the outside world and implemented an inept 
brand of socialism that quickly destroyed the most promising economy in 
Southeast Asia. His government championed a nationalism riddled with racism and 
xenophobia. Among the Burman majority, it nurtured hatred of the Karen, Mon, 
Shan and other ethnic groups living near Burma's borders. And the government 
seized the property of the entrepreneurial Chinese and Indians, expelling 
hundreds of thousands of the latter from the country. 
</P>
<P>
Ne Win surrounded himself with military men who knew nothing about running a 
complex bureaucracy or economy. He bought their loyalty at a premium, providing 
them with special subsidies, rations and private shops that allow officers to 
live far better than ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Reclusive and superstitious, the balding, bespectacled Ne Win is a product of a 
culture more attuned to mysticism and magic than to the Western systems 
inherited from the British. He made fundamental economic decisions after 
consulting astrologers and betrayed a range of eccentricities that defy easy 
categorization. He summarily ordered motorists to drive on the right rather 
than the left side of the road to neutralize a rightist threat to his 
government. In August, 1988, he tried to counteract the anti-government 
protests through a ceremonial marriage to and honeymoon with a 25-year-old 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Fascinated by numerology, Ne Win believes that the number 9 has extraordinary 
powers. After devaluing most of the country's currency in September, 1987, he 
ordered new notes issued in denominations of 45 and 90 (4 + 5 = 9). Many 
government events have been scheduled for dates that are based on the number 9, 
including the May 27 election. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons behind the 1988 upheaval were the very fabric of Ne Win's rule. But 
if a single incident were to be identified, it would probably be the 
government's decision to demonetize the currency. Over night, more than half of 
the country's bank notes became worthless. Many Burmese saw their savings wiped 
out. Students awoke to learn that their tuition money had evaporated. The 
devaluation led to a student rampage in Rangoon, but it was quickly stifled as 
the government closed the universities and sent students home to the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the trigger for the broad-based movement was a largely apolitical 
incident in March, 1988 -- a brawl between students from the recently reopened 
Rangoon Institute of Technology and a handful of drunks over the kind of music 
to be played in a local tea shop. The next day, when the students learned that 
one of their assailants was the son of a local Ne Win functionary, they 
attempted to lodge a protest with the official. After their request was turned 
down, they proceeded to destroy his office. This series of events led to a 
march by hundreds of students and a confrontation with the riot police, who 
opened fire on the students, killing one and fatally wounding six others. One 
group of protesters was herded into a police van for several hours; 41 people 
suffocated. 
</P>
<P>
Between March and August, Rangoon and other major cities were rocked by 
demonstrations, general strikes and government reprisals. On March 16, riot 
police fired on a student demonstration in Rangoon, killing an estimated 200 
people. The same day, they reportedly gang-raped three young girls. Later in 
the week, the government again closed the universities after arresting more 
than 1,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those released told of beatings and torture. Students described cells 
packed with hundreds of people in which it was impossible to sit or lie down 
and recounted interrogations during which they were forced to kneel on sharp 
pebbles or crouch in an unnatural "motorcycle" position for hours on end. 
</P>
<P>
As demonstrations spread throughout the country, the government seemed to bend 
to the public will. In July, Ne Win resigned from what was then the country's 
sole political party. But any hope for change was crushed when his replacement, 
Sein Lwin, was announced. Widely known as The Butcher because of his role in 
suppressing the university demonstrations, Sein Lwin imposed martial law on 
Aug. 3. On Aug. 8, 1988 -- or 8/8/88 as it's known -- a general strike brought 
Rangoon to a standstill. Tens of thousands of people marched in the streets. 
Shortly before midnight, the army shot at unarmed demonstrators in front of the 
city's centrally located Bandoola Park. The government claimed that only five 
people were killed, but foreign diplomats said the death toll ran into the 
hundreds. Burmese now refer to Bandoola Park as "our Tian An Men Square." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, government troops shot doctors and nurses who were treating 
wounded demonstrators at Rangoon General Hospital. The same day, enraged 
civilians beheaded several policemen. During this mayhem, Sein Lwin resigned 
and was replaced by Maung Maung, author of a flattering biography of Ne Win. 
General strikes and massive demonstrations culminated Sept. 18 in yet another 
change in government. 
</P>
<P>
In a carefully orchestrated coup, the government was reorganized under a 
military junta called the State Law and Order Restoration Council. Better known 
by its acronym, SLORC, it designated as chairman another Ne Win loyalist, army 
chief-of-staff Gen. Saw Maung. Meanwhile, Ne Win had all but disappeared from 
public view, although he was widely believed to be calling the shots, Oz-like, 
from behind the curtain. 
</P>
<P>
The SLORC embarked on a campaign of propaganda and intimidation designed to 
re-establish the authority if not the legitimacy of the country's oligarchy. 
"They did not appoint a respectable civilian facade government," one Western 
diplomat told me in Rangoon. "Rather, they chose to harass, arrest and shoot 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Today in Rangoon (the name means "end of strife") and other major cities, 
arrests have come to be expected, and unexplained disappearances are not 
unheard of. A 10 p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfew remains in effect. Outdoor gatherings of 
more than five people are still banned. Burma's universities remain closed. One 
professor I spoke to said faculty members are required to report to work every 
day even though there are no classes, just so the government can keep tabs on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Public demonstrations have been reduced to hit-and-run actions by small groups 
of students. The only people who feel safe to speak freely are children, who 
shout anti-government slogans and destroy pictures of Ne Win in school. One 
10-year-old boy told me his classmates shout "We want democracy" every day. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's father is stoical about the children's outspokenness. "What are they 
going to do?" he asked. "Shoot them?" 
</P>
<P>
TO AN OUTSIDER, the most visible manifestation of the military junta's presence 
has been the construction of hundreds of red billboards blaring SLORC 
pronouncements in English and Burmese. They read like the tirades of a 
Stalinist graffiti artist. "Only when there is discipline will there be 
progress," says the 20-foot-long sign in front of Bandoola Park. At the 
entrance to Shwemawdaw Pagoda, built 1,000 years ago to house two hairs of the 
Buddha, a billboard carries the ominous message, "Crush all destructive 
elements." 
</P>
<P>
There is another sign of the SLORC's rule, which most visitors to Burma would 
probably not see -- a massive demolition and relocation program in which no 
less than 100,000 of the country's poorest people have been forced from their 
homes. Some estimates put the total number of people evicted as high as 
350,000. Often moved in the middle of the night to places miles away from their 
jobs and relatives, these people use what little income they have to pay for 
new homes and increased transportation costs. In a report on the evictions in 
Rangoon, the government-run Working People's Daily explained: "We are setting 
up new satellite towns with a view to providing homes to those who do not have 
houses of their own and to turning the city into a modern one." 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to depopulate the cities," a Western diplomat told me, 
"especially of those who were most vehement in the (1988) protests." 
</P>
<P>
I saw one of the satellite towns outside the city of Taunggyi, northeast of 
Rangoon: rows of one-room, barracks-style shacks set along unpaved roads. A 
civil servant told me that 3,000 people were forced to move there during the 
monsoon season. Six months later, these homes still had no water or 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat who saw an evacuated community in Rangoon said "it looked like 
a war zone." He said anyone who refuses to move is arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economy under the SLORC has gone from bad to worse. The 
inflation rate is as high as 50%; the price of rice quadrupled between 1988 and 
1989, and the possibility of another devaluation discourages people who have 
money to deposit it in banks. As a result, there is almost no money to invest 
or to pay off the $5 billion foreign debt. The only thing that has kept Burma's 
economy afloat is a thriving black market. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Burmese government has done its best to root out its enemies, it 
remains surrounded by them. In fact, had Ne Win deliberately set out to 
alienate every man, woman and child in his country, he hardly could have done a 
better job. 
</P>
<P>
At a party in Rangoon, my host surveyed friends gathered in his living room, 
turned to me and said, "You know, we're all government employees here." Then he 
shook his fist in my face and added, "And we're all against the government." 
</P>
<P>
Another Burmese told me that all her countrymen hate the government. When I 
related her comment to another man and asked what he thought about it, he 
smiled and said, "I like to hear that, but I don't dare to speak it." In a 
rural village, a doctor complained to me about his low salary and the lack of 
medicine to treat his patients. "Ninety-nine percent of the people want a 
change of government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For most Burmese, hope rests on the death of Ne Win or a military coup. While 
the SLORC has been preparing for an election that, theoretically, will pave the 
way for a return to a parliamentary system, it is difficult to take the 
election seriously. A recent editorial in the Working People's Daily claimed 
that "the election commission is taking all necessary measures to make sure 
that the election to be held is just and fair." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the "necessary measures" taken since the unrest in 1988 include 
imprisoning or placing under house arrest the three most popular opposition 
leaders, all of whom have been banned from participating in the election; 
arresting more than 4,000 anti-government demonstrators and prohibiting 
speeches or campaign literature that "denigrate or impair the dignity" of the 
ruling junta. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anyone who believes in the election," a diplomat told me. A 
businessman in Mandalay at first disagreed: "After the election," he said, 
"things will get better." But after a long pause, he modified his prediction: 
"Either they will get better or they will get worse." 
</P>
<P>
WHEN DISCUSSING elections, the Burmese agree on only one thing: In a free and 
fair election for a new head of state, a 44-year-old woman named Aung San Suu 
Kyi would win by a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
Elegant, self-possessed and thoughtful, Suu Kyi was nonetheless an unlikely 
candidate to challenge the dictatorship. She left the country at age 15, 
married an Englishman and returned to Burma in 1988 to care for her dying 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
Suu Kyi proved to be not only a forceful politician but also a powerful symbol. 
She is the daughter of Gen. Aung San, founder of the Burmese army, a leader of 
the Thirty Comrades and a man revered as the father of Burmese independence. 
Aung San was assassinated in 1947 when Suu Kyi was an infant. Today, his statue 
stands near the Shwedagon Pagoda, and the anniversary of his death is 
celebrated every year as Martyrs' Day. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 demonstrations, thousands of protesters carried posters of Aung 
San, and this outpouring of respect for her father, along with a continuing 
lack of leadership among the protesters, no doubt helped persuade Suu Kyi to 
enter the public arena. She made her first appearance on Aug. 26 at the 
Shwedagon Pagoda, delivering a speech to a crowd of a million people. "I could 
not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to all that was going on," she 
said. "This national crisis could, in fact, be called the second struggle for 
independence." Suu Kyi's speech catapulted her to the forefront of the 
pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
During the next 10 months, Suu Kyi toured the country, making bold speeches in 
which she attacked Ne Win by name, calling the dictator a megalomaniac who 
would do anything to hold on to power. In a country where most people were 
afraid to speak out, Suu Kyi was fearless. She said Ne Win continued to control 
what she called the fascist junta, blamed the dictator for ruining Burma's 
economy and called on the military to overthrow him. 
</P>
<P>
Despite constant government efforts to intimidate her and the ban on 
demonstrations, Suu Kyi drew crowds of thousands. In one famous incident, an 
army captain ordered his men to shoot her as she led a group of supporters down 
a street. Suu Kyi told her followers to remain behind while she walked on to 
confront the soldiers alone. As she approached, a major intervened and 
rescinded the order to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
A short distance from Suu Kyi's home in Rangoon, the junta has erected a 
billboard that carries the inscription: "Anyone who gets riotous, destructive 
and unruly is our enemy." Suu Kyi has not seen the billboard, and there is 
little danger that she will get out of control. Since July, she has been under 
house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Like Corazon Aquino in the Philippines in 1986, Suu Kyi has become the leading 
symbol for change in Burma. Precisely what sort of change she would bring about 
is unclear. But to most people, it makes no difference -- Suu Kyi stands for 
democracy, the dictatorship does not. She is its antithesis and its nemesis. 
"Aung San Suu Kyi is like a goddess," said one Rangoon resident. "Her name is 
like magic." 
</P>
<P>
IN THE ABSENCE of any perceptible avenue of change within the system, between 
4,000 and 7,000 Burmese -- mostly students -- have fled the cities and the 
interior to join the ethnic insurgent armies camped in the mountains and 
jungles along Burma's borders. All told, there are about 25,000 ethnic 
insurgents arrayed against the Burmese army, including members of the Karen, 
Kachin, Shan and Mon tribes. All these groups say they want autonomy, and all 
have been fighting a low-grade civil war with the government and, at times, 
among themselves, for decades. 
</P>
<P>
In camps on Burma's eastern frontier with Thailand, students occupy hastily 
contrived wood shelters patched with sheets of newspaper and plastic. There are 
no mosquito nets, and nearly everyone suffers from malaria. In one camp, I 
watched teen-agers in ragged, sun-bleached clothing undergoing rudimentary 
military training, using bamboo sticks for guns. Few of the students have 
weapons, and it is unlikely they will get them soon. 
</P>
<P>
The newcomers at the borders are there because they believe they have no other 
choice. At home, they faced arrest or worse. Aung Naing Oo is typical. A 
third-year student at the University of Rangoon, he spoke to me at Manerplaw, 
headquarters of the 5,000- to 8,000-member Karen National Liberation Army. Aung 
Naing Oo said he fled to the Thai border and joined the revolution in 
September, 1988, just before the pro-democracy movement was put down. He said 
his family does not know where he is. "I sent a message before I left that I 
was going underground," he said. Aung Naing Oo said he wanted to overthrow the 
military regime and achieve democracy. 
</P>
<P>
When I asked him what he meant by democracy, he replied, "People talk 
democracy, democracy, democracy, but they don't know exactly what it is." He 
told me he only became aware of its meaning during the demonstrations when he 
looked the word up in a dictionary. "We are learning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When I suggested that he and his colleagues faced an impossible struggle, he 
replied: "Everybody knows that, but we have to hope. If somebody doesn't have 
hope, he doesn't come here." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt most Burmese wish the students well. But during the past few months, a 
major military offensive has routed thousands of students from their camps. 
They have joined the 40,000 Burmese refugees already in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
The situation for the ethnic rebels is almost as bleak. I happened to be at a 
Karen camp when the Burmese attacked, using heavy mortars. The rebels, 
outmanned and outgunned, retreated in less than 24 hours. No fewer than five 
other Karen camps have fallen during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel leaders say these defeats are not significant. Gen. Bo Mya, president of 
the Karen National Union -- the political arm of the Karen rebel army -- 
insists that he is involved in a guerrilla war and that his men can simply move 
to new locations and continue fighting. But the Karen finance their war by 
controlling the lucrative teak trade, as well as by extorting taxes from 
merchants moving goods in and out of Burma. Lower-level officials within the 
union acknowledge that the recent string of defeats has had a devastating 
effect on Karen resources. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a thin silver lining to the otherwise bleak picture of the 
students' and rebels' resistance. Their alliance is a first in Burma, where for 
40 years the Burman population has been taught by Ne Win that the Karen and 
other border groups are barbarians. While the rebel groups have no explicit 
alliance with the leading opposition parties in the country, their goals, broad 
though they may be, are virtually identical. Taken together, the rebel and 
student opposition at the border combined with the barely legal opposition in 
Burma represent a pro-democratic alternative to the SLORC. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tu Jai, a leader of the Kachin Independence Organization, which 
fields an 8,000-member army: "There are two sides (in Burma), the government 
side and the people's side. And the government is already isolated, so this is 
a very good condition for us to overthrow the regime." 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE TU JAI'S assessment, Burma watchers in Rangoon and outside the country 
say the rebels are in no better position to get rid of Ne Win than are the 
voters in next week's election. In fact, the scenarios for change in Burma are 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
For the rebels to succeed, they would need massive foreign assistance. None is 
on the horizon. For the democratic opposition, on the other hand, the issue is 
survival. The opposition can endure only if there is continued economic and 
diplomatic pressure on the dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario heard and discussed most frequently is a rebellion within the 
armed forces -- salvation by the very people who suppressed the pro-democracy 
movement. One ex-member of the Burmese air force, now in a Karen rebel camp, 
told me that there are many in the military "who want a revolution, who are 
ready to participate in a coup." But only a few dozen soldiers have actually 
defected. 
</P>
<P>
A Burmese civil servant takes a slightly more optimistic view: "The military is 
sitting on the fence." he said, "They are waiting to see which way things go." 
This man and others say there will be no coup until there is the necessary 
catalyst -- such as another round of massive public demonstrations in which the 
armed forces are again called on to shoot innocent civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Many Burmese hope the May election will be that catalyst -- that the 
anticipated fraud will provoke people to take to the streets and that the next 
time citizens stand up for democracy, a sizable faction of the military will 
stand beside them. In the meantime, the SLORC appears determined to perpetuate 
Ne Win's dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
In the shadow of the Shwedagon Pagoda, the Burmese government that is too broke 
to provide sewers or clean water for most of its citizens has been engaged in a 
costly construction project for the past six years. Under orders from Ne Win, 
it is building the Pagoda of the Great Victory -- a substantial, as yet 
ungilded stupa, crowned with precious stones, that rises from a dusty 
construction site at the foot of Singuttara Hill. Following the example of 
Burma's ancient kings, it is the aging dictator's wish to someday be laid to 
rest in this pagoda. Most Burmese hope that Ne Win's wish will be granted soon. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Ne Win's tomb, the SLORC has come up with money for one other 
less grandiose construction project in Rangoon. It has built a thick, turreted 
wall, painted maroon and punctuated every few yards with gun slits, that runs 
along a main thoroughfare and loops around the ministry of defense. "It's a 
shooting gallery if anything happens," one Western diplomat suggests. Remarked 
another, "While the walls are coming down in Europe, they are going up in 
Rangoon."
