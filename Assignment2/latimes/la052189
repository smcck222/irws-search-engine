<TEXT>
<P>
Sixteen Candles (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) is an uneasy mix of the 
sympathetic and the synthetic, the raucous and the racist -- pity poor Gedde 
Watanabe, cast as a sex-starved Chinese exchange student. It also asks us to 
believe that an entire family would forget Molly Ringwald's 16th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
With Red Dawn (Channel 5 Sunday at 8 p.m.) John Milius convinces us that a 
full-scale Soviet invasion could happen here, only to settle for making a cheap 
rabble-rouser. Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen play high school resisters to 
Red rule. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hammer: Murder Takes All (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) finds Stacy Keach's Hammer 
kidnaped, drugged and parachuted into the Nevada desert outside Las Vegas -- 
and that's just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), another 
new TV movie, tells of the baby rescued from an abandoned well in Texas in 
1987. Roxana Zal and Will Oldham play her young parents. 
</P>
<P>
Footloose (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is not particularly inventive, but it 
does have two jaw-dropping musical turns and Kevin Bacon in an electrifying 
star turn as a Chicago hipster who clashes with small-town pastor John Lithgow. 
</P>
<P>
I Know My First Name Is Steven (NBC Monday and Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is a new 
four-hour, two-part TV movie about the boy who was kidnaped in Northern 
California at age 7 and who escaped at 14. Steven is played by Luke Edwards and 
Corin (Corky) Nemec; Arliss Howard plays his kidnaper. 
</P>
<P>
In Weird Science (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), another John Hughes illustrated 
teen-age daydream, Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith conjure up a 
computer-built dream woman, played by Kelly Le Brock -- to her credit -- as if 
she were real. 
</P>
<P>
Revenge of the Nerds (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a delicious, gratifying 
underdog fantasy starring Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is that sparkling 1981 screwball comedy 
with Dudley Moore, John Gielgud and Liza Minnelli; you may have problems with 
the fact that Moore's millionaire is inarguably an alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
Of Channel 5's week of youth flicks, the winner is Martha Coolidge's Valley 
Girl (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), starring Nicolas Cage as working-class 
Hollywood High Romeo and Deborah Foreman in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
Meatballs (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a pleasantly raunchy summer camp 
comedy with Bill Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line (Channel 28 Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is one film 
that uncontestably has made a difference. On the one hand, it's a demanding 
experiment in which an ultra-cool neo-film noir style is brought to bear on the 
documentary form -- and most likely why it wasn't Oscar-nominated -- and on the 
other, a brief for a miscarriage of justice so persuasive that it succeeded in 
getting Randall Dale Adams sprung from a Texas prison after serving 12 years 
for a murder he always claimed he never committed. 
</P>
<P>
The Revenge of the Stepford Wives (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a TV movie 
in every way superior to its big-screen original, a horror fable which imagines 
the worst possible backlash to women's liberation on the part of the 
beleaguered American male. 
</P>
<P>
Bustin' Loose (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) finds paroled convict Richard Pryor 
obliged to drive teacher Cicely Tyson's eight emotionally disturbed kids 
cross-country; this 1981 comedy is uneven but ingratiating. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Selleck is perfectly cast as a World War I flying ace caught up in an 
adventure-filled 1920 race against the clock from Istanbul to Afghanistan in 
High Road to China (CBS Friday at 9 p.m.). Bess Armstrong is equally well cast 
as Selleck's beautiful, resourceful leading lady. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad Zorro, the Gay Blade (Channel 9 Saturday at 8 p.m.) isn't as funny as 
George Hamilton is in his dual role as the foppish son of the legendary Zorro 
and his gay twin brother. 
</P>
<P>
Gallipoli (Channel 13 Saturday at 10 p.m.), director Peter Weir and writer 
David Williamson's sweeping, splendid World War I saga, stars Mark Lee and Mel 
Gibson as two young soldiers whose loss of innocence in battle represents 
Australia's own loss of innocence.

FIVE WEATHERMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE; 
</P>
<P>
THE EXPERTS AT SCRIPPS ARE TRYING TO PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE ULTIMATE 
HEAT WAVE HITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROGERS, Michael Rogers is a novelist and a senior writer for 
Newsweek. His most recent novel, Forbidden Sequence, is about human genetic 
engineering. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CONSIDER THE WEATHERMAN: clown prince of the evening news, perpetually ribbed 
by jovial anchors for once again failing to predict last Saturday's downpour. 
But there is a new class of weathermen at work today, and their gaze is fixed 
not on next weekend but next century. Theirs is a one-time, 
never-to-be-repeated forecast, not quite yet ready for prime time. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it looks like bad news. But how bad? And how certain? Among themselves, 
the new weathermen are already clearing their throats nervously. Trouble, they 
agree, almost certainly lies ahead. But one problem remains: What, exactly, do 
they tell the rest of us? 
</P>
<P>
The villain is the greenhouse effect, a phenomenon now making headlines that in 
fact has existed for millions of years. And a good thing, too: The greenhouse 
effect is the planet's mantle of gases, primarily carbon dioxide, that traps 
the sun's heat, as do greenhouse windows. Without that insulation, our planet 
would be about 50 degrees cooler, and the Beach Boys would sing about ice 
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
But we may yet curse the greenhouse effect, for humans are gradually increasing 
the heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere by burning coal and oil. At the same 
time, we're destroying the tropical rain forests that in ages past helped 
remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. By increasing 
our insulation, we will probably raise temperatures to record highs. The 
augmented greenhouse effect could unleash floods, droughts, hurricanes, 
famines, runaway weed growth, mass extinctions of animals and plants and the 
generalized end of life-as-we-know-it. All this, moreover, could happen within 
the life span of anyone who can remember "The Brady Bunch." 
</P>
<P>
The disasters haven't started yet. But this exceedingly gradual threat has 
already changed the lives of many researchers who previously toiled in obscure 
scientific pastures. This is a story about five of them -- two who launched the 
greenhouse theory decades ago, and three others who are building careers on the 
concept. All work at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, but their 
disciplines vary -- atmospheric chemist, meteorologist, geophysicist. One 
manipulates imaginary models within computers, another ships bottles of air 
halfway around the world. But all of them are also now weathermen of the 
apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
RICHARD SOMERVILLE hesitates. As head of Scripps' Climate Research Group, he 
stands at the forefront of international climatology -- weather on the grand 
scale. A visitor has just asked what seems a simple question: Is greenhouse 
warming already changing our weather? Somerville is momentarily gazing out the 
window. Tan and fit in his mid-40s, he has a mildly aristocratic air and a 
corner office that overlooks an expanse of beach. On this spring morning, the 
fog has lifted and the Pacific is an ideal shimmering blue, dotted with 
surfers, a few of them Scripps researchers. This is a campus replete with wet 
suits, surfboards and offices with towel-bars. But it's no party school: 
Scripps, officially part of UC San Diego, was instrumental in turning 
oceanography, once a rich man's hobby, into an accepted science. Scripps was 
also the birthplace of the greenhouse warming theory. 
</P>
<P>
Today, along with half a dozen other institutions, including MIT and Columbia 
University, Scripps is on the leading edge of trying to predict just what may 
lie ahead. "Let me put it this way," Somerville says finally. "There's no 
disagreement in the scientific community: The greenhouse effect is a problem. 
We differ on the warming we expect, how quickly it will occur and how it will 
be distributed over the earth. But there's remarkable unanimity that it's a 
very, very real problem." 
</P>
<P>
A brief sampler of worst-case scenarios: If global temperatures indeed rise 
during the next few decades and polar icecaps begin to melt, by 2050 ocean 
levels could threaten the homes of 40 million coastal residents worldwide. 
Manhattan might require levees to hold back the tides; Malibu would be a 
disaster zone. Persistent drought would cripple the corn and wheat belts of the 
United States. Chicago would overlook acres of mud that had once been Lake 
Michigan. Northern California would suffer severe spring floods and summer 
parching. As the Colorado River basin dried, Los Angeles would find its water 
supply cut by half. 
</P>
<P>
Somerville doesn't like to talk about global disaster. He was trained as a 
traditional meteorologist, specializing in weather prediction: showers on 
Thursday, clear for the weekend. "But," he says, "my interest just grew, from 
tomorrow's weather, to next week's, to the next season's climate, to the 
decades-long scale of the greenhouse effect." 
</P>
<P>
Now Somerville oversees a research group totaling 25 people, a clutch of costly 
computers and joint projects that involve laboratories from Los Alamos to 
Hamburg. The Climate Research Group studies topics ranging from next winter's 
precipitation to predicting the onset of the Indian monsoon. "Climate," 
Somerville says, "is the sum total of weather. For me, the dividing line is 
around a few weeks -- that turns out to be the scientific limit on how far one 
can hope to predict the weather in a specific place." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Scripps researchers gaze into the next century. They are trying 
to answer two fundamental questions. One is about the greenhouse effect itself: 
How did carbon dioxide cycle through the oceans, green plants and living 
organisms during the eons before humans started burning coal and oil? The 
second, broader question: How will increasing global temperatures affect our 
climate? This second question requires some notion of how the vast machine of 
planetary weather works to begin with. Not for the first time, humans are 
desperately trying to understand natural phenomena even as we are in the midst 
of altering them. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a single copy of the Journal of Atmospheric Sciences is as thick as a 
year's worth of issues from 1962, when Somerville started his work. But each 
year of science seems to produce as many new uncertainties as answers. For 
example, it's an accepted scientific notion that weather comes from the 
interaction of the atmosphere and the oceans. But the finer details of how air 
and sea interact remain mysterious, and that is why researchers such as 
Somerville pull back from specifics about the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of feedback loops in the climate," he says, "each like a 
thermostat in your house. As our climate gets warmer, they'll come on. They may 
turn on the air conditioner, which is good. But they may turn on the furnace, 
and warm it up even more. And there are a lot of these thermostats, all 
connected to a lot of air conditioners and furnaces. And some thermostats even 
seem to be connected to other thermostats." 
</P>
<P>
Somerville specializes in one thermostat: clouds. As the climate warms, more 
moisture will evaporate from the oceans, and the earth will grow more cloudy. 
But will the clouds reflect solar energy away from the planet and act as an air 
conditioner? Or will the additional water molecules in the atmosphere trap more 
infrared radiation -- behaving like a furnace? No one knows. "Society rightly 
wants to know answers about the greenhouse effect," Somerville says, "but 
sometimes science isn't in the position to provide them. When a congressman 
asks, 'What will the weather be like in my district in the 21st Century?' we 
can't yet give an answer to rely on." 
</P>
<P>
When can he expect one? Somerville hesitates. "With new satellite data and 
faster computers, the uncertainty will decrease. But if we don't understand how 
the climate works in the first place, the fastest computer in the world will 
just be solving erroneous equations more quickly." 
</P>
<P>
ROGER REVELLE knows what it is to overturn erroneous equations. Revelle, 80, 
director emeritus of Scripps and scion of an influential San Diego family, is 
probably the most formally dressed fellow on campus, clad in gray flannel 
slacks and a blue blazer. Revelle is also, for practical purposes, the father 
of the greenhouse warming theory. 
</P>
<P>
Revelle wasn't the first to ponder the topic. Just before the turn of the 
century, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius (whose grandson now teaches at 
Scripps) theorized that human activities might add to the natural greenhouse 
effect. But at the time, scientists believed that the oceans could absorb as 
much carbon dioxide as our factories and fireplaces could pump out. Microscopic 
organisms at the sea's surface absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, then die and 
sink miles to the bottom, where the carbon sits for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, in the mid-1930s, a mild global warming trend was under way, and an 
English scientist named G. S. Callendar warned that greenhouse warming might be 
possible. But then a spell of cold winters ensued, scientists dropped the topic 
and the world happily went about pumping additional billions of tons of CO2into 
the atmosphere for two more decades. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, Revelle and Hans Suess, another Scripps researcher, sounded a caution 
that the ocean wasn't going to bail us out: Only about half of the carbon 
dioxide gets the deep six. In their paper, they observed dryly that, in putting 
back into the atmosphere much of the carbon now stored in such fossil fuels as 
oil and coal, "mankind in spite of itself is conducting a great one-time 
geophysical experiment." Says Revelle: "It did not occur to me that we'd really 
have a serious climatic change. I'm not a prophet. I was a scientist and 
thought we'd learn a lot from it." 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Revelle," Time magazine said, "has not reached the stage of warning 
against this catastrophe, but he and other geophysicists intend to keep 
watching and recording." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, someone was already watching: a young Caltech post-doctoral 
student named Charles Keeling, who had seized upon the then-thorny problem of 
measuring the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Thorny because, according to 
conventional wisdom, CO2concentrations varied widely, depending on when and 
where you took a sample. Keeling, however, was the first to monitor CO2levels 
over a sustained period. In taking measurements from Corona del Mar to the 
White Mountains near Death Valley, he discovered something surprising: The 
amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is really quite constant from one 
place to another. 
</P>
<P>
It was a propitious time for global curiosity. The 1957 International 
Geophysical Year was under way, an ambitious, well-financed international 
effort to learn more about the basics of the planet. Revelle, already 
influential in national science, lobbied hard for the IGY to include 
CO2monitoring and, moreover, helped put the unknown Keeling in charge. Keeling 
set up monitoring stations atop Mauna Loa in Hawaii and at the South Pole, 
choosing locations far from any sources of man-made CO2. He found that even at 
those remote spots, the CO2concentration was very similar to that of 
California's. 
</P>
<P>
Within three years, Keeling's figures would reveal ominous news: The amount of 
CO2in the atmosphere was rising, precisely as feared. Revelle's 1957 warning 
proved correct: The oceans absorb only half the CO2that human activities churn 
out. The "Keeling curve," the smoking gun of the greenhouse effect, is now a 
classic chart in atmospheric chemistry: an undulating but gradually ascending 
line that begins in 1957 and climbs unabated to this day. The fluctuations 
reflect the life cycle of plants in the Northern Hemisphere -- absorbing carbon 
dioxide in the spring, releasing it as they decay in the fall. But the 
relentless ascent is entirely man-made. 
</P>
<P>
The implications are profound. Revelle pulls out a graph that displays average 
global temperatures during the past million years. "The entire temperature 
range from an ice age to the warmest interglacial period is about four degrees. 
That's just about the best estimate for the greenhouse-effect increase also." 
Right now, the earth is in an interglacial period -- it's as warm as it ever 
gets on this planet. When another few degrees are added during the next 50 
years, Revelle says softly, "we're moving the climate into uncharted 
territory." 
</P>
<P>
CHARLES KEELING, a slender, unassuming man of 61, still works in the same small 
laboratory where, three decades ago, he confirmed the encroaching greenhouse 
effect. The laboratory looks its age, with racks of handblown glassware and 
cabinets finished in yellowing oak. Out in the hallway are big wooden shipping 
crates packed with air samples freighted in from sampling stations around the 
globe. "Grab samples," they're called, air captured by hand in glass globes 
slightly smaller than soccer balls, often wrapped in surgical tape. Keeling's 
assistants carefully siphon each globe's contents through an elaborate tracery 
of glass, determining -- in parts per million -- just how much carbon dioxide 
each sample contains. 
</P>
<P>
"The rate of rise," Keeling says, "has actually accelerated during the past 10 
years over what we expected." It may be that increased deforestation of the 
Amazon is already changing the planet's ability to absorb CO2. Or else warming 
in the far north latitudes is melting permafrost, releasing CO2into the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The Keeling curve is now accepted by scientists worldwide. Yet the rise in 
CO2hasn't yet translated itself into a similarly ascending chart of 
temperatures, and that has caused no end of scientific debate. In all 
probability, the complex interactions of atmosphere and ocean, combined with 
the centuries-long natural temperature fluctuation, so far have masked the 
added heating. "Temperature is so variable," Keeling says. "Europe just had a 
very warm winter, the Pacific Northwest had a cold winter. You can't blame them 
both on the greenhouse effect, although the Europeans are suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer's Midwestern drought probably wasn't caused by the greenhouse 
effect either, any more than was the Dust Bowl of the '30s. In Keeling's view, 
serious droughts may be more likely these days because of greenhouse warming, 
but he hesitates to say more. Another Scripps researcher puts it this way: Last 
year's drought, a century ago, might have ended a few days sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, in the midst of the drought, a NASA researcher named James Hansen 
made headlines when he told Congress that he was "99%" certain that greenhouse 
warming had already started. And earlier this month, Hansen told the media that 
the administration had softened additional testimony he was planning to give on 
imminent greenhouse dangers. 
</P>
<P>
For researchers such as Keeling, the public interest caused by Hansen's bold 
statements is encouraging. Early this year, the Bush Administration announced 
increased funding for greenhouse effect studies. But beneath the temporary 
boost lies a deeper fear: What happens when it gets cold again? 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's second move into the limelight already showed the administration's 
reluctance to believe that the worst could happen. And although this decade has 
seen the six warmest years of the past century, with 1987 and 1988 the hottest 
of those, Keeling says that in all likelihood, the world's climate will get 
colder again in the 1990s, perhaps even setting new records for chill winters. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to wait about 20 years," he says, "and then we'll break heat 
records again. The 2010s will be even hotter that the 1980s. There will be 
another whole set of discussions about the greenhouse effect -- and then it 
might get cold again. But then, the next time around, by 2040 or so, the 
greenhouse effect will be upon us again -- in spades." 
</P>
<P>
DAVID ERICKSON, heavy-set, cheerful, looks like a guy with whom you could have 
a few beers and shoot some pool. But at the moment, he's communing with a 
computer terminal, logged on long-distance to a Cray supercomputer somewhere in 
the mountains of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, 28, is of the generation of scientists who will make their 
reputations on the greenhouse effect. Growing up in Rochester, N.Y., he never 
saw the sea until he was 12; then he became fascinated with the ocean and 
atmosphere. His degree is in atmospheric chemistry; ironically, now that he's 
at oceanographers' heaven, he rarely ventures out on research vessels to sample 
the atmosphere. Instead, he captains supercomputers -- the multimillion-dollar 
machines that are the fastest computers on the planet. "I've never been without 
a Cray," he says. He now has accounts on six state-of-the-art supercomputers 
spread across the country. That points up a profound change in the field: When 
Erickson's boss, Richard Somerville, wrote his thesis 25 years ago, he 
struggled to find a few hours on a "supercomputer" less powerful than the Apple 
Macintosh on which he now writes letters. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson's specialty represents the future of weather research: He uses 
supercomputers to run immense mathematical models that simulate the earth's 
weather system. A model is an elaborate computer program, often written by 
several hundred people. The computer code is meant to represent realistically 
the incredibly complex interaction of winds, clouds, temperature, solar 
radiation, ocean cooling and the hundreds of other variables that influence we 
The goal: to create an accurate model of current earth climate, then double the 
COc,6 2 level, sit back and see what happens to the weather in, say, Wichita. 
</P>

But that's easier said than done. If the half a dozen giant weather models 
currently floating around the planet's computer networks have anything in 
common, it is that they aren't very good at modeling the weather. "Some people 
in New York do the solar radiation," Erickson says. "Some other group does the 
clouds, and these people maybe meet each other once a year." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson is one of the few researchers in the country now testing the most 
recent model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research. He's asking the 
computer to predict wind speeds in a particular section of the Pacific Ocean, 
over a "month" that belongs in a Ray Bradbury short story : "perpetual July," a 
mathematical construct made up of nothing but 1,000 July days. Once the 
computer has predicted the wind speeds for perpetual July, Erickson will 
compare the results to Scripps' own records -- 300,000 observations of real 
wind speeds during July. "Data from people on boats," he explains. "Captains 
staring out at sea." 
</P>
<P>
In all likelihood, the model won't match the real numbers, Erickson will write 
a paper describing the discrepancies, and the modelers will make repairs. 
Someday Erickson may write his own model. More likely, he will be part of a 
team that creates a huge model representing both oceans and atmosphere, acting 
together, just as in life -- a model so complex that it will run on half a 
dozen supercomputers, all at once. Such a model could provide the first real 
answers about weather half a century hence -- but will probably not exist until 
well into the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there's a bit of a setback: The Cray in Colorado has rejected Erickson's 
code because of some small error in the program. He shrugs with the 
imperturbability of someone who doesn't mind hacking in FORTRAN and the obscure 
Cray operating system. "It could just be a period in the wrong place. These 
models are so massive, you can't really understand everything that's going on." 
</P>
<P>
ALL WEATHERMEN of the apocalypse understand one aspect of their studies: money. 
Who will fund the long-term research that the greenhouse effect demands? 
Private industry may grow more interested in the topic. After last summer's 
drought dropped the Mississippi River 20 feet and halted barge traffic, a major 
Illinois grain firm invested $36 million in a railroad that parallels the river 
-- for if there is greenhouse warming, the Mississippi might no longer serve to 
ship grain to market. In the Northwest, Weyerhaeuser is already planting 
drought-resistant saplings for harvest in 30 to 60 years. And insurance 
companies -- for whom 40% of casualty and property losses are hurricane-related 
-- have launched programs to determine whether warming might lengthen the 
hurricane season. 
</P>
<P>
But industry funding usually goes toward specific predictions. For the big 
picture, researchers must still rely on the federal government. "There are 
hopeful sounds coming out of Washington," Somerville says, "but we're only 
beginning to see the glimmering of real dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 federal budget proposes $190.5 million for research into the 
greenhouse effect. Unfortunately, that sum is divided among nine federal 
agencies. "It's becoming popular to have these enormous global studies 
programs," says another Scripps researcher. "But sometimes it turns out that 
the amount of energy that goes into the planning is more than the amount that 
actually turns into work." 
</P>
<P>
Keeling is even less optimistic. When he set out to measure CO2on Mauna Loa in 
1957, "it was a time that young scientists could try something out. I suspect 
very much that I wouldn't have succeeded today, because I had only my own data 
telling me I was right." Keeling's own funding is now in doubt, since the 
National Science Foundation isn't enthusiastic about sustaining long-term 
monitoring programs. "They like new discoveries," Keeling says. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, these days, grant money more often goes for computer simulations 
than field research. It can cost $13,000 a day to take a ship out and sample 
CO2in the open ocean; it's far cheaper to let researchers sit at computers. 
Ironically, Keeling's son, a recent Harvard Ph.D., had to scramble for dollars 
to conduct a new kind of atmospheric analysis as speculative as his father 
performed 30 years ago. "Students today," says the elder Keeling, "learn very 
quickly that a career in this area isn't necessarily going to be a comfortable 
life style." But for some younger researchers, the motivation is no longer 
simply scientific curiosity or a stimulating job. "Not to sound corny about 
it," Somerville says, "but we're starting to see students with deeply held 
convictions about doing research that leaves the world a better place." 
</P>
<P>
There is, for example, Justin Lancaster, who, in his mid-30s, is athletic, 
outgoing and looks every bit the ski-racer he was as an undergraduate. A 
Vermont native, he was practicing environmental law when he realized that there 
were bigger fish to fry. "I saw my friends pursuing issues that just weren't 
that important. I wanted to know, 'What's really important?' " In 1980, he rode 
his bicycle from Vermont to San Diego and presented himself at Scripps. With 
little background in science, he was told he'd never get in the front door. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the back door?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few months, he was a volunteer in Charles Keeling's laboratory. His 
first job was to carry the big glass bottles out to the end of the Scripps 
pier, where he stood into the wind, held his breath to keep from adding his own 
carbon dioxide to the sample, removed the stopper and let the local air rush 
in. At the same time, he completed his undergraduate science requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Now Lancaster is within months of earning his doctorate in oceanography. His 
work uses the newest technology -- satellite photographs that give a truly 
global perspective -- to answer a basic question: Just how much carbon dioxide 
do plants and soils use, and is this affected by changing temperatures and 
rainfall? Armed with both doctorate and law degree, Lancaster plans to return 
to public-policy issues. He foresees a day when governments and multinational 
corporations will need experts versed in science -- from acid rain to the 
greenhouse effect -- and who are also willing to write prescriptions for 
planetary recovery, ranging from local restrictions on automobile fuel economy 
to international treaties about the use of coal and oil. 
</P>
<P>
The need looms ever larger. In March, NASA released a shocking photograph from 
last September's Discovery shuttle mission. It showed a dense white smoke 
cloud, 1 million miles square, covering the Amazon basin -- suggesting that the 
extent of forest burning there has been greatly underestimated. Regardless of 
what the United States does, in fact, most of the future greenhouse gases will 
emanate from developing nations, which will inevitably use coal and oil in 
their attempt to match Western living standards. Indeed, two-thirds of the 
world's coal remains in China and the Soviet Union -- which are almost certain 
to burn it. Some cynics point out that the Soviet Union is one nation that 
might gain from a warmer climate. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster is surprisingly optimistic about a career that deals so directly with 
doom. He shrugs. "I was just down at Torrey Pines High School for career day. 
My career was supposed to be saving Mother Earth. And a lot of the students 
sounded pretty pessimistic. But my response was, sure, you can find plenty to 
be pessimistic about. Evolution is change, and change is easy to regret. We're 
losing wilderness. We're losing dirt roads with grass shoulders. We're moving 
to an engineered surface of the earth. If you can't accept that, then you're 
stuck in pessimism. But I'm optimistic about technology being able to give us 
clean air; about governments firming up wilderness protection. I accept 
change." 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, Lancaster sounds strikingly like Roger Revelle, half a century 
his senior, architect of the greenhouse warming theory. "Global change isn't 
something to avoid," Revelle had said earlier that day in his gentle baritone. 
"It's something to recognize and keep from happening too fast. Human beings can 
adapt to anything, if we just have enough time. But almost certainly, some of 
the things we adapt to will shock us." 
</P>
<P>
And Revelle smiled, with the calm that can only come from gazing at the very 
big picture. 
</P>

Although this spring has been widely hailed as the 50th birthday of television, 
the world's most powerful medium was not born in 1939. Indeed, it didn't really 
have a birth, it sort of oozed out in bits and pieces from various laboratories 
and companies over several decades. 
</P>
<P>
Milton Berle appeared on an experimental station in Chicago in 1929. At the 
time, 28 "visual broadcasting" stations had licenses in the United States. In 
1930, a television outfit called Jenkins Broadcasting, using a soon obsolete 
mechanical system, sent out a polyglot of programs to the sets it sold in New 
Jersey. Hollywood put out a speculative film called "Trapped by Television" in 
1936, the same year the British went on the air with scheduled broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
The date of April 30, 1939 -- when President Roosevelt was shown on TV opening 
the New York World's Fair -- is really not the birthday of television, but of 
television as we know it. With commercials, for one thing. RCA, the biggest and 
richest of the companies pursuing the television brass ring, weighed in with 
its first commercial broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird, a curator at the Smithsonian Institution, explained that three 
factors came together on that date for the first time in the United States -- 
the electron-scanning technology, a manufacturing base that could turn out the 
sets and a program service that would provide something to watch on those sets. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a happy coincidence for RCA that they were in New York and ready 
to go when the fair was ready to open," Bird said. Indeed, he reminded those of 
this TV-saturated age that Roosevelt was not there to appear on television, he 
was simply there to open the fair. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see pictures of him opening the fair, there are dozens of newsreel 
cameras and one lone TV camera," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Bird was standing in front of the television set that was the centerpiece of 
the RCA pavilion at that World's Fair. It is now the first exhibit you see at 
"American Television from the Fair to the Family" at the Smithsonian's National 
Museum of American History celebrating this 50th anniversary, an exhibition 
Bird spent about a year putting together. 
</P>
<P>
The set is cloaked in Lucite to show its electronic innards. Its picture was 
directed upward and viewers saw it in an angled mirror, an arrangement dictated 
by the picture tube's length. 
</P>
<P>
RCA's was not the only pavilion to feature television in 1939. General Electric 
and Westinghouse had it too. According to Bird, at all three exhibits you could 
walk by a camera and see yourself on TV. RCA handed out cards certifying that 
the bearer had been televised. They have one of those at the Smithsonian, along 
with a button given to early TV viewers that says, "I Have Seen the Future." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the ironies is that television eventually replaced World's Fairs as the 
place where we see the types of things people used to go to the fairs for," he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Near that Lucite TV is one of the first figures to be telecast, a Felix the Cat 
doll that an RCA engineer purchased and put on a turntable for experiments with 
television in the early 1930s. Its crude image, which is preserved in a 
photograph, was broadcast to sets placed in the homes of RCA engineers and 
executives. The picture was formed by 60 lines of electronic scans; today, 
American TVs have 525 such lines. 
</P>
<P>
Putting together an exhibition about television is especially difficult because 
TV is about images, not objects, which are the stuff of such exhibits. There 
are two TVs going constantly at the exhibition. One shows an ad from 1947 with 
Morey Amsterdam and Art Carney selling a Dumont set as "Your Window on the 
World," and the other is a 15-minute reel with highlights of shows and ads from 
the last four decades. But Bird focused his exhibit on the physical objects 
that demonstrate the changing relationship between the country and the medium. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that early advertisements show TV being sold as a step forward 
in the modern industrial world, much as High Definition Television, known as 
HDTV, is being marketed today. But the early ads also show an ambiguity about 
the new medium. Those first sets cost $600, about the price of a car, so they 
were aimed at upper-class consumers. Drawings and photographs placed sets in 
posh homes, but their design allowed them to be hidden behind doors or pushed 
down into consoles. Moreover, the furniture in the room was never arranged 
facing the TV. 
</P>
<P>
World War II abruptly ended the growth of the medium. "Most of the cathode ray 
tube factories were put to work making oscilloscopes," Bird said. But the war's 
end brought a boom in the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
"When you ask people where the first place they ever saw a TV was, it was 
either at a friend's house, in a bar or at an appliance store," Bird said. "We 
tried to re-create one of those environments." 
</P>
<P>
A wall of old sets, mostly vintage 1947 to 1953, stare at the viewer. After the 
war, there were about 140 different manufacturers, the price was down to $199, 
and returning GIs were eager to cash in their war bonds and buy one. 
</P>
<P>
And the marketing changed. The advertisements Bird displayed emphasize that 
while the typical family was accustomed to going their separate ways to 
sporting events, the theater and the like, with television everyone could now 
sit down together to view such fare. It seems hopefully naive, but Bird pointed 
out that it is a rather standard ploy. 
</P>
<P>
"You see computers being sold this way today," he said. "It's a big ticket item 
and the manufacturers know you're only going to buy one of them so they want 
you to think everyone in the family will use it." 
</P>
<P>
Later, when companies were urging us to buy a second, portable TV, the ad 
chosen shows two happy teen-agers watching their own set as mom and dad look on 
approvingly in the background. 
</P>
<P>
The TV exhibition incorporates the so-called "Wall of Entertainment" from the 
continuing "A Nation of Nation" exhibition about American immigrant life. 
Though it still has a variety of exhibits, it has been given a TV slant with 
sheet music of TV themes, the mileage sign from "MASH," the Fonz's leather 
jacket, Magnum's Detroit Tiger hat, Mister Rogers' sweater and the like. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures show the way TV promoted its programs, and the way those programs 
represented American family life. Behind Archie Bunker's chair are a few 
Nielsen audience measuring devices. The empty chair stares at the TV showing 
the highlight reel. 
</P>
<P>
Bird said that ultimately what television has become is the manufacturer of the 
images we carry in our minds. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, every image I have of President Bush or President Reagan I got from TV," 
he said. "When I think of them, I think of their television images." 
</P>
<P>
The closest he can come to a three-dimensional representation of this 
phenomenon is a wall of theme lunch boxes, representing countless kids who 
traipsed to school with a television icon held close to their sides. 
</P>
<P>
In the corner of a case filled with more recent technology, Bird points out a 
button handed out at a demonstration of HDTV on Capitol Hill. "I Have Seen the 
Future," it says. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked to the person who made up the button and she didn't have any idea 
that it was the same slogan used at the 1939 World's Fair," Bird said. "We've 
come some sort of full circle." 
</P>
<P>
So soon, coming to a store near you, a $3,000 High Definition Television that 
will bring your family together to see this technological marvel.

IT'S ONE THING TO BE POOR. IT'S ANOTHER TO BE POOR IN;

<P>
SOMETIMES, WHEN I AM sitting in my ugly old chair of no particular color, I am 
overwhelmed by the beauty of this room. The Red Room. It is not a perfect room. 
If it were, I could not love it as I do. The walls have been darkened by 
cigarette smoke and candle soot, the ceiling is cracked and peeling from the 
leak that appears whenever it rains. It has been 18 years since we painted this 
room red. Time has taken its toll, some might say, but I think time has given 
it the charm of a decaying palazzo in Venice. The Red Room. I could not live 
without a room that was painted red. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, I read that a red room, that is, a room with painted red walls, 
would drive a person mad. I wonder. Have we gone mad living in the Red Room, 
Paul and I? Perhaps we have, yet I'm not really certain -- there is no way to 
judge one's own madness. The only thing I am certain of is that we have become 
very poor. It seems odd to be poor and live in a red room. Yet, I thank God for 
this one blessing. It is one thing to be poor; it is quite another to be poor 
in a red room. 
</P>
<P>
This is a room that love has changed as we have changed. Once it was filled 
with elegant things, handsome sofas and pretty French chairs, but those things 
are long gone, sold though newspaper ads, or sold on the street below in one of 
our many yard sales. Now there are tired old lounge chairs, old wooden packing 
crates from a long-ago traveling photographic exhibition, paintings in gilt 
frames. Renoir's plump, pink naked lady dries her hair, after her bath, and 
looks down upon the green malachite table. Everywhere, leaning against the 
walls, on top of the crates, there are large color photographs, some framed, 
some not, and here and there on top of the narrow glass table are 
photomontages, my last works, once published, now not so new anymore, growing 
old and forgotten like me. 
</P>
<P>
Things come and go. Last year, John gave us an old chemistry bottle from the 
1930s, a clear glass ball with a long, straight neck. I filled it to the brim 
with water, which turned it into a huge, magic magnifying glass. I set it on a 
glass pedestal and placed it on the glass table and filled it full of pale, 
pink lilies from our garden. A fortuneteller's crystal ball with pale, pink 
lilies set against the red walls -- a still life to be photographed. But my 
camera was sold a year ago, or was it two? And the still life is long gone, the 
glass ball sold to some stranger. Yet the image remains in my mind. I see it 
now, pink and red, a fortuneteller's glass ball. The mind is like a camera, but 
there is no camera like the mind. 
</P>
<P>
At Thanksgiving, I imagined that we would have our usual modest meal of oatmeal 
and toast in the Red Room. Neither of us is a very good cook, and food is 
something of a luxury -- and besides, the oven has not worked properly in ages. 
But when we went to the supermarket, Paul discovered a glass case with amber 
heat lamps that was filled with hot, plump, juicy chickens. It was just too 
much for him and we decided, on the spot, to splurge on a somewhat scaled-down, 
but no less festive, dinner. We bought one hot, golden brown chicken, the least 
expensive one we could find, and one big pumpkin pie, which we ate with relish 
late that afternoon in the Red Room. 
</P>
<P>
It's late at night now, and it's cold. Paul has gone to bed and I'm sitting 
here in one of the old lounge chairs, watching James Ivory's "Maurice" on 
television. It starts in England in the early 1900s, and I notice right off 
that in one early scene there is a red room -- in the professor's apartment at 
Cambridge. It's as beautiful as our Red Room, but then all red rooms are 
beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
It's cold in here, but I'm warm and cozy. My feet are propped up on the folding 
footstool, my legs are covered with a warm plaid lap robe, and I'm bundled up 
in a polo shirt, a sweat shirt and a light zippered jacket, topped off with a 
wool sweater with deer-horn buttons that Jeanie made for me. Jeanie must think 
I'm a giant, this sweater is so huge. It's even big on Paul, who's 6 feet tall, 
but I love it; it's cozy and warm, and it's wrapping me up like a big fur coat. 
</P>
<P>
At moments like this, this room always seems to overwhelm me, it's so 
beautiful. Next to me is the green malachite table, and a candle is burning in 
a silver holder, reflecting its light in a large silver dish, an antique from 
Edinburgh. There's a polished brass kettle, made in Occupied West Germany, and 
a pile of 18th-Century books with leather bindings, printed in London in 1762. 
These are Mama's things. She loved antiques and curiosities and rescued them 
whenever she came across them. She gave them to me, most of them. Some I stole 
from our house when she died and I lost my inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
Just beyond, the TV is set in the center of the white breakfront. It's 8 feet 
tall, with folding panel doors that usually are closed but are now flung open, 
fully 8 feet across, exposing the shelves and the insides of the doors. As I 
look at it from my cozy perch, it is a splendor to my eyes. Paul has lined the 
inside of the doors and shelves from top to bottom with hundreds of Christmas 
cards from years past. These are not Christmas cards anymore; they are a 
hundred dazzling little Russian icons. It is an explosion of eccentric Russian 
taste. It's wild and wonderful, and when seen from across the malachite table, 
as I see it now, it is a wonder to behold. 
</P>
<P>
To my right and behind me is the glass table, a late '60s design. Chrome legs 
and a narrow band, topped with thick glass. So simple it's almost invisible, a 
wisp of air, reflecting the changing colors of "Maurice" on the flat surfaces 
of its slender legs. Hanging on the wall behind, and on the table top, are 
large photomontages, flickering faces made of hundreds of hand-cut pieces of 
photographic prints. I made these in a great burst of creative energy. Some 
were published, others were exhibited. One day when our situation improves, 
I'll continue this work. But this will have to wait; we do not have the money 
to spend on artistic expressions. 
</P>
<P>
The table holds a pile of books and a beautiful little portrait of Mama, taken 
in the last days of the '20s or the very first days of the '30s. She is wearing 
a dress of silk crepe de Chine, and pulled up around her face is a thick 
red-fox fur. She is so young and beautiful, so elegant and sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
Here and there, about the room, are the ugly old lounge chairs. They're floppy 
old hound dogs; they are bums in ragged clothing. When our French chairs were 
sold, I missed them terribly. I loved those pretty French ladies, and that's 
what they were, Parisian beauties with rouged lips and spiked heels. But I 
don't miss them anymore. Now I am much more comfortable with bums in rags than 
with fancy French ladies. These lovable bums are at home, here in the Red Room. 
</P>
<P>
It's been raining for a week now, and the little drip on the ceiling of the Red 
Room is busy adding more patina. Tonight, with the rain coming down and the 
little drip dripping, we splurged on a bit of heat and dined in the Red Room on 
the meal a poor artist living in Paris in 1924 would eat. It's become a 
tradition with us. John sends us this artists' meal in a basket every year. He 
sends it to us because we are artists, and we understand, as only artists can. 
In 1924, John was a dapper young man living in Paris. One cold, rainy night on 
his way home from some cafe, he found three beautiful young girls shivering in 
a doorway, soaked to the skin. He took them home to his tiny garret under the 
eaves, where they removed their wet clothes and hung them by the fireplace to 
dry. There, in the flickering light of the fire, John and the naked young 
Parisian beauties dined on French bread, Italian salami, cheese and wine. They 
babbled in French and giggled and laughed until they all fell asleep on the 
floor in front of the warm fire. John does not join us when we eat our artists' 
meal; he is 90 now, and blind. Yet, every year he sends us a basket with French 
bread, Italian salami, cheese and wine. Tonight, at home in his chair by the 
window, John dreams of Paris, 1924. 
</P>
<P>
The Renoir has got to go. I just put an ad in the paper to try to sell it. 
"Renoir, After the Bath, 37x47 inches, a fine copy in oils, with ornate gilt 
frame. Reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Everything in the Red Room seems to have a story, and the Renoir is no 
exception. Thirty years ago, when Paul and I were young, we met a very old 
lady. She was a French teacher who had lived in Paris at the turn of the 
century and had been a friend of Pierre Auguste Renoir. I could hardly believe 
it -- Mary a friend of Renoir. She had been reduced to tragic circumstances and 
lived in a bleak and barren little apartment with only a few possessions: a 
hard chair, a tiny table that she used as a desk, a little blackboard with her 
name painted across the top -- MADAME MARY -- and a simple cot to sleep on. 
</P>
<P>
There amid her pitiful belongings -- bits of yellowed lace, tarnished silver 
spoons engraved with her initial -- was a beautiful old book, "The Works of 
Renoir," which had been given to Mary by Jean Renoir, the artist's son, and 
signed to her with a personal message in French. She loaned me the book, her 
most valued treasure, and from it I made the copy of "After the Bath" in oils 
on a large piece of cardboard. It leaned against the refrigerator in our first 
apartment. And it has always hung in the Red Room. 
</P>
<P>
We are down to our last $7, and so far, there have been no calls for the 
Renoir. Our situation could not be more bleak. Yet, for reasons I can't 
explain, I feel wonderful, even optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
There are two new arrivals in the Red Room. Paul found two upholstered office 
chairs near the trash cans. He took them apart, cleaned them and put them back 
together today. They are in pretty good condition and should sell at our next 
yard sale. Paul has become an expert at finding things in the trash cans -- 
even interesting things, like a solid-brass piano lamp. It needed a bit of 
repair and a good polishing, but Paul has enormous patience, and he soon made 
it as good as new. He found most of the clothes that I have on, including the 
shoes on my feet, in the trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
We once lived a happy life -- a glamorous life, I suppose. We were well known, 
even famous artist-photographers. We were never rich but we were comfortable. 
We lived the ideal life -- the life of artists, enormously interesting and 
bohemian. We could not have asked for more, and we lived in the Red Room. 
</P>
<P>
Then our troubles began, so slowly at first that I was hardly aware. Work just 
slowly petered out. We began a new series of photographs, which we sent off to 
Life magazine. They loved them, they said, but didn't publish them. Then we 
designed a collection of decorative boxes. We showed them to manufacturers, who 
said they were terrific but too complex for their American workers to make; 
they could only be made in Korea. We designed a collection of coffee mugs for 
an importer, to be made in Korea. But they were too expensive-looking, he said, 
to be sold at Pic 'n' Save. We were never paid. In the end, we needed Valium. 
</P>
<P>
Valium, our friend and enemy. We had been taking Valium for years. Valium, the 
wonder pill. It had always helped iron out life's little tensions. It 
contributed to our happy bohemian life style. We were users, but not abusers. 
We were civilized people. We handled it well. We were users but never more than 
one pill a day, and not even that at times. We were small users, but we were 
consistent users. And now, suddenly we had a money problem, and we were out of 
Valium. Valium had gone from $5 a bottle to $28, and a visit to the doctor to 
get a refill had gone from $10 to $100. Now we really needed the Valium, but it 
had become a question of food or drugs, and we needed both. So we decided to 
stop taking it. 
</P>
<P>
The first day without Valium was a cinch. The third day was no problem; we were 
quite proud of ourselves and wondered about the withdrawal symptoms that people 
talked about. We felt great. One week later, we were devastated. We were 
climbing the Red Room walls. 
</P>
<P>
Every day seemed to present new horrors. One day, my left arm would be numb and 
useless. The next day, it would be my right arm, then my left leg and my right 
leg. My hearing became strange, my eyesight would blur and double, my knees 
would suddenly give out, and I would almost fall down; my speech was impaired. 
I felt crazy. Paul was feeling the same way, and we knew that these were the 
dreaded withdrawal symptoms, which we hoped would soon withdraw from our lives. 
</P>
<P>
After a month or two, Paul seemed to be getting better, but not me. I seemed to 
be getting worse and had developed a constant pain in my chest. I was sure that 
I had heart trouble. Finally, with Paul's encouragement and no money, I went to 
see a doctor. He checked me over, ran tests and told me my heart was fine -- 
that the pains were only Valium withdrawal symptoms. Then he gave me a 
prescription for Xanax. The pain went away but I was hooked on the new drug 
just like that. 
</P>
<P>
I learned about a tiny drugstore where the door was always kept locked. There 
were no lights, and it was dirty and dusty. The shelves were almost bare. There 
were no employees other than the druggist, and he was a very strange fellow. He 
would put my pills in any old used manufacturer's bottle that happened to be 
lying around, then hand it to me and say, "You've got to stop taking these; 
you'll get hooked on them." He was right, of course. I took them for seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Then one day I ran out of Xanax, but I just couldn't go back to the drugstore. 
I put it off for a day, then a week. Then a month passed, a year, two years. 
Last October, I began to feel like I had awakened from a long sleep. And now we 
buy food and not drugs. 
</P>
<P>
When our world began to collapse, we told no one, not even our closest friends. 
We stopped seeing people, and they drifted from our lives. They must have 
wondered about us. We had become increasingly shabby-looking, our cars 
disappeared, and then our furniture. We started having yard sales, food became 
a luxury, and any kind of medical attention was out of the question. If an 
aspirin or soaking our feet in hot water didn't cure it, we were doomed. 
</P>
<P>
I felt embarrassed, as though I had done something terribly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
I missed the days when the famous came to the Red Room to be photographed, on 
business or to visit. Sir Cecil Beaton, the photographer, spilled his tea on 
the Red Room carpet after we had photographed Mae West for Vogue. Fashion 
designer Rudi Gernreich had sat under the Renoir. Bridget Fonda's first 
grown-up, movie-star photographs had been taken there. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight we ate a pumpkin bread that Paul brought home from his sister's. And at 
last we took down the Russian icon Christmas cards. It was a shock to my soul; 
I wanted to leave them up forever. They were not Christmas cards to me; they 
were dazzling Russian icons. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Room has changed again; yet as always, it remains the same. And I'm 
still sitting in the Red Room, in the ugly old lounge chair of no particular 
color, thinking.

REUPHOLSTERING furniture has always been expensive. After World War II, 
returning GIs, unable to afford new furnishings, often slipcovered thrift-shop 
couches and armchairs. This "slipcovered look" soon went out of style. Today, 
however, slipcovers are so well designed that they appear to be upholstery. 
Styles in slipcovers range from elaborately structured designs to loose covers 
made like throws. Classic, fitted covers, says Don Ravitz of Dun Rite 
Upholstery in Van Nuys, "will always be in fashion." Traditional fabrics -- 
pliable, stain-resistant, pre-shrunk cottons just heavy enough to conceal 
what's under them -- are popular; these include country florals, stripes and 
ticking. These fabrics are sometimes quilted or tasseled. Some people prefer 
billowing "baggies" in white or pale linen, duck or canvas, augmented by 
gathers, swags, ties and floppy bows. Pullup chairs are often sheathed and 
aproned. 
</P>
<P>
Mimi London, who carries slipcover fabrics in her Pacific Design Center 
showroom, uses draping Japanese couturier Jacquards on sofas and chairs and 
folds the fabric -- rather than cutting it -- "to achieve looseness." 
</P>
<P>
New slipcovers should be dry-cleaned; thereafter, most fitted washables can be 
laundered in cool water and replaced damp without ironing. 
</P>
<P>
 Slipcovers are made by Roman Upholstery and Al Javor in West Los Angeles; 
Finlay's Slip Cover Co., Mimi London, Metropolitan Upholstery and Hal David 
Interiors in Los Angeles; Custom Design in Pasadena; Dun Rite Upholstery and 
Slipcovers in Van Nuys; Family Fabrics in Reseda; A-1 Interiors and 
Upholstering Co. in San Pedro; Betty Gray Interiors in Newbury Park; E.M. 
Interiors in Oxnard and Camarillo; Calico Corners in Los Angeles, Orange and 
San Diego counties. For folding-chair slipcovers, visit Crate &amp; Barrel in 
Century City and Costa Mesa, and Pottery Barn stores throughout Southern 
California.

NOT LIKE FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK REYNOLDS and TOM SHACHTMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'Patrick was depressed when he returned to Hollywood. In a journal, he poured 
out what he knew of his father. He tried to stop loathing Dick and struggled to 
understand him.' 
</P>
<P>
From "The Gilded Leaf -- Triumph, Tragedy, and Tobacco: Three Generations of 
the R.J. Reynolds Family and Fortune," to be published this month by Little, 
Brown and Co. This excerpt describes the period before tobacco heir Patrick 
Reynolds, grandson of R.J. Reynolds, became an anti-smoking advocate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BY THE TIME of the Reynolds family reunion, Patrick was a young film maker. He 
bore the family name but only a small fraction of the money; he was Dick's son 
but had been disinherited, and so, along with his brothers, was somewhat 
ostracized at this gathering. Patrick lifted his movie camera and recorded the 
reunion; it was a wonderful way to be present and distanced at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Hollywood, without the discipline of being forced to earn his own 
living, Reynolds went after his career goal inefficiently. He didn't seek the 
sort of jobs other aspiring film makers wanted, such as working as assistants 
in production companies. Instead, he attended film festivals around the world 
and took courses at UCLA and then at USC. He spent endless hours in an editing 
room perfecting his own short films. 
</P>
<P>
As did many heirs, he tried to surpass his father by attempting to make a lot 
of money all at once. He plunged $400,000 into silver bullion and had the 
satisfaction of seeing the price rise. But he lost money on a prototype 
electric car, a mobile phone in a briefcase, a bank in the Bahamas, an 
executive-search company. Often he agreed to deals with a handshake, wrote 
checks to business partners without consulting attorneys and in other ways fell 
victim to associates whose enthusiasm far outweighed their credentials. 
</P>
<P>
He was delighted when his old mentor, Albert Johnson, invited him to join other 
San Francisco Film Festival people in a tour of the Soviet Union. They met 
Soviet film stars and directors. To Reynolds, it was a revelation that in a 
communist country, where all were supposed to be equal, a few lived more 
comfortably than most. Perhaps it was the natural order of things that some 
were more fortunate than others. 
</P>
<P>
Believing that, he concluded that he wasn't a bad (or a good) person for having 
a lot when others had very little; it was just the luck of the draw. He began 
to be more relaxed about his inherited wealth and decided there was nothing 
wrong with spending some of his money on himself. He rented a hilltop 
castle-estate in the Hollywood Hills. Wolf's Lair was grand and fake at the 
same time -- many rooms, a hideaway pool, a panoramic view of the Los Angeles 
Basin, and another over the Lake Hollywood reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Shelley Duvall was researching a role in Robert Altman's "Nashville" 
when Reynolds met her at the Starwood on Santa Monica Boulevard. Soon she moved 
into Wolf's Lair. 
</P>
<P>
While visiting Duvall on the set of "Nashville," Reynolds was cast by Altman in 
a walk-on. Being a film director now seemed to be an unattainable goal; acting 
was more approachable. 
</P>
<P>
The bit in Altman's movie led to a speaking role in a television production of 
"Bernice Bobs Her Hair," in which Duvall starred. After that production had 
concluded, Reynolds was scheduled to act in Altman's "Buffalo Bill and the 
Indians" when a letter from his aunt arrived. The missive announced that the 
Sapelo Island Research Foundation was offering to sell the South End mansion's 
furnishings to the brothers before holding a general auction. Reynolds was 
insulted by being asked to bid on what he believed should have been part of his 
inheritance. He decided that attending might be his last opportunity to see 
Sapelo. 
</P>
<P>
The magnificence and emptiness of Sapelo, conjuring up both the wonderful and 
the terrible scenes that had occurred there, produced in Reynolds a profound 
sadness. He was quite depressed when he returned to Hollywood. In a journal, he 
poured out all that he knew of his father's and family's life. The writing was 
therapy. In the course of it, Patrick tried to stop loathing Dick and struggled 
to understand him: "Ignoring his children was only part of (Dick's) larger 
pattern. To successfully cope with the magnitude of his endowments in wealth, 
genius and physical stamina, he would have needed an equally extreme 
self-discipline, which he was never inspired or did not choose to cultivate." 
Patrick wrote that he himself hoped to have that discipline. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to put the past behind him forever, to bury and forget it. He had 
his own future in films on which to concentrate. He was cast in a new musical 
by the authors of "Hair" and went to rehearse with it in New York; meanwhile, 
Duvall was on location making another film. At the end of one long-distance 
call, the relationship was over. The musical closed, too, after three 
performances. Reynolds returned to Wolf's Lair; without Duvall, the mansion 
seemed empty. He found an even more majestic estate, in Holmby Hills. This was 
Brooklawn, built in the 1920s by one of the founders of 20th Century Fox, 
Winifred Sheehan. It had enormous public rooms with 14-foot ceilings; there was 
a ballroom with a balcony. Its dimensions and amenities seemed perfect for the 
life Reynolds believed he had been cheated out of -- the style of his father, 
which he wanted desperately to understand. 
</P>
<P>
He gave two large parties a year, held private acting workshops in the 
ballroom, dated actresses and models. With a partner, he optioned some 
screenplays and properties but was not able to persuade the studios to put any 
of them into production. At what seemed to him to be the last moment, he lost 
many potential starring roles in films. The beauty of Brooklawn was a constant 
source of pleasure, but at times its enormous, empty rooms only amplified 
Reynolds' growing feelings of failure and despair.

COOKBOOK ON A COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CIOTTI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FOR MOST PEOPLE the idea of putting a cookbook on a computer disc probably 
doesn't sound like an improvement. After all, cookbooks work fine just as they 
are. You don't need to plug in a cookbook or read an operating manual before 
you can use one, either. Still, Micro Cookbook is surprisingly useful. 
</P>
<P>
Micro Cookbook, a computer program manufactured by Pinpoint, offers 150 recipes 
including steak Diane, pan-fried scallops, sole en Gougons and warm beer soup. 
As usual, most recipes are for four people. But (and this is one of the virtues 
of having recipes on a computer) the program will print out a recipe for any 
number of diners. If, for instance, you tell the computer you'd like to have an 
intimate dish of scalloped potatoes for two, it tells you to start with 1 1/2 
peeled potatoes and half a quart of milk. On the other hand, if it's dinner for 
10, it recommends that you start with 12 peeled potatoes and two quarts of 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
It's more fun if you start from the other direction -- you have no idea what 
you want to serve but you've looked in the refrigerator and you have plenty of 
fresh sweet basil, garlic and butter. When you enter those ingredients into the 
program, it tells you that basil is used in nine recipes, garlic in 46 and 
butter in 59. Furthermore, there are two recipes that use all three: pesto 
spaghetti, and chicken and mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Another feature. Now you don't have to read from your old cookbook on the 
counter, with its broken spine and spattered pages. You just order the program 
to print out the recipe. Then once you're finished making the dish, you can 
throw out the hard copy -- grease spots, smears and all. 
</P>
<P>
Most useful perhaps is the shopping-list feature. You enter all the dishes you 
plan to serve at your next dinner party (beef stew, paella, spicy shrimp, 
risotto and lime pie) and it prints out ingredient totals so, when you go to 
the supermarket, you know how much of each item to buy (one chopped onion for 
the stew, one sliced onion for the shrimp and half a cup of diced onion each 
for the risotto and paella). 
</P>
<P>
Micro Cookbook won't compel people to throw away their cookbooks and go out and 
buy computers instead. But it's a lot more useful than one might think at 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 Micro Cookbook is available at Egghead Software stores throughout Southern 
California for $39.99.

POCKET WATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM BURCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLLECTING WATCHES satisfies many interests -- those of history, art and 
science. Tradition holds that Paul Henlein of Nuremberg developed the pocket 
watch about 1500. Those first watches told only the hour and were notoriously 
unreliable; it was the decoration that was admired. During the 17th Century, 
watch cases were created in a great variety of unusual forms; for example, as 
stars, skulls, crucifixes and shells. Cases were engraved, enameled or 
decorated with gold filigree, tortoise-shell or leather and silver pin-work. 
Such "form watches," with their elaborate workmanship, continued to be made 
during the 18th and 19th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanically, the development of the balance spring in 1675 was most important 
in terms of improved timekeeping. It had, however, little effect on the 
external form of the watch, since it took up so little space. There were no 
major changes until the 19th Century, which saw the transition of watchmaking 
from a craft to an industry. Parts had been made by hand until about 1850, when 
machine methods were introduced into the United States. Soon Switzerland and 
the United States were the largest watch manufacturers. The oldest Swiss 
factory, Vacheron &amp; Constantin, founded in 1785, introduced the principle 
of interchangeability of parts in 1838, about two decades after American 
clockmaker Eli Terry introduced the concept to clock-making. Another important 
and prestigious Swiss watchmaking firm was that of Patek Philippe &amp; Cie., 
founded in 1839. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most famous of the low-priced American watches -- and the first 
successful one -- was the brass-movement 19th-Century Waterbury "long wind" 
watch that sold for $3.50; the Ingersoll brothers commissioned Waterbury to 
make an inexpensive watch to sell at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 
1893. The Yankee model, which sold for $1, was henceforth called a "dollar 
watch." Compare that to a mechanism such as the expensive early-20th-Century 
gold repeater watch by the celebrated London firm of Dent, with a double 
split-second chronograph, a perpetual calendar with a hand to indicate the leap 
years and a minute repeater. 
</P>
<P>
Some sales figures from recent auctions indicate the continuing appeal of 
elaborate decoration: a French gold-and-enamel cylinder watch, movement signed 
Breguet, Paris ($2,300); a gold hunter-cased watch, Copenhagen, 19th Century 
($1,430); a gold pocket chronometer, English, 19th Century ($7,620); a 
gold-and-enamel musical watch, circa 1820, Switzerland ($19,000). 
</P>
<P>
Today, wristwatches from the 1920s, '30s and '40s are eagerly being sought, 
from Hamilton and Gruen watches for under $100 to such special items as an 
early-20th-Century gold world-time wristwatch from Patek Philippe for $20,000. 
The range is wide, the variety endless. 
</P>
<P>
 Pocket watches can be found at Elizabeth Lucas Collection in Santa Monica; 
Village Watchworks in Westwood; the Watch Co. and Second Time Around Watch Co. 
in Los Angeles; Frances Klein in Beverly Hills; Beaded Bird in Venice; Jay's 
Antiques in Pasadena, and Antique Seller in San Diego.

The Cook County, Ill., medical examiner has ruled that a 15-month-old boy 
unhooked by his father from a respirator died of accidental causes. Dr. Robert 
J. Stein made the ruling the day after a grand jury in Chicago refused to 
indict Rudolfo Linares, 23, who removed his son's life-support and held off 
hospital staff with a gun April 26. Samuel Linares had been comatose since 
accidentally swallowing a balloon last August. Officials at 
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center had refused the family's request to 
withdraw life-support. Stein said he reviewed the grand jury's decision before 
changing the death certificate from undetermined to accidental.

About 500 Burmese troops clashed with Thai soldiers after crossing the border 
into northern Thailand to attack a Karen rebel stronghold, a Thai officer said. 
Other attacking troops, perched on hills on the Burmese side of the border, 
fired shells on the Kaw Moo Ra camp, setting much of it ablaze in the third day 
of heavy fighting. About 1,200 guerrillas were defending the camp against 3,000 
soldiers, the officer added. Thai forces eventually fired at the attacking 
soldiers, who later moved on to another area inside Thailand, he said. No 
soldiers were reported hurt in the clashes. Thailand in the past has given 
sanctuary to the rebels, who have been fighting for four decades for greater 
autonomy.

Two of the world's richest men, William R. Hewlett and David Packard, were 
present when the one-car garage where Hewlett-Packard Co. was founded in 1939 
was dedicated in Palo Alto as the birthplace of Silicon Valley. A plaque was 
set in the front yard to identify the garage as a historical landmark, where 
Hewlett and Packard started a high-tech products company. It now employs 93,000 
workers and generated $9.8 billion in sales in the 1988 fiscal year. The 
partners' first product 50 years ago was an audio oscillator, a test instrument 
purchased by Walt Disney Studios, their first major customer.

The powder used in the Iowa's 16-inch gun turrets, where an explosion killed 47 
sailors on April 19, may have been stored at dangerously high temperatures 
before it was loaded aboard, according to a published report. The 
Virginian-Pilot and the Ledger-Star said that cannon charges were stored in 
uncooled barges at the Yorktown Naval Weapons Station for five months last 
summer while the battleship was undergoing repairs at the Norfolk Naval 
Shipyard in Portsmouth, Va. A Navy manual states that exposure to such heat 
dangerously accelerates the decomposition of chemicals used to keep the charges 
stable. On board the ship, the powder is kept in cooled magazines. A spokesman 
for the Naval Sea Systems Command told the Norfolk newspaper that the Navy 
investigation was focusing on whether the months the powder spent sealed in the 
barges caused it to become unstable.

Gov. George Deukmejian said he will sign a bill making California the first 
state in the nation to ban the sale of assault firearms. However, the 
Republican governor -- a longtime opponent of gun control -- cautioned that the 
state also needs to enact stricter penalties against criminals who use those 
guns. "While these (assault weapon) bills will assist law enforcement officers, 
we must continue to let criminals know that if they use any weapons in the 
commission of a crime that we will take them out of society and put them behind 
bars," Deukmejian said in his weekly radio address. The Legislature narrowly 
approved the landmark assault weapons ban. The historic legislation will ban 
the manufacture and sale of more than 50 models of semiautomatic assault 
weapons. People who legally possessed the guns before June 1, 1989, could keep 
them but would have to register them with the state by Jan. 1, 1991.

Thunderstorms swept across the Southeast, with lightning setting a house afire 
and injuring four people in Tennessee. Some flooded rivers began receding in 
Texas but thousands of residents remained out of their homes. The National 
Weather Service said storms raked Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Alabama, 
Mississippi and Oklahoma. A thunderstorm produced hail the size of golf balls 
at Memphis, Tenn., with winds gusting to 56 m.p.h. Tornadoes were reported in 
Cross County, Ark., and just west of Corinth, Miss., but there were no injuries 
or major damage. In western North Carolina, thunderstorms produced high winds 
that uprooted large trees in the town of Texana. Three to five inches of rain 
fell in parts of Okmulgee and Muskogee counties in east-central Oklahoma. In 
Texas, authorities recovered the body of an 11th storm victim from flooding 
that swept through the state during the last week.

A city board's order to remove American flags from shops and other businesses 
in San Juan Bautista has raised tempers and created controversy in the small 
mission town. Lonny Greywolf Hurlbut, San Juan Bautista's acting police chief 
and a Korean War veteran, said he will refuse to obey the order by the city's 
cultural resources board. The board ordered shopkeepers to stop displaying Old 
Glory in front of their businesses, accusing them of using the Stars and 
Stripes to attract customers. The flag flap started this spring after the board 
conducted a survey of the town's signs and found dozens of alleged violations 
of the local sign ordinance. Among them was the use of the American flag for 
commercial, rather than patriotic, purposes.

The U.S. Customs Service passed out $1.4 million in confiscated funds from a 
Thailand-connected drug ring to eight law enforcement agencies in San Jose. 
"This is an example of the other side of the process," said a delighted John E. 
Hensley, assistant Pacific regional commissioner for the agency. The money was 
found in bags at a Del Rey Oaks storage locker in November, 1987, and was 
packed in neat stacks of $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills. The money was 
packaged by drug dealers with Southeast Asia connections, authorities said. It 
was the largest distribution of drug assets in Northern California to date.

A DRUG WAR? CIA HAS OTHER PRIORITIES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Malcolm Byrne and Jefferson Morley, Malcolm Byrne is an analyst at the 
National Security Archive in Washington; the views expressed here are his own. 
Jefferson Morley is Washington editor of the Nation.

<P>
While William J. Bennett has brought his drug war to the streets of Washington, 
he has so far avoided a no less entrenched drug problem in the nation's capital 
-- the long-standing conflict between law enforcement agencies and the national 
security bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
President George Bush has declared narcotics a national security priority, but 
a crucial task for Bennett will be to address the fundamental struggle between 
the goals of his Office of National Drug Control Policy and those of the 
Central Intelligence Agency, State Department and other agencies that seem to 
have different views on national security. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's challenge was underscored in a report, "Drugs, Law Enforcement and 
Foreign Policy," released last month by the Senate subcommittee on narcotics, 
terrorism and international operations. At an April 13 press conference, Sen. 
John Kerry (D-Mass.), chairman of the subcommittee, said his investigation 
"found that, too often, other foreign-policy interests were permitted to 
sidetrack, disrupt and undercut the war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The Kerry committee report noted, in connection with alleged Contra 
drug-running, that its investigation was unable to turn up "a single case 
against a drug trafficker operating in (northern Costa Rica) . . . despite 
direct testimony that trafficking on the Southern Front was reported to CIA 
officials." 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the intelligence community laying off drug dealers during the 
Contra war -- on at least four occasions, U.S. officials did business with 
them. The State Department contracted with a company called SETCO, in 1985 and 
1986, to transport supplies to the Contras despite Drug Enforcement 
Administration information that its founder, Juan Matta Ballesteros, had a 
history of drug involvement. A 1983 Customs Service report noted that Matta was 
"a class I DEA violator" and that "American businessmen who are dealing with 
Matta . . . are smuggling narcotics into the United States." It wasn't until 
1988, that Matta was extradited to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the cases of U.S. Government subversion of the anti-drug campaign, the 
most notorious involves Panama's Manuel A. Noriega. Noriega is now reviled by 
the Bush Administration but only three years ago, senior Reagan Administration 
officials were courting him for his help in fighting the Contra war. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver L. North, according to documents released at his trial, met Noriega in 
September, 1986, with the approval of National Security Adviser John M. 
Poindexter. North discussed the dictator's offer of sabotage and other services 
for the Contras in exchange for U.S. help to "clean up Noriega's image." Three 
months earlier, the New York Times had run a lengthy article detailing 
Noriega's involvement with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of cozy relations between national security operatives and drug 
traffickers is not new. It has existed at least since 1969, when Richard M. 
Nixon first declared narcotics a national scourge. Declassified government 
studies of the early years of the drug war (the only period for which 
significant documentation has been available until now) reveal Bennett's 
predecessors being frustrated by the same interagency battles that go on today. 
Bennett ignores the lesson of these early years at his peril. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA has played a crucial role in the drug war from the beginning. William 
E. Colby, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, made the point 
succinctly in 1973 when he said, "As long as there exists a narcotics problem, 
intelligence agencies will be involved." 
</P>
<P>
That fact brought the CIA into direct conflict with the DEA, according to a 
1975 report by the General Accounting Office on the Latin American drug trade. 
The CIA's mission, the report noted, is to gather intelligence bearing on the 
overall security of the United States. The DEA, on the other hand, is 
essentially responsible for keeping drugs out of the country. The GAO concluded 
that intelligence operatives viewed the DEA as low priority and even a danger 
to their operations: anti-drug campaigns risked exposing clandestine sources 
and disrupting sensitive intelligence-gathering efforts. As a result, many 
local CIA agents simply refused to cooperate with the DEA. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1971 and 1972, White House aides complained about the CIA's 
reluctance to share drug intelligence. A top CIA official defended the agency 
at a White House meeting by saying the drug war required "adjusting agency 
priorities," according to minutes of the session. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA went further to protect its interest. According to a secret 1976 
Justice Department report, the agency tampered with at least four major drug 
cases between 1972 and 1976, to prevent exposure of "sources and methods." 
These actions were supported at the agency's top levels. In 1972, Richard M. 
Helms, then the Director of Central Intelligence, told a Cabinet-level 
committee that the CIA had a duty "to protect intelligence officers and sources 
abroad from investigative or legal disclosures." 
</P>
<P>
Colby, who took over the CIA from Helms, continued the practice. In a 
little-known 1974 case, the CIA interceded in the prosecution of Rafael 
Alarcon, a former top narcotics official in Chile -- and not coincidentally a 
major drug trafficker himself. Citing his help in the CIA-supported ouster of 
Salvador Allende, the agency won him a reduced sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department has also frustrated narcotics officers over the years. The 
1975 GAO study uncovered several instances when U.S. embassy officials in Latin 
America "found it necessary to restrict DEA drug-enforcement efforts which they 
believed would have had a detrimental effect on the U.S.-host country 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
As the SETCO contract indicates, the State Department's priorities are the same 
today. In February, Richard Gregorie, a respected federal narcotics prosecutor 
in Florida, resigned, declaring in an interview, "I give an F to the State 
Department. I am finding the higher we go, the further I investigate matters 
involving Panama, high-level corruption in Colombia, in Honduras, in the 
Bahamas, they are concerned that we are going to cause a problem . . . and that 
is more important than stopping the dope problem." 
</P>
<P>
Can Bennett break this pattern of official collusion with drug kingpins? Much 
will depend on Bush. Bennett needs to recommend that Bush order the 
intelligence and foreign policy bureaucracies to reverse their misguided 
priorities in the war on drugs. If Bush and Bennett are not willing to do that, 
then they are not serious about perhaps the biggest drug problem in the 
nation's capital.

IN THE MIDDLE EAST, BUSH FOREIGN POLICY EMERGES MORE CLEARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Middle East for many years.

<TEXT>
<P>
While there have been loud lamentings in the United States that the Bush 
Administration has been indecisive, such criticism has not been echoed here in 
the crucial Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
In its first 100 days the Administration, quietly but swiftly, brought about 
changes in U.S. Middle East policy that are beginning to look like a U-turn. 
Instead of automatic U.S. acquiescence with everything Israel says and does, 
there are now a dozen issues on which the George Bush and Yitzhak Shamir 
administrations openly differ. These are both long-term and strategic, 
short-term and tactical. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States, the status quo is unacceptable; the objective of the 
peace process, which it strives to keep going, is a final, global settlement of 
the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Shamir government, under pressure from the 
continuing Palestinian intifada, or uprising, probably agrees that the current 
situation is unacceptable but is not planning for anything more than an interim 
settlement -- within a time-frame of five years, no more. 
</P>
<P>
The United States says that the underlying principle for the final settlement 
must be "land for peace," which Shamir rejects. He argues that Israel has 
already handed back all the occupied Arab territory demanded in U.N. 
resolutions 242 and 338. Bush disagrees: The provisions in 242 and 338 for 
Israeli withdrawal have not been fulfilled and his Administration "will hold 
the parties, as best the U.S. can, to a full implementation of the resolutions 
. . . the territory (Sinai) that has been ceded for peace (with Egypt) is not 
the end." Sooner or later, according to Washington, Israel must vacate the 
occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Washington insists, there must not be any further Israeli annexation 
of occupied Arab territory nor any extension of Israeli sovereignty over it. In 
flat contradiction to this position, Shamir, who strives for Greater Israel, 
has said repeatedly and openly that Israel will never withdraw, not even an 
inch, from what the Israelis refer to as the biblical lands of Judea and 
Samaria. 
</P>
<P>
The objective of the peace process is variously interpreted by the three 
parties now involved. The Palestine Liberation Organization demands the right 
to self-determination according to its "legitimate national rights," leading, 
ineluctably, to an independent Palestinian state -- already proclaimed, and 
recognized by more than 35 governments. That independent state could and should 
have a linkage with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel are agreed in not wanting any such state, but 
beyond that they part company. The United States concedes "Palestinian 
political rights," which could lead to some sort of Palestinian authority or 
entity on the West Bank in federation with Jordan. Shamir is not prepared to 
think of anything more than local self-government -- municipal autonomy. The 
Palestinians insist that their state must control the land and water resources 
of its territory. Israel, by contrast, says that the land has been promised to 
it for use in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
The single most emotional territorial issue is the control of Jerusalem, 
specifically Arab East Jerusalem, where the Holy Places are situated. Israel 
claims that in 1967 East Jerusalem became, forever, the reunited capital of the 
Jewish state. Washington has never officially recognized that claim, a current 
point of difference. 
</P>
<P>
In a strategic sense, the Bush and Shamir governments differ on the basic 
nature of the Palestinian struggle. Shamir condemns the intifada and any armed 
attack on Israel from outside as "terrorism." Even former Secretary of State 
George P. Shultz, a devoted friend of Israel, said that the intifada was not 
terrorism; so does Secretary of State James A. Baker III. The State Department 
further says that attacks from outside Israel on military targets are unhelpful 
but not terroristic in nature. 
</P>
<P>
There was a split between the United States and Israel on tactics and 
modalities of the peace process even under the Reagan Administration which 
began direct, if low-level, talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization in 
the teeth of fierce opposition from Israel. In the last three months, Israel 
has tried unsuccessfully to badger Washington into breaking off these talks, 
but the U.S.-PLO contacts in Tunis continue and have, in effect, become an 
indirect dialogue between Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has cautiously come round to saying that, if carefully structured, 
an international conference could be useful in helping to bring about a Middle 
East peace settlement; Shamir is adamantly opposed to any such international 
"interference." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the numerous short-term, tactical differences between the Bush and 
Shamir administrations spring from the Israeli leader's offer of "free and 
democratic elections" in the occupied territories. Until a couple of months 
ago, Shamir opposed elections. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir insists that violence, the intifada, must stop before the elections can 
be held; Baker has said this need not be necessary, though a diminution of 
violence would be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of supervising the elections and providing for security, the 
United States has suggested a partial, temporary concentration of the Israeli 
army in locations away from the main centers of Arab population, along with the 
participation of foreign observers, as in the Philippines elections. Shamir has 
said that he cannot accept any change in the disposition of the army before the 
elections, nor any foreign overseeing of the process. 
</P>
<P>
Last month Washington sent two pointed questions about the elections to the 
Shamir government. Would the Arab citizens of Jerusalem participate in the 
elections, and would the elections be considered elections at the municipal or 
at the national level? These questions had to be posed and answered because of 
differences between the United States and Israel. For Washington, Jerusalem 
remains occupied territory and therefore should participate in the electoral 
process. For Israel this is heresy. 
</P>
<P>
Further, since the United States sees the elections as only the first step 
toward a global settlement, the voting should be national, not municipal in 
scope. For Israel the opposite is the case -- elections must be municipal 
because the context is an interim arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Middle East observers, pleasantly surprised and cautiously pleased at the new 
U.S. positions, are trying to understand why the Bush Administration, in so 
short a time, should have overhauled its policy. The reason is that it has now 
become "safe" to do so, since Israel itself and the powerful pro-Israeli lobby 
in Washington are divided. 
</P>
<P>
Two events have produced the divisions. One is the intifada and the brutal 
methods used to suppress it, as seen nightly on television. The other is the 
controversy over the "who is a Jew" issue, which the ultra-orthodox in Israel 
have been trying to push to a conclusion. These splits have given Washington 
the opportunity to work out a truly national policy, and that opportunity has 
been seized.

GETTING RID OF NORIEGA NOW A PANAMA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard C. Hottelet, U.S. correspondent Richard C. Hottelet was in Panama 
during the May election. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WILTON, CONN. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 2 1/2 years the Reagan Administration has been trying to get rid of 
Panama's strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, using threats, tricks, legal 
maneuvers, bribes and incantations. None of them worked; U.S. policy-makers 
stumbled into a political swamp while Noriega laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Today President George Bush is looking for a better way and Noriega is fighting 
to stay on top. The May 7 election, rigged and annulled, has changed the 
picture. Getting rid of the general is no longer Washington's assumed 
responsibility. That has been accepted, as it should be, by the Panamanian 
opposition. Other Latin American democracies understand; they know what has 
happened. While Noriega's swift downfall is by no means assured, neither is his 
political survival as certain as it has been. 
</P>
<P>
Rigged or flagrantly stolen elections have not been rare in Latin America but 
in this one Noriega revealed that he had lost touch with reality, a most 
dangerous lapse for a dictator. He thought he could win -- or come close enough 
to adjust the result easily. Confidently, he held his election in a gold fish 
bowl with the world watching. Hundreds of observers from dozens of countries 
moved around freely. Among them was former President Jimmy Carter, who spoke to 
Noriega the day before the election and heard no hint about the possibility of 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Election day was a festive occasion. Families flocked to the polls, uninhibited 
in cheering opposition candidates, waiting for hours to vote. There were 
irregularities -- polling places late in opening, shortages of opposition 
ballots and multiple voting by soldiers and government supporters. But 
essentially small stuff. From the observers' accounts, only after the ballots 
were counted in the local polling places, and the results showed Noriega's 
crushing defeat, did the climax come. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Carter reported later, the local tally sheets were seized and 
replaced with counterfeits. Carter went to the top electoral tribunal the next 
day to watch the national vote count and was coldly turned away. Forbidden to 
hold a press conference, he met reporters in a crowded hotel corridor to voice 
disgust. Noriega had affronted Panama's best friend in the United States. The 
general clearly intends to stay in power, whatever the cost, and he must think 
that he can. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's power base is the military -- 15,000 soldiers and police of the 
Panama Defense Forces, the PDF, plus 10,000 irregulars of the so-called Dignity 
Battalions. He treats them well. Not only is the treasury in his hands, he also 
cuts the military in on profitable deals -- down to the PDF sergeants, who have 
the food concession at a popular beach resort. Having dealt with several 
rebellions in recent years, Noriega has meanwhile weeded out dissident 
officers, down to the rank of major. 
</P>
<P>
Yet outsiders widely assume that if Noriega is to be forced out, it must be by 
-- or with the help of -- the military. Bush has openly appealed to the army to 
overthrow the general. The Panamanian opposition offers an arrangement with the 
PDF, preserving its proper role in a democratic society. To move down that 
road, however, the soldiers must first conclude that Noriega's future is not, 
after all, their future. 
</P>
<P>
The failed election may be a first push in that direction. The general, who has 
out-maneuvered the Yanquis and who held his ground against massive protest 
demonstrations, including the general strike of 1988, has lost his touch. 
Caught red-handed before the world, he has inevitably also lost face. The 
Socialist International had already withdrawn observer status from Noriega's 
Revolutionary Democratic Party. The Group of Eight Latin American states 
dealing with the Central America problem has excluded Panama. Not that 
isolation is, in itself, so damaging. Paraguay's dictator Alfredo Stroessner 
spent most of his 35 years in power as an international pariah. He was thrown 
out by a general only this year. 
</P>
<P>
Panama is in serious economic trouble and now has nowhere to turn for effective 
help. The regime is incompetent as well as corrupt, unable to command popular 
support. A thinking soldier may well begin to wonder about his future. 
</P>
<P>
The United States shares responsibility for Noriega's rise. Seven 
administrations dealt with him, welcoming his intelligence information and 
praising him for cooperating in drug enforcements. They helped him build the 
PDF as a stabilizing element in turbulent Central America and, ultimately, to 
defend the Panama Canal. Then the Reagan Administration turned him into a 
powerful adversary, shaking Teddy Roosevelt's big stick while demanding his 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan proclaimed a national emergency to impose selective economic sanctions 
on Panama. Meanwhile, leaving the Panamanian opposition in the dark and 
undercutting Latin American efforts, Washington negotiated privately with 
Noriega for months, even offering to quash narcotics and money-laundering 
indictments against him if he would retire with dignity. The general cast 
himself in the role of dauntless patriot, defying and outwitting Yanqui 
imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has clearly dropped the quick victory, go-it-alone approach. The level of 
rhetoric is down -- no threats of further sanctions, intervention or abrogating 
the treaties to turn the Canal over to Panama at noon, Dec. 31, 1999. Bush has 
called for solidarity with Latin American democracies, all equally appalled by 
May 7 and the brutality that followed. The Organization of American States 
meeting in Washington last week expressed indignation against Noriega but 
divided on taking a strong stand, let alone action. Action is too much to 
expect so soon. Washington must regain the confidence it has squandered. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has a leading part to play, having historical ties with the 
people of Panama stronger than those with any other Latin American country. And 
it has an abiding interest in an open Canal. But so does Japan, now Panama's 
second-largest trading partner. Japan, so far so quiet, must be persuaded to 
join in showing active disapproval, disabusing Noriega's expectation that he 
will surmount this crisis too. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, the main burden falls on the Panamanian opposition. For them, May 7 
was a watershed. Solid evidence that they have enthusiastic national supportt 
gives them fresh standing in their own eyes and in the aroused community. They 
have stood up under bloody attack and have refused invitations since May 7 to 
compromise and form a "unity government" with the Noriega camp. The Catholic 
Church has expressed support for them -- and condemnation of the general -- 
more clearly than ever before. Church political influence should not be 
overestimated in Panama but its moral verdict carries weight. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega will now, of course, use talent and stick to hold his operation 
together, playing for time, trying to blur the issues. In this new phase, U.S. 
policy should be carefully modulated -- firm, consistent, unprovocative, taking 
its cue from the Panamanian opposition. At the same time, it should encourage 
the men and women who have just beaten the machine to formulate a clear social 
and political program, helping them without trying to steer. 
</P>
<P>
The goal must be an independent, democratic nation promising a stability that 
ensures the world's free use of the Panama Canal into the 21st Century.

ADRIENNE RICH: POET, POLITICIAN AND THE FEMINIST OF WILD PATIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SANTA CRUZ 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "wild patience" has taken the women's movement this far, to borrow the title 
phrase from one of Adrienne Rich's poetry collections, a mix of enthusiasm and 
endurance that has allowed women to pile one little gain upon another. That 
patience kept the feminist movement alive and functioning at the grass roots 
level during the eight Reagan years, the poet says, and now it is emerging more 
publicly again. 
</P>
<P>
Where feminism has been and where it is going are inescapable themes for one of 
America's pre-eminent poets. Rich, who lives in Santa Cruz when she is not off 
giving readings or teaching one term each year at Stanford University, may be 
feeling particularly reflective about feminism and its role in her poetry and 
her life these days. She turned 60 this month. And W. W. Norton has published a 
new collection of her poetry, "Time's Power," this month. 
</P>
<P>
The most visible sign that the movement remains strong was the turnout of 
300,000 -- or more -- people in Washington last month in support of women's 
right to abortion. The march "attracted a huge amount of media attention 
because abortion arouses emotion," she said. But she added that the public 
needs to be aware that much more is going on as women work to secure 
reproductive rights -- that is, everything from better prenatal care to 
reduction of unnecessary Caesarean section births. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of vitality, Rich said recently, is "the ever-increasing 
leadership of women of color." Women are giving vast attention to combatting 
racism in society, she said, and many met just last month on the campus of the 
University of Iowa to talk about what unites and what oppresses them. This 
focus is necessary, Rich explains, so that women can work together trying to 
resolve issues ranging from the quality of their children's educations to the 
seriousness with which their own views are taken. 
</P>
<P>
"As a white woman, my world is informed the more conscious I am made . . . of 
the realities of other women different from myself." Speaking of these issues 
means speaking of politics. There are those poetry critics who still find 
Rich's work too political, as if, Rich interjects, one can separate politics 
from life. "What you see when you look out of your window is political and what 
you notice that you choose to put down on the page" is political. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the worst political poetry I know is written by white poets who go to 
places like the Caribbean on a two-week vacation and write poems about the 
beautiful bougainvillea and the palm trees and the beautiful women and choose 
not to see, choose not to write about or even consider the poverty and misery 
of those countries . . . . It would pass for being nonpolitical but I say it's 
political because that kind of poem not only excludes but distorts reality so 
frighteningly." 
</P>
<P>
Too many Americans think art and politics don't mix. "You have art off on one 
side being serene and decorative and inspiring and graceful and many other 
things, and then you have politics, which is low-down and dirty and also which 
is inevitably deforming to art. This is not the view in a great many cultures." 
</P>
<P>
People believe "poetry will lose its density and its complexity and its 
richness if it is informed by politics." In contrast, Rich thinks her own 
poetry has actually moved away from simplistic viewpoints through her 
involvement in politics. 
</P>
<P>
Feminism, Rich argues, provides new working situations "where your ideas are 
not only tolerated and . . . allowed to be spoken but are carried on and picked 
up and amplified and where you're being stimulated by others who are 
like-minded but have different perspectives on the same reality. That is such a 
charge. It can be incredibly depressing to feel that you are the only person in 
a situation who is thinking these thoughts and that you are going to have to 
be, let's say, the Jew in the room or the lesbian in the room or the feminist 
in the room and they (the men) will listen to you with tolerance and go on 
doing business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
"Politics enriches one's world view; it does not limit one's world view. When I 
say politics in this case, I am talking of the politics of opposition, the 
politics of empowering the disempowered." 
</P>
<P>
Rich, one sees from her conversation and her writing, has "a dream of a common 
language." If her poetry has a single motivating impulse, it is "the drive to 
connect, to make communication with others, to extend a hand outward hoping 
that another hand will reach it, to make bridges. That making of connections is 
very important. It's crucial in my politics and it's crucial in my poetry." 
</P>
<P>
Rich finds herself more oriented toward the Pacific since moving to California 
from Massachusetts in 1984. She has had rheumatoid arthritis since she was 21, 
and the Northeastern winters had grown harder and harder to endure. Living in 
California has not necessarily made her more creative, she says with a 
characteristic wry smile, but it has made her "differently creative." Very much 
a poet of landscape, there is new landscape to discover. "I don't think it's a 
bad thing in your life to have your whole orientation completely switched 
geographically." 
</P>
<P>
Critics have called Rich everything from an "exquisitely sensitive and 
brilliant poet" to one guilty of "radical witchery." Much honored, she 
nonetheless once rejected the National Book Award for herself but, with fellow 
poets and nominees Alice Walker and Audre Lord, accepted it for all women. 
</P>
<P>
She lives with poetry in her head. "I'm going about various things and as long 
as the various things are not too demanding or pressing I can keep the poem in 
the forefront . . . . I also need a lot of time to read poems. It's important 
for me to feed myself with poetry." 
</P>
<P>
One may not be able to make a living being a poet, Rich says, but now "one can 
be a poet and make a living" teaching, giving readings, working as an editor. 
The American poetry scene is richer now than it was when she started publishing 
in the 1950s in a figurative sense, she thinks, because "more diverse voices 
are being heard. The women's movement obviously opened up realms for women 
poets that had simply not been there." 
</P>
<P>
There has also been a proliferation of poetry by African-Americans, 
Asian-Americans, American Indians, Latinos. "In the 1950s there were basically 
two known camps of American poets, the beats and the academics. They were 
almost entirely white males, both of them." 
</P>
<P>
Rich has long kept track of herself, as she puts it, by keeping a journal. At 
60, "you are looking backward on the past with a much bigger vista than you can 
when you're 16 or 26 or 36. Some things that loomed very large are flattened 
out and other things you see which you never saw before. So that's partly the 
meaning of 'Time's Power,' the power of time to transform your personal 
landscape." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Rich's poetry is autobiography; some is fiction. Columbia University 
literature professor Carolyn Heilbrun says that Rich, "more than anyone else," 
revolutionized women's autobiography. She "sought again and again to identify 
herself in new ways, ways guaranteed to be upsetting to the neat, orderly world 
from which she came." 
</P>
<P>
Rich's work speaks particularly to women but she seems to be trying to push 
both sexes toward a realization that neither should be the sole definer of 
reality. "The vision of reality that we have been given has been filtered 
through the male and has been structured by males and even our view of 
ourselves has been structured" by men. "You do not understand the history of 
the human species if you do not understand the history of both genders." 
</P>
<P>
Rich was waiting, with wild patience, for an organized feminist movement for a 
long time, "thinking my thoughts in secret, reading Simone de Beauvoir and Mary 
Wollstonecraft and wishing I could know those women and talk to them and then 
beginning to know women who thought that way and had that kind of a fire and 
hunger for freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Had she grown up with a different kind of history, "I can imagine myself having 
become very eccentric, a very encoded poet who wrote obscure, difficult poems 
because she didn't want to expose herself too much and whose energy was very 
much given to concealment of various kinds. For me, feminism's political vision 
of the world was such an endowment of energy. It released so much energy into 
my poetry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>

LOSS OF HABITATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a species is threatened with extinction, the parties causing the 
extinction (e.g. loggers, developers, dam builders) tend to focus upon the 
particular plant or animal in question and ask whether this one bird or mouse 
is more important than a highway or some other project. This begs the point. 
</P>
<P>
Endangered species are a symptom of a greater threat: loss of habitat. The 
spotted owl is endangered because old growth forests are vanishing (editorial, 
"Protection -- at Last," May 2). The least Bell's vireo is endangered because 
riparian habitat is vanishing. The same holds true for almost every other 
threatened species. Unfortunately, there is no Endangered Habitat Act, so we 
are forced to rely upon the Endangered Species Act, hence the argument over 
obscure butterflies and secretive salt marsh birds. 
</P>
<P>
If we are logging our old growth forests at a faster rate than they are being 
replaced, then the timber industry in the northwest is doomed anyhow. It is 
mathematically impossible to sustain this trend. 
</P>
<P>
The timber states should concentrate their efforts upon diversifying their 
economies while they still have time. 
</P>
<P>
The northern spotted owl is but a harbinger of things to come.

In response to "Beirut Reels Under Savage Shelling; 16 Killed, 53 Hurt," Part 
I, Page 16, May 9: 
</P>
<P>
The article states: "Remorseless artillery fire battered Beirut . . . most 
savage shelling of Lebanon . . . 2,000 shells, rockets, mortars . . . nearly 
two-month battle . . . 316 dead and 1,184 injured . . . hospitals, schools . . 
. hit in relentless eight-hour barrage. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Christian sector is being decimated by some 20,000-30,000 Syrian occupying 
forces along with Syrian-backed Lebanese Muslims. All this under the guise of 
Syria's occupation being that of "the settling police force" to keep the peace 
in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Where are Christian leaders raising their voices anywhere in the world 
(including the Pope) to help stave off the massacre of their fellow Christians? 
Why haven't Arab brothers and sisters anywhere in the world become vocal on 
behalf of their fellow Arabs? 
</P>
<P>
Have we witnessed any emergency sessions within the United Nations to condemn 
the slaughter of Arabs by other Arabs? Why? Why? No daily words from the press 
on front pages or television strongly condemning this genocide. The silence is 
terrifying! 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the death of an Arab only becomes meaningful and worthy of 
headlines and international condemnation when a Jewish Israeli pulls the 
trigger.

<TEXT>
<P>
It must be exasperating for the White House to watch Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev taking bows in the East and the West like some conquering Caesar. 
But on the global scale in which the Bush Administration surely will one day 
learn to operate, exasperation is what makes big-league diplomats really turn 
on the charm, not lapse into name-calling. 
</P>
<P>
If it was the purpose of Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, in 
calling Gorbachev a "drugstore cowboy" to cut the Soviet leader down to size in 
the eyes of the world, he failed. For one thing, the slur belongs to an earlier 
generation, and few Americans and fewer Russians know what it means. Even the 
lexicons leave some question about whether a drugstore cowboy is more a fraud 
than a fox. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of knocking Gorbachev off his pedestal, the episode simply emphasized 
again that Bush so far has failed to articulate what he wants for his nation in 
a world of rapid change, and how he can best get it, particularly when it 
involves dealing with Gorbachev. Worse, all that his advertised review of 
foreign policy strategy has produced along that line is another voice from the 
past, a proposal to let reconnaissance planes fly at will over both eastern and 
western countries. 
</P>
<P>
What the nation needs from its President now is a strategy for moving as fast 
as possible to trim nuclear arsenals to whatever minimum number is needed to 
deter conventional war. 
</P>
<P>
It needs quick and massive reductions in ground and tactical air forces that 
face each other in Central Europe, along the lines already suggested -- again 
taking the initiative -- by Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more important is the need for a coherent strategy for disengaging 
Eastern European nations from the control of -- indeed the armed occupation by 
-- the Soviet Union and letting them turn toward their historic roots in the 
West. That must be done without the kinds of sudden moves that might lead to 
violence and, in turn, far more serious confrontation between East and West 
than now exists. It will take considerably more delicate maneuvering than the 
trips Bush plans to Poland and Hungary, both of which may look good on 
television, but neither of which can substitute for years of solid and 
difficult diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also needs to hold the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
together for as long as it takes to achieve the other goals. But the sluggish 
pace of strategic thought in the White House these days not only risks but also 
encourages a breakup of the Western Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Bush should be more concerned than he seems to be, for example, that Paul H. 
Nitze, former chief arms control adviser for President Reagan, is appalled at 
the Bush Administration's opposition to West Germany's yearning for 
negotiations with the Soviets to reduce the stock of short-range nuclear 
missiles that are on its land, or pointed at its land. Nitze provided much of 
the intellectual justification for hard-line U.S. positions in the Cold War and 
has worked just as hard in recent years to take advantage of the opportunity 
for a thaw. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have fallen back into sullen old habits as a result of the argument 
over whether to modernize U.S. short-range missiles or negotiate smaller 
arsenals. Twice in the past week, ranking Soviet officials have threatened to 
leave in place some SS-23 missiles that they agreed more than a year ago to 
take out of the European theater under the INF treaty that called for 
abolishing an entire class of U.S. and Soviet medium range missiles. In typical 
Cold War rhetoric, the Soviets are now engaged in endless denials that such a 
clear violation of the treaty would be no violation at all. 
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later, Bush will discover that these and other irritations and 
exasperations tend to grow when the superpowers are yelling at one another 
instead of talking with one another. He will have a better chance to achieve 
the nation's goals if he makes the discovery sooner.

BR'ER NRA IS COZY IN BUSH'S BRIER PATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST B. FURGURSON, Ernest B. Furgurson writes a syndicated column in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Br'er Rabbit is the National Rifle Assn. The brier patch is President Bush's 
new $1.2-billion anti-crime package. 
</P>
<P>
The NRA wailed predictably that the President would violate the Bill of Rights 
and deprive patriotic American voters of their constitutional right to pack the 
firepower of a Marine infantry battalion. Now the arms industry, driving force 
of the NRA, will make even more profits out of the President's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the package is what its title claims: anti-crime. It includes tougher 
sentencing, more jail cells and hundreds of new federal agents and prosecutors. 
The controversial and sadly laughable part is about controlling deadly weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Four modifiers are necessary to describe the guns that Bush dared suggest 
banning: "certain imported semiautomatic assault" weapons. 
</P>
<P>
That's slicing it pretty thin. And those weapons would be permanently banned 
only if a government review finds that they are not for sporting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic production and sale of such weapons -- three-fourths of the total -- 
would not be affected. Of course, they fire just as fast and kill just as 
efficiently as the imported models. But the only restriction on them would be 
to ban cartridge magazines holding more than 15 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
That's slicing it even thinner. Bush said that magazines feeding 15-plus rounds 
are "unjustifiably large." Thus, those holding 15 or fewer are justifiably 
large. 
</P>
<P>
The fuss over "semiautomatic assault weapons" has distracted from the serious 
question of gun control. The most emotional control advocates are simply 
ignorant of what the terms mean. The gun lobby is happy to watch a fierce 
debate over this marginal issue while debate over the vast majority of deadly 
weapons is forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Some advocates have urged a ban on all semiautomatic weapons. That means all 
guns that chamber another round for firing after each trigger pull. The 
familiar Dick Tracy "automatic" and Army Colt .45 "automatic" pistol are 
semiautomatics. So are hunting rifles and shotguns that fire one shot with each 
trigger pull, without manual cocking or feeding. 
</P>
<P>
The great 1989 campaign against "semi-automatic" weapons began with the 
massacre of children in a California schoolyard. As Bush noted, the murderer 
used an AK-47, the Soviet assault rifle with which communist arsenals have 
flooded the world. The AK-47, like the American M-16, can be rendered fully 
automatic, firing bursts with a single trigger pull, and is often used that way 
in combat. 
</P>
<P>
To control all semiautomatics might be a good thing, but that's not what the 
current hullabaloo is about. However, the President did his bit to confuse the 
question further. He decided to define assault weapons as those with magazines 
feeding more than 15 rounds, and to halt their import (but not their 
manufacture here). Yet he spoke of boosting penalties for use of "semiautomatic 
weapons." Does he mean that, or does he mean assault weapons? There would be 
little point in toughening up against criminals who use slide-operated pistols 
but not against those who use revolvers. There also seems little point in 
banning imported weapons but shrugging at identical domestic ones. 
</P>
<P>
Little practical point, that is. Politically, there is a major point: While the 
gun lobby, as a matter of tactics, rises up against all gun controls, its 
special interest is the U.S. arms industry. It won the Administration debate 
leading up to Bush's anti-crime package, as it has won repeatedly against 
congressional arms-control efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The gun lobby argues that any slightest restriction on firearms in any city or 
state is a first step toward destroying the Davy Crockett tradition in America. 
The simplest gun nuts actually believe that. But the more sophisticated know 
better. They are publicly upset today, as if Bush had dealt their business a 
mortal blow instead of a meaningless feather-tap. But they are chortling as 
they shriek. (Try it). 
</P>
<P>
By condemning over-15-round magazines and blessing 15-and-under, Bush has 
created for them a new marketing opportunity. Watch for it in all your 
"outdoor" magazines: the 2-for-1 deal on 15-round banana clips, tailor-made for 
your AK-47, M-16, Uzi, all your favorite sporting rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, guns don't kill people, magazines do.

They come wrapped in black vinyl casings, surrounded by crumpled sheets of 
brown paper or folded into envelopes resembling masks, often accented with 
dried flowers, tied with straw, sometimes three-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever it is for, an invitation designed by Marc P. Friedland is 
unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
Friedland is one of the city's hottest invitation designers, turning out 
elaborate private, corporate and charity party invitations, many one-of-a-kind, 
hand-painted and hand-assembled. 
</P>
<P>
He's the 29-year-old creative force behind his 3-year-old company, Artafax, 
subtitled "Individually created originals for originally creative individuals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whirl of the Party Circuit 
</P>
<P>
That Los Angeles can support an invitation designer is indicative of the 
crowded and competitive party scene. An invitation must scream from a stack of 
mail in order to be noticed. 
</P>
<P>
So Friedland has become painter, advertiser, publicist and graphic designer all 
in one. 
</P>
<P>
"The more they hold an invitation in their hand, that time is what you're 
buying also," Friedland says. "It registers in the subconscious. It's more of a 
marketing tool for people. . . . What is an invitation but a great way of 
advertising an event?" 
</P>
<P>
His much-noticed invitations have included one for actress Molly Ringwald's 
21st birthday party (celadon green paper trimmed with French linen eyelet), the 
Joffrey Ballet's spring season opening (a three-dimensional design using 
cut-out photographs of dancers), a bat mitzvah (done with pink and purple 
tie-dyed Japanese rice paper) and a wedding (printed on heavy-stock paper in 
which seasonal French wildflowers had been pressed). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Off-the-Wall Materials 
</P>
<P>
Simple invitations run about $14 each; $20 is average for something more 
elaborate. The most expensive one Friedland has designed -- $65 each -- was for 
an Academy Award party in New York. It was in a film canister decorated with 
popcorn and soda miniatures and was hand-delivered by messengers dressed in 
usher uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Other materials he's used include copper sheeting, wire, bark, vinyl, rubber 
and Astro Turf. Says Friedland: "It's looking at commonplace things with new 
meaning, like when (architect) Frank Gehry used corrugated cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
"With most of our invitations," he adds, "you really feel that it's been 
handled, it's been touched, there's human interaction involved, and that's 
really what makes it special. I think people really pick up on all that, on a 
live flower that's placed in an invitation, or the fact that the paper was 
crumbled. In today's day and age, with all the technology, anything that brings 
back the richness and the attention paid to something is bound to be noticed." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Friedland will handle several hundred projects; he's currently 
working on 20 at once in various stages. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a lively former New Jerseyite with a fondness for bizarre ties, 
like the extra-wide psychedelic one he's wearing today from the Hadassah Thrift 
Store. 
</P>
<P>
He planned a career in public health before he was sidetracked into graphic 
design. He professes no outstanding early art talent, although he admits his 
attraction to "weird things" dates back to his youth when he wrote letters on 
airsick bags ("They fold real nicely") and mailed them to friends. 
</P>
<P>
After earning a BA in pre-med and psychology from the University of Miami and a 
master's degree from UCLA in health education and behavioral sciences, 
Friedland had a tough time finding a job. 
</P>
<P>
The graduation cards (filled with philosophical quotes) he made for friends 
were so well-received he decided to make other occasion cards and sell them to 
earn some money. 
</P>
<P>
He was designer and salesman in one, selling door-to-door to local stores under 
the name Fine Lines. As business grew he hired a sales rep and as business 
grew, expanded nationwide, eventually selling his cards in 400 stores. The 
greeting cards sustained him until someone who received one of his greeting 
cards asked Friedland to do her wedding invitations. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never thought about them before then," Friedland says. "I just wasn't 
aware of the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
But the marketplace was ready for him, and it was through word of mouth that 
his business expanded and has since grown, adding charity events (which now 
take up 50% of his business). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charity Circuit 
</P>
<P>
Party hosts agree that the more elaborate the invitation, the better the 
response from guests, confirming the adage that you have to spend money to make 
money. While this is important with most events, it's especially true on the 
charity circuit, where more ticket sales mean more profits for an organization. 
</P>
<P>
County Chief of Protocol Sandra Ausman has been involved with fund-raising 
committees for years. "I see people saying, 'Hey, we don't need people to spend 
that kind of money, we should be giving it back to the charity.' But for 
certain things that doesn't work. To send just a letter for the opening of (the 
Joffrey Ballet's performance of) 'The Nutcracker' doesn't work. Certain things 
require more." 
</P>
<P>
Since last June Friedland's invitations have completely nudged out the greeting 
cards, and he is now expanding to include designing room amenity packages for 
the new Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel, as well as other non-invitation 
projects in Los Angeles and around the country. 
</P>
<P>
His staff now numbers eight, and all the designing (sometimes done on 
Friedland's seven-month-old Macintosh computer), painting and assembling is 
done out of a loft where the floor has recently been painted in primary colors 
and abstract shapes, not unlike his invitations. 
</P>
<P>
The location on Washington Boulevard near La Brea is in a historic but hardly 
chic area of town. Clients sometimes balk at having to go there, but Friedland 
loves the worn buildings where jazz musicians used to congregate. 
</P>
<P>
Some clients come to him with vague notions of what they want their invitations 
to look like. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nonverbal Cues' 
</P>
<P>
"When people can't describe the feeling they want to get from the party, then 
it becomes very difficult," Friedland says. "That's when I have to pull it out 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
He also picks up on "nonverbal cues" by noticing what his clients wear, 
"because it's all a sense of style. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually like parties that aren't theme-oriented because you can express in 
a subtle way that person's sense of style. That's very different from doing a 
Roaring '20s party. So I ask the person if they like black and white, are they 
conservative, offbeat, do they like concrete or organic things, glitzy things. 
It's almost like working with them as a therapist." 
</P>
<P>
But neither Friedland nor the client has final say over an invitation -- the 
Post Office does. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's disappointing when we come up with completely crazy things that 
don't go through the mail. Then we have to rework things. Lately the Post 
Office has gotten very mechanized, but we're still trying to push the limits." 
</P>
<P>
Nanette Pattee Francini hired Friedland to do the invitations for an opening 
party for the Sports Club/Irvine, of which she is vice president and co-founder 
(along with the Sports Club/LA) after hearing about his work from a caterer. 
</P>
<P>
"The clubs are an extension of me, of my personal style, and I like to dress 
and feel like I'm always on vacation, and that's how I want the clubs to feel. 
I had confidence that he would come up with something unique, an art piece in 
itself. It was our first introduction to the community down there, and he came 
up with a hand-painted invitation that wasn't really whimsical, but very 
classy." 
</P>
<P>
Friedland worked with Joffrey Ballet managing board member Phyllis Hennigan to 
design two of the ballet's invitations: a potpourri-scented plaid and lace 
design for last December's "Nutcracker," and the recent contemporary invitation 
with pop-out black and white cut-outs of two dancers, one clutching a real 
piece of orange tulle. 
</P>
<P>
Hennigan likes the concept of an invitation that involves more than yanking it 
out of an envelope. "Because you have to do something with it, you do read it," 
she says. "It sort of says something more to you. I like that." 
</P>
<P>
If there is a downside to having startlingly creative invitations, it is that 
it puts enormous pressure on hosts to throw a party worthy of the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they send an invitation, then it has to be a great party," Friedland 
says. "One area where I can be really disappointed, and this might be a 
complete ego thing, is when we really work hard to do a great invitation, and 
sometimes people fail to recognize what importance that has in setting the tone 
of the party. It's all on a very subtle qualitative type of level. So after 
we've kind of poured our hearts, and they just don't get the whole thing, 
that's kind of a disappointment."

ALICE KAHN: WAY OUT IN RANCHO MUCHO ARE THE FAUX THINGS IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were heading toward Rancho Mucho Dinero, my friend Peter and I. We were 
doing what people do for kicks these days. See, we don't do drugs. We don't do 
cholesterol. We do open houses. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Mucho is the name I have given to a certain development of 
million-dollar-plus houses an hour out of town where civilization and water 
once stopped. There, in that arid, Godforsaken place, we suddenly come to a 
faux lake, a faux creek and a faux waterfall. We are about to enter an entire 
faux universe. 
</P>
<P>
To get through the locked gates, we must first visit the sales office. "Wait a 
minute," Peter says. "What's our story?" 
</P>
<P>
"No story," I tell him. "I'll just say my husband, Shlomo, and I are looking 
for a nice Hasidic community. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In the sales office, standing beneath a huge poster showing the security patrol 
that protects Rancho Mucho, is a latter-day suburban salesman. His impeccable 
dress is marred only by his dragon breath. He tells us that there are no open 
houses today, but we can drive around and look at the full range of properties 
in the Rancho Mucho community. It turns out the place is well stocked with less 
publicized cheapos. 
</P>
<P>
We could start with the $300,000 town homes in the Point Negras Blancas area. 
"They'll be selling for $400,000 in six months," the salesman warns. If they're 
still standing. 
</P>
<P>
I began to wonder if the million-dollar jobs were the loss leaders for these 
mass items. 
</P>
<P>
Next, we could visit the Vista del Visa pool homes, right there on the main 
road and priced to move at $750,000. And, finally, old fire breath suggests, we 
could drive up toward the million-dollar customized homes on "The Gold Coast." 
</P>
<P>
Coast? What coast? The nearest body of water is 80 miles west. 
</P>
<P>
We cruise the dry coast but can only press our noses at a locked gate within 
the gates. Here, a gardener points out the manor house up on the hill, a 
30,000-square-foot hacienda that the developer of Rancho Mucho has built for 
himself. "The bedroom is 4,800 square feet," the gardener says. Then he adds, 
laughing: "I don't know what they do there." 
</P>
<P>
He is busy working on the faux green lawn of a big pink Mediterranean, where a 
brass plaque announces that the house is titled: "Una Espressione D'Amore." 
</P>
<P>
We stop off at Rancho Mucho's own supermarket, Alpha Mucho, which has items 
ranging from a little bag of potato chips to a nine-liter bottle of Moet &amp; 
Chandon for $475. In the corner of the black-and-white tiled floor, a pianist 
plays a grand piano that is parked near the veggies. I recognize the Muzakified 
strains of an old Beatles tune: "I don't care too much for money -- money can't 
buy me love. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, I come back to the open houses. I must see what lurks behind 
the faux Tudor exteriors. This time I bring my real husband instead of my faux 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
During the time between my first and second visit to this real estate 
Disneyland, I have reread "The Great Gatsby," Fitzgerald's saga about a guy 
with a mansion trying to win the love of a gal. Gatsby's pad is an "imitation 
of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side . . . and a marble 
swimming pool and more than 40 acres of lawn and garden." 
</P>
<P>
The houses at Rancho Mucho are no less pretentious but sit on small lots, one 
on top of the other, your Jacuzzi up against your neighbor's wet bar. 
</P>
<P>
In the wine cellar of an executive Georgian, I inspect a case of bottles 
stacked on its side. The label reads, "Cheap Red Wine." 
</P>
<P>
My husband notes the high voltage line running directly over a 1985 antebellum 
mansion. He looks up from the veranda and says, "Five bedrooms, a pool, a fur 
closet and cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Every house has a library -- a man's room, all in dark wood, with bar, mahogany 
desk, leather desk set and wooden duck decoys. I had heard that the books 
weren't real or that they were painted-on faux libraries. Or perhaps the 
volumes were acquired from some "Books by the Yard" discount store. But the 
books I saw were real. Each house had a well-worn copy of "Iacocca" among the 
untouched leather sets. 
</P>
<P>
I thought about a scene in "The Great Gatsby" set in Gatsby's "high Gothic 
library, paneled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete 
from some ruin overseas." There, a drunken man is raving about the books. He 
says, "Absolutely real -- have pages and everything. I thought they'd be of a 
nice durable cardboard. . . . He didn't cut the pages but what do you want? 
What do you expect?" 
</P>
<P>
After looking at three of these houses, my husband began to get ill. He 
compared it to mall syndrome and thought the decaying formaldehyde in the 
building materials was getting to him. "I hate the 20th Century," he said as we 
drove off over the faux bridge at Rancho Mucho. 
</P>
<P>
But I think what was really sickening him was the thought that this was all a 
million dollars gets you these days. That's why the middle class loves to laugh 
at the nouveau riche. All that effort for so little more. You can't be a Great 
Gatsby; you can only be a tract Gatsby. 
</P>
<P>
It's a faux world after all.

FIGHT FOR BABY: NEW CONFLICT IN ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TEL AVIV 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only God knows where baby Lena is. Whose God is also in question. 
</P>
<P>
Lena was born five months ago, the daughter of Zaki Amudi and Norit Yehuda. 
Amudi is Muslim, a Palestinian from Khan Yunis, a dusty refugee camp in the 
Gaza Strip. Yehuda is Jewish, an Israeli from Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
That Amudi and Yehuda should have chosen to spend their lives together was 
considered a scandal by not a few Palestinians and Israelis. Star-crossed tales 
of forbidden love between Arab and Israeli, Muslim and Jew, make news in this 
part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
But the fate of Lena, whose name was chosen by her parents because it is common 
in both Jewish and Arab cultures, is especially tangled. Members of Yehuda's 
family decided that no matter what Amudi and Yehuda might do with their lives, 
Lena should be brought up Jewish, beyond the care and control of either parent, 
especially the father. 
</P>
<P>
The baby is being reared in a secret place. If Norit Yehuda, 24, knows where 
Lena is, she is not telling. 
</P>
<P>
An Israeli newspaper has reported that the infant is with an ultra-religious 
family in the Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Bnei Brak, a suburb of Tel Aviv. 
The report has not been confirmed, however. 
</P>
<P>
Amudi, 26, wants the baby returned to her mother, and he has gone to court to 
demand that he be allowed to see the infant. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the dramatic aspects of the family strife, religious rivalry and 
possibly kidnaping, the case is attracting special interest here because of its 
place at the junction of struggles involving life and politics. 
</P>
<P>
Israel defines itself as a Jewish state. The government has ceded to rabbis a 
certain authority over the private lives of its citizens, including marriage. 
Will a civil court now reclaim a Jewish child on behalf of a Muslim who under 
religious law is not married to the mother? Is Israel going to be forced to 
take up the long-postponed question of separation of synagogue and state? 
</P>
<P>
The passions of the Arab uprising are also in play. Lawyers for Yehuda's family 
have raised the specter of danger and mistreatment for the mother and child 
should she live her life with a Palestinian. 
</P>
<P>
"This case brings all our problems together," said Shulamit Aloni, a civil 
rights activist and member of the Israeli Parliament. "The benefit of a child 
is being buried by conflicts we Israelis have yet to resolve for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Marriage 
</P>
<P>
Even before there was a State of Israel, the British government here and the 
Turkish government before it left the question of marriage to heads of the 
religious communities, Christian, Jewish and Muslim. The early Israeli 
government, intent on attracting the loyalty of observant Jews, continued the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, there is no civil marriage in Israel. In the case of mixed marriages, 
Israelis are forced to take roundabout measures to avoid religious authority. 
They can marry abroad or they can sign a marriage contract in the presence of a 
lawyer that ensures inheritance and support rights between husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
Amudi and Yehuda signed such a contract, and, in Israel, are considered a 
common-law couple. And what of the child? Under Islamic religious law, if the 
father is Muslim, so is the child. Under Jewish law, if the mother is Jewish, 
so is the child. In Israel, the child will be registered as Jewish by the 
Interior Ministry, which is under the control of Orthodox rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
"To carry it to the absurd, if the father was Jewish and the mother Muslim, the 
child would have no religion at all," said Aloni, the civil rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
The romance of Amudi and Yehuda began two years ago at the chocolate factory 
where both worked. They courted for two years, at first meeting for coffee, 
then for strolls -- and finally on secret trips to coastal towns like Haifa and 
Acco, far from prying eyes in Tel Aviv, where they both have friends. 
</P>
<P>
In time, both families learned of the relationship; both objected. Amudi's 
family in Khan Yunis told him he should leave Tel Aviv, that it would be 
dangerous to carry on with the association. Yehuda's family ordered her not to 
see Amudi anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The lovers kept in contact by telephone. Yehuda timed the illicit conversations 
so that calls were made when her parents were not at home, Amudi said. Secret, 
intermittent rendezvous continued. Amudi moved to Tel Aviv so that the 
courtship would not be interrupted either by his family or by the periodic 
closure of the Gaza Strip because of violence connected with the Arab uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Amudi and Yehuda made a fateful decision in the hope of resolving 
their problem. "We decided to have a baby so that both families would agree to 
our marriage," said Amudi, who works at odd jobs in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
After Yehuda became pregnant, the couple signed a marriage contract and started 
living together. 
</P>
<P>
But neither the pregnancy nor the marriage soothed emotions. Yehuda's parents 
followed their daughter to Amudi's apartment and dragged her home after a 
shouting match with the stocky Palestinian. 
</P>
<P>
"In Jewish culture, the daughter is the property of her parents until she is 
married," said Uri Steinmetz, the lawyer representing Yehuda's family. "Norit 
followed her parents' wishes. They do not consider her married to the Arab." 
</P>
<P>
Late last fall, a religious acquaintance of the Yehuda family took Norit, 
already late in her pregnancy, to the United States, presumably to have the 
baby delivered there. Civil rights advocates suspect that the trip was arranged 
by ultra-Orthodox Jews who oppose any mixed marriages and who planned to have 
the baby reared in an Orthodox Jewish community in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, Yehuda became desperate and reached Amudi by phone. With the aid 
of secular Israeli politicians and the FBI, she was located in Baltimore and 
was spirited back to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
After her return, the reunited couple visited Amudi's family in the Khan Yunis 
refugee camp; during the visit, Yehuda gave birth in a Palestinian hospital. 
Amudi and Yehuda moved to Rishon Le Zion, a town south of Tel Aviv, to begin 
life anew in a small apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we could live happily ever after," Amudi said. "We were wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, just before Passover, Yehuda's father and brother came to implore 
her to visit her home. "They told Norit that her mother was about to die from 
grief and she had to visit," Amudi recalled. "So we agreed." 
</P>
<P>
But he insisted on keeping the baby. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Yehuda phoned and said she wanted to have her daughter with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"Norit's father got on the phone and said, 'You have no Norit,' " Amudi said, 
"and told me to bring the child. Norit got on the phone and said bring Lena, 
that we would raise her together." 
</P>
<P>
Amudi said he delivered the child through a friend, and then received a call 
from an uncle of his wife, who told him: "You have no child and you have no 
Norit. Go away." 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to see my daughter," Amudi said. 
</P>
<P>
Is he still in love with Norit? 
</P>
<P>
"Ken," he answered in Hebrew, blushing. "Yes. I think we can make it together." 
</P>
<P>
Amudi's case is based on narrow questions of parental rights. He wants to see 
the baby, he wants visitation rights and wants to be allowed, with his wife, to 
rear the child under the supervision of a social worker. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer for Yehuda's family opposes this plan, building a defense on Amudi's 
status as a Muslim and Palestinian. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as marriage between a Jew and a non-Jew," lawyer 
Steinmetz said. "Amudi wants to see the baby. OK. But the problem is years 
later. What will be good for the child? In kindergarten, would it be good for 
the child to hear other children say she has a dirty Arab for a father? 
</P>
<P>
"It is painful for Jews. If a Jewish girl marries an Arab, sometimes the 
parents hold a Shiva, seven days of mourning."

IT'S A CASE OF JUSTICE FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roger Simon's writing is the greatest, but a statement he made on May 5 must be 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
He said ". . . Tower can't get on the Supreme Court. He is not a lawyer. 
Otherwise, Bush probably would put him there." 
</P>
<P>
The truth of it is that there are no legal qualifications for the post of 
Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. You don't have to be a lawyer, just get 
yourself appointed by the President. 
</P>
<P>
No justice before the 20th Century even had a law degree. Oliver Wendell Holmes 
Jr., appointed in 1902, was the first to have one. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Bush shouldn't read this or John Tower may become the shortest justice 
after all.

In response to "Growing Up Different" and especially to the quote by USC law 
professor Michael Shapiro: "Everyone has procreational autonomy. We don't 
require licenses for people to reproduce." 
</P>
<P>
A question: Why not? 
</P>
<P>
We require a license for marriage. Doesn't reproduction have a much greater 
effect on every aspect of society?

GUTS, GLORY AND THEIR EGOS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Guts, Glory and No Regrets" (May 10): After reading Josh Getlin's article 
on Col. David Hackworth, U.S.A.-retired, one concludes that the difference 
between Gen. George Patton and Hackworth can be summed up briefly: both had 
tremendous egos and both served their country with optimal distinction. 
However, Patton put country above ego in the final test, and that makes all the 
difference in the world.

STAKING A SMALL CLAIM IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article of May 11, "How to Proceed in Small Claims Court" (Legal View by 
Jeffrey S. Klein), was most instructive and should certainly help litigants to 
be better prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The public, however, should have been made aware that a Small Claims Advisory 
Service exists (at the request of the courts) and is run for the benefit of the 
consumer by the County of Los Angeles under the auspices of Consumer Affairs. 
Any Small Claims Court Clerk will give out the number of the nearest advisory 
service (there are several locations throughout the county). Advisers give 
non-legal advice to plaintiffs or defendants on procedural matters, fees, 
subpoenas, appeals, collection methods and general conduct in Small Claims 
Court.

GRATEFUL EX-GI'S SON BUYS AND FIXES UP LEGION HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Out of work and far from his family after the end of World War II, a 
Japanese-American ex-GI was turned away from other American Legion halls 
because of his race. But he ate Thanksgiving dinner at Beverly Hills Post No. 
253. 
</P>
<P>
The memory of that meal was still warm four decades later, when his son heard 
about Post 253's plight: Faced with the need to put on a $50,000 roof that the 
post could not afford, its commander was offering to surrender the bunker-like 
meeting hall to developers in exchange for space in a new office building, but 
there were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
The son, who asked that his family not be identified by name, sent a copy of 
the story to his father, now a prosperous Northern California businessman. 
</P>
<P>
The father consulted with his brothers, fellow veterans of the 442nd Regimental 
Combat Team, a largely Japanese-American unit that fought with distinction in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Welcome Exception 
</P>
<P>
"These guys went straight from the (internment) camps to the front lines," the 
son recalls. As Japanese-Americans, they were not welcomed everywhere when they 
came home, but the Thanksgiving dinner on Robertson Boulevard was an exception. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad and uncles said, 'These people let us in!' So I bought the property for 
a substantial amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
The sale was recorded April 24. But there will be no new building. Instead, the 
American Legion post will retain control of its meeting hall for five years, 
paying rent of $1 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The new owner already has sent workers to install the new roof, paint the walls 
inside and out, and put in a new kitchen and bar. 
</P>
<P>
After five years, he plans to take control of the building and convert it into 
a restaurant or some other venture. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll think about it then," said the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting Place Assured 
</P>
<P>
But the veterans will be able to keep meeting within its nine-inch-thick 
concrete walls at least one Monday a month until the year 2014, if there are 
enough of them around to keep the post going. 
</P>
<P>
The Legion's bylaws require that veterans must have served in wartime to be 
eligible for membership. By 2014, even the youngest of the relatively few 
Vietnam vet Legionnaires will be nearing old age. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't ask for anything better. When you've found an angel, you don't need 
a developer," said Ruth Langes, a Coast Guard veteran who is adjutant of the 
post. She also chairs the board of the Beverly Hills American Legion Community 
Clubhouse Inc., a separate legal entity that owns the meeting hall and its 
6,612-square-foot lot on Robertson Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The post has been meeting there since the building was erected in 1937, but it 
came into its glory days during World War II, when Marlene Dietrich sang for 
servicemen and Red Skelton drew crowds there with impromptu performances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Years of Neglect 
</P>
<P>
That period of prosperity was followed by years of neglect. The World War I 
vets who founded the organization grew old and died, many of their younger 
comrades from World War II turned their attention elsewhere and Vietnam vets 
hardly joined at all. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why this makes sense for us," said the 31-year-old buyer. "Most of 
these guys won't be alive in 25 years, and at the end of 25 years the building 
is mine. . . . When I'm 50 years old, it's going to be worth a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Purchased from the city of Beverly Hills for $10 in 1936, the land was recently 
valued at about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
But it had little appeal for developers, because the Legion's demand for space 
on the ground floor would have meant a drastic reduction in rental income from 
an office building or other commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zoning Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
Any project would have been further complicated by zoning regulations, which 
limit construction to three stories or 45 feet in height and require two 
stories of underground parking. 
</P>
<P>
"You're never going to be able to tear that building down. It's not economical 
to tear it down," the buyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Although sales records indicate that the full price of the property was 
$200,000, the real estate agent who arranged the deal said that future payments 
will bring the total cost to nearly $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the new paint job and other improvements are bringing back some 
members who have not been seen around the meeting hall for years, Langes said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting quite a crowd at our monthly meeting, which is beautiful," she 
said. "This last time we had 25 people in there, which is more than we've had 
in ages." 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills group has 326 members. But it is expected to increase to more 
than 500 in June, when it is scheduled to be merged with the Palomar post, 
which now meets in a Knights of Columbus hall in downtown Los Angeles.

WHITTIER NEARS FINAL VOTE ON UPTOWN PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WHITTIER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nineteen months after the Whittier Narrows earthquake destroyed many businesses 
in the historic Uptown Village section, the City Council is poised to adopt a 
blueprint that calls for an upscale commercial district anchored by a showcase 
shopping and entertainment plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The council will hold its final public hearing on Tuesday, and is expected to 
vote on the long-awaited plan, which was prepared by the Pasadena-based Arroyo 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
If adopted by the council, the $90,000 Uptown Whittier Specific Plan, which was 
released last week, will be added to the city's general plan, City Clerk 
Gertrude L. Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
The consulting firm drafted the inch-thick document after a series of hearings 
and meetings with community leaders, city officials and business owners, 
according to City Manager Thomas Mauk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eight Buildings Started 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake, 17 buildings in Uptown were 
knocked down. So far, construction has begun on eight commercial buildings 
within the area, some of which do not conform to a number of development 
standards outlined in the Arroyo plan, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents and small business owners feared that in the rush to replace 
destroyed buildings, developers would create a "hodgepodge" of retail and light 
industrial outlets, according to an introduction in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-member Citizen's Advisory Committee was formed to help city officials 
and the Chamber of Commerce come up with a long-range development plan, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the final document that arose out of that process," Mauk said. "We 
feel that it will set the pattern and style (of the Uptown Whittier district) 
for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Control Development 
</P>
<P>
Although the plan would not generally dictate architectural design, it would 
control future commercial and residential development by reshuffling zoning in 
a 33-block area bounded by Penn Street on the south, Painter Avenue on the 
east, Hadley Street on the north and Pickering Avenue on the east. 
</P>
<P>
It also would create new commercial and residential zoning categories to 
protect historical property and encourage Uptown residents to shop locally. 
</P>
<P>
According to the ambitious plan, the intersection of Greenleaf Avenue and 
Philadelphia Street -- the area hardest hit by the temblor -- would feature a 
pedestrian mall and cinema center. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for rezoning commercial property to build more apartment 
complexes in an eight-block area bounded by Washington Avenue the east, Penn 
Street on the south, Bright Avenue on the west and Wardman Street on the north. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan does increase (residential) density," Redevelopment Project Manager 
Anthony Ybarra said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that adding more residents to the area would provide more business for 
future retail stores, which are planned along Greenleaf and Philadelphia. "They 
would support, they would play off each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, residents angrily denounced the initial plan because it included a 
provision to build bed-and-breakfast houses and small shops near Central Park. 
Many of the city's first homes were built in an area surrounding the park, and 
residents feared that some of those historical buildings would be converted for 
commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Zoning Categories 
</P>
<P>
As a result of residents' concerns, officials have created two new zoning 
categories to be used around picturesque Central Park: Historic Residential and 
Historic Office. The Historic Residential category prohibits developers from 
buying old homes, tearing them down and building apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
The Historic Office was drafted specifically to protect old buildings along 
Painter. Historical homes that are sold along that tree-lined business street 
could only be converted into offices. The structures must remain intact, Ybarra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also creates the Specialty Retail and Community Retail zone 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
Specialty Retail outlets, which would include theaters, restaurants and 
clothing shops would be centered along Greenleaf. Community Retail outlets, 
consisting of liquor stores, small grocery stores, barber shops and dry 
cleaners, would be concentrated along Philadelphia Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Is Praised 
</P>
<P>
Lane Langford, an Uptown bookstore owner and member of the now-defunct Citizens 
Advisory Council, praised the plan as the best compromise between business 
owners and residents intent on preserving the "quaintness" of Whittier's oldest 
section of town, an eclectic collection of out-of-date architectural styles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great plan," Langford said. "One of the main concerns was to keep 
Uptown Whittier old and attractive. This plan does that." 
</P>
<P>
The advisory committee, which was formed shortly after the earthquake, has been 
dissolved, Langford said. 
</P>
<P>
Langford said business owners and real estate developers can turn the aging 
commercial district into a showplace that visitors and local residents can 
enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
"I always said that in a way the earthquake was a godsend," Langford said. "The 
Uptown really needed upgrading." 
</P>
<P>
But, Langford added, any construction resulting from the plan may not take 
place for years. "None of this is going to happen overnight," he said. "But it 
is a tool that we very much needed to have."

BACKLASH AGAINST GANGS EXPRESSED BY FRIENDS OF NORWALK YOUTH WHO DIED IN 
DRIVE-BY SHOOTING

The car they are riding in winds through their east Norwalk neighborhood 
presided over by lavender trees. No graffiti is evident. "This is a nice place, 
nice people living here," Paseka Teo, 17, says, pointing to homes on neat lawns 
bordering clean streets. 
</P>
<P>
His friend, Ernie Gutierrez, 16, says, "It's like a Leave-it-to-Beaver 
neighborhood. There are really no gangs here. But the overpass over there is a 
good place to stay away from." 
</P>
<P>
Although they do not belong to gangs, Teo and Gutierrez, popular and respected 
sophomores at John Glenn High School, have been touched by gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
The two football players were friends of Juan (Chaka) Enriquez, the Glenn 
senior football and wrestling star who was killed May 9 in a drive-by shooting 
in the barrio, a low-income, mostly Latino area of small modest homes in the 
southern section of Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Teo and Gutierrez had spoken emotionally during a memorial service at the 
school a day after Enriquez's death. Gutierrez, president of the sophomore 
class, angrily asked the gang members among the students: "Chaka wasn't even in 
a gang, what do you think the chances are for you?" 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's authorities believe the killing was gang-related. A 20-year-old 
Fullerton man who had been arrested in connection with the shooting was 
released Tuesday because of lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The anger had not subsided for Teo and Gutierrez last week. Before accompanying 
a reporter and photographer on a ride through the city, they stood outside the 
school weightlifting room and discussed their views on gangs and gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like (gang members) have no respect for other people," Teo said. "I 
think they pick on innocent people. They shouldn't kill no one. 
</P>
<P>
"I never hang around kids who join gangs. If kids want to be in gangs, they act 
and dress like it. They wear their pants real low and wear white T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, they're not really tough; they think they're tough. People who join 
gangs, they think that's the way to meet new friends. It's a waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
The car is on Pioneer Boulevard in south Norwalk. "Behind all those businesses 
is the barrio," Gutierrez says. "I have a lot of friends in there. Never have 
been hassled. They knew me when I was in eighth or ninth grade. My dad grew up 
in the barrio." The car turns into the barrio. "Look at that fence," Teo says. 
It has Varrio gang graffiti: "VNWK." 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said he knows gang members. "Some are here (at school)," he said. 
"Why do kids join gangs? If they have an older brother in a gang, they look up 
to him, want to be like him." Youths also join, he said, because many of their 
friends are in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's stupidity," he said. "It's just dumb. Sooner or later you're going to pay 
for what you're doing. Eventually they get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Teo and Gutierrez try to avoid confrontations with gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"I turn around, don't say nothing, don't even look at them," Teo said. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Gutierrez said, he saw two gangs ready to fight in a parking lot 
near Glenn. "I saw guns in a car, I knew that was my cue to get out of here," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez, who, like Teo, has a muscular build, recalled an incident about a 
year ago: "I was walking across the street and came upon a couple of guys. I 
was outnumbered. When they walk by you, you don't know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was prepared to use his pencil as a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"Chances are they have something on them," he said. "Most of them carry 
something because they never know when they will be confronted. In gangs you 
have to be ready, so they all have something on them. They are cowards. If 
they're looking for trouble, a fistfight would settle it. Using a gun is 
spineless. A drive-by is the easiest way to get out of a fight. They are afraid 
they will get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Since Enriquez's death, Gutierrez said, gang members are more cautious around 
the Glenn athletes. "Now they would have a few problems with us," he said. 
"They give me my space." 
</P>
<P>
The car approaches 166th Street. "Down there are the Chivas," Gutierrez says, 
mentioning the Artesia gang that authorities say frequently fights with the 
Norwalk Varrios. "The little kids (Chivas and Varrios) throw bottles at each 
other. When they are 6, 7 or 8." 
</P>
<P>
On into Hermosillo Park at 162nd Street. "They like to play handball," 
Gutierrez says of the Varrios. A man in a white T-shirt walks near the courts. 
"There's a chola (Latino gang member)," Gutierrez says, nodding toward the man. 
"A retired one." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later they pass the spot where Enriquez was gunned down. A memorial has 
been erected: candles, flowers, wreaths and scores of "CHAKA R.I.P." 
inscriptions on the sidewalk. A banner reads, "Stop the Madness." 
</P>
<P>
The two students do not foresee an eradication of gang problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The writing on the wall and the gangs, you're never going to stop it," 
Gutierrez said. "Maybe it can be slowed down a little. You've got to get to the 
kids when they're little. Parents have to set an example. Parents have a lot to 
do with it." 
</P>
<P>
"They don't give a damn about their kids," Teo said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez seemed well aware of the danger of being a teen-ager in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the same thing that happened to Chaka could happen to me tonight when I 
go home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
High-pitched screams fill the air. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a jumping," Gutierrez says. 
</P>
<P>
On a sidewalk about a block from Glenn High, five teen-age girls stomp fiercely 
on a well-dressed young woman and beat her with their fists. 
</P>
<P>
In a moment the fight is over. The girls pile into the back of a truck and take 
off. The victim, after picking herself up, screams obscenities at her 
attackers. She is comforted by a passer-by. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls didn't have the guts to fight her one-on-one," Gutierrez says. 
</P>
<P>
He says he has seen flare-ups like this several times. 
</P>
<P>
The gangs, the boys had said earlier, come out at night. But even this quiet 
afternoon had not passed without violence. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't stay in the house all the time," Gutierrez said when the car pulled 
back into the school. "It's something you have to deal with. You continue on, 
and hope it doesn't happen to you or someone else you know."

FAMILY OF SLAIN MAN TO GET $50,000 FROM COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County has settled a lawsuit against a Lakewood station sheriff's 
deputy by paying $50,000 to the 8-year-old son of a man who was fatally wounded 
during a traffic stop in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The recent award by the county Claims Board ends a wrongful-death suit filed by 
the family of Danny Ray Keele, a part-time janitor who was shot while sitting 
in his car in the parking lot of a motel on Lakewood Boulevard in Bellflower 
where he was staying with his girlfriend and young son. 
</P>
<P>
Keele, 25, who had been pulled over for weaving in traffic, was shot in the 
back at close range after he allegedly grabbed the gun hand of rookie Deputy 
Steven Minnis, who had leaned into Keele's car to investigate, county lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Keele had failed to get out of his car as ordered, and lab tests showed later 
that he was under the influence of the hallucinogenic drug PCP, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
But in recommending settlement, the county counsel's office said that expert 
witnesses hired by the Keele family were prepared to testify that the deputy, 
on the job just six months, did not follow acceptable police procedures when 
approaching Keele. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contradictory Stories 
</P>
<P>
In addition, witnesses at the motel contradict deputies' accounts of the 
shooting incident, said Patrick J. Gardiner, principal deputy county counsel, 
in a report to the Claims Board. Minnis was on patrol alone, but other deputies 
arrived just after the shooting, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was enough that a jury could probably have gone either way," and its 
award could have exceeded the $50,000 settlement, Gardiner said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Paz, attorney for the Keele family, said the death resulted from bad 
judgment by an inexperienced deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty straightforward," Paz said. "If you have someone who you think may 
be dangerous, you should not go one-on-one. The deputy is supposed to call for 
backup and maintain the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
"But he walked up to the car, told Keele to freeze, stuck his gun in his back 
and leaned over and started looking into the car and into the guy's eyes. 
That's when the gun went off," Paz said. 
</P>
<P>
Paz said Minnis has changed his account of what took place at the Hazy 8 Motel 
in Bellflower that hot July evening five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report by another deputy, Minnis first said that Keele had 
jumped from his car and struggled with the deputy before his gun went off. 
Minnis also told sheriff's homicide investigators a similar story a few hours 
after the shooting, Paz said the investigators reported. 
</P>
<P>
But a witness in a nearby motel room said that immediately after she heard the 
gunshot, she saw Minnis standing alone next to the car. Minnis then pulled 
Keele nearly out of the car before other deputies arrived, the woman said in a 
sworn statement, according to Paz. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Gardiner said Minnis "was in shock" after the shooting and the 
initial account was a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disagree on Struggle 
</P>
<P>
Both sides now agree that Keele was shot while sitting in his car. But they 
disagree on whether a struggle took place. 
</P>
<P>
Paz said there is no forensic evidence that Keele ever laid his hands on the 
deputy's revolver. But Gardiner said, "The deputy breaks loose, and that's when 
he shoots. The deputy thought he was going to get disarmed. He was protecting 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Since the shooting, Minnis' record has been cleared of accusations of excessive 
force, Gardiner said. "This is a bad situation, but the guy's a good cop," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Paz said the county was fortunate that Keele's work history was spotty and that 
his survivors could show only limited loss of support as the result of his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
"If the fellow had had a decent job, this case would have cost them four times 
this amount," Paz said. 
</P>
<P>
About $33,000 of the award was placed in a trust account for Keele's son when 
he reaches 18. The remaining $17,000 paid attorneys' fees, funeral costs and 
other expenses incurred by the family.

EX-PORT CHIEF COULDN'T RESIST LURE OF CONVENTION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Joseph F. Prevratil signed up last year as the new executive director of 
the Port of Long Beach, he described the job as "an opportunity that comes 
along once in a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Commission Chairman George F. Talin Sr. predicted that Prevratil "is 
going to be to the port what Babe Ruth was to baseball." Prevratil showed 
promise of becoming a dockside version of the venerated Sultan of Swat by 
reorganizing harbor management. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Work on Other Project 
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, he abruptly quit after about a year on the job to become a 
private consultant. His first client will be the city, which intends to hire 
him to direct the planned $80-million expansion of the Long Beach Convention 
and Entertainment Center. The city manager said Prevratil will also work on 
other redevelopment projects. 
</P>
<P>
Switching from department head to consultant will allow Prevratil to handle 
other clients as well, which will boost his income. One of the stated reasons 
for Prevratil's departure was his desire to earn more money. 
</P>
<P>
Prevratil, 51, is known as a disciplined manager whose hard-nosed demeanor 
could leave port executives trembling. Port sources said he knocked heads with 
members of the Board of Harbor Commissioners on occasion, but Prevratil and 
harbor commissioners said no clash was serious enough to figure in his decision 
to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Prevratil said he became interested in heading the convention center effort 
when he was involved in protracted discussions about the port's role in 
financing the project. Harbor commissioners also acknowledged the importance of 
having their port chief, with his management and marketing skills, at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, the city is staking the future of its revitalized downtown 
on the project. The expansion would allow the city to compete for mid-sized 
conventions, a step up from the smaller trade shows. Civic leaders envision 
hoards of delegates filling the three major new hotels built downtown -- with a 
fourth on the way -- and dining at new restaurants along Pine Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Though the port plans to put up the money, the city Redevelopment Agency is 
overseeing the expansion. The port is seeking a legal opinion from the city 
attorney about whether it can use its funds for a non-port use such as the 
convention center. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion also would involve dealing with contractors, negotiating a new 
operating agreement and marketing an enlarged complex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gleam in His Eye' 
</P>
<P>
During discussions about the expansion and the port's role, Talin said 
Prevratil's name came up repeatedly when talk turned to the issue of who would 
manage the project. "Over the last several weeks with the commission and Joe, 
you could see the gleam in his eye," Talin said. 
</P>
<P>
Prevratil said "it became evident" that the convention center project would be 
too large an undertaking to handle in addition to his port responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
As a consultant, he will report to Susan Shick, the city's redevelopment 
director, and work with the harbor commission and Redevelopment Agency board. 
Donald L. Westerland, chairman of the agency's board, said he is delighted to 
have Prevratil head the project. "We wanted someone to ride herd on this whole 
project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Just how much authority he will be given in his role as a consultant remains to 
be seen. Shick said Prevratil will be handled "like any other consultant" and 
that decision-making "(will be) left to the (redevelopment) board." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager James C. Hankla said Prevratil's consulting fee will approach the 
$110,046 annual salary he received at the port. He reportedly took a 
substantial cut in pay to come to work at the port last year. As president of 
Wrather Port Properties Ltd., where Prevratil led the Queen Mary/Spruce Goose 
complex out of a decade of losses, he reportedly earned more than $180,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But harbor commissioners balked at trying to push Prevratil's annual salary 
higher than Hankla's $118,218. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate like hell to lose a good man like Joe Prevratil," Talin said. "If I had 
my druthers, we would have paid Joe another $40,000 or $50,000, but we couldn't 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
While his city pay remains substantially the same, Prevratil's new status will 
allow him to accept other work. Hankla said Prevratil will have to disclose his 
clients and cannot accept any other clients who would put him in conflict with 
his city duties. 
</P>
<P>
The city charter forbids the city manager, city attorney and executive director 
of the port from taking outside consulting jobs or other employment. 
</P>
<P>
As the port's executive director, Prevratil shook up management with a major 
reorganization and cleaned house among top directors. He complained that under 
the old structure, too many department heads reported directly to the executive 
director. He streamlined the system by creating three managing director 
positions that reported to him. The managing directors were given 
responsibility for the departments. One of those directors, Paul Brown, has 
been named acting executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor commissioners generally concurred with Prevratil's changes. But there 
were some differences, including times when commissioners would pass over 
Prevratil's hand-picked candidates for key jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he had people he wanted and recommended but the procedures on personnel 
were followed," Harbor Commissioner C. Robert Langslet said. "His people were 
certainly in the running." 
</P>
<P>
With firm management already in place, Langslet, Talin and Commissioner Joel 
Friedland said they are in no hurry to appoint a new executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The port thrives. It handles more tons of cargo and moves more containers than 
any other port on the West Coast. About 5,400 vessels called on the port in the 
last fiscal year, discharging cargo ranging from bananas to cement to toys. 
About $35 billion of imports and exports moves across its docks.

'SAY THE G-WORD,' SHERIFF IS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So (Sheriff) Sherman Block has said for what he hopes "is the final time" that 
his department does not discriminate against any group. It's not the last time, 
not yet (Times, May 11). 
</P>
<P>
Until he says publicly that the Sheriff's Department does not discriminate 
specifically against gays and lesbians, and until he says publicly that he and 
the department will not tolerate harassment of open lesbians and gays on the 
force, no one will begin to believe him. 
</P>
<P>
He has warned in advance that this would be the case, and, indeed, so far, it 
has. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than prolong the process, Mr. Sheriff, why not just say the G-word and 
the L-word and prove you mean what you claim to say?

VETERAN LOGGER TEACHES FORESTRY FIREFIGHTERS ART OF 'TREE FALLING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anybody can cut a tree down, says logger Douglas Dent. Start hacking a wedge 
out of the side of the trunk, and, as sure as rain falling from the clouds, the 
tree will come down. But try laying a 100-foot ponderosa pine out along a 
narrow clearing, veering from power lines, staying away from healthy trees and 
not injuring yourself. That's complicated, says the wiry Oregonian. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems awful simple, but, heck, I've been doing this for 20 years, and I'm 
just beginning to understand what it's all about," said Dent, a tree-cutting 
expert who has traveled to several continents, teaching the hazardous art of 
"tree falling." 
</P>
<P>
Dent, the author of a manual for professional timber men, was at Crystal Lake 
last week, 6,000 feet above Azusa in the Angeles National Forest, teaching his 
craft to 14 firefighters for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you're cutting eucalyptus in Australia, banyans in South America or 
ponderosas here, the principles are the same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hazards of tree chopping became vividly apparent two years ago, Forest 
Service officials say, when an engine foreman was killed on a fire line in the 
Stanislaus National Forest. A tree he was downing snagged another tree, which 
snapped back and landed on him, killing him instantly. 
</P>
<P>
"In my career, there were times when I was taking down between 50 and 100 trees 
a year," said Gordon Rowley, acting fire manager for the Angeles National 
Forest. "Every once in while, something happens that's unexpected to me." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the trainees were fire engine foremen or assistant foremen, who will 
take their newly acquired skills back to their units and teach them to others. 
</P>
<P>
Dent, 42, a short, bouncy man in faded jeans, a checkerboard wool shirt and a 
tin helmet, agrees that trees are as peculiarly individualistic as humans. But 
accidents like the fatality two years ago can be avoided, with some training, 
he said. "Experience is a great teacher, provided you live through it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, the trainees stepped up to designated trees and took their turns. 
These were big ponderosas, dead or mortally ill, lightning-struck or beetle 
infested. "Hazard trees," Karen Fortus, the Mt. Baldy District resource officer 
called them. "We get some pretty gusty winds up here, which could knock them 
down." 
</P>
<P>
In its simplest form, tree falling involves slicing a pie wedge, or "undercut," 
out of the side of the trunk with a big 36-inch chain saw, then attacking the 
other side with wedges and tipping the trunk into the sliced opening. "The 
undercut is like the sights on a rifle," guiding the trajectory of the falling 
tree, Dent said. 
</P>
<P>
But there are always complications, he suggested, sizing up a 100-footer. A 
tree can have rotten wood, or it can lean in one direction, both of which have 
to be compensated for, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the lean?" he asked his students, peering along the line of the trunk, 
encouraging some discussion. "Where's the best place to dump it?" 
</P>
<P>
Dent is a plain-spoken man, gently needling his students, quietly offering them 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tapping the Trunk 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see what it sounds like," he said to Patrick Williams, an assistant 
engine foreman in the forest's Chilao Station, who circled his tree, tapping 
the trunk with the back of an ax. ("A nice solid sound," explained a colleague, 
who had already downed his own tree, "means good wood. A thump means you got 
dried wood.") 
</P>
<P>
Williams sliced into the big tree, sending chips and fragrant sawdust flying. 
His challenge was to avoid some power lines nearby and a stand of majestic old 
trees. When Williams paused for a moment, Dent gave the undercut a critical 
look, sighting along the handle of the chain saw toward a clearing in the 
forest. "I think you can go a little deeper," he said, "but the angle of the 
dangle looks real good." 
</P>
<P>
After 30 minutes of sawing and sighting, the old tree crashed down. "The tree 
went just where you wanted it to go," said the logging expert. "Isn't that 
wonderful?" 
</P>
<P>
Dent says that the greatest hazard in "cutting the big uglies" is 
misunderstanding the dynamics of the cuts. "If you get those pie wedges 
crossing each other, the trunk can split right to the top," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Armstrong, an assistant foreman in the national forest's Saugus District, 
pulled out a copy of Dent's book and pointed to an illustration of the "barber 
chair," when one slice is undermined by another, splitting the tree vertically, 
sending a piece of the trunk backwards. "You don't want to be standing behind 
it when that happens," Armstrong said. "It'll take your head off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Thrill 
</P>
<P>
But successfully dispatching a big one is a thrill. Seeing a big ponderosa go 
down where you want it gives you "an Adrenalin rush," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
You begin to understand why at the end of the day. Dan Smith, foreman at the 
forest's Redbox Station, is tussling with the day's biggest target -- a 
120-foot dead ponderosa, with some spindly branches near the top and a 
corkscrew lightning scar around its trunk, on the edge of the Crystal Lake 
picnic ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Lightning will literally cook a tree," Dent said. "That's what kills it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith must lay the trunk along a narrow alley between a paved road and a picnic 
table. But the equipment was not cooperating. His saw had a fit of "altitude 
sickness," pumping weakly in the thin mountain air, and then its chain hit a 
nail, embedded there long ago by a camper. With a new saw, Smith cut into a 
wedge of rotten wood, being careful to keep the sound wood at the corners of 
his undercut. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was a deep, resonant cracking sound, then another one, and the 
top of the big tree started to move in slow motion. Smith turned off his saw, 
carefully pulled a pair of wedges out of the widening slice in the trunk, and 
stepped back. He turned to watch the tree, about 30 tons of lumber, smash into 
the ground with a ferocious thump, shaking the earth and raising a cloud of 
dust. 
</P>
<P>
Smith expressed himself in the spare style of the experienced woodsman. "It's 
kind of gratifying to see it go where it's supposed to," he said.

WEST COVINA MAN HOPES TO LAUNCH REVOLT AGAINST TAX FOR LANDSCAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WEST COVINA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Barbagallo is hardly a tax revolter to rival Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann, 
the pair who upset the state's political landscape in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But the 33-year-old West Covina resident wants to start a taxpayer's revolt 
that would affect the city budget much like Proposition 13, which slashed local 
property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Barbagallo says West Covina is misusing more than $1.5 million in annual taxes 
collected from hundreds of homeowners for landscaping. Some homeowners have 
been paying between $400 and $650 annually for nine years and have been getting 
nothing in return, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Barbagallo is scheduled to address the City Council about his 
concerns, and the city staff -- which denies Barbagallo's allegations -- is set 
to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"We're paying money for no services," Barbagallo said. "If you're going to 
charge someone for service, you damn well better provide it." 
</P>
<P>
The maintenance districts, established over the past 20 years in five of the 
city's newer subdivisions, are intended to ensure that developers provide 
greenery, which the city subsequently maintains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Researched Records 
</P>
<P>
After an extensive review of city records, Barbagallo said the city has spent 
little or no money on landscape maintenance in his neighborhood. Although 
Barbagallo said the same thing is taking place in all city maintenance 
districts, his research concentrated on his East Hills neighborhood and two 
adjoining tracts. 
</P>
<P>
In his neighborhood, part of Maintenance District 6, there are 240 households 
that pay a combined $130,000 to the city each year, he said. In District 7, 400 
homeowners pay $200,000 annually, and in District 4 homeowners pay about $1 
million in landscape assessments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say residents are receiving all services for which they are 
paying. 
</P>
<P>
Harry W. Thomas, public works division manager, said homeowners in Barbagallo's 
neighborhood are paying to maintain 91 acres of "common open space" around 
their upscale, hillside homes. 
</P>
<P>
Of the common acreage, only about eight acres are intended to have actual 
landscaping and irrigation, Thomas said. The remainder is to stay in its 
"natural state" with only fire prevention and other minimal maintenance, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I get the impression that there may be some feeling that the whole 91-acre 
area was supposed to be landscaped," Thomas said. "Since that didn't happen, 
maybe there's some dissatisfaction about that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Landscaping Slowed 
</P>
<P>
Barbagallo said that the city has not provided brush removal or fire protection 
measures in the areas designated as "natural state." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas acknowledged that promised landscaping on the eight acres has been 
slowed by a succession of home developers backing out of their commitments, but 
he said the work should be completed sometime this year. 
</P>
<P>
"What he is saying is erroneous," Barbagallo said. "You tell me where the trees 
are that it (the city) is maintaining." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his family's home in the hills overlooking the city, Barbagallo 
recalled that he first noticed a $424 charge for "landscape maintenance" 
shortly after moving to West Covina in June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to barren areas where he said there are supposed to be trees, shrubs 
and grass, Barbagallo questioned what the money was being used for. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said most of the estimated $40,000 the district spends each year pays 
for that portion of city staff needed to administer the district. A fire 
prevention plan is being prepared for Districts 6 and 7, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contingency Account 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, Thomas said, the leftover funds have been put in a contingency 
account, which will provide for repairs in the event of a landslide in the 
area. The area has a history of slides, according to city engineers. The 
contingency fund will reach its $250,000 goal this year, and additional surplus 
funds will probably be used to lower future taxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the city, Barbagallo asked that the city collect no taxes until 
significant landscaping work is completed in all of the districts.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE;

<P>
SCHOOL PRAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 269 to 135, the House adopted an amendment denying federal 
vocational training funds to schools that ban student prayer. This occurred as 
the House passed on a near-unanimous vote, and sent to the Senate, a bill (HR 
7) overhauling the major federal law to further vocational education. The 
amendment seeks to counter U.S. Supreme Court rulings against organized school 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) said school prayer "is not a 
partisan issue. It is something the American public wants to happen 
overwhelmingly." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Don Edwards (D-San Jose) said "the First Amendment of the Constitution 
is very clear about" keeping government from requiring religion in public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the prayer amendment.

Minimum Wage 
</P>

By a vote of 247 to 172, the House approved and sent to the Senate the 
conference report on legislation (HR 2) gradually raising the minimum wage from 
its present level of $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by October, 1991. President Bush 
promises to veto any hike to above $4.25, and this vote shows that the House 
probably cannot muster the two-thirds majority it needs to override a veto. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes want a $4.55 hourly minimum wage.

By a vote of 359 to 42, the House sent to President Bush the conference report

promotes the Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday. The bill sets an annual

authorized last month when it gave the bill initial approval by a vote of 305 
to 84.

To Impeach Judge Nixon

By a vote of 417 to 0, the House approved three articles of impeachment against 
U.S. District Court Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. of the Southern District of 
Mississippi. He will lose his lifetime federal judgeship if the Senate finds 
him guilty of at least one article. He is now imprisoned, after being convicted 
of perjury in 1986 following his alleged attempt to influence a state criminal 
case. Members voting yes voted for impeachment.

HUNTINGTON PARK IMPOSES 7% UTILITY TAX

HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning this summer, residents and business owners will pay an additional 7% 
charge on their telephone, electricity, natural gas and water bills. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously last week to impose the utility tax to raise 
about $2.74 million a year to fund additional police protection and other city 
services, Huntington Park officials said. The tax takes effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Without the new charge, officials said, Huntington Park would be forced to 
forgo employee raises during the 1989-90 fiscal year, which begins July 1. It 
would also have had to spend all but $10,000 of a $475,000 general fund reserve 
and reduce spending in other areas, such as tree trimming, officials said. The 
general fund pays for most city services, such as law enforcement and fire 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the single most difficult decision I've had to make on the 
council," Councilman Herbert A. Hennes Jr. said. "This one here goes to the 
heart of every citizen in town. I don't know any alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
About 75 people attended a special hearing on the tax before the council voted 
Monday night. About half of the speakers favored the new tax to put more police 
officers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Resident George Fair told of the time he was tied up and robbed at his home in 
1986. "It took 20 minutes for an officer to get to my house," Fair said. "I 
hope it doesn't happen to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Chapter of the United Neighborhoods Organization and the 
Huntington Park Senior Citizens also supported the tax. 
</P>
<P>
But Oscar Lopez said the tax would be a hardship once he, his wife and three 
children move into a new Huntington Park home in the next several weeks. "I 
think maybe you need to cut programs that are less important," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
But the council members decided the financial sacrifice was warranted in light 
of the proposed budget for 1989-90 that was presented recently by City 
Administrative Officer Donald L. Jeffers. The spending plan, which did not 
include revenue from the utility tax, was balanced but anticipated more than 
$200,000 in cuts for tree trimming and other city maintenance. It also reduced 
the budget for such items as Christmas decorations for Pacific Boulevard and a 
subsidy for the Huntington Park Symphony Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Raises for city employees were not included. Huntington Park employees received 
a 4.2% raise for this fiscal year, which costs the city about $300,000 
annually, Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffers said the city is feeling the full effects of Proposition 13 now that 
state and federal subsidies have been reduced or eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Without the new tax, revenues in the city's general fund in 1989-90 would have 
been $9.7 million, about the same as 1987-88 revenues, according to the 
preliminary budget. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary budget forecasts overall revenues and expenditures of $27.7 
million. That includes money restricted to pay for public transportation, the 
city retirement plan and other items in addition to direct daily operating 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Park Redevelopment Agency has also added to the city's financial 
problems, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's redevelopment program has failed to generate enough property-tax 
income to meet the Redevelopment Agency's $4.4-million annual bond payments. 
City officials said project delays, caused by high interest rates in the 
mid-1980s, are responsible for the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Helps Make Payments 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency has relied on the city to help make the bond payments. 
Sales tax revenue, which would otherwise go into the city's general fund, has 
been loaned to the agency over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
The city loaned the Redevelopment Agency about $1.5 million during 1987-88. 
That amount is expected to be reduced to about $800,000 this year, and to about 
$500,000 in the next fiscal year as more projects are completed and generate 
tax revenue for the agency, Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the loans were responsible for a cash-flow crisis in 1987 
that forced the City Council to eliminate 13 positions and make other spending 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Raul R. Perez, who ran unsuccessfully for City Council last year, 
complained that city residents and businesses are now going to be taxed to 
compensate for the money that is being funneled to the Redevelopment Agency. 
Members of the City Council also serve as directors of the Redevelopment 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It was poor management on their part," Perez said after the hearing. "Now they 
want to get it from us." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William P. Cunningham said in an interview, "That might be true, but we 
plan on getting (the loaned money) back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urgency Doubted 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said the city would have needed the additional revenue from the 
utility tax to increase services, although it might not have been needed so 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
The council members and virtually all the residents who testified Monday agreed 
that the city needs more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The number of officers in Huntington Park has remained fairly stable over the 
past two decades -- about 56 officers in 1972, contrasted with 59 now, 
officials said. But the population has grown from 33,744 in 1970 to about 
52,000 now, according to the U.S. Census Bureau figures and population 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't continue with the same numbers we have," Councilman Thomas E. Jackson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department suffered the brunt of the cutbacks in 1987, losing three 
officer positions, and five clerical and support positions. The department is 
authorized to have 59 sworn officers, but two officers are injured and two 
positions are vacant, Police Chief Patrick M. Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary budget includes money to restore one of the lost positions, 
Connolly said. But the chief says he needs at least two more sergeants and 13 
more officers to meet the law enforcement demands in Huntington Park. The 
department also needs three more jailers, two dispatchers and two clerks, 
Connolly said.

<P>
With his "Ghostbusters II" sidekicks -- Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Harold Ramis 
-- getting the Stay-Puft share of glory, fourth Ghostbuster Ernie Hudson 
insists: "I don't feel like an outsider." 
</P>
<P>
The black graduate of Yale Drama School acknowledges that he's often overlooked 
in media coverage, but adds, "There are a lot of reasons for that. They were 
and are in different places in their careers. They've had more success than I 
have. And in the first movie, the script established them as a unit before I 
was brought in, as their employee." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it took Hudson two-and-a-half years to find more movie work after 
"Ghostbusters." 
</P>
<P>
"You expect that when you do a film that's a major blockbuster, it will move 
your career to another place, but that's not necessarily true." He did TV shows 
and voice-overs before landing a role in "Weeds" with Nick Nolte, and has since 
worked on "Leviathan" and other features. 
</P>
<P>
Director Ivan Reitman was still doing re-shoots on "II" just two weeks ago, 
Hudson said, and the four stars are still looping in dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
"The movie will definitely be released June 16," Hudson added, "but I know Ivan 
will be working on it up to the last minute." Stacy Jenel Smith

Faster than a speeding sequel comes news that Universal's already-announced 
"Twins" sequel may actually spawn something new. Are you ready for "Triplets"? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, according to a studio source, Arnold Schwarzenneger and Danny DeVito will 
apparently be joined by another sibling. And there's a further twist: sibling 
No. 3 is a she. We're told that the top candidate for the part is . . . 
Roseanne Barr. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for producer-director Ivan Reitman said the only thing being 
developed at his company is "a vacation" following the frantic work to finish 
"Ghostbusters II."

<P>
"We may do a sequel and it might be called 'Triplets,' " the rep said 
diplomatically. "Right now we've got a lot of ideas but nothing set in

Hoskins flashback: "Pennies from Heaven," the critically admired 1977-78 BBC 
miniseries in which he starred, will air on KCET in July. The series -- which 
contrasts the bright and cheery songs and dances of the Depression era with the 
grim life of a sheet music salesman -- will air July 23, 24 and 26. Two 
episodes (running 75 minutes each) will air each night, from 9 to 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
This is the program that inspired the 1981 Steve Martin feature film. Many 
reviewers liked the movie (which bombed commercially), but were near-unanimous 
in proclaiming the earlier Hoskins series superior. Pat H. Broeske

Mass appeal: Orion Pictures is shooting a more upbeat ending to "Great Balls of 
Fire" -- the Jerry Lee Lewis musical bio starring Dennis Quaid, due to open 
June 30 -- after test audiences voted thumbs down on the original, downbeat 
finale. 
</P>
<P>
That conclusion had the once-triumphant Lewis reduced to playing at one of the 
old honkytonks where he'd gotten his start, after his skyrocketing career 
fizzled with his scandalous marriage to his 13-year-old cousin (played by 
Winona Ryder). 
</P>
<P>
In the new ending, Lewis will perform in an unnamed auditorium -- in 
celebratory style -- jumping joyfully atop his piano. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that the music goes on," said exec veep Mike Medavoy, "and it 
does, to this day." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "In tests, audiences told us that they loved Dennis Quaid (as Lewis), 
they loved the music and they loved the movie -- except for the ending. They 
wanted something more upbeat, so, we are reshooting." 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for an epilogue bringing moviegoers up to date with the still-wild 
life and times of Lewis, a.k.a. The Killer. 
</P>
<P>
Said Medavoy: "We'll do that in the sequel." Pat H. Broeske

WARREN MAGNUSON; SERVED 44 YEARS IN CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Sen. Warren G. Magnuson (D-Wash.), who served 44 years in Congress to 
become one of the most influential legislators of his time, died Saturday at 
his home in Seattle. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
Death resulted from congestive heart failure due to complications from 
diabetes, a family spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Known to colleagues and constituents alike as "Maggie," the portly Democrat was 
elected to the first of six Senate terms in 1944 after serving eight years in 
the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman 
</P>
<P>
Rising to the chairmanship of the Commerce Committee, which he headed for 23 
years, and later chairing the powerful appropriations Committee, he was 
renowned for looking after the economic interests of Seattle and his home 
state, providing funds for military bases, cancer research centers and other 
federal projects in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who had been a close colleague in the 
Senate, once joked that Magnuson had a policy of dividing federal money evenly 
-- "half for Washington state and half for the rest of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Some called him "the senator from Boeing," a reference to Seattle's giant 
aerospace firm and defense contractor. He inherited the nickname from the late 
Henry M. Jackson, another defense-minded Democratic senator from his state. 
Together, they were called "the Gold Dust Twins" for the federally funded 
projects and defense contracts they steered back home. 
</P>
<P>
Magnuson was defeated for re-election by Republican Slade Gorton in 1980. He 
later remarked on a visit to the Capitol how traditions of respect for 
seniority seemed to be fading. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't the discipline, there isn't the courtesy there was when I was 
here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legislative Accomplishments 
</P>
<P>
Along with his devotion to home-state interests, Magnuson helped speed passage 
in the 1960s and 1970s of landmark legislation dealing with auto safety, 
flammable fabrics, cigarette labeling and truth in packaging. His environmental 
victories included passage of laws specifying penalties and cleanup measures 
for oil spills and establishing national standards for drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
A consummate political insider, Magnuson believed that back-room deals and 
cloakroom arm-twisting were far more important than Senate oratory. Never an 
accomplished speaker, he once said that "if you've got the votes, you don't 
need a speech; and if you need a speech, you don't have the votes." 
</P>
<P>
He divided the Senate into "show horses" and "work horses" and considered 
himself in the second category. 
</P>
<P>
Magnuson, born in Moorhead, Minn., on April 12, 1905, was orphaned before he 
was a month old and raised by a Swedish couple whose name he took. He attended 
the University of North Dakota and North Dakota State University before 
entering the University of Washington in 1924, where he received a law degree 
in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
Surviving are his wife, Jermaine, and a daughter, Juanita Garrison.

PRENATAL CARE HARD TO DELIVER IN 'FERTILE 5TH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was close to quitting time, but the waiting room at the Van Nuys public 
health center was filled with pregnant women. Many, in their last stages of 
pregnancy, had waited hours to see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
As Dr. Norman Kaplan, the county-run clinic's obstetrician-gynecologist, rushed 
along the threadbare carpet from one examining room to another, he had one 
thing to say: "We need more doctors!" 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan and other clinic staff members are trying to cope with what Los Angeles 
County health officials call the "Fertile 5th." The term was coined by 5th 
District Supervisor Mike Antonovich to describe the unprecedented baby boom in 
the area he represents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Patients Poor 
</P>
<P>
Outpacing the rest of the county, the 5th District's nine public health clinics 
in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys have been flooded with 
pregnant women, most too poor to pay for private care. The situation has 
prompted the clinics' medical staffs to worry that care will be jeopardized if 
relief does not come soon. 
</P>
<P>
The number of pregnant women coming to the centers -- many of which are cramped 
and decrepit -- jumped 76% from January to April. But the need for prenatal 
care has been snowballing for years in the north county district, in part 
because of a huge influx of Latino immigrants, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1984-85 fiscal year, the clinics handled 17,590 prenatal visits. If 
present trends continue to the end of this fiscal year, June 30, the clinics 
will have treated 35,320 women -- a 101% jump over the patient load five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire north county is in a crisis in prenatal care," said Karen Menacker, 
the public health nursing supervisor at the Van Nuys clinic. 
</P>
<P>
That would come as no surprise to the hundreds of expectant mothers in the 5th 
District who earlier this year waited an average of almost two months for their 
first appointments. Average waits were even longer at facilities in Canoga 
Park, Pacoima and Valencia -- ranging from 78 days to 107 days. 
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women who never see a physician or who must wait until the last 
trimester risk medical complications for themselves and their babies, said Dr. 
Paul Toot, chief of obstetrics at the county's Olive View Medical Center in 
Sylmar, where many of the clinic patients go to have their babies. Such infants 
are more likely to be born underweight or to start their lives in 
intensive-care units, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At other public clinics elsewhere in the county, a pregnant woman who called in 
February, for example, had to wait less than three weeks on the average before 
her first visit, county officials said. In the San Gabriel Valley, the wait was 
slightly more than a week and in the coastal communities, it was two weeks, 
county officials said. In South-Central Los Angeles, the wait was four weeks -- 
about half of what it was in the north county. 
</P>
<P>
The situation grew more dire for those on the prenatal front lines in the north 
county when tentative budget cuts were announced by the county earlier this 
month. The cuts will become effective later this year if the state does not 
provide more money for local health care, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Slated for extinction is the Burbank clinic, where the clientele are primarily 
pregnant women and those seeking birth control. During an average month, 1,594 
people use this center, and county physicians predict that other clinics in the 
Valley will have to take many of its cases, should it close. 
</P>
<P>
When it became obvious that the north county clinics were severely overbooked, 
the county in February ordered emergency measures taken. 
</P>
<P>
To free up staff for prenatal duty, clinic physicians and nurses began spending 
less time treating those with other ailments such as diabetes, hypertension and 
chronic backaches. Sessions for the detection and treatment of venereal disease 
and tuberculosis were combined for the same reason. Meanwhile, extra nurses 
hired to spend more time with pregnant women with gestational diabetes and 
other complications instead have been helping with the overflow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like putting a finger in a dike, and it just isn't stopping it," lamented 
Dr. Dorris Harris, medical director of the north county clinics. "Even though 
we are seeing more patients, more patients are showing up." 
</P>
<P>
The clinic medical staffs are dreading August and September, when the clinics 
will be bombarded by children who need immunizations to enter school. At some 
facilities, nurses typically set up card tables on lawns to handle the rush. No 
one is sure how the needs of expectant mothers and those of the schoolchildren 
will be juggled. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Roberts, the county's deputy director for health center operations, is 
hoping that extra money comes from the state to prevent the closing of the 
Burbank clinic and to provide relief to deluged facilities. But he is not sure 
whether the health department will receive any of the additional $2.5 billion 
the state discovered last week. He expressed frustration at his limited 
options. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot stop the women from getting pregnant," Roberts said. "What do we do? 
We don't have any more money." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the baby boom are easier to grasp than solutions to the 
clinics' prenatal crunch. 
</P>
<P>
With fewer obstetricians welcoming Medi-Cal patients, the public clinics have 
become a last resort to more people, clinic officials said. Meanwhile, the 
population of the county's northern tier continues to grow and many of the 
newcomers are from Latin America, county officials said. Some of these 
immigrants are seeing a physician for the first time and many do not practice 
birth control for religious reasons, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But even the middle-class bedroom communities in the Santa Clarita Valley are 
contributing to the prenatal push. The Valencia staff members were surprised 
when they began seeing suburban housewives in examining rooms. Some were 
between insurance policies when they conceived or did not have the money for 
insurance after paying their mortgages or other bills, clinic officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Rothwell, holding her stomach as the fetus fidgeted inside, said she 
lost her insurance coverage last year when she quit her job as a nurse to study 
for her real estate license. By the time she and her husband, a masonry 
contractor, looked for a new policy, she said, she was pregnant and no 
insurance company would accept her. 
</P>
<P>
Rothwell had been receiving her prenatal care at Holy Cross Hospital's 
maternity clinic. But the hospital wanted $1,600 for the delivery in advance, 
which was not available after the couple were hit with a tax bill for thousands 
of dollars, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good credit. We have good credit cards. No one would let us make 
payments, I couldn't believe it," complained Rothwell, who said she is happy 
with the care she is receiving at the Valencia clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone qualifies for the clinics' services. The medical care is cheap compared 
to that of private physicians. The first seven prenatal visits are $25 apiece 
and subsequent visits are free. 
</P>
<P>
At the Van Nuys clinic, Kaplan, the obstetrician-gynecologist, said he has been 
forced to shorten the amount of time he spends with patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how much good you're doing, going through the motions," he added. 
"Maybe the county feels going through the motions is better than receiving no 
health care at all." 
</P>
<P>
But Kaplan's patients do not seem to notice being whisked through their 
appointments. And though they might have to wait hours to be seen once they 
arrive at the center, they are mostly appreciative. 
</P>
<P>
"They treat me well. It's a good service," said patient Matilda Reyes, 34, 
through an interpreter at the Van Nuys clinic.

ABOARD THE ARCO ALASKA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a quiet night off the coast of California. The lights of Los Angeles 
glowed dimly on the horizon and the seas appeared empty, yet Third Mate Marie 
C. Wuerker was alert to potential trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Radar showed a cluster of boats less than half an hour away. The boats gave no 
sign of knowing that they were possibly on a collision course with the Arco 
Alaska. It was a Friday night; one of the radar dots might represent a drunken 
weekend sailor. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 1,000 feet long, the Arco Alaska was loaded with 52.4 million gallons of 
crude oil and would require two miles to stop. All on board were painfully 
aware of the March 24 grounding of the Exxon Valdez, which caused the worst oil 
spill in U.S. history. This was not a time to take chances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Captain Returns 
</P>
<P>
Wuerker took the ship off automatic pilot and ordered the helmsman to change 
course. Capt. Tom Morse, who had stepped out for a moment, returned to the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Cap, I'm glad you're back," Wuerker said. "Would you keep an eye on the 
fishing boat? He's the only one of concern." 
</P>
<P>
Morse peered at a radarscope. Minutes passed without a word. Then chimes rang 
out at 10 p.m. and the captain, a casually dressed man with hair cropped neatly 
near the shoulder, finally spoke. 
</P>
<P>
"He shouldn't be a problem now unless he does something stupid," Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
This was two Friday nights ago. The Arco Alaska was nearing the end of a 
2,025-mile voyage from Valdez, and one of its most difficult passages still lay 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Waters 
</P>
<P>
The oil tankers that last year brought 6.1 billion gallons of crude to Southern 
California, shipping experts say, face increasingly difficult waters near the 
Long Beach and Los Angeles harbors -- the nation's busiest port complex. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger and bigger tankers must compete for space with fleets of other cargo 
vessels -- some of them just as large -- and maneuver safely through the 
sometimes unpredictable movements of those who course the waters in boats, 
windsurfers and jet skis for pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
"You get all the weekend wonder people out there," the senior captain of the 
ship would say. 
</P>
<P>
In sharply angled channels, the safety margin for the big ships is measured in 
feet and inches. The largest tankers are so huge that they do not dock, using 
the harbor only as an anchorage. And the next largest class -- which includes 
the Arco Alaska -- draws so much water that the ships cannot be fully loaded. 
Even partly loaded, they might scrape bottom if they didn't wait for high tide. 
</P>
<P>
At 10:52, Point Fermin on the Palos Verdes Peninsula was directly north. Two 
dozen small boats lay ahead on the radarscope. It was time for the captain, 
with 19 years at sea, to take control from Wuerker, a two-year veteran and the 
mate on watch. 
</P>
<P>
Morse ordered the engines, which had been turning at 90 revolutions a minute, 
backed down to 60. He went back and forth from the dimly lit helm to the chart 
room to make sure the ship would pass clear of a sunken wreck just outside the 
harbor breakwater. He called out a sequence of course changes, shifting by 
degrees northward, slowing the ship further. His target was the Queen's Gate 
entrance on the Long Beach side of the breakwater. 
</P>
<P>
The fishing boats fell behind the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outside Help 
</P>
<P>
At 11:20 p.m., a swift boat came through the harbor entrance and bore down on 
the Arco Alaska. Minutes later, Lyle Trottier of Jacobsen Pilot Service Inc., 
who had been summoned from shore an hour earlier to guide the ship into port, 
clambered up a rope ladder onto the deck. 
</P>
<P>
A tug, the Pacific Escort, took up position on the right bow. On shore, in 
Jacobsen's radar room, President Dick Jacobsen, a pilot himself, manned the 
scope and radioed the ship's position to Trottier minute by minute. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ship's size is not so apparent at sea, the closer the Arco Alaska 
got to the entrance, the larger it seemed. From the bridge, 109 feet above the 
water, the ship dwarfed the breakwater. The entrance looked tight. To make 
matters worse, a dredge filling in what will eventually become more terminal 
facilities appeared to block the channel. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the dredge, we have to make a shallower turn than I like," Trottier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 952-foot Arco Alaska began to angle through, with 300 to 400 feet of 
clearance on the left and perhaps 500 feet in front. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Down to Business 
</P>
<P>
Casual conversation stopped. A five-second searchlight on the north end of the 
entrance swept the deck again and again with a reddish glare. Trottier threw 
out command after command with clipped precision. 
</P>
<P>
"Left 20," he said. Then: "Hard left. Thirty degrees left. Forty turns a 
minute. Midship! Hard right. 20 turns. Midship!" 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the big ship was through, heading for a deep-water anchorage far from 
the docks, just inside the breakwater. At 12:26 a.m., with an enormous clanking 
roar, the 12-ton anchor dropped to the bottom. The Arco Alaska was at Anchorage 
C-14. 
</P>
<P>
And that is where the ship stayed until Sunday night two weeks later, when the 
second part of its navigation through the harbor would begin. 
</P>
<P>
These are not average times for tanker crews, and they know it. 
</P>
<P>
An all-hands letter from Jerry A. Aspland, president of Arco Marine 
International, was tacked to the mess bulletin board of the Arco Alaska. 
Aspland labels the Exxon spill "a disaster not only for Exxon but also for the 
entire oil industry," adding ominously: "While it didn't happen to us, it could 
have." 
</P>
<P>
Asking crew members not to "damage (their) personal reputation, that of the 
company or of seafarers in general," he urged them in the April 6 letter to 
avoid complacency on duty and to "be moderate" when ashore. In public, he said, 
Arco employees should "avoid criticism of Exxon" and "rally to the support of 
the industry." 
</P>
<P>
During the last supper before the ship's arrival in port, the conversation had 
turned to the Exxon Valdez accident and the sudden attention on tanker 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being watched," Morse acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Exxon Valdez incident, the Coast Guard had begun phasing in a 
new alcohol and drug-testing program. The Coast Guard lowered the legal blood 
alcohol level from .10% to .04% and will soon require pre-employment tests, 
random examinations and testing after accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Arco -- with an eye on the example of fired Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph 
Hazelwood, whose blood alcohol level after the accident was more than the legal 
limit -- announced May 1 that it will subject all crew members to breath tests 
as they come on board and institute a program of random alcohol and 
drug-testing. 
</P>
<P>
While no major tanker spill has occurred in waters near Los Angeles, the Coast 
Guard's Los Angeles Marine Safety Office has investigated 127 accidents, 
including collisions, fires, groundings and equipment failures, which injured 
five and caused $6.5 million in damages from 1981 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1976 Accident 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular accident was the Dec. 17, 1976, explosion in San Pedro 
that destroyed the Liberian oil tanker Sansinema, killed nine men, blew out 
windows on shore and caused $21.6 million damage. The blast, caused by 
flammable vapors escaping from tanks, led to the requirement of inert gas 
systems to reduce the risk of explosion. 
</P>
<P>
In a more recent accident, the Navy oiler Roanoke collided with the Liberian 
tanker Mint Prosperity in fog just outside the breakwater on July 2, 1986. The 
Coast Guard ruled that the Navy ship had violated rules. "This is another case 
of a human getting into the loop and screwing things up," said Gary Gregory, 
Coast Guard head of port operations. 
</P>
<P>
On that Sunday night, refinery tanks at the Arco refinery in Carson were empty. 
The Arco Alaska prepared to move from Anchorage C-14 near the breakwater 
through the Long Beach Channel at Pier 121 in Long Beach. There, its high-speed 
pumps would force its cargo -- at 60,000 barrels an hour -- through a 42-inch 
pipeline that goes under city streets to tanks near the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Jim Gray, 39, a resident of Peabody, Mass., was there replacing Morse, 
who had left for a two-month vacation. The pilot was Sam Jabuka, 58, who wore a 
jacket and tie as he came on board. Three tugs took position -- two on the bow, 
one on the stern. 
</P>
<P>
The anchor was aweigh at 9:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Pier 121 was only 1 1/2 miles away, but it would take the giant ship -- moving 
first at the speed of a fast walk, then a stroll and finally no more than a 
baby's crawl -- until 11:08 p.m. to tie up with its first line. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 p.m., only 100 feet separated the ship from the dock. Eight crew members 
readied winches and hawsers. On the dock, Arco Terminal employees prepared to 
catch heaving lines. With barely visible progress, the gap narrowed to 75 feet 
77 seconds later; to 50 feet in 86 seconds. At eight feet, Gray ordered pump 
man Glenn Woodford to call out every foot. It took five minutes and 16 seconds 
to close the gap to one foot. 
</P>
<P>
Yabuka, who was directing the tugs at this point, explained that the slowness 
is essential in maneuvering 188,000 tons of vessel and cargo. "You could tear 
all that out in a second," he said, gesturing at the solid-appearing concrete 
dock. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the ship was in position and the pumping began. Yabuka headed back to 
the pilot station where another assignment was waiting. It had been a good 
night so far. 
</P>
<P>
"Slid that baby in real easy," he said.

GAY POLITICAL LEADER SCOTT EULOGIZED AS A MAN OF COURAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By SCOTT HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The memorial service was, in many ways, the epitome of tradition. A soprano 
sang "Amazing Grace," and there was a reading of the 23rd Psalm. That is the 
one about walking through the valley of the shadow of death and fearing no 
evil. Gay political leader Peter Scott, who died from AIDS on May 13, was thus 
remembered Saturday as a man of courage. State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp 
eulogized Scott as a leader who made a difference and had "a good life 
well-lived." A gay friend, Judge Stephen Lachs, spoke of "a lonely chill" and 
of anger. 
</P>
<P>
"I ask, how many more must die from AIDS? How many more before the public 
shakes its lethargy?" Lachs asked mourners at the service at St. Augustine's by 
the Sea Episcopal Church in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been burying our dead every day for eight years. . . . America, can 
you not feel our agony?" 
</P>
<P>
As of the end of April, 4,484 people had died of AIDS in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agony Is Compounded 
</P>
<P>
For the gay community, living in the shadow of AIDS, the agony is compounded by 
the loss of its leaders. Scott's name now takes its place in a litany of 
prominent Southern California gay activists claimed by AIDS. Others include Los 
Angeles banker and UC Regent Sheldon Andelson; San Diego physician A. Brad 
Truax; Long Beach's Rob Kramme, and Los Angeles' Scott Barry. Founder of "Being 
Alive," a political organization of people with AIDS, Barry died only two days 
before Scott. 
</P>
<P>
"We do this a lot," said David Wexler, executive director of AIDS Project Los 
Angeles, after the service. "The beauty is that we have other people coming up. 
. . . He made it possible for himself to be succeeded." 
</P>
<P>
Within the gay community, Lachs said, the reaction to such deaths is more anger 
than despair. Gays are frustrated by what they say is a lack of public 
commitment for research efforts aimed at finding treatments and vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
Only days after the deaths of Barry and Scott, County Supervisor Pete Schabarum 
asserted that the average citizen has no interest in AIDS or in funding a cure 
-- statements gay leaders attacked as callous and inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
"This hasn't been a good week," Lachs said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's memorial, organized by his longtime political consulting partner, David 
Mixner, reflected his life in politics. In addition to Van de Kamp, former Gov. 
Edmund G. Brown Jr., Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), Rep. Henry A. 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and Councilman Joel Wachs paid their respects. 
</P>
<P>
Scott had been a founder in 1977 of the Municipal Election Committee of Los 
Angeles, which raised millions of dollars for local and state elections. He had 
planned to run for the state Assembly but shelved those ambitions upon learning 
that he had AIDS. Scott's last major public act was to organize, with Elizabeth 
Taylor, the "Commitment to Life" benefit that raised more than $1 million for 
AIDS Project Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp told how Scott, after learning that he had contracted AIDS, pushed 
for legislation enabling California to conduct its own AIDS drug research 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Lachs told how Scott, as a boy growing up on a West Texas ranch, dreamed of 
becoming governor. With his charisma, political acumen and "matinee idol 
looks," the judge said, Scott could have done it. All it would require, he 
said, was "a few compromises." 
</P>
<P>
Scott always seemed to be "at the begining" and "at the top" of gay causes, 
Lachs said. 
</P>
<P>
In a later interview, Lachs called Scott's death "a major, major tragedy (for 
the gay movement). . . . We have lost so many wonderful, important people to 
our movement. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have so many left -- that's what I try to think about."

OIL SPILL MAY BE CATALYST FOR A COHESIVE ENERGY POLICY -- AT LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ravaged wildlife and fouled shorelines aside, the Alaska oil spill on March 24 
caused only a brief interruption in the global flow of oil. But its impact on 
the energy debate has been likened to that of the faulty O-ring aboard the 
space shuttle Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Like the review of the nation's attitudes toward space that followed the 
Challenger disaster, the oil spill is hastening change on the energy landscape. 
It also unmasked some fresh conflicts in the nation's spasmodic search for an 
energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
It has killed, for now, any prospect that the oil industry will be allowed to 
drill for oil in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, drilling proponents 
concede. If Congress should eventually grant permission, it will likely extract 
a high legislative price. 
</P>
<P>
The spill is also credited with influencing Bush Administration decisions to 
tighten auto fuel economy standards and postpone an Alaskan oil lease sale. It 
has also unleashed a torrent of anti-oil measures at the state and federal 
level, ranging from the repeal of industry tax breaks to new obstacles facing 
lease sales in Alaska's Bristol Bay and offshore from California, Oregon, 
Washington, North Carolina, Florida and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Pressures Created 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the unprecedented surge in gasoline prices that followed the 
massive spill focused new attention on an increasingly tenuous balance -- 
especially on the West Coast -- between the nation's voracious appetite for 
gasoline and its capacity to produce it. 
</P>
<P>
Seized upon by industry advocates as evidence that we need to find more oil and 
build more refineries, this tightening market is cited by critics as yet 
another argument to toughen energy conservation measures and come up with 
other, cleaner ways to power automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
The tight supply situation has also created new pressure to relax the terms 
under which the President can tap the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It has 
also fostered congressional support for setting up regional oil reserves in 
California and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Some politicians think that all these worrisome signals might be enough to 
finally ram through a policy aimed at the long-term weaning of the nation from 
oil and that President Bush is more receptive to such steps than his 
predecessor was. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Ronald Reagan's first energy secretary -- a dentist whose 
initial pledge was to abolish the Energy Department as unnecessary -- Bush 
appointee James D. Watkins bemoans the dearth of ready alternatives to oil and 
natural gas as an "umbilical link to unstable oil producers in the world that 
threatens our energy security." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, a nuclear expert, has ordered an ambitious review of the nation's 
hodgepodge of energy programs and promised to come up with an "integrated 
national energy strategy." This sounds familiar, but those who feel that the 
nation's long-term energy needs have been ignored in recent years say Watkins 
is saying the right things. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subsidies for Alternatives Cut 
</P>
<P>
Yet it remains far from clear that a sentiment to conserve more energy and 
encourage the development of clean and abundant alternatives to oil can 
ultimately overcome the continued free-market economic advantages of petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
The oil price decline that began in 1981 and became a nose dive in 1986 was 
accompanied by big government cutbacks in subsidies of solar and other 
alternative forms of energy which often failed in the free market and offered 
only limited potential. 
</P>
<P>
The surging demand for the newly cheap oil, combined with falling U.S. 
production, has sharply driven up oil imports for three straight years -- most 
of which has come from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries. A spate of recent accidents in the North Sea and elsewhere in recent 
months has suddenly tightened markets, giving OPEC a modicum of leverage for 
the first time in several years. 
</P>
<P>
Already, some Arab oil ministers -- who just a few months ago were scrambling 
to block another price collapse -- find themselves urging a strategic boost in 
production to prevent prices from climbing so high as to foster a repeat of the 
1979-80 backlash that slashed oil use around the world. Crude oil prices remain 
40% below their 1981 peak. 
</P>
<P>
History suggests that such relatively low prices create too much inertia for 
any new governmental action on energy. But U.S. Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) 
says the Alaska spill -- on top of last year's drought-driven warnings of 
global warming due to fossil fuels, new militancy over California smog and 
other events -- has radically changed the picture 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, I said that with $1-a-gallon gasoline we were never going to 
redirect energy policy," says Miller, chairman of a House interior subcommittee 
that is playing a lead role in responses to the tanker spill. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have been wrong. We may now be in a situation where people are willing 
for the government to get ahead of the market. . . . Too many things are 
dovetailing here. There's essentially no good news on the energy front. I just 
believe the politics are changing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wildlife Refuge a Key Issue 
</P>
<P>
The wildlife refuge in northeast Alaska is considered the most promising place 
in the nation for finding big new deposits of oil to replace Alaska's Prudhoe 
Bay field, whose production has begun to decline. The Bush Administration 
continues to urge development there. 
</P>
<P>
But since the spill, sponsors of exploration and development in the wildlife 
refuge -- which could ultimately prolong Alaska's tanker traffic by 30 years -- 
have put their legislative efforts on the shelf for this year and possibly 
next. And opponents are liable to hold it hostage. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a strong sense that at one point or another, the (wildlife refuge) 
issue is going to return, but the price has been enhanced by this incident," 
says an aide to a key lawmaker. "In return for it, we're going to get some kind 
of serious conservation mandate, something that hits hard at the oil industry 
(and the) auto industry. In the long run, the spill has got to be a tremendous 
boost to these efforts, because the alternative to energy conservation is more 
tankers from abroad." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a myriad of post-spill legislative initiatives that triggered 
five congressional hearings last week alone, the state of Alaska -- 
economically married to oil since the 1970s -- has suddenly moved against the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The state legislature went on record in opposition to oil drilling in Bristol 
Bay, a largely symbolic act that industry critics had repeatedly been unable to 
push through until now. More concretely, the state this month enacted a law 
revoking a form of tax relief that the oil industry had enjoyed in Alaska for 
nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal action in Alaska heightened industry fears that this revived 
anti-oil sentiment will make itself felt on other tax fronts at the national 
level. President Bush has supported greater tax incentives to explore for oil 
and slow the nation's rapid decline in oil production. 
</P>
<P>
"Alaska's new tax will not devastate the affected firms' earnings, yet the tax 
shift is an ominous development," says Bernard J. Picchi, oil analyst at 
Salomon Bros. in New York. Citing fresh polls showing Americans' distrust of 
the oil industry, Picchi says: "We can only hope that this attitude does not 
lead to a national version of Alaska's fiscal revenge against the big oil 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
Says Daniel A. Dreyfus, former longtime staff chief of the Senate Energy 
Committee and now a vice president at the Gas Research Institute: "It will be a 
curse on the oil business and everything they try to do. It could go well 
beyond the wildlife refuge and go to such things as the oil depletion 
allowance." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the instant runup in West Coast gasoline prices after the spill -- 
the quickest rise ever recorded by market analysts at the Lundberg Letter in 
Los Angeles -- showed graphically the conflict between energy and the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Post-mortems after the spill found that, for several reasons, gasoline prices 
were primed to go up at the time the Exxon Valdez ran aground. Fear that the 
spill would cause shortages gave oil refiners an opening to reap record profits 
at the expense of motorists, despite the fact that no actual shortage of oil 
resulted from the spill. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the price runup is a steady tightening of U.S. supplies of 
gasoline, a phenomenon that had been obscured by the fact that the world is 
awash in crude oil. These tight supplies have resulted, in part, from the crude 
glut itself. As the glut hit in late 1985 and prices tumbled, U.S. motorists -- 
encouraged by the relaxation of fuel economy standards and of speed limits -- 
responded by using sharply higher levels of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
This followed the shutdown of dozens of unneeded refineries across the country 
in the early 1980s, which cut the nation's refining capacity by some 15%. Then, 
as demand began to rise, clean-air regulations and industry uncertainty over 
future oil prices served to block any investments in new refinery capacity. For 
many months, the nation's refineries have been operating at near capacity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Severe Problem in California 
</P>
<P>
"There is a fundamental underlying upward pressure on prices because we are 
near the limit of our gasoline-making capacity in this country," says a veteran 
Energy Department analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say the problem is most severe in California. Gasoline 
demand here is rising fastest, resistance to refinery expansion is greatest, 
and the cost of making gasoline is highest because of the heavy types of crude 
oil used here and the environmental restrictions on refineries. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the government-funded East-West Center in Honolulu warned 
that with the scheduled decline in production of oil from Alaska -- source of 
about 40% of the crude oil entering California refineries -- the state's 
motorists face tight supplies for several years. As a result, they will 
continue to pay more at the pumps than the rest of the country and will 
increasingly rely on imported gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
That would further heighten the West Coast's vulnerability to the mere threat 
of minor interruptions of supply, as occurred in the two weeks after the Alaska 
spill when tanker traffic was restricted and some 13 million barrels of crude 
oil were not shipped. 
</P>
<P>
(The California gasoline outlook is particularly cloudy in light of the 
dramatic new clean-air plan enacted earlier this year by the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District. It would impose sweeping new restrictions on 
Southern California's oil refineries in the 1990s -- presumably cutting further 
the local gasoline supply -- at the same time it mandated widespread use of 
other fuels for cars.) 
</P>
<P>
The price impact of the Alaska spill has triggered legislation in Congress to 
lower the threshold at which the President could order an emergency drawdown of 
the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the nation's 560-million-barrel stockpile 
of crude stored in salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Such a step could head off the "psychological shock effect" that was registered 
in California's wholesale gasoline markets within hours of the tanker spill, 
says John Lichtblau, head of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Price spikes of up to 35 cents a gallon were reported at some Los Angeles area 
refineries within a week of the oil spill. Spot prices jumped 20 cents in a 
four-hour period. The national average price increase was 10 cents a gallon at 
the pump in the two weeks after the spill, the fastest such rise ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Lichtblau also urged the establishment of regional reserves of gasoline and 
other finished products, an idea that has been explored in past years by state 
officials in California, Hawaii and New England but opposed by the Energy 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"If there had been two or three million barrels of (reserve) gasoline on the 
West Coast on March 24, ready for instant release, West Coast gasoline prices 
would hardly have risen by headline-making magnitudes as they did," says 
Lichtblau. He says the Alaskan incident "could easily have developed into a . . 
. sub-crisis" had it continued for two more weeks.

U.S. HAS NEW WEAPON IN ITS TRADE ARSENAL; 
</P>
<P>
AS NATIONS BRACE FOR 'SUPER 301,' SOME WORRY THAT 1988 LAW COULD BACKFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bureaucrats at the U.S. trade representative's office found pillows on their 
sofa arms and pizza leftovers in their wastebaskets when they arrived at work 
last Monday -- signs that the weekend's negotiations with South Korea had 
lasted well into the wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
The marathon talks -- not only with the Koreans but with officials of a host of 
other countries as well -- all stem from one fact: The United States is about 
to launch a new weapon in its trade arsenal, and South Korea and other U.S. 
trading partners are scrambling to avoid becoming targets. 
</P>
<P>
The new trade weapon -- known as "Super 301," after a section of last year's 
Omnibus Trade Act that requires the White House to initiate "unfair" trade 
practices proceedings against countries whose trade barriers the U.S. finds 
egregious -- can be effective. Under threat of eventual U.S. retaliation, South 
Korea agreed last week to liberalize its foreign investment restrictions and 
open its market to foreign advertising agencies, travel agencies and 
pharmaceuticals. It also pledged to stop closing its borders to protect new 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the new procedure looks routine enough: Once the list of 
allegations is published, the targeted country has up to two years to reduce 
its trade barriers. If it refuses, Washington would be under pressure to 
"retaliate" -- by barring some of the country's exports or imposing new 
tariffs. The target list is scheduled to be made public before next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills said the new process has already given 
her "a good bit of leverage" to use in wringing concessions from U.S. trading 
partners. "We've probably had more intensive negotiations ongoing in the last 
30 days than we had achieved earlier," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts fear that the new deterrent could just as easily explode in 
the Administration's face. In South Korea's case, for example, whatever 
Americans' perceptions of that country's trade barriers, the prospect that the 
United States was "getting tough" on Seoul has sparked anti-American riots 
there, undercutting South Korean President Roh Tae Woo and impeding U.S. 
efforts to keep the Roh government stable. Similar situations exist in other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Frans Andriessen, the European Community's trade minister, insists that the EC 
will not even agree to take part in negotiations with the United States as long 
as it is under the duress of the new Super 301 law. "We are prepared to look at 
any problem that may exist, but formal negotiations -- not," Andriessen 
asserted on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
And several U.S. trading partners -- including both the EC and Japan -- have 
threatened to challenge the U.S. legislation in the Geneva-based General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 96-country organization that sets and 
enforces global trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
Andriessen asserted earlier this month that retaliation under Section 301 "runs 
counter to basic GATT principles and is in clear violation of" international 
trade law. "The EC will continue to defend its GATT rights whenever Section 301 
is used," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some analysts fear that too tough a stance on Washington's part could 
spur retaliation by other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, 
warns that Washington's "bashing" of its allies and trade partners -- along 
with increasing pressure for retaliation -- could spark a trade war that would 
bring on a global recession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Saving Rate Blamed 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, could ultimately derail the 2-year-old Uruguay Round of global 
trade liberalization talks now under way in Geneva. U.S. officials are hoping 
to win agreement for a major reduction in trade barriers around the world and 
new rules covering trade in services. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Hills conceded this week, knocking down other countries' trade barriers 
can go only so far toward solving the U.S. deficit problem. Most economists 
believe that the main reason the United States is running a huge trade deficit 
is that Americans are consuming more than they are able to produce and must buy 
more goods from abroad. With saving here so low, there is not enough money to 
expand production capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"While there are some unfair trading practices out there (that) need to be 
rooted out, they are not the cause of our trade deficit," Boskin said recently. 
He warned that "the biggest danger to the (U.S.) economy is the "incredible 
gathering momentum" for retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Administration itself has been divided internally over how best to 
employ the new trade weapon. Hills and Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher 
have been pushing for a tough show of force, particularly against Japan, which 
is the object of Congress' ire this year. 
</P>
<P>
But others -- ranging from Secretary of State James A. Baker III to 
presidential National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft -- have been urging more 
caution, arguing that there is more to consider in U.S. relations with other 
countries than trade barriers alone. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. strategists concede openly that they now regard maintaining the 
U.S.-Japanese alliance as the nation's most important foreign policy objective 
for the next several years. Japan is America's No. 1 ally in the Pacific and a 
vital source of financing for the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Alan J. Stoga, an international economics specialist for Kissinger Associates 
in New York, warns that the "automaticity" of the new trade law -- the fact 
that it virtually mandates retaliation if other countries do not meet U.S. 
demands -- is apt to be seen as protectionist. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, all sides are expecting to see a major battle within the 
Administration over how to handle the Super 301 controversy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Japan Sentiment High 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, the Administration's trade generals are mapping out their targets 
for the new Super 301 weapon. The Cabinet-level Economic Policy Council has 
already made a preliminary recommendation on a list of five foreign trade 
practices to cite as "unfair" under the new trade law and is expected to go to 
the President for a final decision early this week. 
</P>
<P>
With congressional sentiment against Japan so high, the list includes two such 
practices by Japan -- the refusal of the Japanese government to buy U.S.-made 
satellites and supercomputers and Japan's complex and stringent lumber 
standards, which they say are crafted to keep U.S. products out. 
</P>
<P>
The group has also proposed citing Brazilian rules relating to trade licensing 
and India's restrictions on foreign investment and on foreign-based insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
And it recommended that South Korea, Taiwan and the European Community -- three 
others on an earlier list of candidates -- not be cited at all. 
</P>
<P>
For all the hullaballoo about U.S. unilateralism under the new Super 301 
procedure, the proposal is deftly crafted to send some clear signals to U.S. 
trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is on the list for two alleged but relatively minor violations -- an 
effort to mollify Congress yet avoid provoking a confrontation with Japan. Two 
surprise entrants -- India and Brazil -- have been prickly opponents of U.S. 
efforts in the current Uruguay Round of trade liberalization talks, and putting 
them on the list makes American chagrin over their positions even more plain. 
</P>
<P>
Omitting South Korea and Taiwan rewards them for having lifted some trade 
barriers earlier this year. And omitting the European Community avoids any 
confrontation there at a time when the United States is seeking to keep Europe 
open to U.S. goods as the Common Market creates a single integrated market in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
To top it all off, the Cabinet Council is proposing to name only specific trade 
practices rather than entire countries in the new listing -- meaning there 
would be no mandatory retaliation. If the Administration cited a country, it 
would be required to launch unfair trading practices proceedings against every 
trade practice listed in the complaint. Merely citing individual trade 
practices would do no more than set an agenda for items that the United States 
would like to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the lackluster listing will satisfy trade hawks in 
Congress. Protectionist sentiment -- particularly against Japan -- is more 
intense than ever this year despite the enactment of last year's trade law. 
</P>
<P>
Hills tried to skirt the issue Friday. "We're trying faithfully to carry out 
the law," she told reporters. "More than that I cannot tell you." 
</P>
<P>
In practice, Super 301 need not be as deadly as it seems, particularly if the 
White House is willing to take on Congress in cases where the lawmakers believe 
that the Administration has not been aggressive enough. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a targeted country refuses to meet U.S. demands that it change its 
trade practices, the President can still decide not to retaliate if he believes 
that such action would run counter to the national interest. 
</P>
<P>
And although the new Super 301 law empowers the chief executive to retaliate 
against recalcitrant trading partners, it also permits him to continue 
negotiations if he believes that it may prove fruitful. 
</P>
<P>
Hills reminded reporters recently that despite the new weapon in its arsenal, 
the Administration's long-term trade policy "still is to open markets and 
expand trade." She pledged not to use the new law "in a bullying way." 
</P>
<P>
And it still is not certain how much in new concessions the United States can 
win using the new law as a cudgel. Indeed, so far, at least, the gains have 
been small. "We're about in the same place that we'd be if we didn't have the 
new law," one U.S. trade negotiator says.

STEVE JOBS' NEXT ACT; 
</P>
<P>
HIS NEW PC ISN'T READY, FORCING THE CO-FOUNDER OF APPLE TO 'SELL HIMSELF' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Will the magic work yet a third time for computer marketing whiz Steve Jobs? 
</P>
<P>
After bringing the world two of its most popular personal computers, the Apple 
II and the Macintosh, the co-founder and former chairman of Apple Computer has 
been crisscrossing the country trying to win support and customers for his 
latest creation, the Next computer. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jobs and his lieutenants are loath to acknowledge it, their task is 
enormous and the outcome is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
Seven months after its unveiling to a hand-picked, standing-room-only crowd in 
San Francisco's symphony hall, the Next computer remains incomplete and behind 
schedule. It is still not for sale to the general public, it can perform few 
useful and routine office tasks and it has no ready-made market awaiting its 
arrival. Indeed, even upstart Next Inc.'s announcement of a $100-million 
marketing arrangement with Businessland nearly two months ago was viewed in 
some quarters as a sign of weakness, an admission by Jobs that he could not 
succeed by sticking to his original plan to exclusively serve the 
higher-education market. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the considerable remaining hurdles, the sleek, black Next cube does 
have one asset no other computer available today has: charismatic 34-year-old 
Steven P. Jobs himself, a natural at hyping high tech. 
</P>
<P>
"If his name weren't Steve Jobs, the task he faces would be impossible," says 
one software publisher. "Because of who he is, Next has a fighting chance." 
</P>
<P>
A lot is riding on Jobs' venture. On the line are his reputation and personal 
fortune -- Jobs has invested at least $12 million of his own money in the 
project. Beyond that, there is the issue of whether an entirely new computer 
system, with its own unique way of handling data, can find a place in a 
maturing market dominated by big-name manufacturers that are not about to be 
dazzled by Jobs' computer. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Jobs has succeeded at this before. 
</P>
<P>
The Apple II, which he fashioned with former partner Steve Wozniak, created the 
whole notion of a personal computer industry in 1977 at a time few even saw the 
necessity for these machines. Seven years later, Jobs spearheaded the design 
and introduction of the Macintosh, a machine that blazed new ground in computer 
graphics and easy-to-use operations. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the computer industry believe the Next machine is yet another in Jobs' 
pioneering efforts and already are lining up to see, and buy, it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are enough people interested in what Jobs does that he can spend the 
next year or two just selling to curious tekkies, researchers and software 
developers. And that may be enough to get the ball rolling," says Paul Cubbage, 
an analyst at Dataquest, a San Jose technology market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs, intense and brash, is trying to capitalize on the excitement he's created 
as he presses independent software writers and corporate computer researchers 
to turn their talents to developing programs that exploit the futuristic 
features of his system. Among the most advanced pieces of the Next machine are 
two proprietary chips that speed the flow of data, an erasable optical disk for 
data storage, a compact-disc quality sound system and, perhaps most important, 
an integrated internal software system that allows average users -- not just 
computer programmers -- to construct their own personal programs. 
</P>
<P>
Several important software developers, such as Lotus Development and 
Ashton-Tate, have agreed to write programs for the Next machine, but the first 
of these will not be available until late this year, and even then, these 
initial efforts are likely to be rewrites of existing programs and not new 
applications that take advantage of Next's advanced data, graphics and 
sound-processing capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
While he waits for the programs to trickle in -- and prods his software 
engineers, who are already about two or three months behind schedule, to 
complete the machine's internal code -- Jobs is wasting no opportunity to 
promote his machine. 
</P>
<P>
For someone who is not terribly comfortable pressing the flesh, Jobs has made a 
remarkable number of public appearances at conventions, trade shows and other, 
smaller events. Still, he picks and chooses his events carefully and, according 
to associates, has declined all requests from reporters for interviews since 
the computer unveiling extravaganza last October. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve's in a marketing mode," says one company insider. 
</P>
<P>
Adds Richard Shaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter: "Steve is trying 
to create enough irrational desire to keep the company going until the real 
applications arrive. He's buying time by creating the excitement that bigger, 
better-financed companies wished they had. To a large degree Steve is selling 
himself now." 
</P>
<P>
All the same, analysts say they haven't forgotten that software is the most 
critical issue facing Jobs at this point. "This could be the best machine on 
the market," says one analyst. "But we don't know, and we can't know until the 
software is there to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Features Called 'Trivial' 
</P>
<P>
Among the software publishers that have balked at developing software for Next 
is Microsoft, the world's largest developer of personal computer programs. "We 
haven't ruled out writing applications for Next entirely," explains a 
spokeswoman. "But we wonder if a totally new system that doesn't work with 
anything out there now can garner enough market share to justify our commitment 
of resources." 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Chairman William H. Gates has been less gracious in his assessment of 
the machine. "Most of these features are truly trivial," he has been quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer says that although he thinks the Next has "the same magic feeling" the 
Macintosh did at its introduction five years ago, he does not believe the Next 
has the financial strength to last the two years that the Macintosh needed to 
establish a firm footing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feeling the Pressure 
</P>
<P>
A number of analysts say Jobs must demonstrate by October -- the first 
anniversary of the computer's unveiling -- that the Next computer is as much 
reality as promise if he wants corporate buyers and analysts to continue taking 
the machine seriously. It's a deadline that puts him under the gun to show some 
substantial progress fairly soon. To some, Jobs already shows signs of feeling 
that pressure. 
</P>
<P>
In late March, he shifted from his original game plan of selling only to the 
higher-education market by cutting a marketing and service deal with 
Businessland, the nation's largest business-oriented computer retail chain. 
Insiders say the change was made in part to lure software developers to write 
programs for the machine by showing them that it would have a greater audience 
than just the nation's 3,000 college and university campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"Next is going to have to play catch-up on software development if it intends 
to compete," says Robert Herwick, a technology analyst with the San Francisco 
brokerage firm Hambrecht &amp; Quist. "There are competitors out there that are 
already getting some of the same features as Next has. Jobs doesn't have an 
open window of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best chance for Next is if someone publishes a program that opens 
up entire new arenas of work, much the way desktop publishing boosted the 
Macintosh and the way the Lotus spreadsheet created demand for the IBM personal 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
What will Next's key program be? "If we knew the answer, we would already have 
a machine doing just that," says Stewart Alsop, publisher of a personal 
computer newsletter in the Silicon Valley. "That's the whole deal about new 
systems." 
</P>
<P>
Even without breakthrough applications, Businessland executives have officially 
predicted that they will sell $100 million of Next machines in the first year, 
the equivalent of about 15,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experimental Orders 
</P>
<P>
Businessland's vice president of advance systems, Kevin Compton, goes so far as 
to say he expects first-year sales to hit $200 million, a level that would make 
the Next the most successful start-up computer company ever. 
</P>
<P>
Although analysts agree that plenty of corporations are willing to buy one or 
two Next computers for their research laboratories and software developers, 
they caution that initial sales for such experimental purposes do not 
necessarily lead to huge follow-up orders because big corporations are 
reluctant to scrap their existing investments in technology and start fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one technology buyer at a Fortune 500 company says he has ordered just 
a single Next machine for evaluation. Unless the machine turns out to be 
substantially more sophisticated and capable than he expects, he says he won't 
purchase another. 
</P>
<P>
"A new computer system coming into a business has to offer real benefit, real 
value," says the buyer, who asked not to be identified. "It has to answer the 
question: How is this machine going to make the company more money?" 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the buyer admits that the real reason for buying a Next machine is not 
all it would seem on the surface. "We want to know what's inside those boxes, 
because we know that some of that stuff will show up in IBM machines in two or 
three years," he explains.

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: TAKEOVER CANDIDATES ARE TODAY'S BLUE-PLATE SPECIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Crudele, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>

<P>
Once a month a group of about 15 stockbrokers from different investment firms 
in Chicago get together for lunch at the Brokers Inn on South LaSalle St., 
across from the Chicago Board of Trade, to exchange ideas. 
</P>
<P>
But these days the brokers aren't discussing which companies will have 
blockbuster new products, or which industries are about to have an earnings 
revival, or even where they think the stock market is going. Instead, they sit 
around for about 90 minutes trying to pick the next corporate takeover 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"We bounce stories off each other," says Mike Rzepka, a broker at Prescott, 
Ball &amp; Turben Inc. "Lately it's mostly hot stories." 
</P>
<P>
"Hot" in Wall Street's lingo means stories about corporate takeovers, 
restructurings and the like. "It's one of the only ways to make money in this 
market," adds Rzepka. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices overall have been up this year; in fact, up sharply. Even so, most 
of the professionals who work with the stock market seem unusually insecure 
about their good fortune. Now even brokers, usually among the more conservative 
of the Wall Street bunch and the closest link to the public, seem to have 
become far more aggressive, handling stocks as speculators and traders do. And 
they've been bitten by the takeover bug, hoping to make the money and run. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Goldman, head of technical market analysis for A. G. Edwards in St. 
Louis, says interest in takeover stocks is "definitely up" over the past few 
months, especially among those clients he calls "stockaholics." 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a definite increase among individual investors in playing each 
day's stock du jour," says Goldman, whose job it is to spot unusual trading 
patterns in a stock that could be a forerunner to a takeover and relay the 
information to his brokers. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to say whether the Chicago lunchers are an anomaly or the 
beginning of the next trend. Experts say the get-together such as the one at 
the Brokers Inn takes place in all major cities, and more frequently the latest 
in corporate takeovers and rumors is the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
There has, of course, always been a hard-core group of brokers (and investors, 
for that matter) who've been willing to put their money into risky takeover 
situations. But only recently does it seem that the allure of quick and big 
profits from the takeovers of companies such as NWA Corp and RJR Nabisco has 
started to grab the attention of a wider group of brokers. And these brokers 
are hooking clients on their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago luncheon meetings were begun six months ago and are the clearest 
indication of how far some brokers have come since the crash. This type of 
get-together is not only unusual because of the topic discussed, but because 
brokers have no qualms about sharing ideas freely with their peers (and 
competitors) at other firms. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the same pressure that brought brokers to deal in speculative 
stocks seems to have created a camaraderie among brokers that transcends 
company lines. 
</P>
<P>
There were about 100,000 stockbrokers before the 1987 crash. Of those, the 
Securities Industries Assn. estimates that 8% to 10% have lost their jobs. 
Those who have hung on have seen their compensation decline sharply over the 
past two years. One estimate is that brokers, on average, now earn only about 
80% of what they did before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers have resorted to hawking fixed-rate investments such as certificates of 
deposit and exotic investments with high commissions to clients who still want 
no part of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Newer brokers without an established client list have been doing even worse, 
with some probably wishing they were a Maytag repairman so they'd get a little 
more action. 
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for (trading in takeovers)," said another broker in the Chicago 
group, "my business would be down 60% instead of 40%." 
</P>
<P>
"My clients like that kind of action," he added. "It's where the money is being 
made." 
</P>
<P>
James Pascoe, a broker in the Darien, Conn., office of Janney Montgomery Scott, 
doesn't play speculative stocks but he does get involved in takeover deals that 
have been announced but not completed. That is arbitrage in its truest form. 
And Pascoe says a lot of brokers he knows are doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can make 7% or 8% in a couple of months, it's a lot better than having 
money in the bank or in the market," says Pascoe, who says he's still nervous 
about the general market. 
</P>
<P>
Small investors are also apparently still nervous from the crash, but there may 
be signs of hope for brokers. Stock prices have blossomed in May, thanks mainly 
to encouraging news on inflation. And even though the return of the small 
investor to the stock market has been incorrectly predicted numerous times 
before, this time, experts say, it really could occur. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Schaefer, senior vice president of the securities association, says 
that as late as last March 30 there was evidence of only a "very slight" growth 
in interest in stocks by small investors. "Only now are they getting more 
aggressive," says Schaefer. 
</P>
<P>
William Coppel, vice president of marketing at the discount brokerage firm of 
Quick &amp; Reilly, also thinks that the May rally has caught the attention of 
small investors. But, he says, "it's not dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
If the stock market does continue to rise and if small investors are lured back 
into the market, then maybe those folks at the Brokers Inn can worry about the 
soup du jour, rather than the rumor du jour. 
</P>
<P>
How did the financial market handle last week's attack of the killer economic 
figures? At first glance, not too badly. Inflation on the producer level rose 
just 0.4% in April, which wasn't nearly as bad as expected. And inflation on 
the consumer level, which rose 0.7%, wasn't any worse than Wall Street 
expected. And for good measure, the nation's trade deficit shrank $1 billion in 
March to $8.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But the numbers weren't really anything to cheer about, either. The trade 
deficit fell because America's exports rose sharply, which means that the 
nation's economy may not be slowing as much as experts had hoped. This means 
that the pros could soon start worrying about inflation and higher interest 
rates all over again. 
</P>
<P>
And inflation on the consumer level is up 5.1% from April, 1988, to April, 
1989. "Year-over-year inflation numbers look pretty bad," says Edward Yardeni, 
chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities. 
</P>
<P>
What will happen to interest rates in the months ahead? Experts say the key is 
the dollar. The only way to get the greenback down -- as the United States 
seems to want -- may be to lower interest rates in America and raise them 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Can a new line of copiers and some new printers save Xerox Corp.'s 
independence? 
</P>
<P>
B. Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities, believes that 
these new products, together with a cost-cutting effort begun by the company 
last year, may be all that stands between the company and an unwanted takeover 
attempt. If Xerox mishandles these products and doesn't improve its earnings, 
there could be trouble, says Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
"If they manage to bungle this, the probability that someone goes after them is 
high," says Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street speculators, of course, always jump the gun. So for the past couple 
of weeks there have been rumors of an imminent bid for Xerox. The Stamford, 
Conn.-based technology company's stock has moved predictably higher, although 
its rise moderated when Hanson Trust -- one of the rumored suitors -- said in 
no uncertain terms that it wasn't planning any big acquisition at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the speculators aren't disheartened. They think that Xerox, with its 
numerous product lines, its servicing capabilities and its financial services 
subsidiary, can be easily dismembered by some enterprising raider. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential-Bache's Henderson, meanwhile, thinks that Xerox's stock -- which was 
trading in the mid-$60s last week -- could reach $73 in six months and $82 in 
12 to 18 months. And that's without any of the takeover premonitions coming 
true. In a takeover, Xerox could be worth $100 to $125 a share, Henderson 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street may be getting more and more optimistic about a so-called "soft 
landing" for the United States economy, but economists are even more convinced 
that the landing will be hard -- with a recession in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which surveys the nation's top economists, says 
21% of the experts it surveyed in May think that a recession will occur this 
year, and another 47% think that it will begin in 1990. That's a total of 68% 
who think that there will be a recession either this year or next. 
</P>
<P>
In Blue Chip's January poll, 65% of the economists surveyed felt that there 
would be a recession this year or next, although the distribution was a bit 
different. Then, 35% of the economists thought that the recession would come in 
1989 and 30% thought that it would start in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental Petroleum's stock rose last Tuesday on a rumor that the company 
would announce a restructuring at this week's shareholder meeting. There was 
also a recurring rumor that Occidental's 87-year-old chairman Armand Hammer was 
ill. An Occidental Petroleum spokesman said there would be no major 
announcement this coming week, and he said Hammer was fine but volunteered to 
"stay in bed for a couple of days" if it'll help the stock price . . . 
</P>
<P>
An analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. got people who are speculating in 
Time Inc. stock very excited last week when he told a little-known news service 
subscribed to by most Wall Street traders that a recent lawsuit against Time by 
Viacom could endanger "a leveraged buyout of Time (that was) recently proposed 
by a major investment banking house." "Woo!" said the speculators who read the 
remarks. "We didn't know anyone had proposed a leveraged buyout." Londoner 
didn't return telephone calls. But a Wall Street source says there is no such 
offer and that the analyst now has "egg on his face" . . . 
</P>
<P>
CNW has cleverly suggested that the Interstate Commerce Commission review all 
transactions involving railroads, whether with public or private parties. CNW, 
of course, is a railroad, and Japonica Partners, a private company, is trying 
to acquire it. A review of the transaction by the ICC could slow things down 
quite a bit -- maybe for years . . .

TIMBER POLICY A 'FIASCO'

There are many, many women in America who stand ready to help save those 
endangered trees in Alaska that you reported on. We wouldn't just be doing this 
for the trees, either. We would be doing it for ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Why? We hate rayon! It should have been left in a time capsule, sealed in the 
1930s, and forgotten. Rayon wrinkles, stretches and usually has to be 
dry-cleaned after use. Generally speaking, it is a great big pain! After 
decades of having the use of the miracle fabrics such as nylon, polyester and, 
miracle of miracles, ultrasuede, now we are faced with expensive clothing made 
from a fiber that is awful. 
</P>
<P>
I and many friends have taken the pledge. No more rayon, ever! No matter how 
attractive a garment may be, if it is made of rayon, it will stay in the shop. 
Perhaps eventually the word will become strong enough that the manufacturers 
will sit up and take notice. Then, if they cooperate, the trees will be saved. 
Our wardrobes will not suffer, either.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A routine look for a TV movie on a frantic schedule. Pale faces, sleepless 
eyes. Some crew members, feet up, yawning, thumbing through paperback 
mysteries. Then scurrying, setting up the next scene. The director chides the 
cast to "hearse and then rehearse." 
</P>
<P>
On the men's room door, the sound crew posts the normal instruction: 
</P>
<P>
 Do Not Flush When We Are Rolling! 
</P>
<P>
A smart aleck scrawls subtitles: (Do not roll if you are flushing). 
</P>
<P>
(Also, do not eat any rolls in Flushing, N.Y.) 
</P>
<P>
Bored little-boy actor Joe Mazello III, 5, with a shock of strawberry-blond 
hair and round, little-boy knees, waits doggedly for his dress-up courtroom 
scene. He rolls up his tie into a ball and lets it unravel. He sticks out his 
tongue at nobody. He puffs out his cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
But the movie work-a-day scene belies this particular shoot, which has one of 
those unspecific titles that ring deadly, "Unspeakable Acts." It's another one 
of those reflections of unspeakable human behavior that docu-television has 
embraced. 
</P>
<P>
These particular acts represent the first of a horror genre to come to script 
form -- multiple child sexual abuse at a day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
Bits of gracious old Charleston, with its anachronistic city smells of 
horse-carriage tours, are standing in for a tranquil, green southwest Miami 
suburb with the mellow name of Country Walk. That's where the story actually 
happened. There were perhaps 50 victims, some as young as 18 months, one the 
son of the perpetrators (changed to daughter for this movie to protect the 
boy). The offenses were so repugnant as to defy comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Fuster Escalona was sentenced to six consecutive life terms in 
prison. Wife Illiana, who pleaded guilty, was given 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The case blasted into the national consciousness about the same time as the 
McMartin Pre-School hoopla, now in its third year of prosecution, the longest 
criminal trial in the world -- with many more months to go. (It beats the 
Hillside Strangler trial -- two years and two days, relates the Guinness Book 
of World Records.) 
</P>
<P>
The Country Walk case, which lasted five weeks in court, claims its own 
distinctions: the first successful prosecution on multiple child sexual abuses 
and, very possibly, the prototype on how to manage such complex and 
disagreeable matters. 
</P>
<P>
And this movie version, scheduled for airing by ABC in November, has a 
distinction -- righteous fervor. 
</P>
<P>
It starts with Linda Otto, who developed and produced the heralded 
missing-child docudrama, "Adam." She insisted on directing on this occasion, 
her first behind the camera on a major project. 
</P>
<P>
She speaks of her motivation with disarming candor: "I was one of those 
one-out-of-three women who was molested as a child," she said, the anger in her 
voice rising. "I feel that no matter what, that my goal, my real goal with this 
film, is to make a difference for all those women and all of the one-out-of-six 
men who were molested as little boys and all the children who this is happening 
to now, so that at least children will be viewed differently within the overall 
system itself so that they don't get raped twice." 
</P>
<P>
Child psychologist Joe Bragga, who with his wife, Laurie, also a psychologist, 
were the heroes of the prosecution and now are heroes of the movie (they're 
played by Jill Clayburgh and Brad Davis), was moved by the mood on the set: 
"They (members of the crew) come up to us and say, 'I haven't told anybody 
about it, but this happened to me as a kid.' I've had others that have come up 
to me and said, 'This happened to my kid.' 
</P>
<P>
"I've had others come up and say, 'You know, I usually work on these (movie) 
projects as just going to work, but I feel really good about this one because 
I've got little kids.' " 
</P>
<P>
The plot plays out the legal trickeries of the case and the anguish of the 
families -- but effectively centers on the Braggas, the specialists in child 
development who were brought in by the Dade County prosecutors to talk with the 
children. The Braggas knew nothing about the case, much less about any sexual 
abuse (not their field) and were expecting only a couple days of consulting. 
</P>
<P>
They sat on the floor of one office with bright toys, with a TV camera set up 
in one corner to record the interviews. The children came in one by one -- and 
the Braggas ended up making 49 videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
Jason, played here by little Joey, was the first one to face the psychologists 
-- and, as it turned out, was the most forthcoming and fearless of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
As portrayed in the film, they invite Jason to play with the toy truck. They 
ask him if he knows why he came here today. 
</P>
<P>
"Um," Jason comes back, in what we learn is ironic understatement, "we're just 
having trouble with the baby-sitter." 
</P>
<P>
It was the Braggas' casual and careful manner with children ("I talk good 3- 
and 4- and 5-year-old," said Joe Bragga) that unraveled the terrible dimensions 
of the case: oral sex on children (one child had gonorrhea of the throat), 
naked ring-around-the-rosy games, drugs administered to children, excrement 
rituals, devil prayers, killing of animals, terrorization, etc. 
</P>
<P>
The Braggas were popular figures -- and loving images -- on the movie set, 
holding hands, sharing a plastic foam cup of noodle soup, Joe taking photos and 
home videotapes, Laurie ready for a summons to each scene to lend actress 
Clayburgh selected pieces of her jewelry -- "They wanted some personal touch." 
</P>
<P>
In the Florida case, the couple was originally viewed with skepticism, as some 
sort of hippie hangovers. They normally wear '60s Dressup -- jeans, T-shirts, 
festive vests, perhaps "Miami Vice" warm-up jackets. Of course, there are suits 
and other solidly middle-class fare for solemnities such as court appearances 
and formal photos. Joe has richly graying hair wrapped into a pony tail; Laurie 
has deep brown hair that has grown to the back of her knees, and around the set 
Joe would help her brush it out and then twist it into a braid. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their unorthodox image for the notoriously straight world of criminal 
investigation, they exude commitment and went on from Country Walk to consult 
on "literally hundreds of cases," for which they work unpaid through a 
nonprofit foundation that is funded from their own savings. The Braggas say 
they haven't taken any money for consulting since the Country Walk case. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 months in 1987-88, they consulted the Los Angeles County District 
Attorney's Office on "McMartin," which around this movie was a profane word. 
</P>
<P>
Director Otto didn't want to be quoted on the McMartin case. Producer Joan 
Barnett noted, "Anybody who's been close to it knows that it's been a bad mess. 
That didn't happen here (in the Country Walk case). They didn't allow that to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
On mention of McMartin, the Braggas look at each other and smile at some 
private joke. Then they shared the joke: "Well, we refer to it in our own way 
-- as a root canal," said Laurie Bragga. 
</P>
<P>
Just what went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
"With every bit of candor I can give you, I'd be very happy to talk to you, but 
I feel limited in my freedom to be able to comment at this time. It would not 
be appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
As for a Hollywood version of McMartin, there is only vague talk about TV 
projects. Veteran writer-producer Abby Mann has a contract with Random House 
for a book on McMartin and then, he said, he hopes to do a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, who wrote "Judgment at Nuremberg," "The Marcus-Nelson Murders," "The 
Atlanta Child Murders" and the current HBO miniseries "The Simon Wiesenthal 
Story: The Murderers Among Us," said he and wife Myra already have done 
"hundreds of hours" of interviews for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said he couldn't reveal whose rights he has contracted, but in the past he 
told Times reporters that he has contracts with the five former defendants and 
oral agreements with the current two defendants. 
</P>
<P>
CBS is shooting a movie in Los Angeles on a fictional case of sex abuse in a 
day-care center. The movie, "O Do You Know the Muffin Man," is produced by Jon 
Avnet and Jordan Kerner and directed by veteran Gil Cates. 
</P>
<P>
It has to do with the so-called Tiny Tot Pre-School, which is run (we 
eventually learn) by child molester-Satanists. A police officer learns that his 
4-year-old son has been molested and terrorized by his teachers -- then later 
discovers that his 14-year-old son, who has become rowdy and obnoxious, 
likewise was abused. 
</P>
<P>
It comes to a sensational trial involving a self-serving prosecutor and a 
loathsome defense attorney who tries to destroy the children on the witness 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
The Braggas, who stayed in Charleston for the whole four-week shoot before 
returning to their Florida home, had good vibes for "Unspeakable Acts" -- 
because they feel a film such as this can change the public's perception of 
child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
aid Laurie Bragga, "One of the actors was saying that a lot of times on 
issue-oriented television, what happens is that people watch it and turn off 
the TV with a sigh of relief and say, 'Now this problem is taken care of. I 
watched this so now I don't have to worry about it.' " But, her husband put in, 
"This is not a disease of the week here." 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Bragga was summoned to the set; they needed her jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Bragga went on: "It's hard for people to absorb that 98% of the people 
walking the streets of America cannot understand why someone would want to have 
sex with a baby or a 3-year-old or a 7-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"But 2% of the people walking the streets of America think day in and day out 
about their next sexual object being a child! Two percent of America's 
population -- 4 million people walking the streets of America who are rapists 
of children!" 
</P>
<P>
The cycle of victims and victimizers continues. Trust and intimacy are 
destroyed. The fabric of the family and the fabric of society is ripped -- but 
film can change perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"It (film) has this dramatic effect to the people who will not watch 'Geraldo' 
do exploitation on child abuse," he said. "I mean, you have Geraldo (Rivera) on 
the one hand doing at least 10 child molestation shows a year and looking for 
any angle he can get, and the attitudes, frightfully so, that people have. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand you have an occasional film like 'Something About Amelia' 
(on incest) and, hopefully, 'Unspeakable Acts,' and that stays with the fabric 
of people's consciousness about the issue." 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning there was the "bible," the Herculean 592-page book about the 
case, "Unspeakable Acts" (Congdon &amp; Weed), written by Jan Hollingsworth, a 
former Miami TV news assignment editor. 
</P>
<P>
She befriended Country Walk parents and pored through "a couple hundred 
thousand pages of (trial) transcripts." As each deadline approached for 
segments of the book, she worked around the clock, fueled by Cuban coffee: 
"Burns holes in your stomach." 
</P>
<P>
Even during this incubation period, her agent (now former agent) badgered her 
with offers from at least 25 producers. The agent kept calling with offers and 
sending contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Hollingworth was reluctant: "In selling rights to the book, I was essentially 
selling the rights to a story that had been entrusted to me." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Barnett, a former NBC executive in movies, happened across "Unspeakable 
Acts" in a bookstore and, knowing of Otto's interest in the subject, bought it 
for her frequent collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
Author Hollingsworth, who has a son, now 11, had known Linda Otto's name from 
the "Adam" project, because those events happened in south Florida. Otto 
related, "I called Jan and she said, 'I wonder what took you so long.' " 
</P>
<P>
The project was put together by Otto's husband, Alan Landsburg, who has a 
curious record ranging from "That's Incredible!," "Jaws 3-D" and "Porky's II: 
The Next Day" on the one hand to celebrated TV movies such as "Adam," "Bill" 
with Mickey Rooney and "Quiet Victory: The Charlie Wedemeyer Story." 
</P>
<P>
Within the confines of the often-maligned craft of network docudrama, how 
accurate could this story be told? The language alone is, well, offensive to 
the public sensibility. Would ABC flip? 
</P>
<P>
As Landsburg relates, "The first script had gone off -- as best as I can put it 
-- on flights of dramatic invention." 
</P>
<P>
He sent the writers to Florida to look over the scene, meet the parents. The 
next version had even more invention. Landsburg set about to write the script 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Then to the network: "Their first response was, 'We are afraid this film cannot 
fit under the standards of ABC.' " Arguments went on: "Standards and Practices 
(the network censor) felt that in principle the possibility existed that this 
(movie) could panic parents of children in day care and cause major problems," 
Landsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
"And my answer to that was that I would be ecstatic to the extent that it would 
make them (parents) look at the day-care center more carefully and be able to 
ask their kids the questions that would be important." 
</P>
<P>
There followed two to three weeks of what is politely referred to as 
"negotiations." (Said an ABC publicist on said meetings, "We would not wish to 
comment.") The network demanded considerable documentation for this project, 
"far beyond any docudrama which they did," said Hollingsworth, who was in and 
out of Hollywood to help sweat out the script. 
</P>
<P>
Recalled Landsburg: "Very frankly, there was a scene that we always considered 
the Fred Allen Gorilla. You know the story. Fred Allen, when he dealt with 
Standards and Practices, had an obscene gorilla joke in his script, and each 
week he would put it in and argue for it until all other arguments went away." 
</P>
<P>
In "Unspeakable Acts," there was an actual question posed by one of the little 
victims to her mother -- was it all right to eat excrement. Landsburg used the 
slang term. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was trouble, but we had a frame -- that was the hardest we would 
get in terms of language and explicitness. That was the barrier line that we 
wouldn't cross," Landsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we would have left it in (it's out of the final script). We just 
had to have boundaries for ourselves when we write a script. We didn't want to 
put a lot of (bad) language in kids' mouths, while (we wanted to be) absolutely 
real." 
</P>
<P>
The line was cut. Landsburg, referred to by associates by the mildly 
affectionate name of "Big Foot," said perhaps only 300 to 400 words were 
changed during the discussions with the network. 
</P>
<P>
Charleston is ancient by the standards of most of the country. The County 
Courthouse is circa 1792. Across the street, City Hall was built in 1801, 
following the Beef Market Fire of 1796. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street again, the Federal Courthouse, a grand edifice of red marble 
staircases and rich brass fixtures and gratings, has been on respite, awaiting 
refurbishing. (Remodelers even found the original marble quarry in Italy.) 
</P>
<P>
The main floor Post Office is still operating and displays the roster of 
Charleston postmasters since Jan. 12, 1694. Also prominently portrayed is a 
photo of the "Charleston Stamp," which the pre-Civil War postmaster ran off 
when the Union stamps couldn't be used and the New Confederacy hadn't printed 
its own yet. 
</P>
<P>
But on the second floor, there was a contrast in centuries. Hollywood had taken 
over. It was the Dade County Courthouse and a drama was being enacted about 
what some people call a secret epidemic of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Director Otto said: "You have no idea. I go to cocktail parties and dinners and 
people seek me out because I have a reputation of advocating for children . . . 
and people disclose these things to me. They say, 'I've never told this to 
anyone.' Men and women in their 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s! And I say, 'You never 
told anyone until now! And you just told me?' And they say, 'That's right.' 
</P>
<P>
On incidents of multiple child-abuse cases, David Finkelhof, professor and 
co-director of the Family Research Laboratory at the University of New 
Hampshire, conducted a study counting only "substantiated" cases, meaning that 
an agency such as social services affirmed that abuse was done. 
</P>
<P>
He extrapolated that in 1983-85, there were as many as 550 cases of multiple 
abuse, involving 2,500 victimized children, out of the 229,000 day-care 
facilities in the nation serving 7 million children. 
</P>
<P>
He computed that reporting of sexual-abuse cases "has gone up on an average, 
I'd guess, of 25 to 30% a year for the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Toth, executive director of the National Center for Child Abuse 
Prosecution, reported the arrival of this "new" specialty: "We have a network 
now of over 800 prosecutors across the country who have identified themselves 
to us as specializing in child abuse prosecutions." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, requests for background information for a growing roster of available 
defense "expert witnesses" -- about 30 now, she estimated -- have become common 
in the last year, said Toth.

A BARRAGE OF LAWSUITS AGAINST VIDEO PIRATES; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN-LANGUAGE TAPE DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS TURN TO THE COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nick Roberts, a former Pasadena cop and now a private eye hired by the United 
States distributor of Asia's biggest producer of TV shows, had been staking out 
an upscale Glendale home from a hidden vantage point and things were starting 
to add up. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Roberts said, the crates being unloaded in the driveway and 
stored in the garage by the home's Asian residents contained far more tape than 
even the most avid home video copycat might need for personal use. The volume 
of incoming video supplies, he concluded, suggested pirating on an industrial 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
A search of the home's garbage provided the clincher that San Francisco-based 
Hong Kong TV Video Program Inc. needed to get a U.S. district judge to issue a 
civil seizure order. Wads of counterfeited HKTV video label backings were 
found, a clear trademark violation. Several days later, federal marshals raided 
the home, said Jonathan L. Kirsch, HKTV's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
In a backroom crowded with metal shelves, they found 44 VCRs copying, via a 
studio quality signal-switcher and a tangle of cables, an HKTV tape from a 
master VCR unit. Also warehoused within were 7,000 tapes copied from HKTV and 
other Asian film makers. 
</P>
<P>
A settlement, which included the payment of damages and the forfeiture of the 
offending tapes and VCRs, was reached between HKTV and the piraters -- their 
names and damages paid remain confidential. The Glendale raid represented just 
one of dozens coordinated in the last two years by Kirsch's Century City law 
firm for HKTV in Los Angeles -- virtually all of which have resulted in making 
piraters pay damages through court judgments or out-of-court settlements. 
</P>
<P>
For better or worse, HKTV's strategy of filing civil suits to enforce the law 
represents the only effective weapon available to video distributors, ethnic or 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is raise the cost to the bootlegger," Kirsch said. "If (the video 
industry) just gives up, the problem will become worse." 
</P>
<P>
Many licensed dealers, whether purveyors of Indian, Vietnamese, Arab or 
Japanese-language tapes, have all but given up on the FBI -- the lead agency in 
charge of policing the pirates. For most video dealers, this means no 
prosecution at all because they simply lack the financial resources to cover 
lengthy investigations and civil lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
These factors, together with the rapid acquisition of VCRs by those in ethnic 
communities eager for a link to their homelands, say video distributors, have 
spawned a marketplace where the dividing line between victims, small-time, 
back-of-the-shop bootleggers and big-time piraters is obscured by regulatory 
neglect and the lure of easy money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so serious I have to work night and day," said Kaitee M. Jung, HKTV's 
in-house attorney. "It's ruining our reputation because the pirated tapes are 
very fuzzy. It's not putting us out of business, but it is hurting us." If 
Jung's assessment sounds bleak, then consider the following: 
</P>
<P>
* Although the Motion Picture Assn. of America, the chief watchdog for the 
Hollywood studios, estimates that pirating losses account for $300 million, or 
10%, of U.S. video sales, non-English language video distributors are reporting 
losses of as high as 50%. Rafael Rivera, president of Condor Video, a 
distributor of Spanish-language videos, predicted routine sales of 2,500 copies 
for Condor's better selling movies would jump to 4,000 units without pirating. 
</P>
<P>
HKTV declined to specify its yearly income, but Jung said the firm loses $2 
million a year to piraters. Los Angeles is HKTV's biggest market with more than 
20 shops licensed to retail its videos -- it's also "our worst territory as far 
as pirating goes," Jung said. 
</P>
<P>
* Apathetic overseas video producers and cumbersome paperwork also slow the 
video pipeline for legitimate dealers while providing a huge window of 
opportunity for piraters. 
</P>
<P>
Brant Reiter, a spokesman for Fuji Sankei Communications International, the Los 
Angeles branch of Japan's Fuji-TV network, said the red tape involved in paying 
royalties, adding English subtitles and going through U.S. Customs delays the 
arrival of Japan's freshest shows by up to three weeks. It's tough getting 
viewers to watch Fuji-TV shows on KSCI Channel 18 in Los Angeles or KDOC 
Channel 56 in Anaheim when they've already rented them from bootlegged tape 
dealers, Reiter bemoaned. 
</P>
<P>
* A lot of pirating occurs in the very shops distributors rely on as prime 
customers. Condor's Rivera cites his experiences in the Spanish-language video 
industry -- the biggest players in the non-English language video business, 
posting annual sales of $30 million. "There are about 4,000 Latino video 
stores" in the U.S., he said. "They may be buying three or four tapes legally 
and making five or six more (pirated copies) in the back of the shop." 
</P>
<P>
* Piraters can be technically sophisticated and ruthlessly organized. 
Spanish-language video distributors say that piraters are known to bribe 
theater projectionists to make video copies. The employees at Latin American 
movie studios are also bribed into "lending" master film prints, permitting 
piraters to have fraudulent copies on the streets before legitimate 
distributors can even begin advertising the same film. 
</P>
<P>
* The FBI and U.S. Attorney General, the non-English-language dealers complain, 
haven't considered video pirating a priority at any level. "We are talking 
millions of dollars in losses," Rivera said. "The entire industry is 
frustrated. The FBI doesn't do anything. We are second-class citizens for these 
people. I hate to be blunt, but that's how it is." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the FBI's anti-pirating efforts were constrained by guidelines 
that rejected cases not worth more $500,000 in tapes and evidence of 
trafficking in at least three states. Moreover, U.S. Attorneys can modify these 
guidelines in their own jurisdictions, said Fred Reagan, an FBI public 
information officer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The FBI only investigates piracy cases that it feels will provide a strong 
impact on the community or involves a street value over $1 million," Reagan 
said. "The agency met with the MPAA a year ago and made them aware that the 
U.S. Attorney's office didn't have sufficient agents to enter every 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI's guidelines were so strict, MPAA officials have said, that the number 
of criminal copyright prosecutions dropped from 85 in 1980 to 24 last year. But 
late last year, the FBI revised its 8-year-old guidelines for investigating 
pirating violations, cutting minimum monetary losses in half and discarding the 
need to show cross-state trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"After a meeting with the MPAA (in January), in which they expressed their 
concerns, we changed our criteria," said Bill Carter, an FBI spokesman. 
"Whether it means more cases will be investigated, I don't know. Each U.S. 
attorney establishes their own criteria. If he or she could better use their 
manpower looking into organized crime," then so be it. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner, chief federal prosecutor for Los Angeles -- the 
nation's biggest pirating market -- declined to comment on whether he will 
implement the new guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the policy of this office not to disclose our guidelines for prosecution 
of criminal copyright violations, whether involving videocassettes, sound 
recordings or any other area," said Bonner, adding that disclosing them would 
inform criminals how to avoid prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he didn't hesitate putting piracy into perspective: "This federal 
district no doubt has more video piracy than any other in the nation, but we 
also have more . . .drug trafficking, more. . .drug money laundering, more 
defense procurement fraud, more fraud on . . savings and loans, all of which 
are priority areas for federal prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, video distributors of all stripes must fend for themselves by 
financing their own war against the piraters. 
</P>
<P>
The MPAA has done well by this game, netting more than 65,000 illicit tapes 
worth $3.3 million last year after raiding piraters in Guam, Puerto Rico and 
other mainland cities. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the MPAA reached an agreement that will permit it to carry 
out anti-piracy raids on behalf of 10 independent home video manufacturers, 
including the U.S. representative of Hong Kong's Golden Harvest Group and 
Spanish-language operators such as Condor Video. 
</P>
<P>
But recent attempts by some video distributors to form their version of the 
MPAA's anti-pirating unit have had less than stunning results even when legally 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, shop owners plying Mandarin-language videos staged a short-lived 
boycott against International Audio Visual Communications Inc., distributor for 
Taiwan's TV networks. Paul Chang, owner of Video Land in Monterey Park, claimed 
the boycott was caused by the exorbitant cost of leasing International Audio 
Visual's tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Yung Chiang Kin, International Audio's president, suspects that raids and civil 
prosecution of several video shop owners prior to the boycott was the real 
reason for the backlash. 
</P>
<P>
"They (U.S. marshals) caught a lot of shops" with our tapes, Chiang Kin said. 
"The court issued a restraining order," he said, which put some shops out of 
business. "So they formed a video association against me," he said, pressuring 
International Audio to lower its leasing fees by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
HKTV spends about $400,000 a year for its enforcement program, recouping half 
of its expenses from cash settlements extracted from piraters, a company 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the price of popularity. Jung said HKTV's videos are among the most 
sought after by piraters -- many of whom are recent immigrants hungry for 
HKTV's best dubbed or subtitled in Vietnamese, Cambodian, Japanese or Mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
But even she acknowledged that filing too many lawsuits against clients can be 
counterproductive. She instead stressed the need to educate shop owners about 
U.S. copyright laws. For the criminally recalcitrant, however, civil 
prosecution is the only antidote. 
</P>
<P>
"HKTV invests a great amount in licensing rights," said Kirsch, HKTV's 
attorney. "But the value of those rights can only be maintained by policing. 
Since the FBI will not make this an enforcement priority, it falls on the 
company to protect its rights under the law."

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: THE MEANING OF LIFE ; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICIANS, SCIENTISTS, EVEN KIDS IN BOXCARS HAVE A SPECIAL VIEW OF THE 
UNIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HERE HAS been much speculation on the meaning of life. Why are we here? Mostly 
the answers are those of theologians, philosophers, physicists and others who 
are thought to have some special pipeline to the eternal mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
But all of us wonder why we are here. It is a question that occurs to little 
boys and girls playing with their toys; to college students; to plumbers, 
teachers, U.S. senators, nurses, soldiers, the homeless, ship captains and 
chief executive officers. 
</P>
<P>
Their answers are rarely found in Bartlett's or any other compilation of 
quotations; yet the wisest men admit that the answer is beyond philosophy and 
science. So we might as well listen to Yogi Berra's answer as Emerson's or 
Einstein's. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent issue, Life magazine asked a number of people, including sages, 
poets, scholars, athletes and tradesmen to answer the question. It published 
their answers under the title, "The Meaning of Life." 
</P>
<P>
The answers ranged from the poetic and profound to the profane and 
scatological. Some agreed with Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun that "with 
our finite minds we cannot presume to know if there is a Purpose." Former boxer 
Muhammad Ali said that "life on earth is only a preparation for the eternal 
home." Businessman Armand Hammer said that we are here "to do good." 
</P>
<P>
There was just as much truth, it seemed to me, in the more irreverent answer of 
a taxi driver, Jose Martinez, who said, "We're here to die; just to live and 
die. . . . Life is a big fake." Or a barber, Frank Domofrio, who said, "I've 
been asking why I'm here most of my life. If there's a purpose, I don't care 
anymore. I'm 74. I'm on my way out." Or comedian Jackie Mason, who said, " 
'What is the meaning of life?' is a stupid question. Life just exists . . . I 
see life as a dance. Does a dance have to have a meaning? You're dancing 
because you enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Writer Charles Bukowski's answer was anti-Establishment: "We are here to 
unlearn the teachings of the church, state and our educational system. We are 
here to drink beer. We are here to kill war." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the people quoted in Jon Winokur's book "Zen to Go" (New American 
Library) tease the question in the mysterious way of Zen. He catches former 
Gov. Jerry Brown saying, "Life just is. You have to flow with it. Give yourself 
to the moment. Let it happen." (No wonder columnist Mike Royko called him 
Moonbeam.) Writer Andre Gide says simply, "Life eludes logic," which is about 
all that Domofrio was saying. And philosopher Santayana says, "There is no cure 
for birth and death, save to enjoy the interval." 
</P>
<P>
The late Richard P. Feynman, the Caltech physicist and Nobel Prize winner, 
turned the question upon itself: 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder why. I wonder why. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder why I wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder why I wonder why 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder why I wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as we know, Feynman never found the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Winokur quotes the beatnik novelist Jack Kerouac as saying, "I don't know. I 
don't care. And it doesn't make any difference." 
</P>
<P>
In a similar mood, author Edward Abbey is quoted as saying, "What is truth? I 
don't know, and I'm sorry I brought it up." 
</P>
<P>
And writer H. L. Mencken, with his usual blunt cynicism, said, "We are here, 
and it is now. Further than that, all human knowledge is moonshine." 
</P>
<P>
Two sage observations on the danger of thought come from Yogi Berra, that uncut 
diamond of the baseball park, and O. J. Simpson, the great running back. Berra: 
"How can you think and hit at the same time?" And Simpson: "Thinking . . . is 
what gets you caught from behind." 
</P>
<P>
The plain-spoken writer Gertrude Stein is given a special place at the front of 
the book: "There ain't no answer. There ain't going to be any answer. There 
never has been an answer. That's the answer." 
</P>
<P>
But we keep searching. I remember grappling with the question one night when I 
was 18 as I lay on a boxcar near Riverside, looking at the stars. The closest I 
came then, and ever since, is that the purpose of life is to keep on living and 
see what happens next. 
</P>
<P>
And we should be good to others and do what we can to end war.

LIFE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why does Los Angeles persist in self-flagellation? The single item that 
decreases my quality of life in L.A. is the whining of those who don't 
appreciate how fortunate they are. Those who moved here years ago from points 
east are the worst offenders. These non-travelers have the impression that 
everything "back there" has remained as they left it. 
</P>
<P>
Most people (especially those you interviewed) are unaware that the logarithmic 
increase in world population has, and will increasingly have, a degenerative 
effect on the quality of all our lives. L.A. is fortunate that it has suffered 
the least from this.

Regarding the cover for "The Quality of L.A. Life": I know the spot well where 
Al Seib took his magnificent picture. It used to be, "On a good day you can see 
Catalina." Today it's, "On a good day you can just barely make out the top of 
City Hall!" Sad isn't the word for it.

<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for "Special Report: The Quality of L.A. Life," by Kevin Roderick and 
Stephen Braun (April 2). It's time Angelenos stopped patting themselves on the 
back for all of the city's recent "progress" and acknowledged what a truly 
miserable place this is to live. You did, however, omit the single most 
annoying factor in L.A. life: The attitude, apparently shared by most Los 
Angeles residents, that "My time is more important than yours." Witness drivers 
cutting each other off on the freeway; people cutting in line at restaurants, 
grocery stores and movie theaters; drivers endangering the lives of pedestrians 
by speeding through yellow and red traffic lights -- and my personal favorite, 
the car horn. Los Angeles drivers have a belief bordering on the mystic that 
honking their horns will make everything better. 
</P>
<P>
After enduring L.A.'s constant assault on my senses for three years, I am 
returning to San Diego. My message to L.A. residents who have also considered 
this move, however, is: "Don't do it. Stay here."

THE AGONY OF DANCING; 
</P>
<P>
RIGOROUS SCHEDULE DEMANDS MEAN PAIN AND INJURIES ARE A WAY OF LIFE, BUT THE 
SHOW MUST AND OFTEN DOES GO ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GIGI BERARDI, Berardi is co-editor of Kinesiology and Medicine for Dance, 
dance critic of the L.A. Reader and teaches at Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The injury to Joffrey Ballet dancer Glenn Edgerton during a performance of 
"Petrushka," Tuesday in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, reminds us that dance is 
a high-risk profession, with pain a constant condition of the art. 
</P>
<P>
Despite fatigue and injury, professional dancers follow a relentless schedule 
of daily class, rehearsal and performance. The audience expects to see dancing 
that looks effortless. No matter what, the audience mustn't know that dancers 
dance in pain. But they do. 
</P>
<P>
David Howard, international ballet master and coach, recalls working on Mikhail 
Baryshnikov's foot for 45 minutes before a performance of "Coppelia." Despite 
advice to the contrary, Baryshnikov insisted on taping the swollen and inflamed 
foot and going through with the performance. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the example of Robert Weiss, former principal dancer with New 
York City Ballet (NYCB), who snapped his Achilles tendon during a performance. 
He tried to dance through it -- until the pain became intolerable. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, at Royce Hall, UCLA, modern dancer Danny Shapiro executed barrel 
turns, his legs fully extended -- and yet virtually every joint in his lower 
body is inflamed. The show must go on. 
</P>
<P>
Dancers are injured all the time, but they don't stop. They can't. As ballet 
master and choreographer Oleg Briansky says, "in (my) time, people used to 
dance ignoring the symptoms of injuries. Dancers are (still) impatient to 
return to dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Although rarely injured, NYCB principal Patricia McBride would agree, "I've 
always tried to dance through an injury." And Don Redlich, artistic director 
and dancer of his own company, suggests that "almost all dancers do it one time 
or another -- dance with some kind of pain." 
</P>
<P>
When the pain is intense, some may even develop a dependency on medication. 
According to Howard, it is not unusual to see dancers taking potent 
anti-inflammatory drugs for extended periods of time. Howard claims that there 
are many dancers who "live on Advil, some of (them) take four or five tablets 
in one dose." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bert Mandelbaum, assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at UCLA, argues 
that the medication that dancers take are mostly non-steroid anti-inflammatory 
drugs. "It is difficult for dancers to compete and perform without them . . . 
dancers, like any other athlete, would do anything to keep performing." 
</P>
<P>
Allegra Kent, formerly of NYCB and currently with the Ballet of Los Angeles, 
feels that dancers are under pressure to return to work after they have been 
injured. She adds, "The company is depending on you; your career seems to 
depend on it. Your friends tell you you can do it . . . there are a lot of 
ruthless (professional dance) schools that pressure (dancers) in invisible ways 
. . . but what (the dancer) really has to do is listen to (his/her) body -- 
listen to the pain." 
</P>
<P>
The pressures to perform are intense. Dancers who are "sidelined" know that 
they will not be considered for any important roles. And yet Gelsey Kirkland 
(former principal dancer with NYCB and ABT) maintains in the Suzanne Gordon 
book "Off Balance," that someone from the company should tell the dancer "It's 
not wise for (them) to dance." 
</P>
<P>
Balletomanes long for the adagios danced by ballerinas where the dancers 
display their control in sustained, unfolding movements. Few realize that many 
adagio ballerinas have worn down their hip joint to the point where hip 
replacement surgery is needed (Suzanne Farrell is a case in point). 
</P>
<P>
These maladies are not unique to dance. Gymnasts suffer from compression of 
their lower spine. Baseball pitchers frequently suffer injury to their shoulder 
joint. But dance is different. Few sports can compare with dance in terms of 
the time and technical demands placed on the mind and body. 
</P>
<P>
"Dancers are ranked with the highest athletes in terms of their need to compete 
and perform regardless of injury and pain. The psychological and physiological 
demands placed on dancers are extreme," says Dr. Mandelbaum. Further, the 
dancer must seek optimal responses from the body, to meet aesthetic demands. 
</P>
<P>
According to podiatrist Dr. Richard Braver, who works extensively with ballet 
and modern dancers from professional companies, the standards in dance are very 
difficult. The dancers try and achieve the impossible. Day in and day out, they 
work on the impossible jump (bigger, higher, faster), 180-degree hip rotation 
(for classical ballet turnout), the perfect landing, dazzling turns. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries are caused by dancers forcing their bodies beyond their limitations to 
meet an external ideal, in class or in rehearsal. Sarah Elgart admits "that as 
a choreographer (one) takes many risks in the studio searching for the ideal 
movement or phrase . . . (one) lose(s) concern for what is healthy." The 
aesthetic and creative ideals demand a high price. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers sprain ligaments in their backs, rupture spinal discs, tear the 
cartilage on their shoulders, suffer from stress. They pull their groin 
muscles, strain their calves. They are especially fearful of muscle spasms -- 
related to stress and fatigue -- but they nevertheless try to dance through 
them. Danny Wilams Grossman, who described himself as "in trouble from the 
waist down," danced for Paul Taylor for 10 years without missing one 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Often, the dancers have little choice. There may be no understudies (as was the 
case with Twyla Tharp Dance). Or the artistic directors may be slow to 
sympathize with their injured dancers. 
</P>
<P>
One company director jokingly advised his company, "if you rip (the muscles), 
they grow back longer." A dancer from that same company believed that "it is 
really important not to focus on the injury . . . better to just dismiss it . . 
. the show must go on." Another ex-company member agreed, "(one) needs a 
particular mind set about injuries and (cannot be too) precious with the body." 
</P>
<P>
Many dancers are reluctant to talk about their injuries. According to Howard, 
there is a fear among the dancers that they will be labeled "accident prone." 
The dancers may lose their company's respect if they experience too many 
physical problems. 
</P>
<P>
Artistic directors believe that for some dancers the injuries are self-serving 
-- fulfilling a hidden agenda of sorts. Murray Louis states that "there are 
some dancers who, like soldiers, want to die on the field of battle and they 
will push themselves until their injuries incapacitate them . . . there is a 
perversity in human nature to seek glory (no matter how) desperately it might 
be achieved." 
</P>
<P>
For many dancers, injuries result because, Briansky says, "dancers work too 
much -- eight performances in a week. You don't allow horses to run eight times 
in one week. Injuries come from wear and tear (due to) the frequency of 
performing." 
</P>
<P>
At one time, NYCB principal Merrill Ashley was dancing 12 ballets each week. 
Eventually, she began to dance in fewer ballets. Other principal dancers 
(especially males at NYCB) are not in such comfortable positions, and for 
dancers in the corps who perform in most ballets every night, the injury rate 
is higher. Still, they continue to dance. 
</P>
<P>
The dance environment is also to blame for injuries -- hard floors with little 
resiliency, cold theatres. For some, technique is the culprit. So much of what 
dancers do in technique class is rooted in tradition, for example. Information 
on correct technique and developing what artistic director Bella Lewitzky calls 
"body intelligence" does not come easily to the young dancer. 
</P>
<P>
As Murray Louis says, "When kids come to dance . . . they're dumb because 
they're immature and part of the definition of maturity is survival." 
</P>
<P>
The young dancers have to prove themselves to themselves, to their family, to 
the dance world. Yet what they really have to do is use common sense. They 
must, according to Lewitzky, " . . . treat the body honorably . . . do not 
abuse it, train carefully (and) sensitize (themselves) to the body's messages." 
</P>
<P>
But Lewitzky is quick to add, "the nature of the work is that you push . . . 
you don't stop and say 'is it safe?' ?" As one former Broadway dancer says, 
"the body has to be battered around . . . you can't just float through dance." 
</P>
<P>
The audience demands virtuosity. If virtuosity is indeed a metaphor for human 
courage, as veteran dancer Daniel Nagrin suggests, then most professional 
dancers aspire to nothing less. 
</P>
<P>
The dancer's desire to dance is strong. As long as the pain can be controlled 
and some sort of "euphoric feeling" (in the words of one artistic director) can 
be maintained, everything will be beautiful at the ballet, despite those tired 
tendons, pulled muscles and exhausting performance schedules.

ON THE RECORD: BARTOK IN ABUNDANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As this columnist frequently has occasion to lament, the quantity of recordings 
of a composer's music does not necessarily reflect or translate into frequency 
of live performance. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Bartok, all of whose major works have multiple listings in the 
current Schwann CD catalogue while in concert he is regularly represented only 
by his readily accessible, Romantically tinged Concerto for Orchestra and, for 
a very different audience, his less compromising string quartets. Even the once 
very popular Second Violin Concerto seems to have been replaced as the 
20th-Century vehicle of choice by the Berg and Prokofiev concertos. 
</P>
<P>
But any orchestra with a presumption to international stature has to record the 
Concerto for Orchestra, with two relatively recent additions to the roster of 
world-class ensembles now attempting it for the first time: the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, under Andre Previn (Telarc 80174), and the Montreal Symphony, 
under Charles Dutoit (London 421 443). 
</P>
<P>
Previn's conception is inappropriately benign, the sort of laid-back 
performance of volatile music with which Previn came to critical grief during 
his recently concluded tenure as music director here. Dutoit is, almost as 
predictably, taut, quick-witted and flashy. 
</P>
<P>
Previn couples his Bartok with a bloodless, disinterested run through of 
Janacek's wonderfully ferocious and grandiose Sinfonietta. But rather than 
excoriating the conductor, should one perhaps lament his being saddled with 
music to which he is temperamentally unsuited? 
</P>
<P>
No such problem for Dutoit, who gives us a becomingly high-voltage rendition of 
Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta. 
</P>
<P>
The Second Violin Concerto has long been a speciality of Yehudi Menuhin, but in 
only one of his three commercial recordings are tone and technique sufficiently 
under control to allow the musicianship to shine through: his first, dating 
from 1953 -- a soaring, lush-toned (once past some early scraping) piece of 
violin magic. And there are rewards as well in the partnering of the 
Philharmonia Orchestra under Wilhelm Furtwangler, who abjures his normal 
deep-think to provide vital, crisply rhythmical support for the soloist. 
</P>
<P>
The recording is, interestingly, available in different couplings on different 
labels: As one of Angel's mid-priced Great Recordings of the Century (69804) it 
is accompanied by Bartok's last completed work, the Sonata for Solo Violin. 
Menuhin -- to whom it is dedicated -- while hardly romanticizing a very 
tough-minded score, does deliver it with more coloristic variety than 
subsequent interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
On the even less-expensive Price-Less label (15100) the Violin Concerto is 
coupled with the scintillating Third Piano Concerto in a reading of delectable 
vivacity by the Hungarian pianist Annie Fischer, ably supported by the London 
Symphony under Igor Markevitch. 
</P>
<P>
Bartok left only the most rudimentary sketches for the Viola Concerto at his 
death in 1945. As interpreted -- or, more likely, largely composed (in the 
Bartok idiom) -- by his pupil, Tibor Serly, it ultimately provided an 
attractive, grateful vehicle for the revered William Primrose. 
</P>
<P>
Primrose's poignant if roughly recorded first performance of the concerto in 
France in 1950 has been made available as part of an invaluable Bartok program 
in which an under-appreciated master among conductors of 20th-Century music, 
Ernest Bour, conducts the Orchestre National (Mode Laser CD 672 006). 
</P>
<P>
Bour and his Parisians also offer -- from handsomely recorded 1969 broadcasts 
-- the "Miraculous Mandarin" Suite, vastly spookier and more exciting under 
these live circumstances than in any studio-made version; and a pulverizing 
assault on the Second Piano Concerto by soloist Claude Helffer, who will have 
no truck with any of this effete Bartok-needn't-be-percussive nonsense. 
Terrific stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The inexhaustible riches of the six string quartets can be sampled in two 
recent CD issues. The Emerson Quartet presents fast-paced, hard-driven, 
quintessentially modern performances (Deutsche Grammophon 423 657, two CDs) 
that revive memories of the Juilliard Quartet's first (circa 1950) recordings. 
</P>
<P>
Coming from a totally different interpretive direction, the New Hungarian 
Quartet, which flourished briefly a decade ago, presents warm-toned, probing 
interpretations on three budget CDs (Pantheon 19149) reflecting the four 
decades of stylistic growth and change that separate the first from the last of 
these works. 
</P>
<P>
As technicians, however, the New Hungarians are hardly in the same league as 
the brilliant Emersons.

MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: 4 WORLD PREMIERES ON S.F. BALLET SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four world premieres, a new, full-length "Sleeping Beauty," and the U.S. 
premiere of a work by the late Kirov choreographer, Leonid Jakobson, are 
highlights of the 1990 spring season of San Francisco Ballet, recently 
announced by Helgi Tomasson, artistic director of the Bay City troupe. This 
57th consecutive subscription season by the company opens Jan. 27 and ends May 
6; performances are again scheduled in War Memorial Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
Tomasson's new "Sleeping Beauty" production, to be designed by Jens-Jacob 
Worsaae, who collaborated with Tomasson on the company's 1987 "Swan Lake," will 
be unveiled March 13. Brand-new works in the season will be choreographed by 
Lisa de Ribere, Brenda Way, David Bintley and Val Caniparoli, the ballet's 
resident dance maker. Jakobson's "Rodin," being seen in this country for the 
first time, will be danced at performances beginning April 11. 
</P>
<P>
Also listed on the eight repertory programs: Balanchine's "Serenade," 
Tomasson's "Menuetto" and "Variations de Ballet," the collaboration (1960) of 
Balanchine and Lew Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
Announced at the same time is San Francisco Ballet's first engagement at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, Oct. 17-22, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Joffrey's '89-'90 season is due to be announced Monday. Stay 
tuned. 
</P>
<P>
BRUHN PRIZE: Announced just five days before the final competition, the 
decision of American Ballet Theatre not to send dancers to the just-concluded 
International Competition for the Erik Bruhn Prize in Toronto, seemed to 
discombobulate the annual contest, which draws its talent from only four 
companies: ABT, National Ballet of Canada, Royal Ballet, and Royal Danish 
Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, with only six (instead of eight) finalists in contention, the 
judges chose Silja Wendrup-Schandorff of the Royal Danish Ballet and Stephen 
Legate of the National Ballet of Canada for the top prizes: $6,000 to each 
dancer, plus a statuette. 
</P>
<P>
Wendrup-Schandorff, 20, performed the pas de deux from Balanchine's "Agon" and 
a new work, "Hommage a Bournonville," with Henning Albrechtsen of the Royal 
Danish Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Legate danced the pas de deux from Marius Petipa's "Le Corsaire" and the second 
movement of Glen Tetley's "Sphinx" with Jennifer Fournier, another National 
Ballet dancer. 
</P>
<P>
The other competitors were Belinda Hatley and Sergiu Pobereznic of Britain's 
Royal Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
The week before the competition, Mikhail Baryshnikov, artistic director of ABT, 
sent word that "there are no suitable candidates in the designated age category 
(18-23) that are currently available to compete." Robert Pontarelli, speaking 
for ABT last week, told The Times he felt that statement needed no elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
About ABT's nonparticipation in the 1989 competition, Celia Franca, founder of 
National Ballet of Canada, which hosts the contest, said: "We sincerely hope 
they will join us in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The late Erik Bruhn left funds to establish the prize in a codicil to his will. 
He specified the competitors be a male and female dancer between the ages of 18 
and 23 and come from four companies with which he was closely associated -- the 
National Ballet of Canada, the Royal Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet and American 
Ballet Theatre. Bruhn was artistic director of National Ballet of Canada for 
the three years before his death in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
COMPOSERS: Ed Applebaum, since 1971 on the faculty of UC Santa Barbara, will 
this summer move to Florida Strate University in Tallahassee , where he will 
serve as professor of composition and director of the New Music Ensemble. . . . 
Jeffrey Rockwell will write the music, J. Sherwood Montgomery the libretto, for 
"Rip van Winkle," an opera for children commissioned by San Diego Opera on the 
occasion of its 25th anniversary. The world premiere of "Rip van Winkle" is 
scheduled in October . . . A roster of 15 composers will meet in the mountains 
of Colorado, Aug. 18-20 for Composer-to-Composer, a three-day gathering "for 
discussions, demonstrations and performances of new work and work-in-progress." 
The composers are Ricardo dal Farra, Jin Hi Kim, Louis Andriessen, Joan La 
Barbara, John Cage, Anthony Davis, Tom Johnson, Tania Leon, Annea Lockwood, 
Steve Reich, Morton Subotnick, Trimpin, Walter Zimmerman, Julio Estrada and 
Conlon Nancarrow. 
</P>
<P>
AND OTHER PEOPLE: Kate Tamarkin has been appointed associate conductor of the 
Dallas Symphony. A 1978 graduate of Chapman College in Orange, Tamarkin also 
holds degrees from universities in Illinois and Maryland. . . . Frank Augustyn, 
longtime principal dancer of National Ballet of Canada, will become artistic 
director of the nine-year-old Theatre Ballet of Canada, the small (budget under 
$1 million), Ottawa-based company which gives 55 performances annually, on July 
1. . . . Richard Bradshaw, formerly resident conduct at San Francisco Opera 
(1977-87), has been appointed chief conductor of Canadian Opera in Toronto. . . 
. Violinist Andres Cardenes, who has been active as a free-lance concertmaster 
on the West Coast, and has served on university faculties in Indiana and Utah, 
will become permanent concertmaster of the Pittsburgh Symphony beginning in 
August. Cardenes, a native of Cuba trained in this country, has been guest 
concertmaster of the Pittsburgh orchestra in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
CORRECTION: Contrary to information published in this space last Sunday, the 
two operas to be performed by the touring Alexander Spendarian State Opera of 
Armenia at the Wiltern Theatre five times this week will not be receiving U.S. 
premieres. Armen Tigranian's "Anoush" has previously been produced in Southern 
California, as well as around the nation. About Dikran Tchoukhadjian's "Arshak 
II," records are inconclusive -- but chances are it has been performed on the 
West Coast. What is incontrovertible is that the troupe's recent productions of 
these works are new to our eyes. More information: (213) 465-6168.

RIDING THE SOUND WAVES AT OTTER CREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
OTTER CREST, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"You simply have to go to the Otter Crest party. The music is different, and 
the setting is idyllic." 
</P>
<P>
When one has heard endorsements along these lines from jazzman after jazzman, 
it eventually becomes embarrassing not to act on their recommendation. As it 
turned out, the Otter Crest Jazz Weekend was everything that had been promised. 
</P>
<P>
The Inn at Otter Crest, a resort hotel six miles north of Newport and 50 miles 
northwest of Eugene, is a rambling collection of timbered buildings clinging to 
the hilly shoreline, surrounded on three sides by hundreds of pine and fir 
trees, on the fourth by the Pacific Ocean. The beauty and serenity of the 
setting established a mood that clearly inspired the musicians at the festival, 
held last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The various jazz parties that have proliferated since the 1960s tend to become 
an almost closed shop, with most of the same performers playing musical chairs 
at Denver, Santa Fe, San Diego, Scottsdale and the rest. Some of them are here 
too, but counterbalancing this is a healthy contingent of unfamiliar faces, 
among them six Canadians and a Japanese, along with several artists from the 
Oregon and Washington State areas who confound the illusion that the term "West 
Coast Jazz" is limited to California. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to mix it up a little," said Jim Brown, the 62-year-old real estate 
dealer who with his wife Mary launched the party in 1978. "The first year we 
had only 12 players and 60 customers; now we have 30 musicians, and we keep a 
ceiling of 300 patrons to maintain some intimacy. We're sold out every year." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Berry, the Los Angeles cornetist who has been Brown's musical director for 
the past decade, gives the hired hands total freedom to play with whomever they 
choose. Certain sets are special: all five bass players playing a special 
arrangement, or all five tenor sax stars in a collective jam. Saturday evening 
all six Canadians worked as a unit: the velvet-toned Fraser McPherson on tenor 
sax, Rob McConnell on valve trombone, the amazing pianist Oliver Jones, 
guitarist Ed Bickert, Terry Clarke on drums, and Don Thompson on bass. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson may well be the most versatile major talent in jazz today. Still based 
in Canada, he has toured extensively (five years with George Shearing), but the 
full range of his gifts is hard to absorb. During a single hour he started with 
three impeccable numbers on vibes, switched to piano for a duo piece with 
Bickert, played some of the most phenomenal bass solos ever heard, then showed 
his talent as a drummer before returning to vibes to close out the set. 
</P>
<P>
Who in the U.S. has heard of Oliver Jones? He has been in this country briefly 
a few times, but is better known all over Europe and, of course, in Canada. 
Like Oscar Peterson, he studied with Peterson's sister, Daisy Sweeney, but at 
Otter Crest he revealed an incredible amalgam of Peterson, Tatum and Garner. 
</P>
<P>
All the pianists here, in fact, were astonishing on their own levels: Ross 
Tompkins of "Tonight Show" fame; Roger Kellaway, the ultimate in wildly 
swinging eclecticism; and Gene Harris, best known as a hard-driving blues 
master, though one of the gentlest moments of the weekend was his slow, 
sensitive reading of "The Way We Were." 
</P>
<P>
Like the Canadians and so many others, Harris is building his fame without 
needing or receiving much help from the U.S. Starting in September he will take 
his own big band on a three-month worldwide tour, subsidized by Philip Morris 
and helped by the State Department. He has many dates in Japan, as well as 
Moscow, all of Western Europe, Africa, Taiwan, Australia, Egypt, Seoul, and on 
and on. America? Ah, yes. There will be exactly one public concert in America. 
</P>
<P>
Otter Crest offered us West Coasters a first glimpse of Ken Peplowski, who at 
31 plays super-Goodman clarinet and doubles on Ben Webster vintage tenor sax; 
and Jay Leonhart, who revealed a rare flair for comedy with his own 
compositions. Singing and playing the bass, he sang "It's Impossible to Sing 
and Play the Bass." Among his other antic-manic works were a hymn of hate to 
Robert Frost inspired by his jealousy of the poet; a paean to pork; a paranoid 
poem called "They're Coming to Get Me." Leonhart is the wittiest 
jazzman-composer since Dave Frishberg (who was here on the final night to film 
a segment for the CBS "Sunday Morning" show). 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to go far from Otter Crest to find appealing new sounds. Rob 
Thomas might be a world-class name if he were not based in Portland. Thomas 
played a five-string electric violin (the extra string is a low C, enabling him 
at times to resemble a viola); he doubled expertly on bass. Then there's Jan 
Stentz, the singer from Tacoma, who traded scat phrases with Jeff Clayton's 
alto sax, sang her own lyrics to Clare Fischer's "Pensativa" and Ruth Price's 
words to the Al Cohn tune "High on You." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Otter Crest was quite a hike for Satoru Oda, who brought his 
tenor sax from Tokyo, and for Jiggs Whigham, the Cleveland-born trombonist who 
for 23 years has lived in Cologne, where he teaches jazz at the conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
The age span here was unusual; the audience, though mainly up in years, 
included a number of children. A touching moment was the appearance of Milt 
Hinton, the distinguished veteran bassist, with Jay Leonhart's 15-year-old son, 
the trumpeter Mike Leonhart, and a 16-year-old saxophonist, Marc Fendel. "Fifty 
years from now," Hinton said, "I want them to be able to say that they played 
with me." Fifty years from now (scientific developments permitting) Milt Hinton 
will be 129. 
</P>
<P>
Because most of the musicians are fast readers who require little rehearsal, 
the final evening at Otter Crest found most of the cast assembled onstage for a 
series of big band charts, written or conducted by John Clayton, Rob McConnell 
and Bill Berry. The shifting personnel included Spike Robinson, who worked for 
30 years as an engineer, gave it up to play tenor sax full time, and is now in 
demand for several European tours a year. At 59, he's suddenly famous, at least 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The company formed by Jim and Mary Brown to present their concerts is known as 
Sound Ideas. The name could hardly be more apt. Anyone tired of the hullabaloo 
of jazz festivals in gigantic auditoriums, of saxophonists trying to outsqueak 
one another and of synthesizers, one more synthetic than the last, could do 
worse than dip his soul into the ethos represented by these uncommercialized, 
altruistically organized affairs.

Wow, Kingdom Come's second album almost doesn't sound like Led Zeppelin! If the 
band starts to Zep out, singer Lenny Wolf tones down the Robert Plant stylings. 
If Wolf gets a little Plant-ish, then the music pulls back on the Zep vibe. In 
places, the group even sounds more like AC/DC! Seriously, though, this record 
does take a step up from the quintet's debut, which sold a ton but brought the 
band ridicule for being a total Zep clone. On a couple of songs here -- 
"Perfect 'O' " and the hypnotic "Gotta Go" -- Kingdom Come shows that it's 
starting to learn how to blend its own heavy-handed personality with its 
influences. JANISS GARZA

This second effort from the besuited British quintet best-known for the 
roiling, boiling single "Birth, School, Work, Death" (1988) is as bedrock-solid 
as it is ultimately unspectacular. Not a bum track in the bunch, but aside from 
"Walking, Talking Johnny Cash Blues" -- a definite cult classick -- and the 
current single "She Gives Me Love" -- which pretty much packs everything these 
wise guys know into one lashing, slashing hunk of pop aggression -- there's 
naught that memorable either. Still, fans of dour vocals, sour romance, kinda 
Kinks-y, semi-Stonesy, sixtieszoid riffslinging -- (some HAIR-raising guitar 
outros here) can lay their ample heads on this weary bosom and find that the 
heart of rock 'n' roll is still making an offer you can't refuse. DON WALLER

New Orleans' second-favorite (to the Neville Brothers) sons attempt to spice up 
the commercial ingredient in their white-soul/bar-band/blues gumbo, with 
less-than-finger-lickin' results most of the time. Instead of moving toward the 
elegant, contemporary blues of a Robert Cray or the fiery blues-rock of a Mason 
Ruffner, the Radiators land facelessly smack dab in the middle of mainstream 
rock. On the title tune the band locks into an infectious, rolling rhythm 
worthy of a Crescent City street parade, and they turn in a solid version of 
J.J. Jackson's 1966 hit "But It's Alright." The rest of the time the Radiators 
sound more like a band you'd find in a Red Onion than Tipitina's. They'll be at 
the Coach House on Wednesday, the Palace on Friday and the Ventura Theatre on 
Saturday. RANDY LEWIS

INTRODUCING: HUSKY 'NU-FOLK' TONES OF INDIGO GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artist: Indigo Girls. 
</P>
<P>
History: Back in Atlanta, Amy Ray and Emily Saliers first sang as a duo at a 
high school PTA show, harmonizing on the sensitive hits of James Taylor and 
Elton John. Moving on to the English-lit-fed climes of Emory University, the 
two began to take their own "nu-folk" writing more seriously. Their 
post-dropout debut album doesn't include Taylor or John, but does boast some of 
the Hothouse Flowers, and all of R.E.M., those fellow Georgians who invited the 
Girls to open most of their latest arena tour. College radio play has gotten 
the record off to a fast sales start; just wait until the Tracy Chapman crowd 
discovers it. 
</P>
<P>
Sound: The two voices here are distinguishable only to a careful ear. Ray and 
Saliers both have lovely altos, warm and husky, that can glide up to the higher 
notes or swoop around each other as they sing verses and choruses in the round. 
Both write solid, melodically rich, acoustic-based material; if they both also 
have a tendency to overextend themselves lyrically, write it off to youth. 
Saliers (whose father is a theology professor) tends to pen the headier 
material, full of religious imagery, while Ray comes up with earnest, tortured 
love songs. "Closer to Fine," the single, is pretty close to fine itself with 
its distinctly '60s, Dylan-meets-the-Everlys hooks. 
</P>
<P>
When: Monday and Tuesday at the Roxy, Wednesday at the Bacchanal, Thursday at 
Bogart's. CHRIS WILLMAN

THE BEST KEPT WINE SECRET IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the outside, Les Freres Taix on Sunset doesn't appear to be the kind of 
restaurant that would have one of the great wine lists in America. Maybe that's 
what makes it such an incredible place: It's still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not exactly unknown. Any night of the week the valets can be seen 
scampering to handle the traffic. It's just that a place that has about 200 
seats for dinner and serves twice that number of dinners on weekend nights 
should be selling more than $250,000 worth of wine a year. 
</P>
<P>
It's not. It is, however, doing more than twice the wine business it did in 
1984, the year before Mike Taix took over the wine program from his father and 
turned it from something that was merely interesting to something that was 
exciting and dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until about a year ago -- when Taix began printing a multi-page 
computerized menu listing virtually every drinkable wine owned by the 
restaurant -- that the real intent of this program took shape. (Previously, 
only 30 or 40 of the restaurant's wines were printed on a menu and it was 
rarely updated.) It may be another year before Mike gets his true pay-back: 
national recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few of the things this wine program offers: 
</P>
<P>
Good wine-by-the-glass selections that change often. 
</P>
<P>
450 selections all priced so low you think they're a misprint. 
</P>
<P>
Many wines for sale to take home by the case -- at prices competitive with the 
deepest-discount shops in town. 
</P>
<P>
Some examples: There are 25 white Burgundies priced at less than $30 a bottle, 
including 13 from the famed 1985 vintage; 37 California Chardonnays priced at 
$20 or less (including 1987 Silverado at $16.75, 1985 Vichon at $18.75 and 1985 
Simi at $17.75); 80 Bordeaux including 1976 and 1978 Chateau Montrose at $30 
and 1974 Lynch Bages at $27; and a string of California Cabernets, many from 
older vintages. 
</P>
<P>
You won't find any vertical selection of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild here, 
however, because Mike buys with his palate, not his ego. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a close-out buyer," he said. "I buy good wines in small quantities until I 
find that 'deal' that other people can't see because the name is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Such a wine is the 1981 Chante-Alouette, white Hermitage from Chapoutier, a 
wine you can buy for $9.75 a bottle here, or $3 a glass. The wine is a good 
example of an older white Hermitage. It would sell for about $13 a bottle at 
retail. Mike bought dozens of cases of it after the wholesaler went out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
He made the same kind of deal on a 1979 Haut Cote de Beaune red wine, which you 
can buy for $8.75 a bottle with your dinner. Or you can take a case home for 
$54 -- $4.50 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition of selling wine both on-sale (with dinner) and off-sale (for 
take-out) is an old one at Taix, going back to Marius Taix's pharmacy, 
Brunswick Drugs, on Commercial Street in downtown L.A. in the 1930s where 
medicinal wines were sold. 
</P>
<P>
Later, his son, Raymond Taix, handled an extensive wine list at the old 
family-style Taix Restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. When office development 
forced a move to the present location on Sunset, Raymond opened a wine shop at 
the entrance of the new restaurant. He closed it a decade ago to add seating 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Mike, 30, said he was raised the same way his father been raised: with wine on 
the dinner table. At age 16, Mike already knew what he liked. In 1985, after 
taking a course in wine appreciation from the late Dr. Ralph Hutchinson, Mike 
asked his father if he could handle the wine program. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Raymond gave his OK, Mike stumbled upon a treasure trove of White 
Burgundies and Bordeaux from the 1920s hidden in the wine cellar. 
</P>
<P>
The wines had been perfectly stored, and were in fine condition, but the 
clientele that then dined at Taix wasn't knowledgeable enough to know they were 
worth hundreds of dollars per bottle. 
</P>
<P>
So Mike shipped them off to an East Coast wine auction house, took the profits 
he earned from their sale and began to stock the cellar. Fancy names or 
gold-sprayed labels meant nothing. Taste was everything. 
</P>
<P>
And instead of re-opening the shop, Mike simply put the case prices of wines 
available to take home right on the wine list. 
</P>
<P>
Example: 1981 Chateau Clos L'Eglise, $22 with dinner, $165 by the case ($13.33 
a bottle). 
</P>
<P>
Case prices for older wines here are often a bargain: a 1976 Burgundy at $19 a 
bottle; a 1982 Bordeaux at $12; 1977 Louis Martini Monte Rosso Zinfandel, 
$6.50. (Alas, the latter wine was discovered recently by a gentleman who bought 
all five cases that were left.) 
</P>
<P>
There are some obvious weaknesses with this sort of buying program -- you 
sacrifice depth for price -- but there's no denying the validity of Taix's 
formula for pricing younger, commercially available wine: 
</P>
<P>
"I price everything at $5 a bottle above retail," Mike says. "That way, I can 
discourage people from bringing in their own wine." 
</P>
<P>
Of course you can bring in your own wine -- corkage is $5 -- but when you can 
get well-cellared wine for the same amount you'd pay retail plus corkage, who 
would want to? 
</P>

AFTER 100 YEARS, THOSE GAUDY, JUKEBOXES ARE COSTING NOSTALGIA BUFFS A PRINCELY 
SUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jukebox. The mere mention of the word stirs rose-colored images of '57 Chevys, 
bobby socks, thick French fries, pompadour haircuts and blue suede shoes. Think 
about it. Did Little Richard, squealing "Lucille," or Chuck Berry, asking why 
"Maybellene" just couldn't be true, ever sound better than when booming through 
an oversize jukebox speaker? No way. 
</P>
<P>
And now this gaudy, noisy, overmodulated symbol of 1950s American youth, 
marking its 100th anniversary this year, is in the midst of a cultural revival. 
The "Fonz" may be in reruns, but jukeboxes, with some reconditioned models 
fetching as much as $15,000 in the United States and nearly $40,000 in Japan, 
are still prime entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"They've become like paintings," said jukebox collector Mike Dorrough, 47, on 
why prices have skyrocketed. "They're now being bought by investors." Customers 
run the gamut from junkyard owners to movie producers such as Steven Spielberg 
and rock 'n' roll stars Mick Fleetwood and Tom Petty. Collectors estimate that 
about 1,000 people own jukeboxes on the Westside and in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, a couple of hundred dollars could buy a serviceable machine, 
Dorrough said, but now popular models such as the Wurlitzer 1015 are in the 
five-digit price range. Known as the Bubbler because of the flowing bubbles 
that went up both sides through eight colored tubes, the 1015 is most often 
seen as a background prop in the '80s TV sitcom "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a wave of nostalgia sweeping the country for about 20 years now," 
explained Russ Ofria, 42, an electro-mechanical engineer who has 25 jukeboxes 
in his Northridge home. The craze began with "people fixing up old cars, now 
it's things like jukeboxes." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
It was at a saloon in San Francisco on Nov. 23, 1889, that someone installed a 
coin slot in a Thomas Edison phonograph, creating the first jukebox. By the 
1930s and '40s, the two decades considered the pinnacle of the business, a 
dozen companies were producing them. It was that era, explained Don Muller of 
Granada Hills, that generated the styles most people remember today. 
</P>
<P>
Muller, who owns dozens of antique jukeboxes, is also the owner of Jukeboxes 
For Rent. For a minimum of $160 a day, he will bring to your Saturday night 
'50s party a 1955 Seeburg or 1975 Rockola, programmed with the records you 
request, install it and let everyone remember the days of poodle skirts and 
ponytails. Ninety-five percent of his business is rentals, Muller said, 
although he occasionally will sell a "plain Jane" machine that he thinks will 
never become a true collector's item. 
</P>
<P>
Muller originally set up business in West Los Angeles after moving here from 
Phoenix in the late 1970s. Two years later he moved the business to Granada 
Hills when he realized the majority of his customers lived in the Valley. 
Today, Valley clients make up about 75% of his business. 
</P>
<P>
He also owns an antique jukebox rebuilding business in Guadalajara, but almost 
all of those machines go straight to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"There is one model of an American machine still used in Mexico, a Continental, 
that there are thousands of," he said. "So we're telling wholesalers in Japan 
that this is the hot one, this is the next craze. We chrome them up, and 
they're jumping on them." 
</P>
<P>
"These have got to be the ugliest jukeboxes in the world," said Muller, who 
said they reminded him of an old-fashioned hair dryer. "I was so embarrassed 
with the only one I had here in 17 years of business I sold it out of my home. 
They're the goofiest looking things in the world, but in Japan they're the hot 
item." Muller said that when he sells them for about $8,000, there are so many 
middlemen that the eventual Japanese consumer will pay up to $40,000. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Danton Burroughs, 44, cashed in his entire U.S. airmail stamp collection 13 
years ago to buy his first jukebox, a Wurlitzer 950, from a man in Colorado he 
had heard about. "The owner wanted $4,000 for it, so I got the money together 
and wired it to him. A friend of mine picked up the machine and brought it 
back." Burroughs said it is now worth about $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
The proud owner of 12 jukeboxes, Burroughs, the grandson of Edgar Rice 
Burroughs and a director of the company that licenses the "Tarzan" name, said 
he has them in every room of his Tarzana home, some loaded with Dixieland and 
early jazz records, others with country and western, still others with a 
cappella. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of baby boomers are remembering all those tunes and the excitement of 
having something unique in your home," he said. "It's the versatility of the 
machine and the music that just thrills us to our marrow." 
</P>
<P>
"The sound that comes out of a jukebox is unique," explained Sam Epstein, 36, 
of West Los Angeles, who is a buyer for Rhino Records. When guests spy his 1958 
Seeburg 201 for the first time, Epstein said they all ask to play it. "They 
can't wait to get their hands on it. It's got its own magic sound." 
</P>
<P>

Push any combination of buttons on Rick Naatz's jukebox and it will always play 
an Elvis Presley tune. It doesn't matter what buttons are pushed; that's all 
Naatz will allow in the machine. "No other record would go in there for a 
million years," he said of the 1955 Seeburg Model J loaded with 50 records in 
his bedroom. Naatz used to have two jukeboxes, but an ex-girlfriend took the 
1964 Wurlitzer when they split up 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very soothing," said Naatz, 36, a Brentwood truck driver. "It's like an 
aquarium. Some people like to watch them. When I come home from work I'll put 
it on and it makes me feel good." But he has a familiar problem -- his 
girlfriend of two years. "She can't stand Elvis," he said. "I play it but she 
sometimes walks out." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dorrough, who manufactures broadcast equipment, has jukeboxes stashed all 
over his Woodland Hills home and a record collection he puts at 1 million 
discs. 
</P>
<P>
"The living room has a 1938 Seeburg Commander, a Wurlitzer Victory and a 
Wurlitzer Cabaret," he said proudly. "Our bedroom is down to just a 1940 
Wurlitzer 750, though, but there's a couple out on the porch, some more in the 
garage, and oh yes, Grandma's room has a 1938 Seeburg Crown. I just love them." 
</P>
<P>
Jukeboxes also have gained renewed popularity in the restaurant business, as a 
growing number of '50s eateries, such as Johnny Rockets and Ed Debevic's, 
request machines to fit into their themes. 
</P>
<P>
"Restaurants want something with a curved top, where they can see the records 
and it sounds good," explained Mike Pearlman, 40, owner of Jukeboxes 4 Fun in 
Santa Monica. The company supplies machines and records for about 40 '50s 
restaurants in Southern California and as far away as Chicago, Atlanta and 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"It represents the '50s time when there was no real pressure and everybody was 
pretty happy," he said. "I've seen guys come up and kick it and say, 'Hey, I'm 
Fonzie,' and not hurt it. Back in the '50s they made things pretty strong." 
</P>
<P>
Pearlman also has a couple of machines in his Woodland Hills home, and he 
prefers Seeburg for its durability. "They're the best," he said. And when he 
presses the buttons for his favorite record, it's "Flip, Flop and Fly" by Joe 
Turner that goes for a spin. 
</P>
<P>
While restored antiques such as Wurlitzer's 1015 Bubbler can cost well over 
$15,000, new machines are still being manufactured by Wurlitzer, Seeburg, NSM, 
AMI and Rockola. The last, Rockola, isn't a play on "rock 'n' roll," but was 
the manufacturer's real name, David C. Rockola. 
</P>
<P>
The Antique Amusement Company, a Sherman Oaks retail store specializing in 
jukeboxes, carries only Wurlitzers. "They're the best jukeboxes made and always 
have been," said manager Paul Reno, 19. Starting with the model SL600 at 
$2,695, the current line includes a new, unique compact disc jukebox holding up 
to 50 CDs. If you still have your heart on that 1946 model 1015 bubbler seen on 
"Cheers," however, Wurlitzer is marketing new ones for $4,995. Antique 
Amusements sells 400 new jukeboxes a year. 
</P>
<P>
For most collectors, however, it is the restored original that is dearest to 
their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought a 1960 Seeburg, one of the first stereo boxes," said Barry Hansen, 
47, of Sherman Oaks, also known as Dr. Demento on radio station KLSX. Saying it 
rekindled memories of when he was a child begging his mother for nickels to put 
in the jukebox, Hansen has stuffed his machine, not unexpectedly, with an 
eclectic mix ranging from the '50s to current sounds. Included are Weird Al 
Yankovic, Captain Beefheart, Roy Rogers singing "San Fernando Valley," "Liar, 
Liar" by the Castaways and "40 Miles of Bad Road" by Dwayne Eddy. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge jukebox collector Larry Ready, 49, is a little more traditional with 
his record selection, explaining that he changes the songs with the seasons 
from his collection of about 600 records. Junkyard owner Ready bought the first 
of his three machines -- two Seeburgs and a Rockola -- four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the resurgence in jukebox collecting, Don Muller feels that their 
future in restaurants and bars is limited. "It has been dying for the last 
eight or nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"When I grew up, every drugstore had a soda fountain and a jukebox. Every 
restaurant had one, too. Now they're only in truck stops, beer bars and '50s 
diners. And with the new ones taking compact discs, it's going to cost $600 
just to stock them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Muller will also tell you that he's in jukeboxes strictly as a business, and 
that it was never a hobby -- until someone asks if there's any machine he'd 
really love to own. "Oh sure," he said quickly, "I'd love an AMI Singing 
Tower," a rare machine he has been trying to get for years. 
</P>
<P>
"A jukebox seems to set the tone and relax people to a certain extent, 
sometimes becoming melancholy," reflected Ready. "You don't talk as much, and 
you find yourself reflecting back. You can look at a jukebox and think of the 
individuals who sat in a restaurant and listened to music. Jukeboxes seem to 
tell a story even when they're not on."

What bothers me most is that the decision, according to station general manager 
Bill Ward, was purely a "business decision." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that Ward has little interest in the music and is concerned only with 
providing profits for the station owners. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the financial concerns are important, but why not have somebody who cares 
about radio run the radio station and leave the bean-counting to accountants?

tried KEDG; it too was great, but then it became K-LITE and got too soft.

GUY WILLIAMS TRIBUTE

<TEXT>
<P>
Guy Williams, who died this month, was talented, handsome and charismatic -- 
the perfect Zorro, with a subtle touch of humor and fencing finesse. 
</P>
<P>
I first saw him as Zorro in 1957-59 when I was about 12. I rediscovered him 15 
months ago when I got the Disney Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Like the legend he portrayed, he will live on. In his films he will bring 
enjoyment to yet a new generation 30 years from now.

AN UNCHANGED HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is one fan who has not had a "change of heart" over the casting of Michael 
Keaton as Batman in the upcoming movie (Pat H. Broeske's "Man Behind the Mask," 
May 14). 
</P>
<P>
Keaton, as talented as he is, lacks the physical presence to make you believe 
he could intimidate criminals. Keaton isn't a wimp; he just doesn't project the 
toughness of a Sean Connery or Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicholson as the Joker, . . . well, maybe 15 years ago. The Joker is 
supposed to be very thin, something 'ole Jack hasn't been in a while. Also, 
let's face facts: Jack has been playing a caricature of himself for his last 
six or more films. (Think of James Woods or Willem Dafoe going all out with 
this character!)

John Lydon (a.k.a. Johnny Rotten) claims a common misconception about him is 
that he's nasty (Kristine McKenna's May 14 article, "The World According to . . 
. John Lydon"). 
</P>
<P>
Then he goes on to insult Sting, Peter Gabriel and Bruce Springsteen, calling 
them "compulsively greedy people" who hog the spotlight by participating in 
benefit concerts. It's easy to see why so many people have that "misconception" 
about Lydon.

LATINO STEREOTYPES

<TEXT>
<P>
About Scott Hays' May 14 article, "Jorge Rivero's Split-Level Career": Although 
this was the standard puff piece timed to coincide with a movie release, it was 
presented as one of an occasional series ("Pacific Rim Arts"); as such we would 
expect it to be culturally and ethnically sensitive. The article not only 
disappoints, it offends. 
</P>
<P>
What sense does it make to say that this hulking Mexican actor's movies are 
seldom shown in the United States and then go on to portray his U.S. audience 
in condescending terms? Surely Rivero knows that Latino audiences here provide 
his bread and butter and virtually keep the whole sadly decadent Mexican movie 
industry afloat. Rivero carelessly stereotypes these fans as dishwashers and 
trash truck drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The article and its quotes from Rivero and producer Carlos Vasallo make the 
inexcusable error of identifying American with Anglo, and Latino with foreign. 
Vasallo contributes to selective Latino invisibility with statements like 
"Americans just don't know how to pronounce Jorge." 
</P>
<P>
Mexican nationals have much more to gain from identifying and cooperating with 
U.S. Latinos than from engaging in destructive competition, stereotypes and 
self-serving distinctions.

DRUGS CITED AS CAUSE OF CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
PLEAS MADE FOR ADOPTIVE HOMES FOR BLACK CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody seemed to want her. Not even her mother, a cocaine addict who gave birth 
to the baby girl at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center and then left 
her there, struggling for life in the neonatal ward alongside a dozen other 
drug babies. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Xylina Bean, a pediatrics professor at the hospital, said she tried for 
weeks to find an "ideal" family that would consider taking in the infant, who 
spent her first days of life quivering from drug withdrawal. But after five 
months of caring for the baby, who never seemed to stop crying, Bean was losing 
hope. "I figured I was the next best thing." 
</P>
<P>
So Bean, a single black woman, decided to adopt her. 
</P>
<P>
Seven months after she brought her home, she said the little girl is doing 
fine. "Nothing's wrong with my baby," said Bean, smiling and adding, "Every 
child deserves a home." 
</P>
<P>
For years, there have been more black children in need of adoptive homes than 
there were homes to take them. But, according to child welfare authorities, the 
problem has grown in recent years into a nationwide crisis as a steadily 
increasing percentage of black children risk spending childhood in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, where blacks make up 12% of the population, more than 
half of the children recently waiting to be adopted were black. And the drug 
epidemic is making a bad problem worse. 
</P>
<P>
One reason that there are not enough black families to adopt, officials say, is 
that many in the black community do not realize the size of the problem, and 
those who do are frequently dissuaded by a tangled bureaucracy. So in what has 
become a nationwide effort, government agencies have joined with black churches 
and other community institutions to wage an intense campaign to recruit black 
adoptive parents. 
</P>
<P>
County and state agencies are using radio announcements and bus ads, celebrity 
spokespersons and campaign slogans, brochures and billboards to find black 
families. 
</P>
<P>
The need is so great that Los Angeles County has created a special unit that 
does nothing but recruit and ease the adoption process for prospective black 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
A private agency in the San Francisco Bay Area has shown pictures of adoptable 
black children between innings of a baseball game, and social workers at a 
South Los Angeles-based agency will travel as far as Palm Springs and the 
border at San Diego to find families. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis has also spawned renewed debate over whether black children should 
have to wait for black homes when there might be others willing to adopt them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Outstripping Capacity' 
</P>
<P>
"The number of black kids is just outstripping the current capacity of the 
black community to absorb them," said Jim Brown, chief of adoptions for the 
California Department of Social Services, which initiated a two-year 
promotional campaign to recruit minority foster and adoptive parents last 
November. "They may have to adopt at 10 times their current rate; we don't know 
how high it'll have to go." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it is being preached from the pulpit of a Baptist church, read on a 
billboard overlooking Crenshaw Boulevard or announced on a black radio station, 
the message, to quote the state slogan, is the same: "Bring our children home." 
</P>
<P>
Although the numbers of children waiting for adoptive homes nationwide is 
dropping, the proportion of minority children -- particularly blacks -- in need 
of placement is climbing. Black children, who made up about 25% of children 
waiting to be adopted in the late '70s, now constitute 40% of that population, 
according to federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
In California, where the numbers of black children needing homes has steadily 
risen since at least 1985, only 18% of the children adopted between July, 1987, 
and June, 1988, were black, although they comprised more than 30% of all 
children waiting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reason Is Drugs' 
</P>
<P>
"And the reason is drugs," said Carlos Sosa, assistant director of the county 
Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
Socioeconomic problems such as unemployment and poverty have always 
disproportionately affected minorities, making their children more susceptible 
to entering the child welfare system. But drugs, particularly cocaine, have 
become one of the most devastating factors in a cycle that sends children into 
foster care and keeps them there indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a phenomenon that disintegrates the family much quicker than anything 
we've seen in the past," said Sosa, who added that in the last three years the 
number of drug babies being referred to the county has jumped from between 30 
and 40 a month to about 200 -- most of them black. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs are particularly devastating for blacks, according to adoption officials, 
because they contribute to the destruction of the extended family network which 
has traditionally absorbed needy children. 
</P>
<P>
"The black extended family has always been there for us . . . but the drug 
culture causes holes in the safety net," said Zena F. Oglesby Jr., executive 
director of the Institute for Black Parenting, the first private, full service 
black adoption and foster care agency in Southern California. "That girl on 
drugs, her family would probably absorb her child, but that drug culture tears 
the fabric of the family. They might not even know where she is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adoption Percentage Higher 
</P>
<P>
Despite a perceived weakening of the black extended family, statistics suggest 
that blacks adopt in higher proportions than others. A nationwide survey 
conducted for the federal government in the early 1980s found that black 
families adopted children from public welfare agencies at 4 1/2 times the rate 
of whites and Latinos. However, the study added that the black community would 
have to more than double its effort to provide homes to all black children 
waiting to be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
It is not an impossible goal, said Oglesby, who added that many black families 
are interested in adoption but have been discouraged by the expense of private 
agencies and the jumble of public agencies that sometimes keep them waiting as 
long as five years for a child. 
</P>
<P>
To bring them forward, the state Department of Social Services has joined with 
county and private agencies in a minority home recruitment effort which 
includes a speaker's bureau, an adoption exchange program and a media campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say that $653,000 has been set aside in the state budget for minority 
home recruitment, funding that initially began in 1982 after a push by social 
service officials and Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles). Besides bus 
ads, billboards, and singer Marilyn McCoo and actor Rene Enriquez acting as 
spokespersons, the state instituted a toll-free hot line that in its first four 
months received nearly 2,000 calls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Campaign Elsewhere 
</P>
<P>
A similar campaign is being waged in New Jersey, where black children make up 
80% of those up for adoption. California took the effort a step further by 
providing funding for the creation of one Latino and two black adoption 
agencies, which in turn work with government agencies in finding families. 
</P>
<P>
The Black Adoption Placement and Research Center in Oakland opened last August, 
and the Institute for Black Parenting in Los Angeles opened two months later. 
It has placed 10 children and is working with more than 80 families. 
</P>
<P>
The reason that an adoption agency -- run by blacks and based in the black 
community -- is needed is apparent as soon as one walks up to the Institute for 
Black Parenting on Western Avenue. "No fees for service," reads the sign in the 
window, a marked difference from many private agencies which often charge 
thousands of dollars. "Convenient personalized services" and "culturally 
sensitive social workers," the agency promises. 
</P>
<P>
"Black families tend to trust organizations within their own communities. We 
trust the NAACP, the Urban League (and) our churches," explained Oglesby, who 
said that his staff will go to churches and military bases to find prospective 
black parents and then will process them quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Oglesby and others acknowledge that minorities are not the only ones who can 
work with minorities, but some prospective minority parents prefer it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Felt Like Interrogation 
</P>
<P>
The Russells, a professional young black couple in the Moreno Valley who 
recently adopted an 8-year-old boy and a 2-year-old girl, said they felt as 
though they were being interrogated rather than interviewed by a white county 
social worker who helped place their youngest child. 
</P>
<P>
The couple said the social worker seemed more interested in how they were able 
to afford their lavish home than the fact that they wanted to share it with a 
homeless child. To Janet Russell, 34, "It boils down to a black-white 
situation. They see black families who want kids, but unless you conform to 
their ideas and their criteria, they won't let them have a child." 
</P>
<P>
Said her husband, Kyle, who spent 11 years in foster care and now has a real 
estate business: "They're (social workers) basically looking for the Huxtable 
or the Donna Reed family. And you're not going to find that. That's not 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
Neither is it realistic to believe that a black home can be found for every 
black child, according to a number of people who believe in the merits of 
trans-racial adoption. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in our lifetime we will see every homeless black child find a 
black family. For many black children, just having a family is not a 
possibility," said Donna Salisbury, who belongs to the Open Door Society of Los 
Angeles which provides support for children and families involved in 
trans-racial adoption. "Trans-racial adoption beats the heck out of foster care 
for life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Law Cited 
</P>
<P>
State law requires case workers to try for at least six months to match a child 
with a family of the same ethnicity. But this guideline can be lengthened at a 
county's discretion, and some believe such regulations should either be done 
away with or be more strictly adhered to, so that children do not grow old in 
foster care waiting for a black family that might never come along. 
</P>
<P>
Samantha Davidge, a 24-year-old black woman adopted by a white couple when she 
was 1 year old, said that such a rule only hurts the child. "Look at the needs 
of the child and then look at who's available," she said. "Six months is a long 
time in a kid's life." 
</P>
<P>
But heads of black adoption agencies say that such options should not even be 
considered until government agencies make a thorough effort to recruit families 
within the black community. And there is no better place to begin, they say, 
than the black church. 
</P>
<P>
State, county and black adoption agency officials all have made a point to 
speak to black congregations. And black churches have initiated their own 
programs to recruit adoptive parents, such as the One Church, One Child program 
that began in Chicago and has now spread across the country, and the Room For 
One More referral program that began in 1978 at the Ward African Methodist 
Episcopal Church in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Care About Black Children' 
</P>
<P>
"I do this because I care about black children," said Billie Green, who heads 
the Ward AME program, which hosts gatherings where prospective parents can meet 
children who are up for adoption. "Without black children, there is no future 
for black people . . . I want to see some more Jesse Jacksons." And she said 
they're not going to develop in the foster care system. "Find them a good mommy 
and daddy, and that's where they'll come from." 
</P>
<P>
One recent morning, the Institute for Black Parenting held an Adoption Sunday 
at West Angeles Church of God in Christ on Crenshaw Boulevard, and actor 
Taurean Blacque stood before the congregation of more than 2,000 to share his 
experience as an adoptive parent. 
</P>
<P>
"We as Christians are taught to save souls," Blacque told the mostly black 
gathering. "How about saving children?" And the congregation said "Amen." 
</P>
<P>
Blacque, a spokesman for the institute, has heeded his own words. He has raised 
two of his own children, adopted four others and is in the process of adopting 
five more. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, he said, is responsibility. "They are our children," said Blacque, 
who then quoted from Proverbs: "Train up a child in the way he should go, and 
when he is old, he will not depart from it."

PHOENIX 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Other people saw only a scarred and trash-strewn hillside. Miner Frank Melluzzo 
recognized opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Under an antiquated century-old federal mining law, he staked a claim on 60 
acres of federally owned land overlooking Phoenix and eventually was allowed to 
buy it from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for $2.50 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
He was looking for building stone. Instead, he struck real estate gold. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, six years after acquiring the land, Melluzzo sold an interest in it to 
the developer of a planned condominium-golf course project called the Pointe 
Tapatio Cliffs. A $150 investment earned him $400,000 and an 11% share in the 
resulting $360-million resort. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm set for life," Melluzzo said, quickly adding that a city zoning plan 
forced him to sell the proper-ty. "The city grew up around me," he observed, 
"and the time came when you couldn't mine in the city of Phoenix." 
</P>
<P>
In a time of huge federal budget deficits, however, such cut-rate giveaways are 
focusing attention on the outdated and ineffective laws that govern public 
lands -- and the primary federal agency assigned to administer them, the Bureau 
of Land Management. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exposing the Land 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with dozens of conservationists, bureau employees and government 
auditors lead to a common conclusion: budget cuts, politicization and outdated 
laws have hobbled the BLM and exposed many millions of acres of public property 
to private profiteering, neglect and environmental degradation. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the massive size of BLM's assignment -- in one way or another, it 
manages about a quarter of the entire United States -- environmentalists are 
characterizing the bureau and its problems as a pre-eminent conservation issue 
of the 1990s and a crucial test of President Bush's commitment to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is some of the most valuable and vulnerable land in the country -- 572 
million acres in all, most of it in the West. Included are 272 million acres of 
desert, rangeland, forest and tundra, as well as the mineral rights to another 
300 million acres, mostly under national forests administered by the U.S. 
Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, the BLM is obligated not simply to preserve the public lands 
it administers, but to make them productive as well. BLM must set aside some 
lands for mining as well as wilderness, for grazing in addition to wildlife and 
for backpackers and off-road vehicle riders alike. The argument comes over 
whether the agency has tilted too far toward production and away from 
conservation. Its critics argue that it has. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GAO View 
</P>
<P>
"BLM has often placed the needs of commercial interests, such as livestock 
permittees and mine operators, ahead of other users (and) the long-term health 
of (the public's) resources," said James Duffus III of the General Accounting 
Office, a congressional watchdog agency. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result," he continued, "some permittees have come to view the use of 
these (public) lands as a property right for private benefit rather than a 
conditional privilege conferred by the public at large." 
</P>
<P>
BLM officials acknowledge that some ranchers feel proprietary toward public 
lands but deny that the bureau acquiesces to them. Instead, officials say the 
agency accommodates ranchers as legitimate users of public land and regulates 
them as much as possible with the money allocated by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism is not new to the agency. Those who contend it is too deferential to 
cattlemen and prospectors have long mocked BLM as the "Bureau of Livestock and 
Mining," while ranchers often grumble about the arrogant "Bureau of Land 
Mismanagement." 
</P>
<P>
Congress tried to improve the BLM in 1976 by passing a comprehensive set of 
guidelines called the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, but critics both 
in and out of the bureau contend that the law has been thwarted by 
ideologically conservative appointees of the Reagan and Bush administrations in 
senior management positions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff Respected 
</P>
<P>
Even the harshest BLM critics respect the agency's staff -- "Some of their 
field managers are the best you can find, anywhere," said Bern Shanks of the 
Center for California Studies at Sacramento State University -- but the rules, 
regulations and orders under which they work have led to a litany of abuses: 
</P>
<P>
* Multinational mining outfits strip-mine billions of dollars worth of gold, 
silver and other valuable "hard rock" minerals from lands owned by taxpayers, 
but pay no royalties nor any other compensation to the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
* A small fraction of the country's cattle graze public rangeland, sometimes 
until it is turned into desert or otherwise ruined for wildlife, while ranchers 
pay fees that are as much as 70% or 80% below what adjacent private landowners 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
* Other land is sold well below market rates -- as low as $2.50 or $5 an acre 
-- or swapped for property of significantly lower cash value because the bureau 
is bound by antiquated mining laws and lacks adequate staff to appraise all of 
the land it manages. 
</P>
<P>
* Park-like wilderness areas and invaluable cultural resources are scarred by 
vandals and off-road vehicles while the BLM debates whether and how to protect 
them. At the same time, it has reversed decisions already made for millions of 
acres of land, opening wildlife and recreation areas to development. 
</P>
<P>
* Delicate areas of designated "critical environmental concern" -- pockets of 
endangered cultural or wildlife resources -- sometimes are opened to oil 
drilling or military maneuvers, or simply ignored and left to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
* Threatened or endangered species are moved closer to extinction when their 
habitats -- sometimes even their lives -- are lost to miners, bikers, 
mismanaged predators and grazing livestock. 
</P>
<P>
Examples of such problems can be found throughout the BLM's dominion, which 
includes significant chunks of 11 western states and Alaska. Many of these 
areas were singled out for protection by Congress or previous BLM management 
teams, only to have managers under Reagan and Bush ignore them, or actively 
manage them for short-term private profit. 
</P>
<P>
"The (BLM) has really been whipsawed over the years by opposing forces and the 
degree to which people have played politics with (it) have really affected it 
in a very, very, very fundamental manner," said Johanna H. Wald of the Natural 
Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starving the Agency 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the damage is irreversible, but I do think the bureau as an 
institution . . . is really going to have a hard time undoing what has been 
done to it." 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, Wald and other critics say, the BLM's problems can be traced to 
a conscious effort to starve the agency of the money and staff needed to do its 
job. They contend that impoverishing the BLM lets a few public servants enrich 
their friends -- and sometimes themselves or their families. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing BLM Director Robert F. Burford, for example, has used public lands in 
Colorado to graze his livestock -- cattle currently managed by a blind trust 
run by his ex-wife and sons -- and he has many friends who do the same. He also 
headed the BLM during a time when grazing fees fell sharply, grazing allotments 
grew and efforts to halt overgrazing were stymied by endless studies. 
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, (BLM's) failure to do an adequate job . . . can be traced to a 
lack of staff and funding," said Faith T. Campbell of the Natural Resources 
Defense Council in Washington. The problem, she said, is caused by the "BLM's 
deliberate refusal to be realistic about its needs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deep Concern' 
</P>
<P>
The House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs made a point of this in 
reviewing the 1989 BLM budget proposal. With a note of unusual frankness, the 
committee publicly expressed a "deep concern" over the "skewed priorities" of 
recent BLM management. Budget cuts proposed under Reagan -- and followed by 
President Bush -- "have undermined the ability of the Bureau of Land Management 
to properly meet its responsibilities under existing law." Congress added $17 
million to the White House budget request for BLM. 
</P>
<P>
"The philosophical outlook of an agency is shaped by the professionals who 
staff it," said Frank Gregg, a BLM director in the Carter Administration. 
"(Former Interior Secretary James) Watt understood that and set out immediately 
to reduce the number of people in both the wildlife and resource management 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
According to Congress, between 1981 and 1988, the inflation-adjusted budget for 
land-use planning in the BLM plummeted 51%; funding for resource management 
dropped 29%; wildlife management funds fell 26%; grazing management funding 
declined 39%; money for range improvement was cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Manipulation 
</P>
<P>
The committee's statement concluded that, "as . . . Watt prophesied, (BLM) 
policy has been distorted through the manipulation of the budget." 
</P>
<P>
With the new Bush Administration, all of the traditional users of public lands 
are waiting to see which direction BLM will take. Early signs do not encourage 
conservationists. For example, Bush's BLM budget request has been dismissed as 
inadequate; Rep. Peter H. Kostmayer (D-Pa.) calls it little more than "warmed 
over Ronald Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's nominee for BLM director, Cy Jamison, worked for eight years as an aide 
to one of Congress' top anti-conservationists, Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont.). 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is there a sign Bush will try to restore BLM's funding or staff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Spread Very Thin' 
</P>
<P>
"We are spread very thin in the BLM," conceded Deputy Director Roland Robison. 
"Compared to the Forest Service, we're really under-funded. We've got far fewer 
people to manage the acreage than other organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as bureau critics note, the federal government's major multiple-use 
management agencies have remarkably different budgets. The Forest Service this 
year was authorized to spend $10.54 on each acre it manages; the BLM, only 
$2.68. 
</P>
<P>
Burford dismisses the under-funding argument. He notes that he has advocated 
increases in several programs: river recreation facilities, identification and 
cleanup of waste-disposal sites and the management of cultural resources. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be a mini-Park Service," he said recently at his office, 
looking more like a crusty Colorado cattleman than Washington bureaucrat as he 
fidgeted with a tin of Copenhagen chewing tobacco. "They have guides who take 
people on nature walks. I don't think we should do that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Clout 
</P>
<P>
Evidence indicates that when preservation policies come into conflict with 
production, BLM rules in favor of politically potent "consumptive users" over 
other groups. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Nestucca River in western Oregon is a remarkably beautiful 
steelhead trout and salmon fishery that the bureau has termed an "area of 
critical environmental concern," a legal designation meant to save wildlife, 
scenic and cultural resources from damage by a human activity -- in this case, 
logging, said BLM Resource Area Manager Dick Prather. 
</P>
<P>
After designating the area for protection, BLM rehabilitated the stream bed and 
constructed sheltered pools that not only are pretty to see, but also have 
helped restore the Nestucca as one of Oregon's premiere fishing streams. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, timber companies and local governments funded by 
timber receipts have pressed BLM to keep the area open to clear-cut logging, in 
which all the trees in each section are cut down at once. Sportsmen and others 
say the practice is unsightly and threatens the fishery with siltation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure to Cut 
</P>
<P>
Prather and another BLM manager responsible for the area, Dana Shuford, say the 
river is protected from these problems by a "no-cut buffer zone" several 
hundred feet wide. But they acknowledged some logging occurs within the buffer 
zone and said the real buffer is whatever remains after the area is logged. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure to cut is almost irresistible. Congressional delegations want logs to 
keep local sawmills in business, and the bureau itself needs the money from 
logging to operate. Sales of Oregon timber generate nearly 60% of all of BLM's 
revenue, even though it makes up only about 1% of the bureau's total land base. 
</P>
<P>
Few complained about the BLM tilt toward loggers, ranchers and miners until air 
conditioning and automobiles opened the bureau's arid, remote lands to new 
types of visitors -- people interested in preserving public lands for 
wilderness, wildlife or off-road vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competition for Land 
</P>
<P>
Water and access -- scarce resources in the West both then and now -- put all 
these different interest groups in competition for the relatively few chunks of 
land with the magic magnets of a river or a road nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Now BLM finds itself trying to balance environmentalists who want to protect 
the land, conservationists who want to save wildlife, campers keen to preserve 
scenic views and miners, cattlemen and off-road vehicle users who want to be 
left alone to pursue their interests. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, miners and livestock operators have grown dependent on the 
public lands. Many western ranches, for example, have little summer or winter 
pasture of their own; their real value, and the income of their owners, depends 
largely on the right to graze on nearby public lands. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like running a household of 12 children and every one of them wants to 
be No. 1," said Robison, BLM's deputy director. "It's not my job, nor can it 
be, to satisfy all those guys." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attempt at Reform 
</P>
<P>
Congress attempted to reconcile those inherently conflicting constituencies by 
devising the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, or FLPMA. It instructs BLM 
to employ the management practice called "multiple use-sustained yield," under 
which local plans set out how best to use public lands so that a variety of 
activities can be pursued indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
But many BLM critics -- in Congress, among environmental groups, even at the 
bureau itself -- complain that the Reagan Administration, working through BLM's 
appointed director, Burford, intentionally starved the bureau of the resources, 
money and staff needed to do that difficult job. 
</P>
<P>
Burford, for example, is attempting to overturn two decades of previous BLM 
land-use planning and arbitrarily open 180 million acres of BLM land to miners 
and ranchers. The effort includes such areas as the South Pass of Green 
Mountain in Wyoming and the "Arizona strip" adjoining Grand Canyon National 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
South Pass had been set aside as a useful fish and moose habitat; on the day 
Burford scuttled the plan, 199 gold- and uranium-mining claims were filed in 
that area -- a total that has since topped 400. The Arizona strip protects 
scenic and environmental values of one of the country's most popular national 
parks; it, too, is sought by uranium miners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Environmental Suit 
</P>
<P>
The National Wildlife Federation sued to stop Burford's plan, alleging that BLM 
violated federal law by reclassifying the land without notifying Congress, 
seeking public comment or doing an environmental impact study. A federal judge 
dismissed the suit on a technicality, but the wildlife group is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
"The record is clear," said Debbie Sease of the Sierra Club. "The Reagan 
Administration attempted to thwart the multiple-use stewardship mandate of the 
Bureau of Land Management." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent bureau-sponsored history of BLM, Burford wrote that he believes he 
did not fetter the bureau's conservation programs as much as elevate energy and 
minerals to be "co-equal" with forests, grazing lands and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
"As I reflect upon past accomplishments, I have seen a strong bond develop 
between BLM and the public land-users," the former Colorado legislator penned 
in the history. "This partnership has successfully reversed the lock-up trend 
of previous administrations and returned control from the chosen few to local 
governments that are more directly responsive to the public's needs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Non-Professionals 
</P>
<P>
For that same reason, Burford welcomed an unusual influx of non-professional 
political appointees to senior policy-making positions at the BLM headquarters 
in Washington. The watchdog General Accounting Office found that the number of 
political appointees increased from one when Burford entered office in 1981 to 
14 in 1986, while the number of career BLM policy-makers remained at 19. 
</P>
<P>
A political appointee himself, Burford has acknowledged that "feelings run deep 
and mixed on the presence of political appointees within the ranks of the 
agency." But, he added, even though only eight remain, he believes appointees 
will help prevent BLM from becoming "an inbred, stagnant organization." 
</P>
<P>
Others are less sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
George Lea, a former BLM official who now heads the Public Lands Foundation in 
Virginia, a collection of 2,000 former and retired BLM employees, said that the 
use of political appointees in top BLM management positions has frequently 
skewed policies in favor of cattlemen, miners and other consumptive users. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Bunch Is Mad' 
</P>
<P>
"I have worked for several administrations," he said recently, "but this bunch 
is just mad." 
</P>
<P>
A broad coalition of national environmental groups, including the Wilderness 
Society and National Wildlife Federation, recently warned that the public lands 
and their resources have suffered "tragic abuse" because BLM is "subject to 
political manipulation." 
</P>
<P>
"Today, as in the past," the coalition warned in an agenda-setting report for 
the new BLM administration, "policy decisions are repeatedly altered, and 
resource decisions made by professionals in the field are frequently overruled 
(by political appointees)." 
</P>
<P>
Often cited as an example is BLM's lukewarm support of the "areas of critical 
environmental concern." Conservationists argue that these areas, which are 
authorized under federal law, either are not designated or once chosen are not 
managed well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fragile Desert 
</P>
<P>
High Rock Canyon in Nevada, for example, was designated an area of critical 
environmental concern in 1983 for its scenic, anthropological and wildlife 
values. A visually stunning formation in the high desert, it has one of the 
three highest concentrations of birds of prey in the nation. Prairie falcons, 
golden eagles and owls nest in the sheer, 400-foot canyon walls and feed on 
rodents scampering over still-visible tracks left by wagon trains traveling the 
Applegate Trail nearly 150 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But until 1987, sheep and cattle were allowed to graze the area, eating 
protective grasses, trampling delicate stream banks and encouraging the stream 
to erode large areas, including parts of the historic trail. Meanwhile, a lack 
of BLM staff still allows vandals to loot and deface priceless anthropological 
resources, from axle-grease graffiti left by 19th-Century settlers to evidence 
of Indian habitation dating back at least 12,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the High Rock Canyon, motorcyclists have destroyed barriers 
that were designed to keep vehicles out of a sensitive meadow, unleashing more 
erosion of the slow-to-heal desert soil. Ironically, the barriers had been put 
up by environmentally conscious off-road vehicle clubs working with BLM to try 
to keep riders on designated trails. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agency Helpless 
</P>
<P>
BLM, lacking funds, has been helpless to check the abuse. Archeologist Hugh 
Bunten said it has taken him two years to obtain signs explaining the delicate 
nature of the area and asking visitors to be careful. Even then, the signs did 
not come out of BLM's budget -- they were donated by a gas pipeline company and 
will be installed by off-road vehicle owners. 
</P>
<P>
Money to enforce the laws protecting the critical areas -- enough for a lone 
ranger to cover a district that sprawls over three counties in northeastern 
California and northwestern Nevada -- was made available only late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Similar problems have been documented at other critical areas around the West 
by the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to us that, to a large extent, they are ducking the nomination 
process," said resource specialist Faith Campbell, who wrote the council's 
report. "Even when they do nominate, they go out of their way to make sure they 
do not impinge on any economic interest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Morale Suffers 
</P>
<P>
The cumulative weight of all these problems has long affected staff morale. 
</P>
<P>
John Adams, a former BLM soils scientist, said inconsistent BLM policies made 
him feel like "a straight man in a Marx Brothers movie." 
</P>
<P>
"We used to even question whether there was a BLM management plan," Adams 
recalled. "For example, people would bulldoze roads and then take out permits 
(to do so)." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, 12 years after the Federal Land Policy and Management Act was signed 
into law, BLM has finished only 57, or 37%, of the Resource Management Plans 
that are crucial to implementation of that law, according to its latest annual 
tally. One reason for this is the 50% cut in BLM's planning budget between 1981 
and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Setting a deadline for filing those plans is a key element in BLM reform 
legislation under preparation by Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the 
House Interior Committee's subcommittee on national parks and public lands. His 
other ideas include banning most political appointees and replacing 
rancher-dominated grazing advisory boards with more broad-based multiple-use 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outside Pressure 
</P>
<P>
BLM's critics acknowledge that the bureau has improved several of its 
management practices -- when protecting endangered species in the deserts and 
forests, for example, or devoting more resources to critical areas. But, they 
add, many such changes are the product of congressional pressure and 
environmentalists' lawsuits, not enlightened management or successful lobbying 
by staff conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
"For substantive progress . . . there will have to be a fundamental change" in 
BLM's management philosophy, the GAO's Duffus recently told Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"For this to occur," he stated, "BLM will have to abandon its historical 
identification with the interests of livestock permittees and other commercial 
interests. . . . Business as usual simply will not do if Congress' expectations 
as set forth in (the Management Act) are to be realized."

BELEAGUERED KOHL'S PATH GETS ROUGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BONN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To many West Germans and their allies, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been a tower 
of Teutonic stability. Now, however, many of them describe him in considerably 
less flattering terms. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Kohl's image has shifted from that of a plodding but reliable 
ally to that of a panicky political opportunist, offending Bonn's closest 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of a series of election setbacks and policy changes, Kohl's 
standing in public opinion polls has plummeted, the parties of the government 
coalition are wrangling among themselves, and Kohl's future as chancellor is 
said to be in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine Stern, party stalwarts may dump Kohl before the 
general election scheduled for December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"They had Kohl to thank for their seats, posts and sinecures," Stern said, "and 
they knew the elephant in the chancellery would stamp on any critic. Now there 
is danger that the herd will crush its leader underfoot because it no longer 
trusts him to defend their rich feeding grounds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Reasons for Shift 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of reasons for the drastic shift in Kohl's image, but the 
main reason is one that goes to the heart of West Germany's ties with its 
Western allies: the issue of short-range nuclear missiles based in Kohl's 
country. Kohl's position, that the allies should forgo modernizing the missiles 
and enter negotiations soon with the Soviet Union on that subject, is directly 
opposed to that of Washington, which is in favor of upgrading the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization's arsenal of tactical nuclear missiles in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has never been a popular figure, but he has confounded critics with his 
ability to survive despite his stolid, wait-and-see leadership. Some observers 
say his strengths have been those of a canny, tenacious provincial politician 
-- useful qualities but perhaps not suitable for the leader of a major European 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has been compared to the late President Lyndon B. Johnson, the self-made 
Texan who combined a sure touch on the domestic scene with a faltering step 
abroad. Kohl, as Johnson was, is a big, heavy, shambling man, with a mastery of 
the back-room levers of his party, who can be vindictive when crossed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequently Satirized 
</P>
<P>
Also like the Johnson image, Kohl is a rumpled figure with a regional accent, 
no facility for foreign languages, and a down-home manner, all of which are 
satirized by the political cartoonists who are accustomed to worldly 
chancellors such as Konrad Adenauer, Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has always been criticized for not providing vigorous international 
leadership, but this year he seems to have lost his touch on domestic policies, 
and this confused and alienated voters in recent local elections. 
</P>
<P>
In trying to placate domestic opinion, Kohl reversed himself on the missile 
issue and as a consequence incurred the contempt and anger of Bush 
Administration officials and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a month ago, Bush and Thatcher believed that in return for their 
delaying a decision on the sensitive issue of modernizing the missiles in West 
Germany, Bonn would not press for negotiations with the Kremlin on their 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caved in to Genscher 
</P>
<P>
But 24 hours after this deal was struck in Brussels, Kohl caved in to the 
persistent demands of Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and called for 
"early" talks with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
He also reversed himself on the length of service for West German conscripts. 
His government announced an increase from 15 to 18 months because of the 
declining birthrate. Then, to the dismay of defense officials, he said the 
extension would be put off. He cited "new figures" but refused to disclose 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"These decisions," a West German analyst said, "have infuriated Washington, 
London, the defense community and NATO allies, but they may play well at home." 
</P>
<P>
Angelika Volle, a senior West German policy analyst, said, "Germans want to get 
rid of nuclear missiles, and they don't mind a chancellor standing up to the 
U.S. and British on this." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has also reversed himself on health, welfare and tax reform questions -- 
once he realized that they were unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
These about-faces have led to a perception of Kohl as changing course in 
response to every political wind rather than providing firm guidance. Still, 
some see this as an ability to adjust to popular wishes. 
</P>
<P>
And some of Kohl's problems are not of his making. He presides over an unwieldy 
coalition of three parties -- his center-right Christian Democratic Union, its 
Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, which is more to the right, 
and the liberal Free Democrats, who stand to the left. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has allowed his foreign minister, Genscher, a leader of the Free 
Democrats, to take over the reins of foreign policy, to the consternation of 
Washington and London, to the extent that Genscher is known as "Bonn's secret 
chancellor." Genscher stands at the top in popularity polls. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Kohl's main antagonist was Franz Josef Strauss, leader of the 
Christian Social Union, who died last year. Ironically, Strauss' right-wing 
image kept many ultraconservatives under the Christian Democratic tent, but 
they are now voting for far-right parties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seemed Improbably Cast 
</P>
<P>
Because of his political shifts, Kohl may not be able to recover the centrist 
vote, political observers say, and he has lost the chance to be considered a 
true statesman. But Kohl always seemed improbably cast for the world stage. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the industrial city of Ludwigshafen in the wine-growing 
Rhineland-Palatinate, he is the son of a Roman Catholic customs official and a 
Protestant mother. In high school, he became a youth member of the Christian 
Democratic Union, then studied at the University of Heidelberg, which awarded 
him a doctorate in history. 
</P>
<P>
At 29, he was elected to the Rhineland-Palatinate state legislature. He married 
and fathered two sons and held a succession of political posts, in the process 
learning to manipulate the party machinery. He became the youngest man ever 
elected premier, or governor, of the state, then moved on to the federal level 
in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, he was his party's choice for chancellor but lost to Schmidt. In the 
next election, in 1980, Strauss shouldered Kohl aside to run at the top of the 
ticket -- and lost. In 1982, the Free Democrats switched allegiance from the 
Social Democrats, bringing down the Schmidt government, and teamed up with the 
Christian Democrats. Kohl was named chancellor and won the office in his own 
right in 1983, then again in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He has weathered political crises: the Flick affair, involving charges that he 
had accepted funds from industries on behalf of his party; his dismissal of a 
senior general on unsupported morals charges, and his insistence that 
then-President Ronald Reagan accompany him to the Bitburg military cemetery, 
which contains the graves of several Nazi SS men. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl scorns public relations advice and is confident that he can reach the 
German people directly with his folksy approach. But he is a stilted speaker 
and does not project well on television. 
</P>
<P>
He is fond of pointing out that he is the first chancellor of the post-World 
War II generation. He speaks of knowing the "real" Germany, as distinguished 
from intellectual circles in Bonn, Hamburg and Berlin, and unabashedly praises 
the fatherland concept that appeals to much of the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
He has tended to surround himself with men whom some regard as second-rate. His 
former official spokesman encouraged him to describe Soviet leader Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev as a better propagandist than the Nazi propaganda chief Joseph 
Goebbels -- a gaffe that froze Moscow-Bonn relations for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, in part because of poor advice, Kohl mishandled the issue of a 
Libyan factory with the apparent potential of making chemical weapons. Kohl 
insisted that West German companies were not helping Libya build the factory 
long after it had been made clear that they were. 
</P>
<P>
This year, after regional election setbacks in West Berlin and Hesse, Kohl 
appeared to panic. He quickly shuffled his Cabinet and reneged on his 
commitment to the NATO on the short-range missile issue. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Social Democrats were bolstered at the polls and the 
radical Greens party decided to take part in state coalition governments, 
creating a real possibility that a "red-green" combination could take power 
after the next election. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, few political analysts are writing off Kohl, who has proved 
the skeptics wrong before. As Volle, the policy analyst, put it, "Though his 
strengths are much shorter than his weaknesses, it is easy to underestimate 
him." 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Kohl's u-turn on nuclear missiles could prove to be a big 
political bonus. His position is supported by several NATO allies, and the 
first domestic impact may come sooner rather than later. On June 18, West 
Germans will choose their representatives to the European Parliament, as well 
as local officials in the Saarland and in Kohl's own Rhineland-Palatinate. 
</P>
<P>
Those results will be closely studied here and abroad to see whether the 
phoenix of West German politics can rise again.

EXPERTS ASSESS CASE AGAINST MAYOR; 
</P>
<P>
BRADLEY UNLIKELY TO FACE CRIMINAL CONFLICT CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, Times Legal Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legal experts say they do not expect prosecutors to charge Los Angeles Mayor 
Tom Bradley with any crimes based on allegations that he took official actions 
to benefit a bank and a savings and loan in which he had financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
They say that if the mayor faces legal difficulty stemming from his role as a 
paid official of the two financial institutions -- and it is not clear that he 
does -- it will most likely take the form of a civil suit alleging that he 
violated the less punitive of the state's two conflict-of-interest laws. Such a 
suit would carry a maximum $2,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations were prompted by disclosures that Bradley was paid $18,000 as 
an adviser to Far East National Bank and up to $24,000 a year as a member of 
the board of directors of Valley Federal Savings and Loan Assn., both of which 
had business dealings with the city. The ties between these institutions and 
Bradley have become the central focus of an investigation by City Atty. James 
K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
This is only one of several inquiries into the mayor's financial affairs. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan 
have begun separate inquiries into the mayor's financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
But the exact nature and likely outcome of these probes are largely unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment that Bradley will not be charged with a crime for violating 
conflict-of-interest laws is based in part on the observation that very few 
politicians have ever been prosecuted on such charges. Charlotte Rhea, a 
research analyst for the state attorney general's Bureau of Criminal 
Statistics, said she could not find any record of conflict-of-interest 
prosecutions in California in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment is also based on the mayor's not having acted in a typically 
criminal manner: Rather than hide his financial relationship with the financial 
institutions, he reported them, as the law requires, on economic disclosure 
statements that are open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that he did not try to fool the voters -- that he reported it -- 
pretty much takes it out of the criminal arena," said one prosecutor who has 
evaluated numerous conflict-of-interest allegations involving other officials. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most serious of the allegations is that Bradley used his official 
position to try to influence the city treasurer to deposit city funds with Far 
East National Bank, where Bradley was acting as a paid adviser. 
</P>
<P>
This is what has been reported: 
</P>
<P>
The mayor called city Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg just after he had received a 
phone call from the bank's president, Henry Hwang, asking about reports that 
the city was about to end its policy of depositing money in small 
minority-owned banks. The next day, the treasurer deposited $1 million in 
Hwang's bank and another $1 million a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Civil Suit More Likely 
</P>
<P>
One expert, a lawyer who has wide experience in such cases, said a civil suit 
is more likely than a criminal prosecution. Like most of seven experts 
interviewed for this story, this one spoke on condition that he not to be 
named. 
</P>
<P>
"Bradley has received more than $250 (the legal standard)," the lawyer said. 
"It appears he's participated in a decision affecting his source of income in 
that he called the city treasurer and said -- if it can be shown that he indeed 
said this -- 'why don't you deposit money with Far East?' " 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty is proving Bradley made such a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The treasurer has said that he did not think the mayor or anyone else was 
trying to influence him. 
</P>
<P>
What did the mayor then want? The treasurer and the mayor have said Bradley 
simply wanted to know if the bank was receiving city deposits. Rebutting this 
appears to depend on city documents that reportedly indicate the mayor long 
knew the city had funds on deposit with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
A criminal prosecution, which entails proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, 
probably would be extremely difficult under these circumstances, experts said. 
A civil suit, which requires only that one side's case be a little stronger 
than the other's, would be much easier. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley appears clearly off the hook as far as the tougher of California's two 
conflict-of-interest laws is concerned. That law, which can be prosecuted as a 
felony, prohibits public officials from being "financially interested in any 
contract made by them in their official capacity or by any body or board of 
which they are members." But bank deposits, although contracts, are 
specifically exempted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role Poses Questions 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's position as Far East's only paid "special adviser" raises other 
questions for prosecutors: 
</P>
<P>
Did the mayor, who was a police officer for many years before he became a 
politician, have special expertise in banking? 
</P>
<P>
If not, was he really offering advice, or was he offering his influence as 
mayor in the guise of advice? If so, was he guilty of accepting an illegal 
gratuity -- which is akin to a tip -- or a bribe? 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors with the Los Angeles city attorney's office, which is reviewing the 
allegations, have already ruled out such prosecutions, according to a source 
familiar with their probe, because they have come up with no evidence of a quid 
pro quo. 
</P>
<P>
But Daniel Lowenstein, a UCLA law professor and principal author of the state's 
Political Reform Act, said bribery should not necessarily be ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
Lowenstein said a bribe does not require an explicit exchange of money for an 
official action. It merely requires that the public official intends to be 
influenced when he accepts the money. Lowenstein said bribes are commonplace in 
politics, and distinctions between them and some campaign contributions, gifts, 
honorariums and illegal gratuities are blurred. Much "bribery goes unprosecuted 
primarily because the crime is so pervasive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Four prosecutors said that while Lowenstein may be technically correct, it is 
unrealistic to expect a jury to convict a public official of bribery without 
evidence of a quid pro quo -- preferably on tape. 
</P>
<P>
In part because they believe it is so difficult to obtain convictions against 
popular public figures, some prosecutors, who have almost unlimited discretion 
in these matters, said they are sometimes content to let politicians take a 
beating in the media -- rather than spend money on taking them to court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Violations 
</P>
<P>
A decision to prosecute, they said, usually requires that a lot of money, 
concealment or repeated violations be involved. They also said they have to be 
convinced that there was an intent to commit a crime rather than a foul-up. 
</P>
<P>
The only conflict-of-interest prosecution in Los Angeles County in recent years 
-- one that apparently escaped the attention of the Bureau of Criminal 
Statistics -- involved a Downey city councilman. The councilman, James 
Santangelo, cast the deciding vote in favor of redeveloping an area in which he 
operated a large real estate office and owned substantial property, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Herbert Lapin, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
Santangelo had not hidden his assets. The case against him was dropped after a 
jury was declared hopelessly deadlocked, 11 to 1, for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Santangelo was charged with a misdemeanor under the Political Reform Act's 
conflict-of-interest provision. It prohibits a public official from 
participating in or using his position to try to influence any governmental 
decision in which he "knows or has reason to know he has a financial interest." 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing wrong with public officials having conflicting interests. It 
is only illegal if they fail to disqualify themselves from public actions that 
affect their private interests. 
</P>
<P>
Conflict-of-interest law evolved from the Biblical admonition that "no man 
shall serve two masters." 
</P>
<P>
The point of the law, as the attorney general's office has expressed it in a 
formal opinion, is to forbid a public official from placing himself "in a 
position in which he might be tempted by his own private interest to disregard 
the interest of the public." 
</P>
<P>
"We know some people may be capable of acting objectively" even though they 
have a competing private interest, Lowenstein said, "but we're not interested 
in that. We're saying, 'This is the line, don't cross it.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Valley Federal Savings and Loan, Bradley faces allegations that 
he crossed the line because he conducted city business that affected the 
financial institution, while a he was one of its stockholders and directors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approved Rezoning 
</P>
<P>
The city business was approval of zoning changes sought by Valley Federal's 
development subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
One question facing prosecutors is whether Bradley knew or had reason to know 
that the documents he signed involved this subsidiary. Bradley has said he did 
not know. Rebutting his position would probably be difficult because the 
documents did not contain the name of the Valley Federal subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley could also be off the hook if it could be shown that the zoning changes 
did not have what the law refers to as a "material financial effect" on the 
savings and loan. This effect has been variously defined. 
</P>
<P>
To have a material effect on a company the size of IBM, for example, in which a 
public official owned stock, a decision by the public official would have to 
result in at least a million-dollar change in IBM's gross revenues, according 
to regulations imposed by the state Fair Political Practices Commission, a 
policing agency created by the Political Reform Act. To materially affect a 
small business, the decision would have to result in at least a $10,000 change. 
In a zoning case, there would have to be a $10,000 increase or decrease in the 
fair market value of the rezoned property. 
</P>
<P>
Whether such a change could be proved as a result of the Valley Federal 
rezoning decisions is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Another difficulty in prosecuting Bradley in connection with the zoning changes 
involves an exception to conflict-of-interest law called the rule of necessity. 
This exception, according to the attorney general's office, "permits 
governmental officers or agencies to carry out essential duties despite 
conflicts where only they may act." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Bradley, he can sign, veto or refuse to sign zoning change 
ordinances approved by the City Council. If he refuses to sign, the ordinance 
becomes law anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The only way Bradley could have avoided a conflict of interest in the zoning 
matters would have been to leave the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leave the City? 
</P>
<P>
The question then becomes: Is the mayor required to leave the city whenever a 
conflict arises? The answer is doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
A similar question arose in San Francisco a few years ago when then-Mayor 
Dianne Feinstein vetoed an ordinance that could have cost her money. Feinstein 
was a landlord with five apartments. The ordinance would have limited the rent 
that landlords could have charged new tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was sued by a nonprofit group, which alleged her veto violated 
conflict-of-interest law. A trial court agreed, but a panel of the state Court 
of Appeal ruled there was no violation. 
</P>
<P>
If the city attorney's office declines to prosecute Bradley or file suit 
against him, the FPPC still could could begin an administrative action against 
the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The commission did that last year with Los Angeles City Councilman Richard 
Alatorre, after the city attorney's office declined to press a 
conflict-of-interest case. Alatorre was fined $2,000 after admitting that he 
attempted to steer a $722,500 city contract to an Eastside community 
organization that had paid him $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has fined 14 public officials for conflict-of-interest 
violations in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
For public officials concerned about avoiding conflicts, the commission hands 
out free advice. Every month, about 10 officials make use of the service.

<TEXT>
<P>
A century later, Elsie Frum remembers vividly the steady, shrill whistle of 
warning and the horrifying wall of water that killed 2,209 people in the 
Johnstown Flood of 1889. 
</P>
<P>
"My father ran into the house and said: 'Run! The dam has broken!' And we ran. 
We just got out in time," Mrs. Frum recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible. It sounded like thunder. It took everything, everything in 
front of it -- railroad engines, the roundhouse. It took all the buildings. It 
looked like an ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there was nothing left. It was like a beach when it was over. We just 
stood there and watched it. Everyone was stunned. We didn't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Frum, 106 years old and a great-great-grandmother, is the last known 
survivor who remembers the flood of May 31, 1889, the first of three floods to 
devastate this western Pennsylvania mountain city and nearby villages. 
</P>
<P>
One of the five worst natural disasters in U.S. history, the Johnstown Flood of 
1889 was caused by the collapse of the South Fork Dam about 15 miles northeast 
and 450 feet above Johnstown. 
</P>
<P>
The 72-foot-high earthen dam held a private lake for the exclusive summertime 
recreation of such 19th-Century industrial barons as Andrew Carnegie, Henry 
Clay Frick and Andrew Mellon. Experts said 
</P>
<P>
later it was weakened by poor maintenance and extraordinarily heavy rains of up 
to 10 inches in 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The dam's collapse sent a 35- to 80-foot surge of water racing down the narrow 
Little Conemaugh River Valley, sweeping away houses, barns, railroad cars and 
locomotives, telegraph poles, livestock, people and nearly everything else 
before it hit Johnstown at 4:07 p.m., 57 minutes after the dam broke. 
</P>
<P>
Then a budding industrial city of about 10,000 deep in a bowl-like valley, 
Johnstown was already under several feet of water from the rains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crashed Into City 
</P>
<P>
The mid-afternoon flood water, pushing a roll of debris before it, crashed into 
the city's busy steel mills, fragile wood-frame homes and finally into its 
sturdy Pennsylvania Railroad bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people in Johnstown never saw the water coming; they only heard 
it," historian David G. McCullough wrote in his 1968 book, "The Johnstown 
Flood." 
</P>
<P>
"Those who actually saw the wall of water would talk and write about how it 
'snapped off trees like pipestems' or 'crushed houses like eggshells,' " 
McCullough wrote. "But what seemed 
</P>
<P>
to make the most lasting impression was the cloud of dark spray that hung over 
the front of the wave . . . it was talked of as 'the death mist' and would be 
remembered always." 
</P>
<P>
Scores of stranded people floated on a huge jumble of wreckage covering about 
30 acres that jammed up at the stone railroad bridge just below downtown. But 
the great pile caught fire and 80 helpless victims died in a second horror. 
</P>
<P>
Clara Barton, then 67 and eager to promote her new American Red Cross, rushed 
in from Washington and set up headquarters inside a boxcar. 
</P>
<P>
The new Red Cross helped organize field hospitals, kitchens and laundries. Five 
months later, Johnstown's citizens bid her farewell with a diamond locket and 
their grateful thanks. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Frum, then a 6-year-old schoolgirl, lived with her parents and two younger 
sisters in East Conemaugh, just upriver from Johnstown. Her father, John 
Shaffer, owned a planing mill next door. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Frum remembered her father as a nosy and nervous man, especially about 
increasing rumors that the South Fork Dam was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer had stepped outside in the rain to see if nearby wooden bridges were 
still standing when, Mrs. Frum recalls, everyone heard engineer John Hess' 
heroic warning whistle from the cab of Pennsylvania Railroad Engine 1124. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nearly Everyone Heard Alarm 
</P>
<P>
McCullough wrote: "Hess in his engine blazed down the valley, the water 
practically on top of him, in an incredibly heroic dash to sound the alarm. . . 
. Nearly everyone in East Conemaugh heard it and understood almost instantly 
what it meant." 
</P>
<P>
"That was our Paul Revere," Mrs. Frum recalls. "A man had taken his train up 
and he was on the way down, and saw the dam had broken. And he tied his whistle 
down. He jumped. He was saved. He stayed on it till he got into Conemaugh. 
</P>
<P>
"My father knew then that the dam had broken," she says. 
</P>
<P>
From the safety of a nearby hill, Elsie and her family saw "everything just 
roll away." 
</P>
<P>
"We could see things tumbling around in the water," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer sent his family into the country for a week. When Elsie returned, her 
father was building coffins for the dead brought to the nearby United Methodist 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember they brought the bodies there to wash, took them across to the 
church and laid them across the top of the seats," Mrs. Frum says. "They put a 
robe over them. He made the coffins to bury them in. That's what I remember. I 
saw all that. 
</P>
<P>
"It was horrible. I was scared to death of dead people. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the cleanup. Every time they would dig a place for a home, they 
would find a body. And every time they would dig any place, they would find 
something, you know, a body or something." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bodies Were Found for Weeks 
</P>
<P>
Johnstown's dead were found miles past the stone bridge for weeks. Debris was 
recovered as far away as Pittsburgh, about 75 miles to the west. The last body 
was discovered 15 years later. 
</P>
<P>
Many bodies could not be identified, and 663 of the unknown were buried in a 
common plot in nearby Grandview Cemetery three years later. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of lives lost, the Johnstown Flood ranks as the second-worst natural 
disaster in U.S. history. A hurricane that hit Galveston, Tex., in 1890 left 
6,000 dead. The San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 ranks fifth, with 500 killed. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's press sensationalized the tragedy, sometimes filing false stories 
of heroism and looting. But the press also helped mobilize quick national and 
international help for the stricken area. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, trainloads of food, tents, clothing, lumber, construction 
supplies, and even coffins, arrived. Cash contributions from around the world 
totaled $3.7 million, according to McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Frum remembers the relief efforts, the immediate rescue and reconstruction 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
"All kinds of food came in and all kinds of clothing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits Filed 
</P>
<P>
Later, fingers of blame were pointed at the millionaires' South Fork Fishing 
and Hunting Club, which had allowed the dam at the former reservoir to 
deteriorate. Several lawsuits were filed and, without a lake, the club soon 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
But, McCullough reported, "not a nickel was ever collected through damage suits 
from the . . . club or from any of its members." 
</P>
<P>
"Every person was warned, oh, long before it 
</P>
<P>
broke," Mrs. Frum said. "Oh yes, they were warned. Every time it rained, they 
said the dam was going to break and it didn't. And, of course, when it 
happened, why, nobody thought it was going to happen and nobody ran -- but us." 
</P>
<P>
The Shaffers were lucky. The high water flooded their house and they returned 
to live in it. 
</P>
<P>
But Mrs. Frum lost everything, including the contents of her Johnstown home, on 
March 17, 1936, when a warm rain melted heavy winter snows too quickly and the 
city suffered its second major flood. The 1936 flood left 25 people dead and 
caused $41 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
Moving to a nearby suburb atop a mountain, Mrs. Frum missed Johnstown's third 
great flood on July 22, 1977, when 11 inches of rain fell in the area in nine 
hours. The 1977 flood left 80 people dead and caused $350 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Frum never left the Johnstown area, and she has survived two husbands. All 
of her 30 descendants are still alive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard Times 
</P>
<P>
"I have wondered, yes, a lot why I'm here," she says. "I guess it's just not 
time for me to go. I've gone through a lot. I don't want another flood, I know 
that." 
</P>
<P>
There have been other hard times for Johnstown. Stung by rapid declines in the 
steel industry, Johnstown at one point in 1983 bore the nation's highest 
unemployment rate, 26.6%, but at the same time it maintained the nation's 
lowest crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
The city, now about 35,000 people and slowly recovering economically, has 
planned more than 100 commemorative and special events this summer to mark the 
flood's 100th anniversary under the slogan, "A Triumph of the American Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for the celebration is to show how the city has been resilient, not 
only from the floods, but from the various economic adversities," says Mayor 
Herbert Pfuhl Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to survivors of the 1889 flood, Pfuhl says, "I think they'd be 
pleased with the changes and the progress that have happened."

THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD 1. On May 31, 1889, a steady rain caused the earthen South 
Fork Dam to break, sending lake water swirling into the valley below.2. The 
first town struck was South Fork, where 20 to 30 houses were destroyed and the 
flood claimed its first victims.3. The raging waters were temporarily dammed up 
by a railroad viaduct. When the viaduct collapsed, the water broke free with 
violent force.4. The saw mill town of Mineral Point was struck with the renewed 
force of the wave. Thirty families lived on the village's single street, but 
when the flood passed, only bare rock remained. 16 died.5. A witness said the 
water by now was almost obscured by the debris, resembling "a huge hill rolling 
over and over" tossing up logs high above its surface. At East Conemaugh, 50 
died.6. As the river straightened out, the flood gathered speed and power. 
Woodvale was leveled. 314 died.7. The flood hit Johnstown with full force, 
bearing the remains of the Conemaugh Valley. The time was 4:07 p.m., 57 minutes 
after the dam had broken. Hundreds more died. Stranded people floated on a huge 
jumble of debris measuring 30 acres consisting of trees, telegraph poles, 
buildings, and trains. This pile jammed at a stone bridge in Johnstown which 
became for a time an island of safety, but the jam caught fire and 80 people 
died. FIVE WORST U.S. NATURAL DISASTERS ; Map, 100 YEARS AGO: THE JOHNSTOWN

A key financial adviser to U.S. Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) is enmeshed in a 
tangle of lawsuits here that accuse him of failing to pay hundreds of thousands 
of dollars in debts and of breaking promises to business associates. 
</P>
<P>
Merced accountant Donald W. Ozenbaugh Jr. has emerged as a pivotal figure in 
questions surrounding Coelho's personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, who said through a spokesman on Friday that he was unaware of the 
lawsuits against Ozenbaugh, has identified him as the man who prepared 
financial disclosure forms that failed to list an unusual $50,000 loan Coelho 
received from Columbia Savings &amp; Loan in 1986 to finance part of the 
purchase of a $100,000 high-yield "junk bond." Ozenbaugh also prepared Coelho's 
1986 tax return, which, according to an attorney for the congressman, 
incorrectly reported the $6,882 profit from the sale of the bond, forcing a 
probable liability for back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems caused by Ozenbaugh, Coelho continued to express 
confidence in him and his handling of the junk bond investment.

"I hired Don to do this," he said in an interview last week. "He'd done all my 
financial disclosures. It was up to Don to tell me if it was a good investment. 
If he said, 'Yes,' I believe him. I pay for professional advice." 
</P>
<P>
But a more skeptical portrait of Ozenbaugh emerges in lawsuits on file at the 
Superior Court here and in other courthouses around California. Some 32 
lawsuits ascribe a pattern of broken promises and bad debts to the 42-year-old 
accountant. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, some of the accountant's clients had to pay thousands of dollars 
in back taxes after the Internal Revenue Service made adverse rulings on 
investments they made on Ozenbaugh's advice, according to one investor who said 
he had to pay $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ozenbaugh is scheduled to testify in Superior Court in Merced in a 
case involving an alleged debt of $142,000 -- at the same time he is supposed 
to appear in Municipal Court in Contra Costa County on an unrelated claim of 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ozenbaugh denied any wrongdoing, but declined to talk about his legal problems 
or investment advice, referring specific queries to his attorney, Steven Clair, 
who also would not answer detailed questions. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said that many of the lawsuits involving his client have been 
resolved and that Ozenbaugh has filed papers denying others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Terribly Unusual' 
</P>
<P>
"Litigation is not terribly unusual," Clair said in an interview in his 
Stockton office. "It happens when people have disagreements." 
</P>
<P>
Ozenbaugh has had his share: 
</P>
<P>
* In the case now on trial in Merced Superior Court, G. R. Clark, a grading 
contractor, accused Ozenbaugh of owing $141,954 for work on the Hillcrest 
subdivision in Merced. Ozenbaugh has filed a cross-complaint alleging that he 
lost $150,000 because Clark did not complete the grading on time. 
</P>
<P>
* Security Pacific National Bank said Ozenbaugh owes $322,465 plus interest on 
a loan that has been in default since Nov. 11, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
* A group of seven local investors, some of them former accounting clients, 
accuse Ozenbaugh of violating his fiduciary duty as their financial adviser by 
allegedly failing to inform them when rental units that he built and sold to 
them in 1982 developed "significant structural problems" several years later. 
</P>
<P>
* Richwood Meat Co. Inc. Profit Sharing Plan Trust -- whose owners, former 
Ozenbaugh clients, are suing in connection with the structural defects -- said 
in a lawsuit filed Sept. 11 that the accountant had guaranteed a $35,000 note 
and then failed to pay when the borrower defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
* Cal Valley Orchard Services said in a suit filed July 19, 1985, that it had 
harvested a 1984 almond crop on a 622-acre farm operated by an Ozenbaugh 
investment group and that Ozenbaugh and the group still owed $53,068 for the 
harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
* Bank of America said in a suit filed July 5, 1988, that Ozenbaugh failed to 
repay a $75,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
* In March, Texas Commerce Bank, which had obtained an $80,000 judgment against 
Caltex and Ozenbaugh in Texas, filed suit in Merced County to collect the 
award. 
</P>
<P>
* Wells Fargo Bank said in a suit filed April 28 that Ozenbaugh owed $75,000 on 
two checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
* In the case set for trial in Contra Costa on Monday, Ozenbaugh is accused of 
failing to pay the Owens Financial Group a $40,000 commission for a real estate 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
* The California Teachers Assn. successfully sued Ozenbaugh in October, 1987, 
alleging that he owed more than $10,000 in rent and county taxes on a 1.6-acre 
parcel and had failed to develop the land as agreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus of Legal Actions 
</P>
<P>
The focus of this legal animosity is a bearded, burly 42-year-old 6-footer who 
lives in a sprawling house on almost two acres in Atwater. In nearby Merced, a 
well-appointed suite of offices houses Ozenbaugh's accounting firm and also 
Caltex Land and Development Co. Inc., a Texas and California corporation of 
which he is president. 
</P>
<P>
On the wall next to the office door, framed photographs show Ozenbaugh with 
Coelho, House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), former House Speaker Tip O'Neill and 
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), a former candidate for the Democratic 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the congressman invested between $5,001 and $15,000 in Dairy 
Management Associates, a partnership organized by Ozenbaugh that markets 
computer software for dairy farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Ozenbaugh also persuaded two of the congressman's acquaintances who live in 
Washington to invest in the partnership -- Fred Hatfield, Coelho's chief of 
staff, and John P. Mack, former aide to House Speaker Wright. Mack resigned 
last week after reports that he been convicted of brutally beating a woman, 
stabbing her with a knife and leaving her for dead 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Good Investment 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, when Thomas Spiegel, president of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan, offered 
Coelho the chance to purchase the $100,000 junk bond, the congressman turned to 
Ozenbaugh, who said it was a good investment. 
</P>
<P>
Ozenbaugh said he was aware of the $50,000 loan that helped pay for the bond 
but simply forgot to put it on the congressman's disclosure statements. 
Ozenbaugh also prepared Coelho's income tax returns for 1986 and listed the 
congressman's $6,882 profit from selling the bond as a long-term capital gain. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho attorney Robert Bauer said Coelho probably owed back taxes because the 
congressman had not held the bond for the six-month period that was required to 
take advantage of the lower tax rate at the time on long-term capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho spokesman David Dreyer said that Coelho is contemplating no legal action 
against his accountant as a result of the alleged mistake he made on the 
congressman's tax return and financial disclosure report. 
</P>
<P>
Some other people who relied on Ozenbaugh in Merced and other Central Valley 
cities and who do not share Coelho's reluctance about legal actions against 
Ozenbaugh, are biting in their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tied Up Property 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Ronald H. Marks, who represented the California Teachers Assn. in its 
successful suit against Ozenbaugh, said the accountant's late payments of rent 
-- some with bad checks -- and failure to pay county taxes allowed Ozenbaugh to 
tie up a valuable piece of property for very little money. 
</P>
<P>
"A great deal for Ozenbaugh; a terribly inequitable deal for the California 
Teachers Assn.," Marks wrote in a legal motion. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that Ozenbaugh should not be allowed to reinstate the lease, Marks said 
he had been a "quarrelsome, troublesome tenant" and that his failure to pay 
county taxes, "suggest either that Mr. Ozenbaugh is playing games with CTA and 
the court or, more likely, Mr. Ozenbaugh is in serious financial trouble 
scrambling to keep his creditors happy." 
</P>
<P>
Former accounting partner Michael Smith severed his years-long relationship 
with Ozenbaugh in 1986, taking many of the firm's clients with him. Smith 
acknowledged in an interview that he is helping in the suit lodged by the 
former clients of Ozenbaugh in the structural defects case. 
</P>
<P>
One of these clients is John Schneidmiller, a retired Air Force officer who 
lives in Merced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Been a Friend 
</P>
<P>
Schneidmiller said in an interview that he once was a good friend of Ozenbaugh 
and used him as his accountant, but broke with him after following his 
investment advice to buy into a series of limited partnerships that offered 
significant tax write-offs. Eventually, he said, the IRS ruled that he had to 
pay $40,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to mortgage my house. . . . Uncle Sam says it is nothing but a tax 
dodge," said Schneidmiller, noting that Dairy Management Associates in which he 
had invested was given a clean bill of health by the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Schneidmiller and Ozenbaugh's former secretary, who asked not to be named, said 
a number of Merced's most affluent people had made similar investments on 
Ozenbaugh's advice and also had to pay back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many people chasing Don," Schneidmiller said.

'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' STAR GILDA RADNER DIES AT 42 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comedian Gilda Radner, who made millions laugh with the zany characters she 
created as a member of the original cast of television's "Saturday Night Live," 
died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after a long struggle with ovarian 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old performer had fought the disease for 2 1/2 years and had 
recently written a book about her struggle. She died in her sleep, with her 
husband, actor Gene Wilder, at her side, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
Radner entered Cedars-Sinai on Wednesday for treatment of side effects from 
earlier treatments, according to a hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"She fought hard," said associate Rachel McCallister. "She was a very brave and 
courageous lady, and she didn't give up easily." 
</P>
<P>
As a gawky, squawky-voiced satirist, with a frizzy tangle of hair, Radner 
created such characters as Roseanne Roseannadana, a gross, lisping newscaster; 
Emily Litella, a dithery, confused editorialist; Candy Slice, a masochistic 
punk rock star, and co-ed Rhonda Weiss, a gum-chewing Jewish "princess" from 
Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
Her characterizations brought her an Emmy in 1978 for outstanding performance 
as an actress on "Saturday Night Live," where she was a member of the Not Ready 
for Prime Time Players with Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Bill Murray and Dan 
Aykroyd, who all went on to stardom. 
</P>
<P>
The actress fought cancer with anger, hope and humor, according to an account 
of her struggle detailed in her book, "It's Always Something," which will soon 
be in stores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Unfunny Thing' 
</P>
<P>
In excerpts in the June issue of Redbook, Radner wrote: "Cancer is probably the 
most unfunny thing in the world, but I'm a comedienne, and even cancer wasn't 
going to stop me from seeing the humor in what I was going through. The last 
thing that I wanted was to be tragic." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Michigan, Radner sometimes referred to herself as "this Jewish girl 
from Detroit." She studied drama at the University of Michigan, leaving to join 
a Canadian production of "Godspell," the religious rock musical, staged in 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
She moved on to become a member of Toronto's "Second City" improvisational 
comedy troupe, an offshoot of the famed Chicago company. Her fellow performers 
included Aykroyd and Murray, who would be with Radner again when "Saturday 
Night Live" premiered on NBC in October, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
While still on the show, Radner appeared in 1979 in a short-lived, one-woman 
Broadway show called "Gilda Live," which was produced as a movie a year later 
and as an album, "Live From New York Gilda Radner." 
</P>
<P>
She left "Saturday Night Live" in 1980, making five films and appearing in a 
Broadway play in the next six years. The movies included "The Woman in Red" and 
"Haunted Honeymoon," both written and directed by Wilder, whom she met on the 
set of the film "Hanky Panky" in 1981 and married three years later in southern 
France. They had homes in Southern California and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Quite Grown Up 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at the edge of growing up," Radner said in a July, 1986, interview. "I 
don't miss 'Saturday Night Live.' I feel less of a need for the fulfillment 
that performance used to give. . . . I don't have to do everything right away. 
As long as I can walk and jump, I'll still perform, but I no longer feel such a 
compulsion." 
</P>
<P>
Radner did not know then that her greatest challenge lay ahead. She learned 
that about two months later when doctors told her she had ovarian cancer and 
discovered during hysterectomy surgery that the malignancy had spread to her 
liver and bowel. 
</P>
<P>
"The three weeks I spent at the hospital recovering from surgery, I amused 
myself by making the nurses laugh and racing up and down the halls with my IV 
stand while Gene chased me," she wrote in her book. "How could I be happy under 
the circumstances? I don't really know -- except that I discovered that I have 
a strong spirit and a powerful will to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, it was impossible for her not to feel sorry for herself when 
she became ill and her hair fell out because of chemotherapy treatment, and she 
started to introduce herself by saying, "I used to be Gilda Radner. Because 
that was how I felt -- that now I was someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Radner credited a "sprinkling of angels," including Wilder, and doctors, nurses 
and fellow cancer patients for helping her fight the disease. "Gene never gave 
up," she said. "He believed in me and never treated me like my days were 
numbered." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joined Self-Help Group 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by a psychotherapist, she joined the Wellness Community, a cancer 
self-help group in Santa Monica whose members were all fighting different 
stages of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I was learning that death is part of life," Radner wrote. "It seems to me now 
that as long as we have the gift of life, the only tragedy is to allow part of 
ourselves -- our spirit, our creativity, our glorious uniqueness -- to die." 
</P>
<P>
Radner's friends were stunned by news of her death. Aykroyd said in a 
statement, "I loved her like a sister. My thoughts are with Gene and her 
family." The current "Saturday Night Live" cast planned an immediate tribute to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Friends who attended the all-girls Liggett school with Radner in Detroit said 
the actress missed a 25th class reunion two weeks ago. "We really missed her, 
and we didn't know she was as bad as she was," said classmate Betty Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Wilder, Radner leaves her mother, Henrietta, and a brother, Michael. 
Memorial services will be private. The family requested that in lieu of flowers 
donations be sent to the Wellness Community.

SETTLEMENT STILL ELUDES BARGAINERS; TEACHER STRIKE NEARS WEEK 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON and SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The third round of bargaining talks in the Los Angeles Unified School District 
teachers' strike produced no settlement Saturday, with little time left to 
prevent the walkout from entering its second week. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where it's going to lead, but negotiations are continuing," 
school board President Roberta Weintraub said after a three-hour negotiating 
session Saturday night at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel downtown. The talks are 
scheduled to resume this afternoon and Weintraub stressed that today will be "a 
decisive day." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said: "The teachers 
want a settlement . . . but they're not willing to capitulate at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, the district school board and a council of union leaders held 
separate meetings to review bargaining positions and similar gatherings are 
planned for early today. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable sources said that both sides face risks if the strike goes into a 
second week. The union would lose some bargaining strength if a significant 
number of teachers drift back to work because of money worries. On the other 
hand, the school board would feel increased pressure for a settlement from 
angry parents and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Leonard Britton has said that a settlement would have to be 
reached by noon today for schools to be back to normal on Monday. And even if a 
contract were signed today, officials fear that it would be difficult to get 
the word of a settlement out. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the Saturday afternoon meeting of his staff at union headquarters near 
MacArthur Park, Johnson disputed an earlier pessimistic report about the 
bargaining from district negotiator Dick Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
The union chief charged that Fisher's statement that talks were not progressing 
well was calculated to scare strikers back to work. "We are making proposals 
and counterproposals," Johnson said. "How can you say that is not going well?" 
</P>
<P>
Under the supervision of a state mediator, the talks have been held on three 
consecutive nights. 
</P>
<P>
The school board, which has been sharply divided on settlement terms, met in 
closed session for about 90 minutes Saturday afternoon at the Bunker Hill 
offices of its law firm, O'Melveny &amp; Myers, to review bargaining proposals. 
No vote was taken, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Alan Gershman, leaving that meeting, compared the strike to 
a chess game in which the pawns have all been sacrificed. "The students have 
been hurt. . . . Hopefully, we are going to end soon," said Gershman, who is in 
a tough campaign for reelection in a June 6 runoff in his Westside district. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a news blackout, officials from both camps refused to give details of 
the proposals for a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Representatives on Call 
</P>
<P>
The union's House of Representatives is on call today for a ratification vote 
if a contract is ready. If a contract is approved by those representatives 
today, teachers would go back to work on Monday and hold a full membership 
ratification vote soon afterward, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
After a seven-hour bargaining session Friday, Weintraub said she was "neither 
optimistic nor pessimistic" about a quick settlement, but said she thought the 
negotiating was "getting to the point where the issues are clearly defined." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, parents are becoming increasingly upset about the strike's effect on 
their families. Some are skipping work or taking their children along to their 
jobs rather than send them to understaffed campuses. According to the district, 
more than 600 parents have called the district urging a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Student attendance dropped drastically during the week, as youngsters wearied 
of substitutes and a diet of movies and makeshift readings. On Friday, only 
259,128 of the 594,000 district students were at the morning attendance roll. 
About two-thirds of the district's 32,000 teachers, nurses, counselors and 
librarians remained on strike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Strikers Expected 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Johnson said he expected some attrition in the number of strikers 
if the walkout goes into a second week. But he added that he had "no doubt that 
the strike will remain strong." 
</P>
<P>
The talks are surrounded by uncertainty about how much of an enormous state tax 
windfall over the next two years will be available to raise teachers' pay. 
Other issues include the elimination of school yard duties for elementary 
school teachers and the formation of school governing councils on which 
teachers would have a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
The last publicly announced position from the district offered an 8% 
retroactive raise for this year, between 5.5% and 8% next year depending on 
funds from the state surplus, and 8% the following year. The union's last 
public position was for annual raises of 10%, 8% and 8% over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Starting pay for Los Angeles teachers is $23,440 and the current top is $43,319 
although some teachers earn more for extracurricular duties and teaching summer 
school. A state fact-finder's report, released this week and angrily denounced 
by the union, described that range as among the best in the state. The report 
supported many of the district's positions.

HUNDREDS RALLY BEHIND BEIJING PROTESTERS; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. SCENE OF A 'LONG MARCH' OF SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks ago, little more than a dozen Chinese students studying at Cal Tech 
marched in front of the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles. Scrawled on reams of 
computer paper were their benign slogans: Human rights. Freedom. Reform. 
</P>
<P>
Some wore paper bags over their heads to conceal their identities from Chinese 
officials. They said many more students wanted to show support for thousands of 
protesting students in Beijing but feared government reprisals. That was before 
the Chinese government declared martial law in several central areas of Beijing 
last week and brought in troops to quell dissent. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, almost 1,000 chanting Chinese students from across Southern 
California strode through the streets of Chinatown, past City Hall and back to 
the consulate in the mid-Wilshire area. They carried pictures of a 
blood-drooling Deng Xiaoping. "Tyrant" was stamped on the Chinese leader's 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open Letter 
</P>
<P>
Students, some coming from as far away as Arizona, chanted "Down with fascism!" 
They demanded that consulate officials telefax an open letter to China calling 
for the government to resign and to refrain from using violence against 
hundreds of thousands of people filling the streets of Beijing in the biggest 
challenge to the state's legitimacy since its birth in a bloody civil war 40 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Anger, hope and anxiety were voiced, in organized dissent and individual 
reflections, as Southern California's sprawling Chinese community closely 
followed the drama unfolding in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
One protester said that the majority of the students view their country's 
political system as a terrible failure. 
</P>
<P>
"The government is in control now, but no one knows how long. An hour? A day? 
No one thinks it can last more than a year," said Bing Xiao, who arrived for 
the march on a bus chartered by students at the UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
They piled signs saying "Communism is not for people but to oppress people" and 
"Democracy by force" outside the building where the consulate occupies a 
third-floor suite of offices. Officials inside had no comment, but students 
said they were told that their letter would be passed on. 
</P>
<P>
Two UCLA students left for China on Friday to tell the thousands of citizens 
filling Tian An Men Square in Beijing that they are supported by many of the 
estimated 40,000 Chinese students studying in the United States. Student 
leaders said they raised $2,000 to give to an illegal student newspaper in 
Beijing. A collection box was filled with $20 and $10 bills. 
</P>
<P>
Passing motorists waved "V" salutes, and workers at City Hall clapped as the 
several-block-long line of students passed. 
</P>
<P>
Some sang the Chinese national anthem, composed in the 1930s as a rallying cry 
against Japanese occupation. A Christian group sang "We Shall Overcome." 
</P>
<P>
There was something of a festive atmosphere as couples mugged for snapshots 
with their banners. But the tone was serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us two or three days ago were very optimistic. But with martial law, 
we can't predict what will happen," said Xiao. 
</P>
<P>
Said one protester: "We were told that with communism everyone has free speech, 
a good job. The concept in my mind is very pretty. That's not what it's like in 
China." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Executives Gather 
</P>
<P>
Across town, a sedate group of business executives gathered in a Chinese 
restaurant in Monterey Park to support the protests. Sipping tea, members of 
the Taiwan Benevolent Assn. of California discussed ways to aid the students 
protesting at home and in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to help them reform entirely their political system; changing a 
little bit won't help," said T. C. Wang, a former general in the Nationalist 
Chinese forces that retreated to Taiwan in 1949. "I think they will succeed in 
the long run." 
</P>
<P>
A visiting Chinese scholar was more circumspect. When Ding Shisun, president of 
Beijing University, showed up at a downtown hotel for a long-planned banquet, 
several students pleaded with him to join the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Saying it was a time for calmness, he declined. "I am 60 years old and about to 
leave the stage of history," he said in his speech. "I hope when I step down 
that I will see all the people pushing forward for the country. There is 
corruption in China and there is corruption in (Beijing) University." 
</P>
<P>
But one older merchant in Chinatown, who didn't want to be named, thought the 
government had made enough changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a big family. Not easy to control. I think the students are overacting," 
he said in a curio-filled shop on North Broadway. "You can't change too much. . 
. . The students are asking for too much democracy." 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the ultimate outcome, many Chinese-Americans praised the 
protesters' courage. 
</P>
<P>
"They're ready to risk their lives. I think everyone overseas is very touched 
by it," said Steven Hsu, an engineer shopping in a Chinese market. "All they 
want is just more freedom. It's a very simple thing: basic human rights."

INDIANS, TOWN FEUD: 'WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?'

PARKER, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Pat Beaver has trouble at her motel in this square-mile outpost along the 
Colorado River, the local police department refuses to respond. She has to call 
nearby Indian tribal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
When Luana Miller rousts a disorderly drunk from her Red Pony Saloon down the 
street, she has to know the ancestry of the scoundrel before she knows which 
police agency to summon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty volatile situation in my business," she grumbles. 
</P>
<P>
These days, nobody's sure who runs Parker -- the townspeople or the neighboring 
Colorado River Indian Tribes. Two police departments patrol the town. Some 
stores collect sales tax, some don't. Some restaurants receive health 
inspections, some don't. 
</P>
<P>
The town of 2,800 is surrounded by the independent, sovereign Indian 
reservation, and about one-third of the lots in town -- including Beaver's Kofa 
Inn -- are also on reservation land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ruled 'Indian Country' 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a federal judge recently ruled at the behest of the Indians that 
Parker was "Indian Country," and part of the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Now the tribes, which share a 47% unemployment rate and are eager for 
aggressive economic development, want a say in town government. 
</P>
<P>
Townspeople are furious. 
</P>
<P>
"People bought this land (in town) thought they were buying a part of the 
United States, and they think they are part of the United States. But that's 
what the judge ruled -- they aren't," said Parker Mayor Sam Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The clash of cultures has been anything but peaceful over the years, and both 
sides say it has held back economic development. 
</P>
<P>
After Parker police fatally shot two Indians in separate 1987 incidents, tribal 
police began following the city officers, and the city police chief described 
the situation as "explosive." Federal mediators helped defuse some of the 
tension. 
</P>
<P>
The reservation -- made up of Mojave, Chemehuevi, Navajo and Hopi Indians -- 
launched a boycott of Davis' hardware store in Parker, and in April the tribes 
bought some city land and opened their own hardware store. It's nearly twice 
the size of Davis', and customers -- Indian and non-Indian alike -- don't have 
to pay sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Store Goes Off Tax Roll 
</P>
<P>
The hardware-store land also went off the city tax roll and will become 
reservation, tribal attorney William Lavell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians said they don't want to take over the town -- all they want is more 
respect from townspeople. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize we have to work with the town in order to have peace in the 
community," said Lawanda Laffoon, one of three tribal representatives on a 
negotiating team trying to resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"We both realize neither one of us is going away." 
</P>
<P>
But townspeople say the tribes are after their tax money, and some say if the 
tribes take over government in Parker, many in the town will pack up and move. 
</P>
<P>
"It's conceivable but not practical," Miller said. "People like me own two 
businesses and two houses in town. You can't turn tail and run. My whole life 
is here." 
</P>
<P>
The town has spent so much fighting the legal case that lawyers' fees at one 
time amounted to 10% of the annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
While other areas along the Colorado River between California and Arizona have 
boomed with tourism developments, Parker has been left behind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dispute Hurt Us All' 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the dispute has hurt us all on both sides and we would like to 
get out of that mode, so to speak, and get on to development," said Roberta 
Hoffman, a town council member and representative to the negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
The 180,000-acre reservation that straddles the river was established in 1865; 
the town was founded six years later outside the reservation boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion about the lands took root in 1908 when Congress approved moving the 
town onto reservation land so it would be near the new railroad. 
</P>
<P>
A 1-square-mile area was carved up and sold by the government, which holds 
reservation lands in trust. One-third of the land, however, remained unsold and 
was returned to the tribes. 
</P>
<P>
The town and the tribe lived peacefully together for decades, but trouble began 
amid a local economic depression caused by a 1983 flood. 
</P>
<P>
That year, the tribes filed suit asking that Indian authorities be given 
jurisdiction over zoning on the one-third of the town that was Indian land and 
that the town be barred from denying utilities to those Indian lots. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, the suit was seen as a threat to the town's independence. The key 
question was whether Congress meant to "disestablish" the town from the 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Town Loses Battle 
</P>
<P>
In February, the town lost. U.S. District Judge Roger Strand ruled Congress did 
not separate Parker, and the town was part of the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement is so complicated that a slew of police phone numbers have to 
be posted by the phone in Miller's saloon. 
</P>
<P>
Town police can arrest only non-Indian town residents. Tribal police can 
prosecute only misdemeanors committed by Indians. Felonies by Indians become 
the domain of federal police, such as the FBI or Bureau of Indian Affairs 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if crimes are committed on Indian land within the town, only tribal police 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the town is realizing that there are economic benefits to be reaped by 
being part of an Indian reservation, which is eligible for special tax breaks 
and extra federal funding. The reservation is nearing completion of a new 
generating plant on the Colorado that could offer low-cost electricity to new 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to save money in the long run," said town Manager George Kruse. 
"Attitudes are changing. We're moving in the right direction now. . . . The 
lawsuit was the catalyst and the judge's ruling was the reality." 
</P>
<P>
But others, like Mayor Davis, said the only permanent solution will have to 
come from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress should finish doing what it didn't do in 1908. If it didn't 
disestablish the town, then it should do it now," he said.

BAKER SAYS U.S. SHOULDN'T BE SEEN AS 'SOMEHOW INCITING TO RIOT'; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH PLANS TO DEAL WITH CRISIS IN CHINA GINGERLY AND AT ARM'S LENGTH

<P>
The Bush Administration served notice Saturday that it will avoid making any 
strong statements of support that might encourage the Chinese demonstrations 
for democracy, in effect rejecting calls from congressmen to have the United 
States give moral support to the movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that we should in any way be seen to be somehow inciting to 
riot," Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a news conference in 
Kennebunkport, Me. " . . . I don't think it's in the best interest of the 
United States for us to see significant instability (in China)." 
</P>
<P>
Another senior official said the Bush Administration is afraid of giving the 
Chinese demonstrators the wrong impression that the United States would be able 
to help them. In 1957, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Administration called for the 
"liberation of captive nations," although he had offered no tangible help while 
an uprising against Hungary's Communist regime was suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be prudent enough not to lead (Chinese) people to think that we 
have power over the situation, when we don't," explained one Administration 
official. "This is a Chinese event. We (the United States) want to stand 
outside it. We will condemn the use of force and specific violations of human 
rights when they occur." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issues New Travel Warning 
</P>
<P>
The State Department issued a new warning Saturday on travel to China, advising 
Americans to defer any plans to travel to the country for the next three days. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a resolution 
which endorsed the Chinese demonstrators' call for democracy. On Saturday, 
William C. Triplett II, a Republican staff member for the committee, criticized 
the Administration for what he called weak statements on the events in China. 
</P>
<P>
"The Congress is in sympathy with the forces of democracy," he said. "It's time 
for the Administration to follow the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Asked at his news conference why the United States is not encouraging the 
Chinese demonstrators, Baker replied: "I think we should be expressing our 
support for freedom of speech, for democratization and for freedom of assembly. 
And that's what we're doing. I do not think that we should in any way be seen 
to be somehow inciting to riot, and I think that we have to be appropriate in 
our response. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that reform (in China) has to proceed apace. . . . What may be 
happening here is that the economic reforms in China got out a little bit ahead 
of the political reforms," the secretary observed. 
</P>
<P>
One factor underlying the Bush Administration's reticence in commenting on the 
Chinese situation is uncertainty over what will happen. In simplest terms, U.S. 
officials don't know yet how successful the Chinese demonstrators will be. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Kind of Revolution? 
</P>
<P>
"The real question is whether we are talking about a revolution with a small r 
or a big one," one Administration official said. "Are we talking about the kind 
of revolution that just leads to a minor change in the government or to one on 
the order of the French Revolution?" 
</P>
<P>
"There is such a thing as crushing a movement," said a U.S. official who 
specializes in Asian affairs. "How well is the democracy movement doing in 
Burma these days? The optimist in me says China has gone beyond that point, but 
I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
(Last summer, Burmese authorities called in troops and used force to suppress 
widespread demonstrations for democracy.) 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is the U.S. government's reluctance to do or say anything that 
would disturb the military and intelligence cooperation between the United 
States and China. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported in 1981 that two U.S.-equipped intelligence stations, manned 
by Chinese technicians, had been installed in western China to monitor Soviet 
missile firings. Those intelligence stations were built to substitute for the 
electronic listening posts in northern Iran that were lost as a result of the 
Iranian revolution in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the United States and China have also carried out a 
long series of consultations and exchanges on defense matters. 
</P>
<P>
Leading officials of China's People's Liberation Army have made visits to the 
Pentagon, and senior Defense Department officials have toured army 
installations in China. A 1983 visit to China by then-Defense Secretary Caspar 
W. Weinberger cleared the way for these military ties.

Thousands of Chinese college students staged raucous protests Saturday from San 
Francisco to New York in support of the pro-democracy uprising in their 
homeland, chanting slogans and carrying banners reading "Freedom or Death." 
</P>
<P>
"We are all supporting the students in China. They are heroes," Lewis Lu, a 
business student at UC Berkeley, said during a rally in San Francisco that 
included a meeting with Chinese consular officials. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations also were held in Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Paul, Minn., 
Washington and New York. No arrests were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The protests followed the declaration Saturday of martial law for urban Beijing 
by Chinese Premier Li Peng in response to huge demonstrations there, considered 
the largest challenge to the nation's Communist rule since its founding in 
1949. 
</P>
<P>
But hundreds of thousands of people continued to swarm through the streets of 
China's capital in defiance of martial law and in support of the students who 
have led the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is host to an estimated 40,000 students from China. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest demonstrations in this country took place in Washington, 
where about 3,500 students marched on China's embassy, shouting "Down with 
martial law!" and "Freedom now!" Some were natives of Taiwan or Hong Kong, but 
the vast majority were citizens of mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of final examinations going on at many schools, students came from 
Cornell, Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Brandeis, Duke, New York and Johns Hopkins 
universities and the universities of Virginia, California, Pennsylvania and 
Pittsburgh, as well as several schools in the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to show our support for other people who are fighting for our freedom, 
and to show our own government that its position is wrong," said Qiao Chunming 
of Shanghai, a student at Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a critical time for our nation," said Chen Dingju, 27, a graduate student 
in applied mathematics from Cornell University, who drove from Ithaca, N.Y., 
for the protest. "China is now a changed China, and the people have changed. 
Western culture has influenced us." 
</P>
<P>
Min Tao, 40, who is studying for a post-doctoral degree in biochemistry at the 
University of Maryland in Baltimore, said she wants her country "to have 
democracy. . . . Our leaders won't step down because they are dictators." 
</P>
<P>
Zhang Amei, 37, a former Red Guard now studying economics at Yale, said she and 
other young people were "fooled by Mao." 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 students rallied near the Chinese Consulate in Chicago, 
chanting, "Down with Li Peng, up with freedom!" 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Grant Park, they placed a sign reading, "Beijing, We Hear You. Do 
You Hear Us?" at the feet of a statue of Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Among the demonstrators was Huang Ciping, 26, who drove with about 20 others 
from the University of Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an emergency call," she said. "I told my boss I couldn't stay (at work) 
any longer because my country is in emergency status." 
</P>
<P>
Others flocked to the Chicago demonstration from Purdue, Marquette, Illinois 
State and Michigan State universities and the universities of Notre Dame, 
Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana and Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, about 1,000 demonstrators, many wearing white headbands, held 
a rally at the Chinese Consulate, then marched to Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
They jabbed the air with signs in Chinese and English carrying such messages as 
"A Billion People, One Press" and "Freedom or Death." One placard compared 
senior leader Deng Xiaoping to Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Cars crawling through snarled traffic honked in support. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of the protesters were allowed into the Chinese Consulate to meet 
with officials.

RIOT TROOPS BLOCK SEOUL PROTEST; 1,000 ARRESTED

Riot police broke up protests and arrested more than 1,000 people Saturday 
after the South Korean government deployed 17,000 troopers to block a rally by 
dissidents calling for the fall of President Roh Tae Woo. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of riot troopers in combat fatigues and black helmets flooded central 
Seoul, conducting street checks for radical supporters and guarding key 
government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Police charged hundreds of protesters who tried to block streets and chant 
anti-government slogans in the city center. Struggling protesters were taken 
away on buses. Police said more than 1,000 people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"Punish Roh Tae Woo!" and "Drive out the Yankees!" protesters yelled. 
</P>
<P>
About 120 students courted arrest by lying down in one main street with their 
arms and legs interlocked. Police hauled the students away as other protesters 
screamed abuse, but there were no clashes. 
</P>
<P>
Riot police also blocked protests in the cities of Chonju, Sungnam and Taegu. 
Small protest marches were allowed in eight other cities after organizers 
obtained police permission. 
</P>
<P>
The United National Democratic Movement, the nation's main dissident alliance, 
had called for a major protest in Seoul to push for President Roh's downfall 
and to mark the anniversary of a May, 1980, uprising in the southern city of 
Kwangju. 
</P>
<P>
Police banned the Seoul rally on grounds that it was a threat to public order. 
</P>
<P>
In other protests, about 500 people marched in Kwangju to call for Roh's fall. 
The march was blocked by about 2,000 riot police in the city's main square, and 
the protesters hurled eggs and rocks at troopers. 
</P>
<P>
The Kwangju protest was the smallest since daily protests began May 11 to mark 
the anniversary's uprising. Crowds estimated at up to 100,000 took part in 
protests there last week.

MARCOS REPORTED MORE ALERT BUT STILL GRAVELY ILL

Deposed Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, gravely ill after suffering 
kidney, cardiac and pulmonary failure, was conscious and more alert Saturday 
but was still barely clinging to life, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos is now able to understand instructions and to communicate with doctors 
with hand signals, said Gene Tiwanak, assistant administrator at St. Francis 
Hospital. But because of Marcos' extremely weakened condition, the prognosis is 
still poor, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a sign of improvement," Tiwanak added. "He is rallying. That's a 
positive statement. But being in extremely critical condition, he could also go 
the other way." 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, 71, exiled here with his family since February, 1986, remains attached 
to a respirator and a dialysis machine, which cleanses the blood. He is being 
treated with heart medication and antibiotics for a fever and massive 
infection, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
The former president's wife, Imelda, their son and other relatives as well as 
staff remained in or near the hospital most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, who ruled for 20 years before being ousted during a popular uprising 
amid charges of election fraud and plundering millions from the country's 
coffers, has spent the last four months in the hospital, where he was admitted 
for pneumonia, bronchial asthma and congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has been on a "medical roller coaster" according to Dr. Azucena 
Ignacio, an internist at St. Francis and one of 12 doctors attending Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
His condition took an extreme turn for the worse when he was rushed into 
surgery Thursday for kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos and his wife are charged with stealing $103 million from the Philippine 
treasury and fraudulently borrowing $265 million from New York banks to buy 
property and art. U.S. government prosecutors said last month that Marcos was 
too ill to stand trial on charges. His wife is free on $5-million bail.

LEADERS OF UPRISING CALL FOR REVENGE ON ISRAELIS;

LATEST LEAFLET URGES ATTACKS ON SOLDIERS, SETTLERS 'TO MAKE THE ENEMY PAY'

A day after Palestinians clashed with pursuing Israeli troops in a deadly 
shoot-out, the leadership of the Arab uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
called on its followers Saturday to take revenge on Israeli soldiers and 
settlers whenever Palestinians are killed by either. 
</P>
<P>
"From a position of self-defense and in order to make the enemy pay a high 
price for his crimes, we call on the strike forces to attack soldiers and 
settlers and to kill a soldier or settler for every martyr who falls," the 
latest leaflet of the underground leaders said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian activists say that the leaflet, one of the directives periodically 
published by the Unified National Command of the Uprising, was in the works 
before Friday, when a gun-and-grenade battle left three Palestinians and one 
Israeli soldier dead. It was the first time in the 17-month-long uprising that 
Palestinians had used firearms against Israeli soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The document responds not to that incident, activists said, but is meant to 
combat recent measures taken by Israel to put down the intifada, as the 
uprising is called. 
</P>
<P>
"The shoot-out (Friday) was not a turning point but a display of what might 
happen," said Madi Abdel Hadi, a Palestinian political analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"Looks like things are going to heat up," added Daoud Kutab, a prominent 
Palestinian spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The leaflet calls for no particular weapons to be brought into play. During the 
17 months of the intifada, anti-Israeli militants and demonstrators have 
generally limited themselves to using stones and gasoline bombs. Recently, 
however, Arabs suspected of collaborating with the Israelis have been killed 
with guns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reflects Impatience 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian observers viewed the leaflet as reflecting impatience with 
diplomacy and as a response to pressure from grass-roots organizers and 
activists who are taking the brunt of Israeli suppression. In any case, an 
eye-for-an-eye call for Israeli deaths had not been made before; it remains to 
be seen whether the forces in the field are willing to risk an escalation 
against the heavily armed Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
"We are at a crossroads," said Abdel Hadi. "Either the intifada will continue 
at the level of the past, giving time for diplomacy to develop, or else there 
will be escalation -- and we will have a Belfast." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomacy, being shepherded by the Bush Administration, is following a slow 
pace. The Administration is trying to interest the Palestine Liberation 
Organization as well as Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza in taking up an 
Israeli offer to hold elections in the occupied land. 
</P>
<P>
But both the PLO and its followers in the occupied regions want assurances that 
subsequent talks would lead to independence. Instead, Israel offers five years 
of limited self-rule and talks later on final arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Israel has put in place new military tactics designed to assert 
control over the Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza. For the past few months, the 
army and paramilitary Border Police carried out surprise raids on villages, 
made mass arrests, damaged property and on occasion engaged in clashes with 
stone-throwing residents that often ended in Arab fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
Large cities were periodically placed under curfew while troops went on similar 
roundups. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and army Chief of Staff Dan Shomron 
have come under fire for failing to quell the intifada and have taken further 
steps. Last week, the entire Gaza Strip was placed under curfew and its 600,000 
inhabitants were confined to their homes. Sporadic clashes during the past two 
weeks have left 10 Arabs dead in the Gaza Strip alone. 
</P>
<P>
Settlers, meanwhile, have set up vigilante groups to retaliate for stone 
throwing. The settlers mainly vandalize Palestinian property, but there have 
been instances of Arab deaths at the hands of the vigilantes. 
</P>
<P>
The run of casualties and arrests have angered grass-roots militants who feel 
that their hands are tied by the limited tactics of the intifada. Graffiti have 
appeared on walls of several towns calling for "armed resistance," and factions 
of the Palestinian resistance groups have issued their own leaflets calling for 
greater violence. 
</P>
<P>
One grouping, called the Abu Jihad Brigades, began to lobby for escalation as 
early as February.

A team of six mediators struggling to bring peace to Lebanon will launch a 
high-level Arab diplomatic effort today to try to enforce a cease-fire and 
deploy truce observers. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Sudan, Tunisia and the United 
Arab Emirates are following up an Arab League initiative to end some of the 
heaviest shelling in Lebanon's civil war and secure a political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
They were to join the other Arab League foreign ministers later today in two 
days of preparations for an emergency summit covering Lebanon, Palestine and 
Middle East peace moves. 
</P>
<P>
The kings, presidents and emirs are also expected to give their seal of 
approval to the two-state solution adopted by the Palestine Liberation 
Organization at a landmark session of the Palestine National Council in Algiers 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, a 10-day-old cease-fire mediated by the league has largely held 
after two months of savage battles between the mainly Christian troops of the 
army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, and Syrian forces and their Muslim and 
leftist allies.

3 REGIME FOES DEFY PANAMA'S BAN ON RALLIES

<P>
The three top opposition leaders defied a ban on rallies and marched through 
the streets of the Panamanian capital on Saturday, their first public 
appearance since they were physically assaulted after the May 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
And late Friday, U.S. officials reported that the government had released 15 
Panamanians employed to provide security at U.S. Embassy offices. Two 
Panamanians are still being detained. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and vice presidential 
candidates Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo (Billy) Ford were beaten up on 
May 10 by paramilitary forces of strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The government Saturday prohibited "marches, meetings, public demonstrations or 
caravans of vehicles" by any political organization until at least June 5. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Endara, "The prohibition does not have any meaning to us." The 
politician spoke as he made his way through an outdoor market in San Miguelito 
on the capital's eastern outskirts. The stop was one of six made by a caravan 
of about 20 opposition vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blocked Traffic 
</P>
<P>
The caravan briefly blocked traffic on some major routes. Police watched but 
took no action. 
</P>
<P>
Endara said the caravan was designed "to thank the people for their support May 
7." 
</P>
<P>
Independent observers say the opposition candidates were leading the 
Noriega-picked government candidates in the national election two weeks ago 
when Noriega's troops seized election ballots. The results of the election have 
been annulled by the government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Violence Probe 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government said the 17 security guard personnel were questioned 
as part of an investigation into the May 10 violence. 
</P>
<P>
Those detained work for Tesna Protective Services, an American firm that 
operates in Panama under the name Memsa. The company provides by contract about 
80 employees who serve as security personnel for U.S. diplomatic offices. They 
are not employees of the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Alexis Guerra, a bodyguard of Ford, was killed in the May 10 violence, and 
another, Humberto Montenegro, was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Guerra was a Tesna-Memsa employee, on leave from the company. Montenegro had 
been employed by Tesna-Memsa until early this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Response to Visit 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Government and Justice issued a communique saying the 
prohibition on demonstrations was in response to the upcoming visit by 
delegates from the Organization of American States. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago, 
accompanied by OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, are due in Panama on 
Tuesday. They will try to promote resolution of Panama's 15-month-old 
government crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The organization on Wednesday approved a resolution critical of Gen Noriega, 
the commander of the Panama Defense Forces and the effective ruler of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since February, 1988, when he 
was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in Florida. Noriega has survived 
economic sanctions and international pressure, accusing the United States of 
seeking to scrap a treaty that will give Panama full control and supervision of 
the Panama Canal by the end of the century.

KIRIBATI'S PRESIDENT TABAI STRESSES SELF-RELIANCE; 
</P>
<P>
LEADER OF PACIFIC ISLAND STATE MARCHES TO OWN DRUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
TARAWA, Kiribati 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a sultry equatorial afternoon, Ieremia Tabai welcomes guests to his 
presidential office. He is dressed in a pinstriped shirt, shorts and bare feet. 
He exudes quiet confidence and a down-to-earth pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
In a decade of leadership, such traits have made Kiribati's president one of 
the most respected of the Pacific Island leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Where many resource-poor island nations have become dependent on infusions of 
foreign aid, Tabai still bangs the drum of self-reliance. "It is better to 
subsist on your own than to rely on someone. It is hard for the people. But I 
am convinced we can do it," the bearded leader said. 
</P>
<P>
Many might consider Tabai's optimism unrealistic. In addition to typical 
problems of crowded, typhoon-prone island nations lying thousands of miles from 
major markets, the Republic of Kiribati (pronounced Kiribass) has its share of 
unique development hurdles: 
</P>
<P>
* The size of Kiribati poses challenges for transportation, communication and 
government management. The micro-state consists of 65,000 people living on 33 
coral island specks strewn across an ocean area as wide as the continental 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1979, when it gained independence from Britain, Kiribati lost its largest 
revenue source when mining of phosphate ore from Banaba Island ceased because 
of a dispute with landowners. Government income was halved and export earnings 
fell 80%. The nation was left with coconuts and fish as exports. 
</P>
<P>
* Scientists are now warning that rising sea levels, due to the so-called 
greenhouse effect, could flood low-lying atolls. Kiribati could become a nation 
of "environmental refugees." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Tabai insists Kiribati will overcome these hurdles. His attitude is 
typified by his now legendary refusal of certain aid. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he canceled a multimillion-dollar British aid agreement. He decided to 
curb spending rather than to continue reliance on foreign handouts to subsidize 
the government's recurring operational costs. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Tabai gave politely declined Australia's offer to give 20 cars for 
chauffeuring regional leaders when they gather in Tarawa for this year's South 
Pacific Forum meeting in July. "It's embarrassing for me to receive Bob Hawke 
in my country in his car. I prefer to receive them in a car I've bought 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Tabai has a commerce degree from Victoria University in Wellington, New 
Zealand, and keeps a tight hold on his nation's purse strings. Government 
spending has been slashed, in real terms, by 5% a year since 1979. But spending 
is still more than the revenue from the nation's limited sources. Budgetary 
shortfalls are covered by interest from the $148 million in the Revenue 
Equalization Reserve Fund. The fund, an accumulation of phosphate royalties, 
has been praised as a model for developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
But the loss of the phosphate exports has meant Kiribati runs a trade deficit 
of $8 million to $16 million annually. To boost exports, Kiribati is developing 
small businesses, such as garment making -- something other island states have 
done successfully. And efforts are under way to curb food imports, as sweet 
aromas from the new Tarawa Biscuit factory attest. "Already it's producing 60% 
of local requirements," Tabai boasts. 
</P>
<P>
But economic growth since independence has been sluggish, at best. A 
government-funded fishing company has struggled to break even. Yet, Tabai 
remains confident. He's excited about an Italian developer's plans to build a 
$160-million resort complex on Fanning Island -- possibly breaking ground next 
year. Apart from a few sports fishermen, not many tourists visit Kiribati. The 
Fanning Island project could put this out-of-the-way nation on travelers' maps. 
</P>
<P>
And Tabai hopes to restart the phosphate mines. He recently reached a verbal 
agreement with landowners on Banaba. "If all goes well, we will start mining 
again next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, royalty payments from foreign boats fishing in Kiribati waters 
have generated some funds -- and controversy. In 1985, Tabai shocked Washington 
and Canberra by giving the Soviet Union fishing access rights. It was the 
Soviets' first island toehold in a region long dominated by Western interests. 
The agreement lapsed after a year, when Tabai refused to lower access fees. But 
for the right price, he said, the Soviets would be welcome back.

TOPEKA TRIES OUT LIVE DRAMA IN CRIME FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
ROBBERS STAR LOSERS ON 'RADIO C.O.P.' 
</P>

<P>
It may not have the machine-gun sound effects of the "Gangbusters" radio show 
of the 1930s, but a local experiment in radio crime drama appears to be 
working, both for listeners and the police. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to alert businesses of robberies in progress because some robbers rob 
more than one place in one day," said Sgt. Richard Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
That desire led to the Radio C.O.P. -- Call Our Police -- shows that five local 
stations have aired since Feb. 1. Some Topeka broadcasters say the joint effort 
of police and commercial radio is the first of its kind in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It also tells other would-be robbers or the robber that your description is 
being broadcast out over radio for everyone to be looking for you," said 
Johnson, a detective in charge of Radio C.O.P. 
</P>
<P>
Radio C.O.P. allows Topeka police to broadcast, between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., 
descriptions of robbers minutes after a business robbery occurs. The bulletins 
usually last no longer than 60 seconds. Listeners are warned to take no action 
beyond calling police if they think they see the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
It is too early to say for sure if Radio C.O.P. has had an effect, Johnson 
said. Officials at several radio stations, however, say listeners like the 
bulletins. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of exciting for the listener when it comes on," said Dave Alexander, 
program manager for WIBW-FM, a "fairly music-intensive hit-oriented station." 
</P>
<P>
"It has that kind of instant effect: Somebody is at large right now. You think 
Eliot Ness might jump out at any time, going after the bad guys," Alexander 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great program. It's a great service for the community," said 
Chuck Urban, program director at KHUM-FM, an adult contemporary station. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Radio C.O.P., a robber is "not only going to have the police on his 
tail, but every station in town is going to be broadcasting what he just did," 
Urban said. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps us know what's going on and we can let the listeners know what's 
going on," said Cynthia Bervert, news director at KTPK-FM, a modern country 
station. 
</P>
<P>
It all starts with Johnson, who monitors the police radio for robbery calls. 
</P>
<P>
"I will write that information down, then call each radio station and give them 
the information, which they in turn interrupt their normal broadcasting to 
deliver," Johnson said. "Our response time is less than 15 minutes" and he said 
he makes the calls only when he has a good description of the robber. 
</P>
<P>
Since April 4, the Radio C.O.P. bulletins have also been routed over two-way 
radios to the 400 utility company workers out on the streets at any one time, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Topeka police have other crime-prevention programs in place so it is hard to 
determine the impact of Radio C.O.P., he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have one success story to my knowledge," Johnson said. "We did link one 
description of the robbery car by a person who heard it on the radio," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do get better descriptions of people" because the bulletins make citizens 
more aware of what is happening around them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, Johnson said: "We've only had one incident of two robberies by 
the same person on the same day," and that was when the program was new and 
generally unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe major-market radio stations don't like to get involved in that kind of 
thing. Some people might say it sounds too hokey or too dumb. I think if people 
see results out of this type of program, it will spread to other communities," 
Urban said. 
</P>
<P>
The Radio C.O.P. bulletins are so short and infrequent that they are only a 
minor interruption to normal programming, Alexander said.

COAST GUARD'S OIL TANKER TRACKING SAFE, OFFICER SAYS 
</P>

Coast Guard personnel ceased physically plotting the movement of ships in the 
area where the Exxon Valdez ran aground after a new radar system was installed 
in 1984, the Coast Guard commander in Valdez testified Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But Cmdr. Steven McCall told federal investigators that the change, and a 
reduction in staff three years later, would not have compromised safety for 
tanker traffic at the site of the nation's worst oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
McCall made his statements on the fifth and final day of a National 
Transportation Safety Board hearing on the March 24 grounding of the 987-foot 
Exxon tanker in Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard's ability to monitor traffic in the sound has come under 
scrutiny since the ship spilled about 11 million gallons of North Slope crude 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
Safety board officials, who heard earlier last week from Exxon representatives, 
some tanker crew members, state officials and others, have said they will not 
complete their report for several months. 
</P>
<P>
McCall said the new radar system has functions that make it unnecessary to 
physically plot ship movements. He said the Coast Guard traffic station in 
Valdez had some staff cuts in 1987 and some duties were reassigned, but it did 
not pose any major problems. 
</P>
<P>
Ship monitors testified last week that they could not see the Exxon tanker on 
radar in the minutes before it ran aground and had no indication that it was in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
McCall said the radar system has a range of up to 20 miles, but the range 
varies with the weather. 
</P>
<P>
McCall also confirmed that the tanker did not have the Coast Guard's permission 
to leave normal traffic lanes. Normally, a tanker's crew is supposed to ask for 
such permission. Members of the ship's crew have said they left the lanes to 
avoid ice, and acknowledged that permission had not been asked. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony Saturday, McCall said there was no reason for him to take 
over response to the Exxon oil spill soon after it happened, because resources 
to deal with the spill were not on hand. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no benefit to be derived from me taking it over," he said. Response 
immediately after the accident was handled by Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., an 
industry consortium that manages the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and Valdez 
marine terminal. 
</P>
<P>
McCall said that the use of oil-dispersing chemicals was discussed soon after 
the accident occurred. But he told investigators that Alyeska had in stock less 
dispersant than would have been needed to significantly reduce damage caused by 
the spill.

A charging Alaska brown bear was shot and killed by an Exxon cleanup crew 
working to remove oil from park shorelines fouled by the Exxon Valdez oil 
spill, the National Park Service reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal agencies were investigating the shooting, Park Service 
spokesman John Quinley said. It is against the law to shoot bears in national 
parks except in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Quinley said witnesses reported that the brown bear was shot Friday in Katmai 
National Park at a distance of 16 feet as the crew members tried to capture an 
eagle that had oil on it.

Swedish police have detained 15 people of Arab extraction suspected of 
involvement in bomb attacks against a Copenhagen synagogue and airline office 
in 1985, police sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 were rounded up last week by security police from different parts of 
Sweden and taken to Stockholm for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Police said several had connections to the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command, which has been named by U.S. intelligence as being 
behind last December's bombing of a Pan Am jet in which 270 people died.

A man about to take his turn at the California Lottery's giant "Big Spin" wheel 
Saturday took a moment first to propose to his girlfriend, who was cheering him 
on from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Pack, 32, a construction worker from Ontario, slipped an engagement ring 
on Sandy Silva's finger, then spun the wheel -- to win $1 million. Pack was 
joined on the stage by Silva, who said "yes." Pack said he will use his money 
to "pay off the ring, pay for the wedding and honeymoon and start on a house 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it hasn't quite sunk in," he said. "I was so excited about her 
saying yes, the million hasn't sunk in." 
</P>
<P>
Pack was one of four people who became millionaires. The others were Helen 
Cunningham, 64, Long Beach; Richard Pruneau, 26, Thousand Oaks, and Norma 
Arebalos, 26, Fresno.

LAST OF SANTA ANA JAIL ESCAPEES CAUGHT TRYING TO SELL GEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK and MARK LANDSBAUM, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The inmate who last year allegedly masterminded one of the largest jailbreaks 
in Orange County history was arrested Saturday in Rapid City, S.D., while 
trying to pawn diamonds that law enforcement believe came from a Chicago 
jewelry store heist. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Douglas Taylor, 35, was the last to be captured of the five inmates who 
escaped from Orange County Jail Nov. 20 by rappelling from the top of the 
four-story building in downtown Santa Ana. One of the men broke his leg and was 
captured immediately. Another turned himself in on Thanksgiving Day, and two 
more were captured two weeks later by FBI agents in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who was using the alias Michael Anthony Prescott, was captured by 
police exactly six months to the day after he broke out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credit for Television 
</P>
<P>
FBI agent Bucky Cox credited the Fox network television program America's Most 
Wanted for producing the first significant tip to Taylor's whereabouts. After 
the May 7 broadcast showed a photograph of Taylor, FBI agents were told that he 
was using the alias Prescott, carrying a Nevada driver's license and traveling 
in a van with his wife, Lisa, and their children, a boy, 6, and a girl, 2. The 
tipster also said Taylor was living in Portland, Me. 
</P>
<P>
When agents checked the address in Portland, Taylor had already left. 
</P>
<P>
Agents put all the new information about Taylor into the National Criminal 
Information Center network. That told police that the Michael Prescott who was 
trying to sell diamonds to a pawn shop dealer in Rapid City on Saturday was 
really Michael Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid City Police Sgt. David Walton said Taylor's wife, their two children, and 
another unidentified man who was with Taylor when he was arrested were all 
taken to the police department. Walton said he expected that Lisa Taylor would 
be arrested on suspicion of harboring a fugitive. The man, who was not 
identified, was being questioned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Taylor has a history of crime. He was suspected of more than two 
dozen robberies in Southern California when he allegedly led the jailbreak last 
November. Police said that since then, Taylor is suspected of numerous jewelry 
store heists in Chicago, his home town. He was also wanted on a federal 
fugitive warrant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Southland Robberies 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Jim Barry said he has connected Taylor to at least 
10 robberies committed in 1988. In Huntington Beach last year, Taylor entered 
Designer Jewelers with two accomplices and stole more than $100,000 in gems, 
according to court records. When Taylor was arrested for that robbery, an 
officer involved in the arrest wrote, "Given a chance, he will escape." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities attributed dozens of armed robberies of jewelry stores to Taylor 
last year in Los Angeles and Orange counties. They say the stones and gold 
taken in the holdups may total $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor had made the list of the FBI' 10 most-wanted fugitives. Police searching 
his home on Puget Sound found a photograph of him posing in front of an FBI 
poster with his mug shot. An earlier newspaper story about Taylor said he has a 
reputation as a self-confident thrill seeker who has been an extraordinarily 
successful outlaw because he is also cunning and a perfectionist.

Neither an aching arm nor a gusting wind could keep Danny Sullivan from 
qualifying Saturday for the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, ignoring the pain and discomfort caused by his broken right forearm, 
was the fastest of the day's five qualifiers for the May 28 race, turning a 
10-mile, four-lap average of 216.027 m.p.h. with a fast lap of 216.753. 
</P>
<P>
Two more positions in the 33-car field will be filled with six more hours of 
time trials scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's effort was nowhere near the record-smashing performances last Sunday 
of Penske Racing teammates Rick Mears and Al Unser, who qualified at the front 
of the tentative lineup. But Sullivan, the 1985 Indy winner, was satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big relief," he said. "It's a big burden off my shoulders. I was 
concerned if I could go that fast, now I'm just relieved." 
</P>
<P>
As Sullivan posed for pictures in the pits after his qualifying run, his crew, 
behind the defending CART-PPG Indy car champion, grabbed cloth slings from 
their pockets and put them on without Sullivan noticing. When he turned away 
from the camera, the 1985 Indy winner broke up at the sight. 
</P>
<P>
Laughs did not appear to be in his immediate future when the 39-year-old driver 
from Louisville, Ky., crashed during practice here on May 11, sustaining a mild 
concussion and a broken right forearm. 
</P>
<P>
The broken ulna was put back together and held in place with a metal plate and 
seven screws and Sullivan got back onto the track Thursday with the help of a 
special brace designed to keep his arm from twisting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still modifying the seat and steering and Dr. (Terry) Trammel will 
continue working with me on modifying the brace," Sullivan said. "Hopefully, 
with eight days more rest, we'll be strong enough to run 500 miles." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the arm hurt, Sullivan said, "Oh yeah, there's going to be pain for a 
long time. But when you're out here running around on the speedway the pain 
seems to go away." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan started with a lap of 214.715 then turned three consecutive laps 
around the 2 1/2-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway oval at more than 216 in his 
new Chevrolet-powered Penske PC18. 
</P>
<P>
"I had messed up in turn two," he said of the first lap. "The wind was blowing 
across the track. I knew it wasn't a good lap. 
</P>
<P>
"I adjusted something in the cockpit on the backstretch. The car felt 
comfortable after that. I wasn't particularly surprised by the increase. I was 
surprised by how much it was." 
</P>
<P>
Once the field is full the slowest cars can be bumped by faster qualifiers. The 
fastest 33 cars by the end of Sunday's session, 4 p.m. PDT, will start the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Dominic Dobson opened the qualifying Saturday with a consistent four-lap run of 
213.590, with a fast lap of 213.731 and a slow lap of 213.397. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Krueger was next at 212.458, followed by Sullivan and 1986 runner-up Kevin 
Cogan at 214.569. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Lazier, whose father Bob drove at Indy, escaped injury when he spun and 
hit the wall in turn two. Later, Steve Saleen spun in turn four and slammed 
into the wall virtually head-on. He was awake and alert, but had to be helped 
from the car and was expected to stay overnight Saturday at Methodist Hospital 
for further examination with back pain.

IT'S NEVER EASY: DODGERS WIN IN THE 10TH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It has been this kind of season for Orel Hershiser: Any time he gives up only 
two runs, his earned-run average soars, and the Dodgers usually lose. 
</P>
<P>
And his catcher will tell you that Hershiser "struggled all day." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser is a victim of heightened expectations, the result of his Cy Young 
Award season in 1988 and a good start this season. 
</P>
<P>
So it was that Hershiser, having given up a ninth-inning homer to Tim Raines 
Saturday, was able to count his blessings after such an outing, a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a most fortunate victory," he said after Mike Scioscia's run-scoring 
single in the 10th inning rescued him and gave the Dodgers a 3-2 victory over 
the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser (6-3) knows, as does any pitcher on this staff, that giving up two 
runs is about the same thing as surrender. A couple of weeks ago, Hershiser 
gave up only one run and lost. Pitching for the worst-hitting team in the 
league, he could hardly expect better. 
</P>
<P>
Letting Raines tie it up, at the very least, was going to break his streak. He 
had gained a decision, one way or another, in each of his previous eight 
starts. Hershiser said the victory was lucky "in that I didn't have one until a 
two-strike, two-out hit (by Scioscia) in the 10th." 
</P>
<P>
With the Dodgers ahead, Manager Tom Lasorda sent Jay Howell to pitch the 10th. 
Lasorda got some argument from Hershiser, who is not called Bulldog because of 
his looks. "I'm a competitor," he said, "I don't like to give the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot more fun to wake up in the morning and see a 'W' by your name," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So he protested, even though the two walks he gave up in the ninth in addition 
to the home run indicated some fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't see my side of the story," said Hershiser, who had two complete 
games going into this one. 
</P>
<P>
"But I stopped arguing when they showed me the number of pitches." The number 
was 156. "That's a lot," Hershiser acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
But Hershiser was able to get the 'W' by his name when the Dodgers scrambled, 
in typical fashion, for one more run. With Pascual Perez, newly demoted to the 
bullpen after six losses as a starter, on the mound, Willie Randolph led off 
with a single but was forced by Mike Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis got to second on Mike Marshall's ground-out, and Perez (0-7) walked Eddie 
Murray. Scioscia, batting in the fifth spot in a lineup that is not studded 
with power these days, singled to right for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
This is pretty much the Dodger Way these days. For most of the game, until 
Raines unloaded, the Dodgers' go-ahead run was the result of Dave Anderson's 
double-play ball that scored John Shelby. 
</P>
<P>
And the first run was similarly produced. Marshall scratched out an infield hit 
and took second on Spike Owen's throwing error to first. Murray's subsequent 
single off starter Dennis Martinez got the Dodgers off to a good start. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser hasn't often required more than that this season. He began the game 
with a 1.74 earned-run average. And if he hasn't had any scoreless inning 
streaks like last year (59), he was working on a nice run without giving up a 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser wasn't sure when he last gave one up, but he knew he hadn't given up 
any this year, none in the playoffs or World Series last year and, of course, 
none during his scoreless-inning play. "Gotta be 150 innings or more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the streak dates to a game with the San Francisco Giants on Aug. 14, 
when Bob Melvin homered. Including the playoffs and World Series, Hershiser 
went 195 1/3 innings without giving up a home run. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't particularly surprised by Raines' blast, however. "I fell behind on 
the count," he said, "one of the few times I did all day, and I had to really 
go after him. I said, 'Here, hit it.' He did." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser said it is easier to pitch around Raines when he's leading off than 
when he is batting fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a change in the Dodger batting order was benefiting Hershiser. 
Scioscia, batting fifth, was the guy who rescued him. 
</P>
<P>
"I like batting fifth," Scioscia said, "even though I haven't been producing. 
But there's a lot of action there, lot of guys on base." Saturday there were 
two, all he needed. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia wasn't impressed by Hershiser's performance -- "I think he struggled 
all day," he said -- but conceded that it was good enough. "That he can keep us 
in a game like that. . ." 
</P>
<P>
That is how the Dodgers have managed to win five of their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser and his colleagues -- today's starter, Mike Morgan, has an ERA of 
0.77 -- have given up two earned runs or fewer in 23 of their 39 games. But the 
Dodgers find themselves only one game above .500. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson still hopes to be back in the lineup for the Dodgers' next 
homestand, but he's making no promises. "I'm just getting close," he said. "I 
can't put a date on it." But he's relieved that the Dodgers are winning. "It's 
less frustrating when you're winning," said Gibson, who has been on the 
disabled list because of a sore hamstring. . . . Jay Howell got his sixth save 
in Saturday's game but denied he was "on a roll. . . . ' I never look back," he 
said. "A reliever looks back, he regresses." He said, "As of late, we're doing 
the things to win. All we need to see is (Jeff) Hamilton and (John) Shelby 
hitting, and taking the load off the other guys." Hamilton is nine for 16 in 
his last four games.

LAKERS PROVE THEY HAVE PLENTY IN RESERVES; 
</P>
<P>
BENCH REPELS SUNS, 127-119, IN GAME ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
During training camp in Hawaii last fall, Laker Coach Pat Riley boldly 
predicted that his promising corps of reserves would prove to be the deepest, 
most productive in his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Little that happened during the regular season supported Riley's prediction. 
But in Game 1 of the NBA Western Conference finals Saturday, when it was needed 
the most, his bench helped lift the Lakers to a 127-119 victory over the 
Phoenix Suns before a Forum crowd of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
Thrust into lead roles by necessity, the supporting players had to perform if 
the Lakers were to overcome the Suns, who overcame a 16-point first-half 
deficit in the opening game of this seven-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson was on the bench with five fouls, eventually fouling out late in 
the game. Byron Scott, also in foul trouble, spent much of the second half 
sitting next to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
And Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sat out the final five minutes because of an injured 
hip. 
</P>
<P>
In came Orlando Woolridge, Mychal Thompson and Michael Cooper to rescue their 
more famous teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"When your key guys are out," Woolridge said, "everybody out on the court has 
got to do something extra. You have to." 
</P>
<P>
So, even though James Worthy scored 32 points and stifled counterpart Tom 
Chambers, nearly everyone concerned credited the Laker bench for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the difference today," Riley said of his reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"(Woolridge) was outstanding. He paid his rent today. Coop ran the offense very 
well. We know it's going to take eight men to beat these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Not eight at once, of course. But against a team with so many offensive 
resources, led by multi-talented point guard Kevin Johnson, Laker depth was 
essential merely to keep pace. Woolridge scored 11 of his 13 points in the 
second half and added seven rebounds, three assists, two blocked shots and a 
key steal late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper ably ran the Laker offense in Magic Johnson's absence and took over 
Scott's unenviable task of guarding Kevin Johnson, who had 27 points and 18 
assists in 46 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
And Thompson, who had eight points and six rebounds in relief of Abdul-Jabbar, 
combined with Woolridge for what might have been the game-clinching play. 
</P>
<P>
With two minutes left and Magic Johnson having fouled out, the Lakers held a 
116-111 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns threw a half-court trap at the Lakers, and the best shot they could 
get was a baseline jump shot by Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
He missed, but Thompson grabbed the rebound. He then fed Woolridge charging 
through the lane for a dunk shot while being fouled by Tyrone Corbin. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge's free throw gave the Lakers an eight-point lead with 1:35 left, and 
they were not threatened thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"Woolridge made the big plays," Phoenix forward Eddie Johnson said. "Mychal got 
that offensive rebound that killed us, and then Woolridge got that big 
three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't take advantage (of the Laker reserves). If we had someone come up 
and say to us before the game, 'What would you like (to happen), we definitely 
would've took (having Magic and Scott in foul trouble). But we just didn't do 
what we had to do to win in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
And the Lakers did. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Johnson fouling out for the first time in the playoffs since 1981, and 
despite having Scott on the bench for an 11-minute stretch in the second half, 
the Lakers persevered and remained unbeaten in eight playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
Dating to last season, the Lakers have won 10 straight playoff games, an NBA 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy continued his prolific playoff scoring, making 13 of 22 shots. He also 
held Chambers, averaging 26.1 points coming in, to 15 points. Chambers made 
only five of 19 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played and been around Tom a long time," said Worthy. "I respect him, and 
you have to give him all your energy." 
</P>
<P>
All but four of A.C. Green's 18 points came in the first half, when the Lakers 
made 61.4% of their shots. All told, he made eight of nine shots and led the 
Lakers with 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Production from the forwards was needed because of the Lakers' foul trouble. 
Johnson made only six of 13 shots for 18 points and Scott scored 24. After the 
Suns took a 100-99 lead on Eddie Johnson's basket with 7:40 left, Johnson 
returned to the lineup, having been preceded by Scott one possession earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored five more points before fouling out with 2:23 remaining. Scott 
sank three straight jump shots, then made a driving layup with 1:16 left that 
gave the Lakers a 10-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson received his fifth foul, for charging, with about four minutes to play 
in the third quarter. It came one possession after he incurred his fourth foul 
on a similar call. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Earvin saw that he was coming out and wanted to give it one last 
drive," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was replaced by Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 'O' was the key," Worthy said. "He made the big plays. He had some 
rebounds when we really needed them. And he can be an intimidator with his 
blocked shots." 
</P>
<P>
During his stay on the bench, Johnson was Woolridge's biggest supporter. He 
waved his fist during timeouts and rushed over to offer congratulations and 
advice to Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Orlando gave us a spark we haven't had," Johnson said. "What I liked today was 
that he wasn't just making the offensive plays. He blocked some shots, got a 
big steal (late in the game) and some rebounds, too. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we need. Early and midway through (the regular season), our bench 
wasn't (producing enough). But in the last week of the season and now the 
playoffs, we've got confidence in them." 
</P>
<P>
Said Woolridge, who also made five of six free throws: "In the past, I've been 
characterized as only an offensive player. But I'm working more on intangibles. 
I got a couple of rebounds and then (during a timeout), Magic came around and 
really pumped me up. Coming from a guy you respect, that gives you confidence 
and helps you to get to the next level." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said that, by the end of the playoffs, this could be remembered as the 
deepest Laker bench of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say it should be the best," Riley said. "It should be productive. 
They are capable of doing that. Mychal and Coop always have known their roles. 
Orlando is starting to get into it. He's starting to lend some support." 
</P>
<P>

STARTERS' SUCCESS SPELLS FAILURE FOR ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the rest of the Angel pitching staff has been getting rave reviews for 
its success, reliever Bryan Harvey has been getting ho-hum notices. 
</P>
<P>
Even when Harvey did not allow a run in his first eight appearances and picked 
up five saves in five opportunities, he got little more than a pat on the back 
and a nod of approval. 
</P>
<P>
But the success of the Angels' starting pitchers may be leading to the demise 
of their premier relief pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, making only his third appearance in 15 days, turned in his third 
consecutive shaky outing Saturday night. He gave up a single, a three-run homer 
and two walks as the Brewers rallied for a 5-3 victory before a crowd of 34,764 
at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that I'd like to get more work, but the starters have been 
doing their job," Harvey said before the game. "I'm throwing the ball well, I'm 
just not sharp enough to hit the spots I have to hit when I need a strike. 
</P>
<P>
"And when I'm too strong, I try to throw too hard." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, against whom 11 of the last 18 batters have reached base, apparently 
had both problems Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Bert Blyleven gave up a leadoff home run to Rob Deer in the eighth 
inning that made the score 2-2. And when Paul Gantner lined a shot off the 
glove of third baseman Jack Howell for a single, Manager Doug Rader went to his 
bullpen ace. 
</P>
<P>
But Harvey, who has been working behind in the count most of the time for the 
past two weeks, couldn't produce the kind of magic that carried him to 17 saves 
and a 2.13 earned-run average last season. Glenn Braggs lined a single to left, 
and B.J. Surhoff followed with a line-drive homer into the left-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey then got Terry Francona to ground out, but he walked Bill Spiers and 
Paul Molitor before Willie Fraser was summoned. Fraser got out of the inning 
without further damage, but, for Harvey, the doubts remained. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of the problem is in my head," he said. "I wasn't throwing it 
anywhere close to where I wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey said he thought he might be having a problem with his arm mechanics, but 
Rader saw nothing that a few consecutive days of work couldn't cure. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a situation where he's just not getting enough work to stay sharp," 
Rader said, "but I hope we get in a save situation again tomorrow, because Harv 
will be out there again. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been getting plenty of exercise in the bullpen but that's not the same as 
competitive work. I see no cause for concern. I'm sure his confidence is a 
little damaged, but not as damaged as yours or mine would be. That's what makes 
him special. He's so resilient." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey may bounce back, but the Angels couldn't rebound from the Brewers' 
four-run eighth. They scored once in the bottom of the eighth, but the rally 
faltered when Chili Davis grounded into an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven (4-2) had worked a typical let-'em-get-on-and-leave-'em-there stint 
for seven innings. The veteran right-hander has pitched into the seventh inning 
41 times and has 20 complete games against the Brewers, but his career record 
against them is 21-15. Saturday night's outing was a classic Blyleven vs. the 
Brewers matchup. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee left runners in scoring position in four of the first seven innings, 
and had at least one hit in every inning but the first and ninth. And the 
Brewers left the bases loaded in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Things were looking good for the Angels in the first inning. Devon White hit 
his third homer in as many nights. And then a power outage at a nearby 
substation blew out two banks of lights, delaying the game for 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
White's line drive landed in the second deck in right-center field, giving him 
three home runs in seven at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers made the score 1-1 in the second inning. Deer led off with a double 
down the left-field line and took third on a controversial bunt single by 
Gantner. He rolled the ball wide of first base, where Wally Joyner picked it up 
and then made a headlong dive at Gantner, who was making a head-first slide 
into first. 
</P>
<P>
Television replays clearly showed Joyner's glove hit Gantner's foot before the 
Brewer runner reached the bag, but umpire Dave Phillips ruled Joyner had missed 
the tag. 
</P>
<P>
Deer would have reached third in any case, and Braggs followed with a deep fly 
ball to center field to score Deer. Blyleven then escaped the inning without 
further damage. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee starter Don August, who picked up the victory to improve his record 
to 3-5, retired 15 of 18 Angels from the second through the sixth innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels went ahead, 2-1, in the seventh when Lance Parrish hit a towering 
home run to left-center field. August, from Mission Viejo, gave up two more 
hits but got out of the inning when Johnny Ray grounded into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' lead, like Harvey's reputation as a stopper, evaporated in a hurry 
in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"My pitches weren't even close," Harvey said. "They were down, out . . . not 
even close." 
</P>
<P>
Quick starts aside, if Harvey doesn't return to form, the Angels may end up 
down and out, too. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Veteran right-hander Bert Blyleven's slightly slanted sense of humor and the 
dip of his curveball have boosted the Angels' morale and their record. He has 
given so many hotfoots this spring that the clubhouse smells like burning 
leather. And every fifth day, he's helped ignite the Angels' return to 
respectability. Saturday night, the 38-year-old Blyleven was at it again. 
Blyleven bobbed, weaved, even wavered, but he snapped off enough good curves to 
hold Milwaukee at bay for seven-plus innings before Bryan Harvey failed in 
relief. Blyleven gave up 10 hits but stranded eight Brewers in the first seven 
innings.

STILL BLAZING; 
</P>
<P>
AT AGE 42, RYAN HASN'T SLOWED UP ALL THAT MUCH 
</P>

ARLINGTON, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As farewell tours go, this one lacks something, or everything, starting with an 
announcement that anyone might be going away. 
</P>
<P>
There are no ceremonies or speeches. Think of the merchandise that may never be 
proffered, the rocking chairs, the plaques, the Rolls-Royce! 
</P>
<P>
And yet . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the farewells to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar featured a shadowy imitation of the 
player he once was, this tour has the real deal: Nolan Ryan, 42 and no less 
larger than life, breathing fire and throwing flame, his old mythical self to 
the end. Tiger, tiger, still burning bright. 
</P>
<P>
Fans flock to see him. After a rainout in New York moves him back to the opener 
of the series in Kansas City, the Royals report a walk-up sale of 6,000. Ryan's 
Texas Rangers average an extra 5,700 when he pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows, this can't go on. 
</P>
<P>
Can it? 
</P>
<P>
The man is 42, after all, and no one can throw that hard forever, can he? 
</P>
<P>
He does. Gather your children and tell them to watch closely. We never saw his 
like before, nor are we apt to again. 
</P>
<P>
Radar guns still catch his pitches at 97 m.p.h. He leads the major leagues in 
strikeouts, having led them at 40 and the National League at 41. This season, 
he has struck out 10 or more in five of eight starts, and taken a shot at his 
sixth no-hitter into the ninth inning at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy can deal," says the Royals' Kevin Seitzer, who was an 11-year-old in 
Lincoln, Ill., when Ryan threw his first no-hitter in 1973 . . . against the 
Royals. 
</P>
<P>
"He and Vida Blue were the big names when I was a kid. The guy threw 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"My expectations were tremendously high, because all I heard was how hard he 
throws, the curveball, the great changeup. I was pretty geared up for it, I'll 
put it that way. My only goal that night was to not let him strike me out and 
he didn't get me. 
</P>
<P>
"He throws as hard as anyone I've ever faced. It's just that, when you're 
facing a Nolan Ryan vs. an Eric Plunk or Roger Clemens -- they all throw gas, 
but when you're facing someone like Nolan, I don't know what it is, but you get 
a little extra adrenaline. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a freak of nature, as far as I'm concerned. Nobody that old should throw 
the ball that hard, that's all there is to it." 
</P>
<P>
Seitzer can consider himself lucky, if that's the word, for the experience. 
Ryan almost packed it in last winter, when the Houston Astros asked him to take 
a 20% pay cut in the sure knowledge that their family-conscious star, born, 
raised and still living in nearby Alvin, Tex., was too tied down to move. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan gathered his wife Ruth and three kids and asked them if he should retire, 
adding that if old Dad wanted to continue, he'd probably have to go somewhere 
else and they'd be apart again, for a while. 
</P>
<P>
They told him to keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess they weren't too keen on the idea of having me around every day," Ryan 
says, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
Now he has a one-year contract for $1.8 million plus a $200,000 bonus. The 
Rangers have an option for an extra season, if he wants to stay, and they want 
him back. 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude is, I still enjoy being in shape," Ryan says. "I still enjoy 
competing. I'm not tied to any number. I'm not concerned with trying to win 
300, or strike out 5,000. I think I've probably surpassed my expectations by 10 
years. I never thought I'd be playing at this age. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got to Houston (in 1980), I only asked for a three-year contract 
because I felt like that was a reasonable amount of time. I really felt like 
I'd get out of the game then. I just figured, when I couldn't be a power 
pitcher any more, I'd get out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
That day never came. 
</P>
<P>
He spent nine seasons in Houston, from ages 32-41, with the Astros measuring 
every pitch with a radar gun, which can register 2-3 m.p.h. slower than the 
more commonly used JUGS gun. 
</P>
<P>
In those nine years, the velocity of an average Ryan fastball dropped 1/2 
m.p.h., from 92.8 to 92.3. 
</P>
<P>
Heaven only knows how far off that day might be, if Ryan really cares to test 
it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PHENOM 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, he was a local legend. At the end -- well, maybe near the end 
-- he's a national one. All that has changed is the constituency. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the tournament game Alvin High played against Deer Park in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
"The first kid up, I hit him in the head and broke his helmet," Ryan says, 
grinning again. "Second kid, I hit him in the biceps and broke his arm. The 
third kid went out and begged the coach not to hit." 
</P>
<P>
The amazing thing about this story? 
</P>
<P>
It's essentially true. 
</P>
<P>
There are disagreements about how many Deer Park batters Ryan hit and where he 
hit them, but several people present agree on one thing: The third batter did 
beg his coach not to make him hit. In this life, the tall tales mostly 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan didn't start throwing truly hard until late in his career as an Alvin High 
Yellowjacket. He was 6-foot-2 and 150 pounds when the end of puberty brought 
some physiological miracle of flexibility and coordination that launched him on 
this road that seems to have no end. 
</P>
<P>
"He really didn't like baseball," says Jim Watson, his coach at Alvin and now 
the principal at Pearland High in Pearland, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"His preference was for basketball. But he began getting some publicity for 
beating some of the bigger teams around the Houston area. . . . We didn't get 
much publicity, but what there was, it called him a 'phenom.' That was the word 
they used." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, because of his wildness, there has been a tendency to regard Ryan 
as some kind of idle wastrel. Actually, he is the most diligent of workers, and 
was, even then. 
</P>
<P>
"The interesting thing about Nolan was his work ethic," says Bob Jacobs, then 
Alvin's catcher, now associate professor in environmental health science at the 
University of Alabama Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
"He would be out running the fences in the outfield, while the rest of us would 
be being typical high school kids. Nolan worked very hard at his baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Says Watson, laughing: "He would, but I made him. I made him, because I'd been 
told that legs were important. I ran him until his tongue was hangin' out. He 
hated me for it, but he did it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a pretty tough taskmaster because I was really a football coach. I gave 
him a bunch of special drills, to be honest with you, and he always did 'em. He 
never complained. I didn't let him swim. The other kids, we'd be off on a trip 
somewhere, they'd be swimmin' and he couldn't go. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted no special favors. I remember, I let him go in early one day. The 
next day he came up to me and said, 'Coach, I don't mind staying out there with 
all the guys.' I knew what he was talking about. He didn't want to be thought 
of as a prima donna. 
</P>
<P>
"He was really a shy youngster. He didn't want to be different. I'm sure he 
appreciated having his name in the paper and stuff like that, but he knew his 
responsibility, first and foremost. He knew exactly what his role was: If he 
didn't go, we couldn't win. We just had a little, old bunch of weak kids. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was a very special high school player, but I had nothing to compare 
him to. The only thing I had was after the 'Stros got (Larry) Dierker, who was 
the hard thrower and everything. I'd watch Nolan pitch in the afternoon and 
drive to the dome that night, and he could throw harder than Dierker. 
</P>
<P>
"So I knew he was very special, but as far as going to the big leagues, no. 
Alvin had had one or two kids that had signed contracts and never made it past 
double A at the most. We just figured it'd be a little fling and then he'll 
come home. Were we wrong!" 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes, there's another version of the Deer Park game. 
</P>
<P>
"What sticks out in my mind is that Nolan hit the second fellow," Bob Jacobs 
says. "The third guy was coming up and he did ask the coach not to hit. He 
said, 'I don't want to do this.' What I recall, the boy finally was talked into 
hitting. And then Nolan hit him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BI-COASTAL COWBOY 
</P>
<P>
Ryan was selected by the New York Mets in the eighth round of the 1965 
free-agent draft and made the big leagues in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, he was part of the staff of prodigies: Tom Seaver, Jerry 
Koosman, Gary Gentry, all hard throwers, themselves. Ryan pitched, in relief, 
in the World Series in his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
On the minus side, he was a long way from home. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a young kid from Texas," Seaver said from his Connecticut home. 
"He was a young, naive, small-town kid from Texas, but he had a good mind and a 
good head. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty close when we were on the Mets together. We shared a lot of 
things professionally and socially as well. Our wives became friendly. It was 
just a matter of maturity, as far as Nolan was concerned. He was very 
uncomfortable playing here in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"More than anything else, he was afraid for his wife. They were both very young 
and he was concerned about her safety in New York City, and I don't blame him. 
It was difficult for him to deal with that. He got traded to California, where 
there was a more comfortable environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the trade, itself, was probably a maturing factor. He thought, 'Well, 
I've got to get with it.' I remember, we talked about it. We had dinner a 
couple times and we would talk about his attitude and his approach and the 
ability that he had and the things he expected of himself. He agreed, but he 
couldn't put it together for an extended period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Says Jim Watson: "I remember him back then telling me, boy, if he could make it 
one more year, he was packing it in, he'd had enough. You needed five years for 
a pension. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was disgusted with New York, more than anything else. And now, you 
can't get him to hang 'em up. I remind him of that conversation fairly often 
when I talk to him." 
</P>
<P>
After four seasons, the Mets traded Ryan to the Angels for the aging Jim 
Fregosi, to solve what was referred to as "their perennial third base problem." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan threw two no-hitters by July 15, went 19-16 and struck out 329 batters. 
Fregosi was gone by the end of the next season. He used to laugh about it when 
he was named the Angel manager and Ryan was his ace. 
</P>
<P>
Thus did Nolan Ryan become Nolan Ryan, now also known as the Von Ryan Express, 
etc. 
</P>
<P>
Just what that is has been the subject of some debate: A great pitcher? Certain 
Hall of Famer? A curiosity who's more spectacular than effective? 
</P>
<P>
Jim Palmer of the Baltimore Orioles, his rival in the annual Cy Young balloting 
-- Palmer won three, Ryan none -- and a man not averse to claiming what he 
believed was his, once said of Ryan, "His thing is 383 strikeouts; mine is 215 
victories." 
</P>
<P>
Someone less partisan than Palmer could wonder if Ryan wasn't as much seduced 
by his power as he was its master. 
</P>
<P>
That he was at least intrigued by it is a safe assumption. Ryan has told of two 
occasions, in those trackless wastes of losing Angel seasons, when he stepped 
off the mound and told the batter what was coming -- nothing but fastballs -- 
so they could see just which of them was better. 
</P>
<P>
One was Reggie Jackson, the other Richie Allen. Ryan says he got them both out. 
</P>
<P>
Seaver says that "it's possible" that it all might have worked to Ryan's 
detriment as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I definitely think there was a fascination with the strikeouts," 
Seaver says. "There's no question about that." 
</P>
<P>
In Ryan's eight Angel seasons, he won 20 games twice and 16 or more five times. 
He threw four no-hitters between 1973-76 and struck out 300 or more five times 
between 1973-78. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, he went 16-14 on the first Angel division winner -- and was allowed to 
leave as a free agent when General Manager Buzzie Bavasi got into an emotional 
standoff with Ryan's agent, Dick Moss. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bavasi, on replacing Ryan: "All we need are two 8-7 pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
Later, with Ryan thriving in Houston and the Angels floundering, Moss asked: 
"Has Buzzie found his two 8-7 pitchers?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WALTZ ACROSS TEXAS 
</P>
<P>
Perfect speed, my son, is being there. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jonathon Livingston Seagull 
</P>
<P>
The most amazing thing happened to Ryan in Houston. His control improved. 
</P>
<P>
The man who walked as many as 204 and never fewer than 148 until his last Angel 
season, never walked more than 109 with the Astros. His earned-run average for 
the nine years was 3.13. In 1987, he became the oldest man ever to lead the 
National League with a 2.76 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
And he still threw hard. 
</P>
<P>
"I got him at Chicago one ballgame at 99 m.p.h.," says Billy Joe Bowman, who 
operates the Astros' radar gun. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I remember it so vividly, Lee Smith was throwing that day. Lee 
Smith also threw one 99. The ball was way out of the strike zone, but it was 
still 99. 
</P>
<P>
"Nolan's velocity would vary sometimes from ballgame to ballgame, but he'd 
always reach a stretch where he'd get to his maximum velocity, and then he'd 
just come right on. And here he comes! 
</P>
<P>
"He's an awesome individual, to be that old and throw that hard. I guess, of 
all the pitchers I've ever put the gun on, he's probably the most consistent, 
except for the ones who throw the sinker and stay around 81-82. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody throws any harder than Nolan. Dwight Gooden will stay 
right with him." 
</P>
<P>
For how long? By age 35, your basic power pitcher -- say Seaver, Steve Carlton 
or Bob Gibson -- will be throwing fastballs in the high 80s or maybe the low 
90s and getting people out on sliders and location. 
</P>
<P>
Throw 97 at 42? 
</P>
<P>
Forget it. Only Ryan ever did that. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has filled out but he is anything but muscular. He has large thighs, but 
unremarkable biceps, forearms, delts, traps, you name it. He doesn't have one 
or two lifts he can do better than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"He was never really exceptional," says Lewis Yocum, the Angel team physician. 
"Like, 'Look at that forearm, it's 10 times bigger than anyone else.' I have a 
feeling, a lot of it, it's like a good golf swing." 
</P>
<P>
These, then, must be the finest pitching mechanics God ever gave anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all the work he did helped, but it's God-given," says Bob Jacobs, his 
high school catcher. "It's just his basic bone structure, the flexibility that 
he has. 
</P>
<P>
"What I recall also was the flexibility he had in his wrist. He could really 
pop it. He was throwing hard long before he refined his talent, so it was 
there." 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-'70s, before pitching coaches were putting their charges through 
stretches, Ryan was already doing his own routine. He is limber enough to 
easily put his nose onto his knee in a hamstring stretch. That may be routine 
for 13-year-old girl gymnasts but certainly is not for 200-pound, middle-aged 
men. 
</P>
<P>
So what if he lost a little off his fastball? He had so much more to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan remembers the night in 1975 when the Rockwell people came out to a game in 
Anaheim Stadium with their instruments. They shot a beam down in front of the 
plate -- and caught him over 100 m.p.h. seven times. Their top speed of 101 
went into the "Guinness Book of World Records" and still stands as the 
prevailing mark for thrown baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
"My arm doesn't feel like it did 15-18 years ago," Ryan says. "It doesn't have 
the elasticity and the strength in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it doesn't ache me and all that but -- when I was with the Angels, I 
could throw every fourth day and throw 150 to 180 pitches and go back out there 
four days later. One year, I started 41 games and finished 26 of them. And 
pitched 333 innings. You know, those days are over, I realize that." 
</P>
<P>
As much as anything, Ryan will be remembered by the people who knew him as one 
of the game's great gentlemen, as unpretentious now as he was as an Alvin 
Yellowjacket, and a man of great warmth. 
</P>
<P>
The Angel he was closest to was Jimmie Reese, the 83-year-old coach, after whom 
Ryan named one of his sons. When the Angels tried to re-sign Ryan last winter, 
one of the things he says tugged at him was that "Gene (Autry) and Jimmie were 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Says Astro trainer Dave Labossiere: "There are a lot of people, you've got to 
admire their skills but as a person, you're not going to admire them. Now this 
is a person for someone to admire." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE END? 
</P>
<P>
So here's our hero, with a son, Reed, who's 17 and a basketball star at Alvin 
High . . . as Nolan was. Reed is 6-2 and can dunk . . . as Nolan did. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, a junior, has just gotten a recruiting letter from Stanford, and has been 
invited to several five-star camps. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan, who still admits to preferring basketball, is excited. He is having the 
Ranger trainer devise a workout for Reed, who will come over to Dallas with 
Ruth and the other kids when school lets out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the age bracket of a lot of these kids' parents, some of 'em," says 
Nolan, looking around the Ranger locker room. "I got a son 17, so a lot of them 
are like my son's friends. I think they look at me as more of a coach." 
</P>
<P>
Not likely. Probably more as a piece of history they had the privilege of 
seeing unfold before them. 
</P>
<P>
That day in Toronto, when Nelson Liriano broke up Ryan's no-hitter in the 
ninth, Ryan let out a yell and snapped his head angrily. 
</P>
<P>
It was remarkable, since it was a good deal more emotion than he showed when he 
actually pitched a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
His first four came between 1973-76 in his super-dominating Angel days. He had 
all but given up on the idea of ever breaking his tie with Sandy Koufax by 
1981, when he got No. 5 against the Dodgers. All he did that day, after Dusty 
Baker grounded to third for the last out, was duck his head, raise his right 
arm and wander around looking kind of embarrassed until his Astro teammates 
mobbed him. 
</P>
<P>
"I did take it hard," Ryan says of Liriano's hit. "To get that close and lose 
it . . . I was really disappointed because I didn't throw the ball where I 
wanted it. I realize if I get in the ninth -- that opportunity may not arise 
again. I hope it does, but you know, there's a good chance it won't." 
</P>
<P>
Look while you may. He may never pass this way again. 
</P>
<P>
No one like him is going to turn up soon, either.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE BROUGHT SUNS FROM A TOTAL ECLIPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Colangelo was by far the best pitcher on his high school baseball team, a 
team on which Jim Bouton could not even make third-string. He also excelled at 
basketball, played guard for the University of Illinois and definitely had a 
little Jerry West in him, although perhaps less in dribble and jumper than in 
name and haircut. 
</P>
<P>
Colangelo attended America's greatest high school, Bloom Township in Chicago 
Heights, Ill., cradle of sportswriters. Later on, Jerry came back to town and 
worked for a while selling prom tuxedos, but basketball was his first love, and 
somehow he finagled a job with the public-relations staff of the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Little did he know that he would end up president and part-owner of a National 
Basketball Assn. franchise, the Phoenix Suns, or that under his aegis, the 
ballclub would recover from the indignities of a drug scandal and from an 
unseemly record to -- almost overnight -- find itself one of four clubs with a 
shot at winning the NBA championship. Talk about rising from the ashes; Phoenix 
did. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a long way from where we were," Colangelo said as the Suns opened the 
Western Conference finals against the Lakers. "If you just go back to April 
1987, when the drug investigation took place, to the death of Nick Vanos (a 
promising Sun player killed in a plane crash) a couple of months later, things 
were about as bad as they could be. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to believe now that, remembering how things were, there had to have 
been an excellent possibility that the franchise could have been moved 
somewhere else or gone entirely. Things were that bleak. That's one of the 
reasons I put a group together to buy the franchise, and hired somebody like 
Cotton Fitzsimmons to come in as coach, because it was clear to us that we had 
no choice but to absolutely start over." 
</P>
<P>
Colangelo and his colleagues were daring, you have to give them that. They took 
a ballclub in tatters and turned it into something special, so quickly you can 
hardly believe it. This team had a record of 28-54 last season, for heaven's 
sake, and here they are in this postseason, going against the Lakers for the 
right to play in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
You want to talk turnarounds? Before Saturday's 127-119 defeat at the Forum, 
Phoenix had won 25 of its previous 30 games, counting the playoffs. Remember, 
this team won 28 times all of last season. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, things are so peachy back in Phoenix that the blueprints already have 
been drawn up for a new house of the rising Suns. By November 1991, Phoenix 
expects to be playing in a $17-million, 18,000-seat, state-of-the-art arena, 
with 100 luxury suites. The Suns are picking up half the tab, the city the 
other half. 
</P>
<P>
Say this for Sun lovers, they never did abandon their boys. Even after all the 
negative publicity, after the drug-use admissions that forever tarnished the 
good names of local hero Walter Davis and others, Phoenix's fans stood by 
faithfully. The season-ticket base of around 7,000, Colangelo says, never 
eroded. 
</P>
<P>
The public even swallowed hard and accepted it when the Suns negotiated a 
brave, brave trade. Management had made up its mind that to be successful, it 
had to start completely from scratch. Not just back up the truck. Burn the 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
"We took our best asset, and made one of those monumental trades you sometimes 
talk about but never pull off," Colangelo said. "This is no business for the 
timid, let me tell you. You've got to be a risk-taker. Especially when you're 
in the position we were in, coming back from the depths." 
</P>
<P>
The swap was the one that sent Phoenix's finest and arguably most popular 
player, Larry Nance, to the Cleveland Cavaliers. In return, the Suns got three 
starters, including their very able point guard, Kevin Johnson, plus the right 
to draft Olympic star Dan Majerle, plus a couple of second-round picks. It was 
the start of something big. 
</P>
<P>
Then, all they needed was somebody big, a big talent, somebody to build the 
team around. Their timing was superb. Unrestricted free agency gave them carte 
blanche to go after Tom Chambers, who had worn out his welcome in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"At the stroke of midnight, we targeted Tom Chambers, went after Tom Chambers 
and, within 48 hours, had Tom Chambers," Colangelo said. "We knew he had had a 
reputation problem in the past, and wondered if there was something we didn't 
know. But it's amazing how it all turned out. Tom's had a career season for us. 
</P>
<P>
"When we met with him, the first thing we told him is that he didn't have to 
shop the marketplace, that we intended to build our team around him. That's 
really all he had to hear. All he needed was to be loved." 
</P>
<P>
The Suns themselves are loved again in Arizona, by those who never stopped 
loving them, and by those who might have temporarily abandoned them. Colangelo, 
once rumored as a candidate someday to be NBA commissioner, has settled 
comfortably into the club's chief-executive suite after many up-and-down years 
as general manager. Long gone and nearly forgotten is the worst break he ever 
got, that coin flip for Lew Alcindor that came up Neal Walk. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are playing the Lakers, the dominant team of the era," Colangelo said. 
"You know, when I lost that coin toss, I thought I was facing 10 years of 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reminding me of my bad luck. I was wrong by a decade. He 
hasn't gone away." 
</P>
<P>
No, he hasn't. The Phoenix Suns, meantime, did go away for a while. But they 
are back, all the way back, with their entire community behind them. In the 
1990s, if he needs to do any more flipping, Jerry Colangelo is not going to be 
hurting for coins.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
A'S STEWART (8-1) CONTINUES TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Stewart became the first pitcher in the major leagues to win eight games 
for the second season in a row Saturday, working out of a first-inning jam and 
holding the Boston Red Sox to six hits in 7 2/3 innings at Oakland as the 
Athletics won, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Eckersley, coming right back after giving up a grand slam to Dwight 
Evans Friday night, got the last four outs to earn his 13th save. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Stewart's record isn't quite as good as it was a year ago, when he 
went on to post a 21-12 record. In 1988, he won his first eight. This year, the 
8-1 record is probably more of an accomplishment, mainly because Jose Canseco 
has not appeared in a game, taking away a big part of the Athletics' punch. 
</P>
<P>
While most observers realize that Stewart has become an outstanding pitcher, it 
is Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan who points to an extra part of Stewart's game. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that in every game he pitches against us," Morgan said, "he makes at 
least one great defensive play. Taking (Danny) Heep's smash and getting the 
double play, that saved the game for him. He not only pitches, he does whatever 
he has to, to win." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Greenwell's single in the first inning had driven in a run, and there were 
Red Sox runners on first and third with one out. Stewart speared Heep's shot up 
the middle. Instead of going home, he wheeled to second to start the 
inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
"That early there isn't much chance two or three runs is going to beat us," 
Stewart said. "So I'd rather try to get out of the inning than try to cut down 
the run at the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Gallego and Terry Steinbach homered for the A's, and Dave Parker drove in 
two runs with a pair of singles. Eckersley came in with the bases loaded in the 
eighth -- the same situation as the night before -- but disposed of Rich Gedman 
on a ground-out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was anxious to get back in there after what happened last night," Eckersley 
said. "I wanted it bad. I didn't sleep well after the home run." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 5, Cleveland 1 -- Jeff Ballard, 8-12 with the ineffective team of 
last season, is off to the best start for an Oriole pitcher since Wayne Garland 
won his first eight decisions in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard gave up four hits in 7 2/3 innings at Baltimore to improve his record 
to 7-1. The key hit for the Orioles, who built a 5-0 lead, was a bases-loaded 
single for Craig Worthington to make it 3-0 in the seventh. Worthington is 5 
for 5 with seven runs batted in when the bases have been loaded. 
</P>
<P>
After his fast start, Garland went on to win 20 games. Arm problems then 
wrecked his career and he soon faded from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 2, Kansas City 1 -- The Tigers are 2-0 since Manager Sparky Anderson 
was sent home for a rest. 
</P>
<P>
Both wins at Detroit have come on ninth-inning home runs. Friday night, Lou 
Whitaker hit a two-run homer. In this one, Alan Trammell led off the ninth with 
his second home run. 
</P>
<P>
For the second game in a row, Mike Henneman won it with two scoreless innings 
of relief. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals had a chance to break it open in the seventh. But Pat Tabler, who 
also has a phenomenal record when batting with the bases loaded, flied out with 
three runners on. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 11, Chicago 1 -- Ernie Whitt had four hits, including a three-run home 
run, and Lloyd Moseby drove in three runs at Chicago to lead the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Key (5-2) allowed four hits in eight innings, including Ron Kittle's 
eighth homer. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 19, Texas 3 -- Randy Bush hit two home runs and tied a club record 
with eight RBIs as the Twins breezed to victory at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
When the Rangers ran out of pitchers, infielder Jeff Kunkel pitched in the 
eighth and ninth. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up Bush's second three-run home run in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 6, New York 4 -- Ken Griffey Jr. hit a three-run homer in the seventh 
inning as the Mariners beat the Yankees at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Steve Trout (4-2) retired all three batters he faced in the seventh 
inning to get the victory, and Mike Schooler pitched the last two innings for 
his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
Dave LaPoint (5-2) had his five-game winning streak snapped, allowing five runs 
on nine hits and five walks, but Griffey connected off reliever Dale Mahorcic. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Bob Geren put the Yankees ahead, 4-3, in the sixth with his first major 
league home run. DAN HAFNER

Cobra Strikes Back: Dave Parker, the Oakland Athletics' designated hitter, 
batted only .194 in April but has rebounded to hit .333 in May -- 18 for 54 -- 
and promises revenge against any pitcher who had showed him up in April, 
including the Angels' Bert Blyleven. "Blyleven was one of the guys who really 
showed me up," Parker said. "It was as if he said, 'I know you're swinging bad 
so take this.' He threw me back-to-back off-speed pitches. The last was a 
knuckleball that I swung through and you could see he got enjoyment out of it. 
I got a very special (home run) trot saved up for him. One of my very best 
trots." 
</P>
<P>
Babe's Ghosts: A key reason for the fall-off in major league home run 
production has been the demise of the New York Yankees and their traditional 
array of left-handed hitters to take advantage of Yankee Stadium's "short 
porch" in right field. The Yankees have only two homers by left-handed hitters 
and none at Yankee Stadium. Don Mattingly, the club's premier left-handed 
hitter, had not hit a homer this year through Saturday, and Ken Phelps, who 
came in as the major leagues' active leader with a ratio of one homer every 
7.46 times at bat, had only one in 75 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Superiority: Of the shift in power from the American League East to West, 
Cleveland Indian Manager Doc Edwards said: "The main difference is the 
pitching. When you think about the top pitchers in the East, you think about 
Roger Clemens. When you think about the West, several guys come to mind." 
</P>
<P>
No Pride: With an 18-19 record, the Indians led the East Thursday, and 
operators at Municipal Stadium were greeting callers by saying "Home of the 
first-place Indians." This was the latest any division has had a sub-.500 
leader, a record the East extends on a daily basis now. 
</P>
<P>
Last Words: Shortstop Andres Thomas of the Atlanta Braves went into Wrigley 
Field this week saying of the Chicago Cubs: "Take away the second baseman (Ryne 
Sandburg) and the catcher (Damon Berryhill) and there's nobody over there who 
can play for us." The Cubs outscored the Braves in a three-game sweep, 12-3. 
</P>
<P>
Margo: Boston third baseman Wade Boggs can continue to insist that the Margo 
Adams fallout hasn't been a distraction, but he left Anaheim Thursday night 
batting .291, 65 points below his career average, had only five hits in his 
last 34 at-bats and had struck out 16 times, compared to 34 all of last year.

Laffit Pincay, forgoing the ride on Houston in the Preakness, stayed at 
Hollywood Park Saturday and rode five winners, including favorites Notorious 
Pleasure in the $111,900 Will Rogers Handicap on the turf and Bayakoa in the 
$106,400 Hawthorne Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay, who has ridden five winners on a card 10 times at Hollywood, won the 
third race with What Has Been. 
</P>
<P>
He then rode four straight winners, starting with Notorious Pleasure in the 
fifth race and finishing with Bayakoa in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Notorious Pleasure and Bayakoa both won by 4 1/2-length margins in the Grade II 
races. 
</P>
<P>
In the Will Rogers, a race for 3-year-olds, Notorious Pleasure covered the 1 
1/16 miles on the grass in 1:40 1/5 for his third consecutive victory. He paid 
$8.80, $4.20 and $3. Advocate Training paid $5.40 and $3.60 and First Play 
returned $4.20. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa went wire-to-wire to win the one-mile Hawthorne on the main track in a 
stakes record 1:32 4/5. Bayakoa paid $3.20, $2.20 and $2.10. Goodbye Halo paid 
$2.40 and $2.10 and Behind The Scenes returned $2.20. Goodbye Halo, a multiple 
Grade I stakes winner, has finished second in her last three races. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay also won with Icy Resolution in the sixth and Sam Who in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden Phipps' Seeking The Gold, one of the nation's leading 3-year-olds last 
year, came back from a six-month layoff and won the seventh race at Belmont 
Park in Elmont, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking The Gold, a top contender for handicap races this year, won the 
seven-furlong allowance for 3-year-olds and up by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking The Gold, who carried 121 pounds and Craig Perret, was timed in 1:21 
3/5 on the fast track to edge Sewickley, who was carrying 124 pounds and Randy 
Romero. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking The Gold paid $2.60, $2.10 and $2.10. Sewickley returned $3.00 and 
$2.10, and Cliff Flower paid $2.10.

Bill Yeoman, former Houston football coach, reached a contract settlement with 
the university, although nothing has been officially signed, the chairman of 
the university systems board of regents said. 
</P>
<P>
Yeoman is in the third year of a four-year, $412,000 contract. He was 
reassigned to the fund-raising job after the 1986 season, when the NCAA began 
investigating his football program. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, when Houston was placed on probation, a provision of the 
penalties called for Yeoman's suspension from fund-raising activities.

Corona del Mar High School, sparked by the blocking of Jason Perkins and Chad 
Steelberg, defeated Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, 16-18, 15-12, 15-6, 15-8, in 
the Southern Section 4-A boys' volleyball championship match Saturday at Marina 
High in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, a 6-foot-4 middle blocker, and Steelberg, a 6-1 outside hitter, led 
Corona del Mar after it lost a draining first game. In all, Corona del Mar had 
34 stuff-blocks, including eight in the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins was tops with 11; Steelberg had nine. 
</P>
<P>
"We really focused on our blocking," said Charlie Brande, Corona del Mar coach. 
"After that first game, we started reading their setters much better." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (16-2) had three game points in that first game but could not 
win. Mira Costa (21-1), the playoffs' No. 1-seeded team, won the game on a 
block by Zach Small. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Herrington had 22 kills for Corona del Mar, Chris Pliha 20, Matt Cwiertnia 
14 and Perkins 13. 
</P>
<P>
David Swatik had 16 kills for Mira Costa and Jason Stimpfig 14. STEVE LOWERY

NBA DRAFT LOTTERY; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS HAVE EXPERIENCE ON THEIR SIDE 
</P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clippers will return to their one area of consistent success today, the 
National Basketball Assn. draft lottery. And as the defending champions, no 
less. 
</P>
<P>
It's no great honor, of course, to reach this made-for-television event. The 
stage is usually reserved for the league's worst teams. But give the Clippers 
credit. Once they get here, they become a winning franchise. The lottery has 
given them two No. 3 picks, a No. 1 and a No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
What some of those picks have developed into is another matter, but consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1985: The New York Knicks win the inaugural lottery and take Patrick Ewing. 
The Clippers get the third pick and draft Benoit Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1986: The Clippers don't participate, having traded the pick to 
Philadelphia for Joe Bryant, who lasts three seasons with the club and is long 
gone by the time the lottery takes place. The 76ers get the No. 1 spot and then 
make a pre-draft deal with the Cavaliers, who select Brad Daugherty. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1987: The San Antonio Spurs win and take David Robinson. The Clippers get 
fourth and draft Reggie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1988: The Clippers win and take Danny Manning. The first team to ever have 
two lottery picks, they also pick sixth and get Hersey Hawkins, but trade him 
to Philadelphia in a three-team draft-day deal. The trade sends Charles Smith, 
the No. 3 pick by the 76ers, to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Today, when the nationally televised event occurs here at the Equitable Center 
at halftime of Game 1 of the Chicago Bulls-Detroit Pistons series, they are 
guaranteed no worse than the seventh pick among the nine teams in what has 
become a complicated process. 
</P>
<P>
Cards bearing the logos of the Clippers, Charlotte, Chicago -- the Bulls are 
the only playoff team in the lottery, taking the place of New Jersey as a 
result of the trade that sent Orlando Woolridge to the Nets in 1986 -- Dallas, 
Indiana, Miami, Sacramento, San Antonio and Washington will be placed in 
identical envelopes and sealed, placed in a clear container and mixed. Each 
team, in an order determined by a draw earlier in the day, will select one 
envelope. 
</P>
<P>
The first six envelopes will be placed on one side of the display board and 
will represent picks four through nine. The seventh envelope taken will be for 
draft spot No. 3, the eighth will be for No. 2 and the remaining for No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner David Stern will open the envelopes for picks four through nine, 
and the logos will be arranged in reverse order of the teams' regular-season 
record. The Clippers will have broken their tie with San Antonio -- both teams 
finished 21-61 -- earlier in the day. If they win the tie-breaker the Clippers 
be able to do no worse than sixth, by virtue of trailing only Miami and 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Stern will open, in order, envelopes No. 3, No. 2 and No. 1, keeping 
them in those spots for the June 27 draft. Orlando, Fla., and Minnesota, the 
expansion teams for 1989-90, fall 10th and 11th, the spots to be determined by 
a coin flip June 12. 
</P>
<P>
Steps will be taken to ensure that the Clippers continue their winning streak. 
Team President Alan Rothenberg will go to the same store, buy the same brand of 
fortune cookies and, along with his wife, break the 100 or so open. He got down 
to the last one a year ago and the message read, "Your fondest wish will come 
true." 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg: "You don't want to break up a winning combination." 
</P>
<P>
What could change is the Clippers' plan for the pick. Some teams have already 
made courtesy calls about trading for a prime position in the draft, but once 
the exact spot is determined today, conversations will begin in earnest. And 
the Clippers, who would like to add a shooting guard and some experience to go 
with a young team, will listen with great interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, there was no way we would deal the pick because of Danny," said 
General Manager Elgin Baylor, who will represent the Clippers at the drawing. 
"This year, we would certainly entertain trade talks. It hasn't been decided if 
we will move the pick because we don't know where it will be. But if we feel 
good enough about a deal, we certainly would move the pick." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers plan to renegotiate the contract of Ken Norman, who led the team 
in scoring last season while making only $300,000. No serious talks will begin 
until after the Clippers evaluate their draft, but management has contacted 
David Falk, Norman's agent. The Clippers hold a 1989-90 option on the 
third-year player, but would now like to give him a raise and an extension now.

SUNUP CAME LATE; 
</P>
<P>
WILY LAKERS GET OUT OF THE BLOCKS, MAKE PHOENIX CHASE THEM MOST OF THE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Phoenix Suns encountered a new kind of Laker Saturday. It had both of its 
eyes wide open, and fire in them. 
</P>
<P>
For a young team with one player who has ever been in a conference finals -- 
Tom Chambers, whose Seattle SuperSonics lasted four games against the Lakers in 
1987 -- this took some getting used to. By the time the Suns got their feet 
under them, the Lakers were ahead, 50-34, and the Suns were in for the uphill 
fight they ultimately lost, 127-119. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers? He shot five for 19 and had more than he could handle with James 
Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
Another big Sun, Eddie Johnson, went six for 16. Kevin Johnson, point guard and 
the team's heart and soul, went one for three in the first period with two 
turnovers, although he came back strongly after that. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I really needed to come out and kind of do a little extra because I 
have been here," Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I was pretty good about it. I was going to the hoop strong. I didn't 
think I was overly aggressive. Now, hopefully, I'll be able to go out and play 
the way I played all season. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had four or five shots that didn't go in early. I thought they were my 
normal shots. That happens. I think I could have a good game shooting those 
same shots." 
</P>
<P>
If he wanted to see shots go in, he didn't have to look any farther than the 
man he was guarding -- Worthy, who made 13 of 22 en route to scoring 32 points, 
with a vintage see-if-you-can-guess-where-I'm-going assortment of whirling 
moves in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Chambers had a good view for critical perspective. 
</P>
<P>
He rated it five stars, even to the point of agreeing that Worthy, at the top 
of his game, is unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
"One-on-one, yeah," Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are a lot of players in this league who are tough to stop 
one-on-one. You have to have help from your teammates. You have to do a good 
job of keeping yourself between him and the basket. You have to do a good job 
of moving your feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, he's as tough as anyone in the league when he's playing with that much 
enthusiasm and that much quickness. He wants the ball and he gets it and he 
does something with it. He never throws up a bad shot. If you double-team him, 
he passes it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so quick down on the block. You give him an inch and Magic (Johnson) will 
hit him. A lot of times, you can make a little mistake and it doesn't hurt 
because the point guard isn't going to see it, but not here. 
</P>
<P>
"James is really getting after it and giving them an inspiration, probably more 
so than anybody on their team." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Chambers' teammates also have to be ready to help guard Johnson, 
Byron Scott, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, A.C. Green, et al, so you begin to see the 
dimensions of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the somber Sun dressing room, there seemed to be a great reluctance 
to admit that they'd opened tight, even if they didn't get a shot off until 
their fourth possession, by which time the Lakers had two easy fast-break hoops 
and had flown to an 8-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, who are giving away all that experience, don't want to concede 
anything, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
"We came over here expecting to win," Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said. "We didn't 
come over for the weather. The weather's good in Phoenix." 
</P>
<P>
So why did the Suns start so slowly if they weren't tight? 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Lakers) seemed to be extremely ready for the game," Jeff Hornacek 
suggested. "We weren't ready at their level." 
</P>
<P>
Late in the afternoon, Fitzsimmons seemed to tire of the subject of Worthy's 
use of Chambers and conceded something, after all. 
</P>
<P>
"Worthy was very good, gentlemen," Fitzsimmons said. " So what else is new? 
Worthy is very good. I liked him when he was at North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"He was drafted No. 1, wasn't he? (Worthy was the top pick in the nation in 
1983). Jabbar was drafted No. 1, wasn't he? Magic was No. 1. Mychal (Thompson) 
was No. 1. Byron was picked fourth (on the first round in 1983). A.C. gets to 
be the overachiever. He was picked 20th (on the first round in 1985). They're 
good." 
</P>
<P>
As good as they are, the Suns caught the Lakers and went ahead in the fourth 
quarter, even if the Lakers did take the lead back, lose Magic Johnson on fouls 
with 2:23 left and won, going away. 
</P>
<P>
Color it a missed opportunity, Suns, who will be back at the Forum for Game 2 
Tuesday night. They dressed hurriedly and flew home to Phoenix, to practice in 
familiar surroundings, with equally nice weather.

SCOTT OSTLER: IN A BIND, WITH MAGIC OUT, LAKERS WERE BOUND TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Add to the Lakers' dazzling repertoire of moves and grooves this new one: 
</P>
<P>
Bonding. 
</P>
<P>
It's like what happens in the hip TV beer commercials, where a yuppie 
outdoorsman discovers the meaning of life while trout-fishing or rock-climbing 
with his male-model buddies in the only wilderness spot in the world not 
infested by mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
That's male-model bonding, that heartwarming mountain-top camaraderie. The 
Lakers now have a variation of it. Laker Coach Pat Riley explained it when 
talking about what happened when Magic Johnson fouled out with 2:23 left in the 
game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"When Magic went out," Riley said, "I really sensed the collective bonding of 
the guys on the floor. They were determined not to let that (Magic's untimely 
rest) deflate them." 
</P>
<P>
The deflatees, instead, were the Phoenix Suns, who lost the series opener, 
127-119. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got out-bonded," Sun Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said. Actually, Cotton 
didn't say that, but he should have. 
</P>
<P>
The scouting report on the Lakers now is: Cut off the outlet pass, don't let 
James Worthy post up low and don't let the Lakers bond. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Lakers' bonding could use a little work. Magic picked up his fifth 
foul when the Lakers were up by five points, and when he returned with 7:22 
left in the game, the Lakers were down by a point. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson immediately hit a long set shot for another Laker lead. After Magic 
fouled out, the Lakers held their own without their leader. There's bonding and 
then there's bonding. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, the Lakers have been bonding for years. We take you back briefly to 
Magic Johnson's first NBA game, 1979, against the then-San Diego Clippers. 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar hits a long sky hook to win the game at the buzzer, and 
Magic wraps Kareem in a huge bear hug, whirling him around midcourt like a 
waltzin' fool. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Big Fella," Magic probably told Kareem, "it doesn't get any better than 
this." 
</P>
<P>
To which Kareem replied, "If it doesn't, son, we'll both be out on the street 
soon, looking for real jobs." 
</P>
<P>
It did get better of course (although not for the Clippers). The last decade 
for the Lakers has been one long bond-a-thon. 
</P>
<P>
It's almost embarrassing. Other teams go through cycles, highs and lows, good 
seasons and bad. Remember the Boston Celtics? Remember the Utah Jazz? 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers continue to roll along at an alarmingly high level of performance. 
This was to be the season they would fade, with Kareem phasing out and everyone 
else getting too old or too jaded by success. 
</P>
<P>
So, guess which team has won 13 consecutive games, eight straight in the 
playoffs, and seems a good bet to advance to the NBA Finals again. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there's no overpowering indication that the Suns will be the team to 
un-bond the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the Suns play Game 2 right back at the Forum, where they haven't 
won since, I believe, 1922, when Kareem was a gleam in his grandfather's eye. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns must play Game 2 under Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons, who is 
0-for-Inglewood. He has brought various NBA teams to this city, played 34 games 
in this building, and lost each and every game. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton's record at the Forum is one that only Red Klotz could truly appreciate, 
Klotz being the lovable coach of the Washington Generals, who lost 9 zillion 
straight heartbreaking games to the Harlem Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton has done a near-miraculous job of building a basketball team out of the 
ruins of the Phoenix Suns, but when he comes to the Forum, he may as well try 
to outdance the Laker Girls. 
</P>
<P>
These are the Lakers, bond you very much, playing in their very own First 
Western Trust &amp; Loan Forum, or whatever it's called. They are very tough on 
their own floor. Home or away, they are bonding up a storm. 
</P>
<P>
Take Orlando Woolridge. Every basketball scouting report has a standard line 
that goes, "Don't let (fill in the blank) beat you." On the Lakers, the blank 
is Orlando Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
So Saturday, the Suns have cut the Laker lead to five with two minutes left and 
Magic has fouled out. Orlando misses a shot, Mychal Thompson rebounds, feeds to 
Orlando alertly cutting through the key, and Woolridge slams home a lefty dunk 
over Tom Chambers, gets fouled, hits the free throw, and the crowd goes wild as 
the Suns go back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that's Laker bonding, what Thompson and Woolridge did on that play. 
Woolridge, in fact, has finally become Lakerized. Six weeks ago, he couldn't 
get off the bench. He was all style and no substance. He was a candidate for 
NBA Disappointment of the Year, along with the Forum popcorn. Now he's a key 
guy off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"He went from being a home-run hitter to a guy who will take a walk, go for the 
single," Riley said. "He's not out there just worrying about awesome dunks." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, like a stray particle needed to accomplish table-top fusion, 
Woolridge has been sucked into the Laker chemistry. He has bonded onto the big 
purple molecule. 
</P>
<P>
And it's a molecule with momentum. Before Saturday's game, Riley pointed out 
that due to the nature of the Suns' spread-out offense, it was vital that the 
Lakers challenge any Suns driving to the hoop. So the Lakers swatted eight 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those blocks were on switch-offs, help-out situations where a Laker 
defender gets beat and his buddy slides over and smacks the ball away.

TRIP OF THE WEEK: ITALIAN FESTIVAL AT SANTA BARBARA'S OLD MISSION

SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Italian tradition comes to the steps of Santa Barbara's Spanish mission 
during the Memorial Day holiday, May 27 through May 29. Artists will cover the 
mission's asphalt piazza with more than 200 paintings, all created with colored 
chalk. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day display is the city's third Italian street-painting festival. 
Called "I Madonnari" in honor of the Italian name for street painters, it 
celebrates a tradition continued in Italy since the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Artists will be of all ages and every talent level. They are only limited by 
the size of the pavement "canvases" that measure from 4 x 6 to 12 x 12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Each painting is sponsored by individuals and businesses, with donations to the 
Children's Creative Project. The nonprofit program provides art experiences for 
elementary school children throughout Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Festival and Tour 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can watch the street artists create and afterward can view the 
completed works. Festivities include a street market with Italian foods and 
musical entertainment adjacent to the piazza. Hours are 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
If you go to the Madonnari festival, try to tour historic Mission Santa 
Barbara. In addition, visit the city's botanical garden and natural history 
museum, both nearby in the foothills behind the mission. 
</P>
<P>
To get to Mission Santa Barbara from Los Angeles, drive north on U.S. 101 to 
the Mission Street exit, go right about nine blocks to Laguna Street, then turn 
left to the mission grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Sited on a hillside two miles from the ocean, the mission was started 204 years 
ago on the feast day of St. Barbara. Its founder was Father Fermin Lasuen, 
Spanish-born successor to Junipero Serra, who died after establishing nine of 
Alta California's 21 missions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mission History 
</P>
<P>
The church that stands at Mission Santa Barbara was built from local sandstone 
in 1820. Earthquakes destroyed three adobe churches erected earlier by the 
Chumash Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The regal church is beyond a grassy expanse where the mission's cattle and 
sheep once grazed. A feature is the building's Roman facade, which was copied 
from an architect's book and crowned by twin towers. It's the only church in 
the mission chain with two towers. 
</P>
<P>
Visit the church and mission compound by walking beyond the Moorish fountain to 
the museum, where self-guided tours begin. Early day artifacts that recall the 
mission's past are displayed in eight rooms that were once living quarters for 
the padres. 
</P>
<P>
Continue to the courtyard, where Indians were taught to make leather footwear 
and woolen garments and practiced other trades. They also raised crops to feed 
the large Chumash population at the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Enter through a side door into the long church to see Mexican art from the 
1700s and 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Church Graveyard 
</P>
<P>
A side door, marked by skulls, leads to the cemetery with the vaults of padres 
and Santa Barbara pioneers, as well as the unmarked graves of about 4,000 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the cemetery gate, cross the road to view the stone ruins of the 
mission's aqueduct, water reservoir, grist mill and tanning vats. In front of 
the Moorish fountain is a lavanderia, where the Indian women washed clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Santa Barbara is open every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday mornings 
the church is used for services and closed to tours until 1 p.m. Admission is 
$1, children under 16 free. 
</P>
<P>
Drive to the right around the mission onto Mission Canyon Road that climbs up 
the Santa Ynez Mountain foothills. Look for signs and drive to the Santa 
Barbara Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marine Wonders 
</P>
<P>
Next to the parking lot is the 72-foot skeleton of a blue whale that washed 
ashore at Vandenberg Air Force Base in 1980. Other marine life, as well as 
animals, birds and insects, are on display inside the rambling Spanish-style 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The museum began in 1916 with a collection of bird eggs that was expanded into 
a notable exhibit of birds, including waterfowl found along California's 
shores. Also look for California's native wild animals displayed in lifelike 
dioramas. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian Hall has artifacts of various North American tribes and features the 
local Chumash. Special planetarium shows take place on Saturdays at 3 p.m. and 
Sundays at 1:30 and 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The natural history museum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sundays and 
holidays from 10 a.m. Admission is $3, teen-agers $2, under 12 years $1 on 
weekends and holidays; entry on other days is by donation. 
</P>
<P>
Drive back onto Mission Canyon Road and follow signs to continue north (with a 
brief jog on Foothill Road) to the tranquil Santa Barbara Botanical Garden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Education in Native Plants 
</P>
<P>
Covering 65 acres near Los Padres National Forest, the garden is devoted 
exclusively to the state's native trees, shrubs and wildflowers. In the garden 
shop are trail maps to the various plants. 
</P>
<P>
One walk covers a grove of coast redwoods, over a dam built in 1807 to supply 
water to the mission, then along Mission Creek and past desert flora back to 
the parking area. 
</P>
<P>
Free guided tours are offered Sundays and Thursdays at 10:30 a.m., with an 
extra tour Sundays at 2 p.m. The garden shop is open daily and has plants for 
sale Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are welcome at the botanical garden every day without charge from 8 
a.m. until dusk. However, no picnicking is permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Get dining and lodging information by calling (805) 965-3021. Or stop at the 
new Visitors Information Center at the corner of Santa Barbara Street and 
Cabrillo Boulevard (two blocks east of Stearns Wharf). Hours 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
daily. 
</P>
<P>

FOOTLOOSE: NICE HAS A STYLE AND AIR OF ROMANCE ALL ITS OWN 
</P>

NICE, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During this year's bicentennial celebration of the French Revolution you'll see 
and hear much of Marianne, the legendary heroine who waved the tricolor as she 
led insurgents against the troops of Louis XVI. 
</P>
<P>
But Nice has its own military heroine, Catarina Segurana, who during a 
16th-Century attack by Turks mounted the town ramparts and dispatched a couple 
of Barbarossa's troops with her carving knife. 
</P>
<P>
Catarina then spun on her heels, lifted her skirts and flashed total contempt 
toward the retreating infidels, a feat that caused locals to dedicate an 
enormous bas-relief plaque to the intrepid damsel. 
</P>
<P>
Nice has always had a full measure of Catarina's verve and derring-do, and an 
air of romance that caused Napoleon to propose to his landlord's daughter on a 
visit here. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? Its location on the ever-blue Baie des Anges is one of France's 
most spectacular settings, and the town's style can best be described as a 
year-round celebration, what with the renowned Nice Carnival, the Battle of 
Flowers, the concerts and jazz festivals and the costume parades and other 
hoopla that go on most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Toss in 15 art galleries, the Chagal, Matisse and a dozen other fine museums, 
plus a flower market in Old Town that alone is worth a visit, and you realize 
why Nice should be on anyone's itinerary of southern France. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly Air France nonstop to Paris or UTA nonstop from San 
Francisco. Several American and foreign carriers also fly to Paris with 
changes. Air France and Air Inter will get you to Nice in about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Our latest visit was three days and that seemed too short. 
Nice is loaded with good hotels in all price categories. Also a gamut of fine 
restaurants, but the prices can get scary. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: A dollar recently bought six francs. Visit any time from 
February's carnival until year's end. July-August is terribly crowded, 
September-October lovely. Le Petit Train leaves every 20 minutes to make the 
rounds of important stops in town (with guide) for about $3 U.S., with 
on-and-off privileges all day. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: The Primotel Suisse (15 Quai Rauba Capeu; $43-$51 double, a 
suite for four at $82) has the best view in town from the east end of Baie des 
Anges. It's anything but a motel, being a small older hotel that was renovated 
this year. Bedrooms are small, but freshly decorated in light blue and white, 
with fine baths. 
</P>
<P>
Plaisance (20 Rue de Paris; $38-$50 double, depending upon season) is in the 
heart of the shopping district and very popular. Again, rooms are small, but 
you get most of the amenities: hair dryer, TV, air conditioning and a room 
safe. Breakfast only. The manager is affable. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Nicea (6 Rue Miron; $41-$47 double) is in the same neighborhood as 
Plaisance and also serves breakfast only. Small bedrooms are very neat and 
fresh, but most only have showers. Take the old-fashioned cage elevator up to 
the sixth floor for a drink on the terrace overlooking the town. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Nice is rightfully known for its salad nicoise, a 
refreshing mix of cooked and raw vegetables capped with anchovies, tuna, black 
olives, capers and egg slices. 
</P>
<P>
Pissaladiere is a pizzalike tart of fried onions, anchovies and black olives. 
Just as favored is pan bagnat, an enormous sandwich bun filled with most of the 
salad nicoise ingredients and sprinkled with oil and vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
Another local specialty is socca, a pancake made of chickpea flour and either 
baked with bread crumbs and cheese topping or fried in olive oil. And there's a 
variety of fresh seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: La Belle Nicoise (in the Old Town flower market) is the place to 
head if you want all the Nice specialties. It's built into the old city walls, 
with vaulted ceilings kept bright by pastel colors, green vines climbing the 
walls and rustic blue furniture. 
</P>
<P>
The $15 menu we sampled offered fish soup or mussels, then a fillet of hake, 
mixed fried fish or an entrecote, followed by chevre or a dessert. Everything 
was prepared beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
La Baieta is the place for fish and other seafood in all its forms. You'll find 
20-plus varieties straight from the grill, pan or oven, plus bouillabaisse. 
Dine inside or outside in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
The brand-new La Reale (Primotel Suisse) is built into the walls of an old 
castle across from the bay. Crisp white linen and fresh carnations, and the 
menu presents three courses of assorted classic French dishes. A fine place. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Hotel Beau Rivage (24 Rue St. Francois de Paule; $133 
double) is a perfectly run hotel with a wonderful location, total comfort and 
superb dining. 
</P>
<P>
Beau Rivage is a step from its own private beach, with a restaurant by the 
water, another in the hotel that served us one of the best meals of our trip 
and a cooking school run by the renowned Roger Verge, who also supervises the 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Henri Matisse stayed here and painted "My Room at the Beau Rivage" in 1917. 
Director Pierre Constant came onto the scene much later, but he runs his hotel 
with the same deft hand, preserving a lightness of feeling and color that the 
painter achieved. 
</P>
<P>
Negresco (37 Promenade des Anglais; $216-$332 double) is the Grand Dame of Nice 
hotels, a turn-of-the-century palace as ornate outside as in. But what 
impressed us most was its Chantecler (one star) restaurant and new chef, 
Dominique Le Stanc. Le Stanc has cooked in seven restaurants with a total of 15 
Michelin stars, most of them in clusters of twos and threes, and all by the age 
of 30. 
</P>
<P>
We shan't forget the cannelloni stuffed with a fricassee of lobster, black 
olives, fennel and herbs. The pasta was made with finely ground black olives in 
the dough. Or a round of paper-thin potato slices layered and grilled with 
scallops, leeks and truffles. A fantastic meal. 
</P>
<P>
Elysee Palace (59 Promenade des Anglais; $130) is the brightest new star on 
Nice's hotel horizon, a modern-as-tomorrow place with gorgeous rooms and 
rooftop pool that still retains much of the intimacy and personal service of a 
small hotel. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Hop Le Petit Train for an overview of the town and its sights, 
then return to the colorful markets of Old Town, perhaps for lunch in one of 
its many good restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
We particularly enjoyed a stop at Nice's oldest shop for olives, oil, mountain 
honey and assorted herbs: Huiles d'Olives Alziari at 14 Rue St. Francois de 
Paule. And just around the corner, Caves Caprioclio is the town's oldest wine 
seller, with an endless display of Provencal wines from $2 on up. 
</P>
<P>
Stop at a tourist information office (5 Ave. Gustave V; another at the airport) 
for a brochure on Nice's museums and galleries. Deciding which to visit is a 
difficult choice in this art-rich city. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the French Government Tourist Office at (213) 
271-6665 and 272-2661, or write to 9454 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 303, Beverly 
Hills 90212 for a map/brochure of southeast France, including Nice.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: THE GLOBAL VILLAGE KEEPS SHRINKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're in downtown Istanbul, in a Bangkok hotel or at a remote ski lodge in 
Finland, and you're driving yourself crazy. Did the Lakers win last night? Did 
your favorite stock split? Did the space shuttle take off? What about the 
weather in Buffalo? 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, unless you invested in some expensive phone calls, you were out 
of touch. 
</P>
<P>
Not any more. With few exceptions, maintaining contact with your world at home 
-- and the world around you -- has become easy. 
</P>
<P>
A truly global village has been created by new technology, combined with the 
relaxation of broadcasting and publishing restrictions by many foreign 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers who need to know what's happening can now turn on, tune in and drop 
in on the world. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago intrepid voyagers who were news junkies had to carry bulky 
"transportable" (but not really portable) multiband radios to get a regular 
news fix. If atmospheric conditions were right they could pick up the BBC World 
News from London. 
</P>
<P>
Or, if they were in major European capitals such as London or Paris, they could 
pick up a copy of the International Herald Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Both BBC World News and the Herald Tribune can still be found; in fact, they're 
bigger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
The Herald Tribune prints 230,000 copies a day via satellite from 10 plants 
around the world. It arrives in most European capitals in the morning. In Asia 
it is at most newsstands and hotel kiosks by 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
There is some stiff competition, however. It's Cable News Network. Ted Turner's 
Atlanta-based CNN can be heard almost everywhere in Europe and in many parts of 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, after an 11-hour flight, I turned on my television set at 3 a.m. 
in a downtown Tokyo hotel room and watched the Iran-Contra hearings live on 
CNN. 
</P>
<P>
Last year I watched the National Basketball Assn. finals live from Stouffer 
Grand Beach Resort in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
And from a hotel room above the Arctic Circle I watched highlights of the 
National Football League championship games. 
</P>
<P>
New technology also has caught up with cruise ships. On the QE2 news is 
transmitted via satellite to the ship, where it is printed each day in the 
ship's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
High-tech radio also receives the BBC World News and other news programs, and 
is broadcast in cabins. Passengers can turn on their cabin televisions to 
receive the daily "Oceansat News Review." 
</P>
<P>
An experimental program for receiving satellite television news on the QE2 was 
scrapped recently because of poor quality. "We couldn't get a stable base for 
the satellite dish to always work," QE2 Capt. Alan Bennell said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're working to find a better receiver. Once that's in place, we'll be 
able to pick up just about anything from the satellites -- sporting events, 
major breaking news. What we've found is that our passengers all say they've 
come on board to get away from it all, and that's true. But it doesn't mean 
they want to be isolated from the news." 
</P>
<P>
Hotels throughout the world are upgrading their media capabilities. For 
example, Los Angeles' St. James's Club offers 55 video channels in its rooms. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that in hotels where CNN was offered, 84% of the guests 
watched the channel. (CNN delivers the service to hotels for about the same 
cost per room a day as a daily newspaper.) 
</P>
<P>
CNN has become the newest news empire overseas. And owner Turner has enlisted 
an unlikely ally in his drive to make CNN the international news service of 
record: the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
CNN has signed a deal to lease a transponder on a Soviet satellite orbiting 
over the Indian Ocean that will broadcast CNN's signal to India, Pakistan, 
Egypt and a few African nations. The Soviet Union could be the next receiver of 
the service. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was popular in Europe," said one European government official who 
followed the Soviet deal closely. "But it was already popular in Russia among 
government officials. The Soviets had been bootlegging the signal for their own 
use for years, and now they're just making it available to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon," he said, "there may be no need for Radio Free Europe."

YOUTH BEAT: STUDENT TOURS OF THE SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Independent travelers touring Europe on a budget can join economical 
English-language tours into the Soviet Union through two Scandinavian youth 
travel bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
Between June and September the Scandinavian Student Travel Service will operate 
6 to 13 night tours. The international programs attract people from a variety 
of English-speaking countries. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations are provided in two- or three-bed rooms; meals and sightseeing 
are included. 
</P>
<P>
There will be seven departures for a six-night tour of Moscow and Leningrad. If 
you join the program in Copenhagen, the cost is $695 U.S.; from Leningrad the 
price is $405. 
</P>
<P>
The programs usually fill up about three weeks before departure. You can make 
arrangements through many European student travel agencies by contacting SSTS's 
retail travel office, DIS Rejser, at Skindergade 28, DK-1159, Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
Each summer Travela, the travel service of the Finnish youth hostel 
association, offers weekly budget programs to Moscow and Leningrad. You can 
contact Travela at Mannerheimintie 5 (about a block from the Helsinki rail 
station). It takes at least a week to make visa arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The travel service of the Danish youth hostel association reports that it is 
operating a new youth hostel in Greenland. 
</P>
<P>
The building, within walking distance of the international airport at 
Narsarsuaq, is owned by the Greenlandic Sheep Farmers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
It's a modern, Scandinavian-style building with four four-bed rooms, two 
eight-bed rooms and a kitchen. Some tourist information also is provided. 
</P>
<P>
It will open for the summer on June 20. When a staff person is not there, a key 
is left at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
This summer, budget travelers will find 17 youth hostels and 29 hotels, homes 
and schools offering low-cost sleeping-bag accommodations in Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
Budget travelers on arrival in Reykjavik can head for the youth hostel at 
Laufasvegur 41 in the center of the city. There are budget accommodations and a 
travel service that can help make arrangements to visit other areas of the 
island country. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you can arrange a short bus trip, plus a three-hour ferry ride, to 
Heimaey, one of the 15 volcanic Westman Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Heimaey, with a population of 5,000, is Iceland's largest fishing port. It has 
an intriguing, turbulent history. In 1627, 250 of its 500 residents were 
carried off by African pirates. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973 more than 300 homes were destroyed by a volcanic eruption. Residents 
were moved off the island for a year and a television camera was placed on top 
of a mountain beside the village. 
</P>
<P>
After regular television programming signed off each night, a switch was 
flipped and the displaced villagers were able to watch Mother Nature's 
production. You can still see homes half-buried by the lava flows. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the round trip by bus and boat, plus a night at the Heimaey youth 
hostel, is 111 German marks (about $62 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
At the travel office you can also buy a Circlepass (valid for travel in one 
direction around the main island), plus vouchers for seven nights of hostel or 
sleeping-bag accommodations for 404 marks (about $226 U.S.). This is only 
available from June 1 to Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Another option is an Omnibuspass that allows travel in any direction for seven 
days, plus seven vouchers for sleeping-bag accommodations. The price is 444 
marks. You can buy the pass from May 15 to Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>

SAN JOSE, Costa Rica 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We sat in the waters of a swimming pool near La Fortuna, our eyes on Mt. 
Arenal, a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a pool watching a mountain may not sound very exotic, but when that 
mountain is an active volcano, it evokes more than just your normal emotions. 
</P>
<P>
It was dusk. Though the top of the mountain was covered with clouds, we could 
see little puffs of steam rolling down its sides. As daylight faded, color 
emerged. 
</P>
<P>
The clouds surrounding the cone sporadically took on a rosy glow, and soon the 
puffs of steam turned fiery red -- ribbons of molten lava oozed down the 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning we went to the piedmont of Mt. Arenal and climbed part way up. 
It was still active, but we now could hear as well as see it. 
</P>
<P>
With irregular frequency we heard loud thunderclaps, followed by a noise 
similar to that made by corn popping. But these were not tasty little morsels, 
they were rocks and lava ejected from the core of the volcano. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bouncing Rocks 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the rocks fell close enough for us to see them bounce; mostly we saw 
only puffs of steam descending from the convulsive turmoil above us. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens of the inaptly named La Fortuna, which lies in the path of this 
restive volcano, go about their lives with a remarkable equanimity, despite 
periodic eruptions up to a mile high, the last one in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
We slept without a worry in the small, new Motel San Bosco in La Fortuna, after 
congratulating ourselves on the reasonable price -- only $6 U.S. a night for 
three of us in an exceptionally clean room with bath. 
</P>
<P>
Active volcanoes, each spectacular in its own way, are commonplace in Central 
America. We visited several during our stay, but none put on a show like Mt. 
Arenal's. 
</P>
<P>
Several are alarmingly close to heavily populated areas. Only a few miles from 
San Jose, the capital, is Irazu. It greeted President John F. Kennedy's arrival 
with an unexpected salute in March, 1963, and has erupted several times since. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, and easily accessible from the city, is volcano Poas, with two craters 
-- one a beautiful, emerald-green lake, the other ominously steaming. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the volcanoes, this little country the size of West Virginia is a 
bonanza for nature freaks of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
Though only 10 degrees north of the Equator, the climate in San Jose is mild, 
averaging 72 degrees all year. In a valley about 3,500 feet above sea level, 
the city is surrounded by mountains, some of which are more than two miles 
high. 
</P>
<P>
The country has two seasons -- wet and dry. Even during the rainy winters, 
morning sunlight is the norm. My hosts, a son and daughter-in-law in Costa Rica 
on sabbaticals, preferred the winter because of its lush greenery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hotel Prices 
</P>
<P>
In San Jose, deluxe resort hotels are $40 to $150 a night. First-class hotels, 
mostly downtown, cost $22 to $85. Apartment hotels are $175 to $200 a week, or 
$500 to $800 a month. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, some very economical places, but they may or may not have 
their own bathrooms, and their cleanliness is sometimes suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Though we ate many of our meals at home -- the market is filled with delicious 
tropical fruits and vegetables, as well as fresh fish and shellfish -- we had 
our favorite places for eating out. 
</P>
<P>
Sodas are fast-food places, and the one we returned to time and again was Soda 
Tapia. Its arreglados -- delicious hamburger-type sandwiches -- followed by a 
fabulous ice cream with fresh-fruit dessert, is a must. The arreglado costs 
about $1.25, and the dessert $2 to $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
Two good hotels, the Amstel and the Bougainvillea, serve excellent meals for 
about $10. Steak dinners at Las Cascadas also cost about $10. For quiet 
elegance, Chalet Suizo is highly recommended. Prices, of course, vary, 
depending on what one orders, but they are generally somewhat below stateside 
prices and they include a 10% tip and tax. 
</P>
<P>
Curio shops abound in San Jose, and many of the outlying villages sell their 
own specialties. Sarchi, about half an hour's drive from the capital, is great 
for wooden handicrafts -- everything from jewelry to furniture to Costa Rica's 
famous, brightly painted wagons. Leather craft also is popular and can be found 
in most curio shops. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee is an excellent buy, whether whole beans or ground. It makes a great 
gift, especially with one of the little coffee makers called a choreador. 
</P>
<P>
It consists of a wooden stand, like a small easel, from which is suspended a 
cloth bag through which one pours boiling water over ground coffee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potpourri of Creatures 
</P>
<P>
Nature buffs are offered a potpourri of native creatures, including tropical 
fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals and insects. We found them 
everywhere -- in cloud forests, tropical rain forests, dry forests, on the 
plains and at the seashore. 
</P>
<P>
Water sports and nature go hand in hand. White-water rafting on the Reventazon 
River combines an exciting and thrilling adventure with superb scenery. These 
trips cost $59 to $65 a day, depending on which river and what is supplied. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing trips can be arranged through fishing lodges or tour companies in San 
Jose. They start at about $125 a day, including boat, guide, room and all 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
A room with bath at the Hotel Cahuita cost $20 for the three of us. After 
signing in, we went to nearby Puerto Viejo for a superb lobster dinner at 
Stanford's Lobster Cafe. The lobsters were caught that night after we had 
ordered them, and the delicious dinner cost only $8 for three. 
</P>
<P>
Within 24 hours of a swim in the Caribbean, including a brief stop at our San 
Jose headquarters for camping gear, we were bathing in the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is considered the most beautiful beach in Costa Rica and because its 
campsites cost only $1 a night, Manuel Antonio is always crowded. But we found 
a space, and though early -- not yet 7 p.m. -- it was dark; a year-round 
equinox prevails this close to the Equator. 
</P>
<P>
One national park worth visiting is Tortuguero. A tour bus from San Jose took 
us to Moin, a village on the Caribbean side, where we boarded the Mawamba, a 
river launch, for a seven-hour jungle trip to our lodgings at Sabina's Cabinas. 
</P>
<P>
Tours to Tortuguero cost $75 to $100 per person for a weekend, including meals. 
The round trip on the launch costs $16 a person, and Sabina charges $6 to 
$12.50 for a double, per night. 
</P>
<P>
Several endangered species are protected in Tortuguero, among them the manatee, 
great green macaw, migrant peregrine falcon, tapir and cougar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deeper Into the Inlets 
</P>
<P>
You can't see all of them from the river launch, nor were we lucky enough to 
see very many, but at the lodge we engaged a boatman and his cayuca, a small 
native boat, to take us deeper into the narrow inlets. 
</P>
<P>
In a tree, neatly camouflaged by dappled sunlight, hung a jaguar, enjoying a 
few winks as we glided silently past him. 
</P>
<P>
Tortuguero also is famous for the giant turtle. Envied by other naturalists is 
the traveler who can be around to watch these amphibians lumbering out of the 
Caribbean to dig their nests and lay their eggs in the sand, and two months 
later be present when the hundreds and hundreds of tiny offspring hatch and 
make their perilous journey to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
In Monteverde, a wildlife preserve, we stayed at the Quetzal Inn. It costs 
about $19 a night per person, including three family-style meals. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the host's interest in bird watching -- he has a delightful nook in 
the garden with a small pool, surrounding by bird feeders -- Audubon tours and 
groups of biologists frequent the place. 
</P>
<P>
From the porch we watched hummingbirds and songbirds and a few squirrels and 
rabbits. The highlight of our bird watching, however, was in the adjacent cloud 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
There we saw the shy, elusive quetzal, which does not survive in captivity, so 
can be seen only in its native habitat. 
</P>
<P>
A soft, fuzzy-looking crest and a smooth cowl, both jade green, blend into a 
brilliant red breast. The shorter tail feathers are white, but are topped by 
others that are long and of the same jewel-like jade green. Her shorter tail 
easily distinguishes the female from her mate. 
</P>
<P>
The quetzal is considered one of the world's most beautiful birds. But it is 
only one of many; the tropical forest teems with a wide variety, their songs 
and calls filling the air. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more exotic are toucans, cockatoos, parrots, macaws, orpendulas 
(weaver birds) and mot-mots. 
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of species of native orchids in Costa Rica, both parasitic 
and free-growing, in a variety of sizes and colors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wild Flowers 
</P>
<P>
Multihued impatiens grows wild, vying with ferns as they carpet the shoreline 
and the sides of cliffs near streams and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Bougainvillea, poinsettia, Mexican creeper, wild roses -- on and on -- blooms 
both dazzling and delicate delight the eye wherever it rests. 
</P>
<P>
Bright colors are not confined to flowers and birds. 
</P>
<P>
Some trees are spectacular because of their height, soaring as much as 200 
feet; others produce blooms so beautiful that they leave one awe-struck -- gold 
showers, white, blue, incredible reds, oranges and purples. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the world's most sought-after woods come from these tropics -- teak, 
rosewood, mahogany. They are the source of medicines, resins, nuts, fruits and 
other useful products. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is served by several airlines. The country's own national line is 
LACSA, which charges $400 round trip from Los Angeles to San Juan. Mexicana 
costs $600 round trip, while Pan Am is $632 to $645. 
</P>
<P>
Resort hotels in San Jose cost from $80-$135 per night, single or double. Most 
feature horseback riding, golf, tennis, saunas, swimming and casino gambling. 
Included are the hotels Carinari, Aurola (a Holiday Inn), Corobici, Sheraton 
Herradura and the La Mariposa Hotel at Manuel Antonio Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Less luxurious, but comfortable and conveniently located, are several San Jose 
hotels priced at $40-$80, including the hotels Irazu, Torremolinos and 
Bouganvillea, and the historic, 100-year-old Gran Hotel Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
For under $40 a night, there are several good ones -- the Ambassador, Balmoral, 
Don Carlos, Amstel and Presidente. 
</P>
<P>
As for dining, try Rias Bajas, which specializes in seafood. Dinner, with wine, 
runs $20 and up. Others, also in the $20-$25 price range, include La Coq Hardi, 
L'll de France, Greta's and Chalet Suizo. Less expensive restaurants ($5-$10, 
including wine) are the Lucas, Lancaster and Balcon de Europa. 
</P>
<P>
Several rivers offer white-water rafting. Tours on the Reventazon, Sarapiqui 
and Corobici, all class 2 and 3 rivers, cost $74-$85, and include a guide. 
</P>
<P>
EcoTours, an agency of the Costa Rica Tourist Board in Los Angeles, offers a 
basic tour -- San Jose Delight -- for $549 per person, double occupancy. The 
price includes air fare, seven nights at the Ambassador Hotel, transfers to and 
from the airport, and a half-day tour of San Jose. It's a great way to become 
acquainted with the country. Call toll-free (800) 882-1885 or (213) 385-1215.

KEEPING HEALTHY: PACK LIGHT AND LOOSE FOR PROTECTION FROM A TROPICAL SUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. KARL NEUMANN, Neumann is a Forest Hills, N.Y., pediatrician who writes 
on travel-related matters. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When packing for a cruise in the tropics, don't just pack for fashion. Pack for 
protection. The sun can do damage to skin unaccustomed to too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
This is especially important in late winter and early spring when protective 
tans from the previous summer are gone. Then, even half an hour of morning or 
late-afternoon sun can result in a burn. 
</P>
<P>
Sunburn is the most common condition treated by ships' physicians. This is 
because on a cruise, a good portion of time spent in the sun is spent near the 
water. Because sun reflects off water the rays can come at you from all angles, 
thus increasing your sun exposure. Using sunscreens and wearing sunglasses 
helps, as does wearing the correct clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the weave of the fabric and the color of the material. The garments 
most travelers pack, items light in color and wide in weave, often are least 
suitable for tropical cruises. Such fabrics do not offer adequate protection. 
</P>
<P>
Dyed fabric generally blocks more ultraviolet rays than undyed, and the thicker 
the fabric, the better the protection. 
</P>
<P>
As a test, hold garments up to a light bulb before you pack them. The more 
opaque the better. If the garment allows too much light through, it may permit 
an unhealthy amount of ultraviolet light to reach the skin, according to the 
University of California, Berkeley, Wellness Letter. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just the pain of sunburn that should be of concern. Recent 
research suggests that a rapidly acquired sunburn may suppress your immune 
system and cause skin infections or cold sores by activating latent viruses. 
</P>
<P>
Tightly woven cottons offer better protection than tightly woven 
nylon/polyester knits. The best cottons are tightly woven blue denim, dark 
whipcords and other dark cottons, according to the Wellness Letter. 
</P>
<P>
Such materials have a sun protection factor (SPF) of more than 1,000, allowing 
just 0.1% of the ultraviolet light to pass through. A loosely knitted nylon 
jersey has an SPF of 4 and allows 24% of the ultraviolet light through. Good 
sunscreens give you an SPF of at least 15. 
</P>
<P>
Garments should fit loosely to allow air to circulate. This helps keep you 
cool. And try to stay dry. Wetness greatly decreases a fabric's ability to 
protect. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to proper clothing, tightly-woven hats and parasols are useful. 
Choose a hat with a broad brim, a high dome and holes for ventilation. No need 
to pack these, though. They are readily available at most ports of call and 
generally are inexpensive.

CRUISE VIEWS: NEW STAR PRINCESS CRUISING TOWARD ALASKAN SEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Star Princess -- newest and largest ship in the Princess fleet -- will call 
at Los Angeles Saturday after a 14-day transcanal cruise from its winter base 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,470-passenger, 63,254-ton ship, part of the cruise line featured in the 
"Love Boat" television series, will continue to San Francisco. From there, it 
will journey to Alaska and Canada on 12-day, round-trip cruises beginning May 
29. 
</P>
<P>
The Star Princess already was under construction under another name as Sitmar's 
FairMajesty when that line was acquired by Princess/P&amp;O last summer. Many 
passengers had booked the inaugural cruise before the new name and logo were 
painted on the ship at Chantiers de l'Atlantique Shipyard in St. Nazaire, 
France. 
</P>
<P>
The Star Princess is not intended to duplicate either the Royal Princess or the 
former Fairsky, now the Sky Princess. Instead, it has been designed to appeal 
more to younger passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The Lido pool deck runs most of the length of the vessel and features two large 
swimming pool areas spanned by a raised sunning deck. The Oasis pool has a 
waterfall and an in-pool bar, while the Paradise pool is flanked by four 
Jacuzzis. Additional lounge chairs and shaded tables surround the area and the 
balcony deck above. 
</P>
<P>
At the stern of the spacious outdoor deck, Cafe Cornucopia serves breakfast, 
lunch, tea and midnight snacks, with two buffet service lines and plenty of 
tables inside and out. Pronto Pizzeria and a bar called Characters, 
specializing in brightly colored drinks in gigantic glasses, are on the 
opposite end of the deck. 
</P>
<P>
The directional signs throughout the ship are readable and specific, making it 
easy to get around despite the ship's size. 
</P>
<P>
In the three-deck atrium, a huge stainless-steel kinetic sculpture, created by 
artist George Baker, dominates the open area around the curved stairway. It is 
flanked by shops on two levels and a pastry shop and cafe-bar called La 
Patisserie. 
</P>
<P>
The latter is an ideal spot for people-watching, and in the evening the area 
doubles for dancing with live music. Entertainment includes four production 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
Star Princess cabins each contain a built-in safe, a hair dryer, a refrigerator 
and a mini-bar, plus plenty of wardrobe space. Fifty suites and mini-suites 
have private balconies with chairs and tables, and 10 cabins have been designed 
with extra-wide doors and no sills or thresholds to make access easy for 
wheelchair passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Per-diem prices, including air fare, for the 10-day Caribbean sailings this 
fall and winter range from $196 per person, double occupancy, for an inside 
cabin with two lower beds, to $391 for an outside suite with a veranda. 
</P>
<P>
The Alaska prices, including air fare, range from $209 to $428 per day. The 
suites include a mini-bar that is restocked daily with complimentary drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Book three or more months in advance and you'll get a substantial discount. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an abundance of public space, the ship does not have a small, quiet bar 
with charm. All the lounges, even the classy Vineyard, are open to traffic flow 
and are much too bright and noisy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the dining room did not immediately settle into the kind of 
high-quality restaurant for which Princess has been known. Service was spotty, 
and many dishes seemed over-sauced. 
</P>
<P>
But these failings can be corrected. More important for the passenger are the 
vast deck areas and the spacious cabins.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: ANTWERP'S DESIGNERS MAKE IT A FASHIONABLE PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When clothing fashioned by young Belgian designers attracted international 
attention at this spring's Paris shows, the success surprised some. 
</P>
<P>
To others -- especially couture watchers following the ascending reputation of 
the clothing design program at Antwerp's Koninklijke Academie Voor Schonen 
Kunsten (the Royal Academy of Fine Arts), Mutsaertstraat 31, 2000 Antwerp, 
Belgium -- the applause was earned. 
</P>
<P>
A tradition of excellence at this respected fine arts school goes back about 
325 years. The academy's student roster includes famous artists, Vincent Van 
Gogh being the best known. 
</P>
<P>
These days, however, it is the academy's avant-garde fashion institute that is 
inspiring acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
The institute is producing some of Europe's hottest young designers, and 
they've turned the charming port city of Antwerp, about 30 miles north of 
Brussels, into a thriving center of haute couture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six Top Designers 
</P>
<P>
The top six Belgian designers riding the crest of the wave were graduated from 
the academy in 1982. They are Anne Demeulemeester, Walter Van Beirendonck, 
Marina Yee, Dirk Van Saene, Dirk Bikkembergs and Dries Van Noten. 
</P>
<P>
They, along with others who were graduated in subsequent years, have 
established headquarters and/or boutiques in Antwerp, although they also sell 
in boutiques in Brussels and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Most famous and sought-after is Anne Demeulemeester. She shows at Louis 
(Lombardenstraat 2), an Antwerp boutique dedicated to Belgium's haute 
designers. Demeulemeester works in wools, in rayon and acetate fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
Black is her favorite color, but she also uses earth tones and splashes of 
bright highlights. 
</P>
<P>
Her collection includes finely tailored culottes (about $300 U.S.) to be worn 
with form-fitting backless jackets (about $450). Attractive culotte dresses 
(about $450) are made of eyelet knits in unusual patterns. Short black or 
maroon sweaters (about $250) are designed to reveal midriffs and fit like a 
glove. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boxlike Shapes 
</P>
<P>
Demeulemeester also designs fabulous accessories, including leather handbags, 
from roomy, well-tailored envelopes to large, unusual and asymmetrical boxlike 
shapes (about $300 and up). Broad and narrow belts come plain (about $70 and 
up) or with convenient hard-sided pouches (about $200). Demeulemeester's hats, 
straw helmets to bonnets, are perfect for topping off her chic and sassy 
ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
Louis also is the Antwerp outlet for Dirk Bikkembergs' trendy, sometimes exotic 
men's fashions. His cool, woolen double-breasted jacket (about $800) is 
emblazoned with a dragon applique. Another jacket has tuxedo elements imposed 
on its otherwise straight lines (about $760), and an unusual red tuxedo jacket 
with fringe (about $780) can be worn with white linen trousers with a red 
elastic waistband (about $260) for dress-up or with jeans for attitude. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asymetrical Styling 
</P>
<P>
Two-tone shirts in blue and maroon (about $230) have oddly asymmetrical 
styling, and a light blue raincoat (about $550) is a handsome cover-up for rain 
or shine. 
</P>
<P>
Dirk Van Saene's elegant women's wear, also in stock at Louis, includes 
distinctively silhouetted bell-bottom slacks (about $200) to be worn with white 
or purple cotton blouses with gauze sleeves (about $200), or form-fitting 
jerseys in bright solid colors or stripes (about $100). 
</P>
<P>
Walter Van Beirendonck, known simply as Walter and considered the most 
avant-garde among Belgian designers, makes eccentric sweaters, shorts and pedal 
pushers. 
</P>
<P>
His collection is available at Closing Date (Korte Gasthuisstraat 15), a 
boutique specializing in knitwear and jeans by top, trendy international 
designers (including Katherine Hamnett and Vivienne Westwood, among others). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pedal Pushers 
</P>
<P>
Especially popular are Walter's vibrantly-colored and sculptural fish-scale, 
snake or brick-patterned bulkies and King-Kong theme sweaters (about $180 and 
up). Matching pedal pushers (about $140) have bright red knee patches. There 
are also wild-looking striped shorts and T-shirts covered with hand patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Dries Van Noten has his own boutique at Nieuwe Gaanderij 63, with men's and 
women's styles shown on opposite sides of the shop. Men's ensembles feature 
jackets with striped sleeves (about $560), contrasting vests (about $30) and 
striped cotton trousers (about $200). 
</P>
<P>
Men's wash-and-wear silk sport shorts (about $250) can be worn with 
wash-and-wear silk shirts (about $300) that are fastened with silk frog clasps, 
and/or cardigan-like sweat shirts that are fastened in front with shoelace ties 
(about $135). 
</P>
<P>
For women there are bolero jackets (about $440), high-waisted culottes (about 
$250), comfortable and easy-to-wear washable silk pleated-front trousers (about 
$300) and matching long-sleeved shirts (about $250) with brass buttons. Navy 
and white are favored colors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Touches 
</P>
<P>
Marina Yee's collection is sold at Bellissimo! (Ommeganckstraat 2A). Yee uses 
subtle pinks, subdued grays and other quiet, ultra-feminine colors to create 
flattering skirt and blouse ensembles (about $350 and up) in silks and flowing 
synthetic fabrics. Many of the styles have unusual touches, such as buttons 
placed to fasten jackets in a somewhat jaunty, uneven manner (about $400), and 
skirts with slightly asymmetrical hems. 
</P>
<P>
Coccodrillo (Huidevettersstraat Nieuwe Gaanderij 48) sells stunning women's 
shoes by Demeulemeester, including white dressy oxfords with pointed toes and 
square heels (about $200 and up), and men's shoes by Dirk Bikkembergs, 
including woven black suede dress slippers (about $155 and up). 
</P>
<P>
The academy program that trained these innovative Antwerp couturiers, and more 
recent graduates who are sure to impact the fashion world, takes four years to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
The students' collections are presented at the academy's annual springtime 
fashion shows, where the designs are unusual. For example, men's tuxedo jackets 
may have bustle backs and detachable sleeves that cling to the upper arm with 
elastic. Women's rain slickers may have extra bits of belting that tie around 
the body to make the coat look like a straight jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, all this experimenting and exaggerated style eventually transforms 
itself into innovative yet commercially viable, finelytailored, wearable 
clothing, all of which is helping to bring fashion fame to Antwerp.

FOR TEACHERS IN TIJUANA, LIFE HAS BECOME A HARD LESSON IN POVERTY 
</P>

<P>
Public school instructors in the United States say they have been historically 
underpaid, as demonstrated most recently by the teachers strike in Los Angeles. 
But most can generally expect to have achieved a measure of financial 
stability, albeit not complete independence, after two decades in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Not so Jaime Chollet Silva, an elementary school teacher here for 23 years, who 
was among the hundreds of thousands of instructors throughout Mexico who walked 
off their jobs en masse last month. 
</P>
<P>
To supplement his salary, Chollet works a double shift as an elementary school 
teacher here and, on weekends, puts in time as an exterminator. Three years 
ago, things got so bad that he crossed the border and headed for Los Angeles, 
where he worked for a year as an undocumented laborer, cleaning bathrooms and 
performing other menial tasks before returing to his family here. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a difficult decision for me, as a professional person, to go to the 
north and do that kind of work, but I felt that I had little choice," Chollet 
recalled last week as he gathered with other instructors at a largely deserted 
elementary school. "Hardly anyone can make a living just as a teacher in 
Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mexico's seemingly interminable economic crisis has clearly hit the 
poor hardest, the nation's middle classes have also been devastated, and 
perhaps no professionals have seen their standards of living decline as 
precipitously as teachers. Instructors say their real earnings have dropped by 
more than half since 1982, when the Mexican economy began to nose-dive and 
inflation began to surge. 
</P>
<P>
One former university professor recalled how his salary dipped from more than 
$400 a week in 1981, before the great peso devaluations, to less than $100 a 
week in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although no one ever got rich as a public-school teacher north of the 
border, the profession has been making a lot of people poor in Mexico in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In Tijuana, elementary and junior high school teachers earn about $50 a week. 
Striking Los Angeles teachers earn about $450 a week, spread over a full year, 
a beginning salary that amounts to about $23,400 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican instructors, once able to afford cars, houses and a modicum of a 
middle-class life style, now must scramble just to meet rent and mortgage 
payments and put food on the table. Most work double shifts to supplement their 
income. Often, they do triple time, filling in at universities and private 
schools. Many work weekends in assorted jobs, vending tacos, driving taxis, 
painting houses, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
A good number, particularly along the border, have given up the profession 
altogether and have taken menial jobs in the United States, while others use 
their summer vacations to find work in the north, supplementing their meager 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've been teaching, I would say half of my colleagues have left the 
profession," said Rafael Navarro, who has been an elementary school teacher for 
12 years. "They just couldn't afford it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Added Ignacion Montes, a 22-year-veteran, "It's an honorable profession, but we 
haven't been treated honorably." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers' rapidly declining standard of living prompted almost 1 million 
instructors nationwide to stage a wildcat walkout a month ago. The work 
stoppage was not approved by the teachers union leadership, whom many 
grass-roots instructors accuse of corruption and failure to look out for 
members' interests. Along with a 100% pay raise, school workers have demanded 
greater democratization of the Mexico City-based teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Increase Sought 
</P>
<P>
Most of the nation's instructors returned to the classrooms in recent weeks, 
after the government authorized a 25% raise, but in Tijuana and other areas, 
the work stoppage continued through much of last week. Tijuana's 11,000 or so 
preschool, elementary and junior high teachers are demanding a "preferential" 
border salary -- perhaps another 25% increase -- to compensate for the high 
cost of living along the international frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Most Tijuana teachers are expected to return to the classrooms this week, but 
they say their fight for higher wages will continue. There are threats of 
another walkout and even more severe actions -- possibly occupation of 
buildings -- after May 31. The school year ends June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"The lucha (battle) goes on," said Jorge Ojeda, a 23-year veteran of the 
Tijuana school system and a spokesman for the rebel instructors. "We have yet 
to receive a response that deals adequately with the needs of the teachers. We 
are looking for nothing more than to live with a certain dignity." 
</P>
<P>
That dignity is often not present in the classrooms, teachers say. Because of 
budget constraints, educators say it is not unusual for schools to be short on 
basic supplies, such as chalk and blackboards. Classrooms are sometimes packed 
with as many as 50 students. Some schools have had to operate without running 
water or electricity, occasionally prompting authorities to suspend classes. 
Parents and teachers have traditionally chipped in to improve the physical 
plants, but educators say the need to work so many hours has inevitably cut 
into their commitment to individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
What has ultimately suffered, teachers here say, is the quality of schooling. 
"Unfortunately, all of this has repercussions in education," said Ojeda. "If a 
professor has problems, if he's unable to buy food for his family, or pay his 
bills, how can his work be excellent?" 
</P>
<P>
The work stoppage has played havoc with the lives of parents here, many of whom 
work while their children are in the classroom. Although voicing worry about 
their children's missed time in school, most parents, themselves well-versed in 
economic hardship, appear supportive of the teachers. Many marched alongside 
them during several recent large-scale protests here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Just Fight 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers' fight is a just one," said Antonio Cureses, whose daughter has 
missed school during the work stoppage. "Not all teachers are saints, but 
mostly they try to do a good job. We all lose out if the good ones cannot 
afford to go on teaching and must find other work." 
</P>
<P>
During the past month, there has been little teaching but much spirited 
discussion on the grounds of most public schools here and in much of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, the teachers of the elementary school Defensores de Baja 
California, in a poor neighborhood called Colonia Obrera, gathered in an office 
in the otherwise largely deserted campus and spoke of their problems. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Chollet Silva spoke of his weekend job as an exterminator, and of his 
time in Los Angeles cleaning bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Sanchez, a teacher for a dozen years and one of the leaders of the 
work-stoppage movement, said he is considering working in San Diego during the 
summer to enable him to make some additions to his home. His wife is also a 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"Our salaries are hardly enough to meet our basic needs," said Sanchez. Later, 
he drove off in a 1977 Volkswagen bug. He said he had saved 1 1/2 years to 
purchase it, although he bought it used and battered. "Ten years ago," he said, 
"in a month's work, you earned enough to put down a car payment. All that's 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
Another teacher, Maria Angelina Diaz Ortega, said she would like to retire, but 
retirement benefits -- 80% of pay -- would hardly leave her enough to pay her 
bills. "I've reached a point in life where I'd like to relax and enjoy my 
family, but I can't do it," said Diaz, who has taught here almost 30 years. She 
spoke of other colleagues with 40 years of experience who also cannot afford to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
The principal, Juan Manuel Colado, said salaries are so low that school 
administrators like himself only earned a few dollars more a day than his 
teaching colleagues. "It doesn't pay anymore to seek extra training, extra 
education," said Colado, an educator here for 15 years. "You can imagine that 
effect that has on the schools." 
</P>
<P>
On the school grounds, a hand-written sign hung on a classroom building alerts 
readers of a charity group's reduced-cost sales of staples, including cooking 
oil, bread, flour and pasta. Designed for poor neighborhood residents, the 
weekly sales are also attracting some of Tijuana's less traditional 
impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
"The sales help me keep down costs," explained Jose Calderon de la Barca, an 
elementary school teacher for 15 years in Tijuana. "I always go."

WATER, WATER (NOT) EVERYWHERE;

<P>
PUSH IS ON TO RECLAIM SEWAGE, KEEP COUNTY FROM DRYING UP 
</P>

<P>
Here's a quiz: By the year 2010, where does San Diego County plan to locate an 
extra 180 million gallons of critically needed water every day? 
</P>
<P>
A. In Northern California reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
B. In the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
C. In the toilets, washing machines, dishwashers and sinks of county homes and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
If you picked "C," swim to the head of the class. 
</P>
<P>
A thirsty San Diego's share of Northern California reservoirs and the Colorado 
River will remain the same during the next 20 years as population continues to 
grow. So water districts throughout San Diego County are poised to embark on an 
unprecedented drive to build one of the nation's most ambitious water 
reclamation systems to save much of the waste water that now pours into the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by an unusual spectrum of interest groups that ranges from 
environmentalists to the building industry, local officials are planning 
reclamation projects that in 20 years will convert sewage into 13% of the 
county water supply. 
</P>
<P>
"It's implicit that we're not going to get more water," said John Foley, 
chairman of the Regional Water Quality Control Board. "We've got to look at 
conservation and reuse, or we've got to look at one hell of a change in our 
life styles." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Mandatory Use Ordinance' 
</P>
<P>
In the Metropolitan Sewerage System, which includes the city of San Diego and 
will generate an estimated 70% of the county's reclaimed water, a key ordinance 
requiring the use of reclaimed water wherever it is available and "economically 
feasible" will begin its journey through the San Diego City Council on June 7. 
The Metropolitan Sewerage System services 1.5 million users below North County 
and utilizes the Point Loma sewage treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
Essential to the system's plans to reclaim as much as 120 million gallons each 
day, the "mandatory use ordinance" requires developers to begin laying the 
system of dual piping needed to carry reclaimed water to golf courses, parks, 
freeway medians and greenbelts where it will be used without mixing it with 
fresh water. 
</P>
<P>
Technical plans on how and where to build nearly $500 million in water 
reclamation projects, which will be part of the city's planned $2.5-billion, 
secondary sewage treatment system, will come before the council later this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Other districts are planning similar systems, and some are ahead of San Diego. 
In Carlsbad, the soon-to-be built Aviara development along Batiquitos Lagoon 
already is being plumbed for reclaimed water. 
</P>
<P>
In Santee, where 1 million gallons of sewage already is reclaimed daily at one 
of the oldest successful treatment plants in the nation, plans are being made 
to expand to 4 million gallons per day. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 15 separate projects -- six of them components of the gigantic 
Metropolitan 
</P>
<P>
Sewerage System's clean water pro gram -- are in planning or construction 
stages throughout the county. By 2010, they are expected to reclaim as much as 
180 million gallons of waste water daily -- 100,000 acre-feet each year -- for 
irrigation, or enough to free up potable water for the yearly needs of 500,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Badly under-utilized in San Diego -- water districts in the county are 
reclaiming just 7 million to 8 million gallons of sewage each day, much of it 
at Camp Pendleton -- water reclamation is a long-accepted practice elsewhere, 
from Orange County to the parched Middle East nations of Saudi Arabia and 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sanitation districts' five treatment plants are today 
reclaiming 60 million gallons of sewage. Orange County's Irvine Ranch 
development uses reclaimed water on its golf courses and greenbelts, and the 
Moulton Niguel system uses reclaimed water for various needs, including 
decorative fountains. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have been doing this for the last several years," said San Diego 
City Councilman Ron Roberts, widely credited as the driving force behind the 
city's water reclamation project. "We're coming to this very, very late. Many 
cities in the country are ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Successful Santee Lakes 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one of the earliest water reclamation projects in the nation was 
the Padre Dam Municipal Water District's Santee Lakes project in 1968. Stocked 
with trout and catfish and surrounded by campgrounds and recreation areas, the 
chain of seven lakes remains a popular spot. Perhaps more importantly to water 
reclamation advocates, any hesitation about fishing and boating in reclaimed 
sewage -- no swimming is allowed -- is not evident in the use of the lakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that comes out of here, I eat," said Tom Bentham, who pulled a 
5-pound trout out of one of the lakes Wednesday and has been fishing there 
since 1980. "I'm not dead yet." 
</P>
<P>
The project, which commanded worldwide attention when it opened, uses settling 
ponds and bacteria to clean the water, which is then percolated through the 
soil before being pumped into the lakes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a shirt," said Ted Mitchell, operations supervisor for Padre Dam. 
"Why should we throw it out when it gets dirty? You launder it. Well, that's 
what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Doubters like San Diego City Councilman Bruce Henderson argue that a vigorous 
statewide conservation program focused on agriculture would be cheaper than 
local water reclamation efforts and produce huge new supplies of fresh water. 
Agriculture uses about 80% of the state's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
"Say you could effect, throughout the state, 30% water conservation," Henderson 
said. "Look at all the fresh water you'd be saving. And then we'd be awash in 
fresh water." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, who enthusiastically support water reclamation but see water 
availability as a natural inhibitor of population growth, are watching 
carefully to make sure that the new systems do not spur growth by producing an 
overabundance of water. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see (reclamation) plants sized beyond a reasonable projection 
for growth increases," said John Reaves, chairman of the local Sierra Club's 
water resources subcommittee. "We don't want to have a capacity which is so 
much larger than needed that it would encourage growth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wary of Carrying too Much Cost 
</P>
<P>
The Construction Industry Federation, whose legislative committee has formally 
endorsed water reclamation, also is wary that builders will be forced to bear a 
disproportionate amount of the cost of the system. Before dual piping is 
ordered, argues John Seymour, legislative analyst for the federation, builders 
want specifics on treatment plant sizes and locations, distribution pipelines, 
pump stations, cost estimates and financing mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd better have those things definitively identified before they start 
mandating dual piping systems," Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
County planners face the daunting logistical and technological task of building 
the local system nearly from the ground up. Because the county is nearly devoid 
of underground aquifers for natural water storage, most of the systems will be 
made up of "on-demand" projects that send water out to users daily. 
</P>
<P>
The metropolitan system alone is tentatively planning six water reclamation 
plants, 330 miles of water mains and 2,200 miles of pipeline, which will cost 
at least $436 million. Storage tanks for 96 million gallons must be built to 
allow the reclaimed sewage, which flows most heavily during daylight hours, to 
be gathered before it is dispensed to irrigation systems for nighttime use. 
</P>
<P>
In summer months, the full 120 million gallons will be used each day, but in 
wet winter months, when demand may plummet to zero, the reclaimed water, which 
will exceed even secondary-treatment standards, will be poured into the ocean. 
Average daily use year-round will be about 64 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan system planners have identified more than 300 top markets for the 
water, thirsty parcels of ground larger than 5 acres. The 39 county golf 
courses now using potable water, and 18 others on the drawing board, are prime 
candidates for reclaimed water. An 18-hole golf course drinks 1 million gallons 
of water daily during peak summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Cleaning Processes 
</P>
<P>
The water will undergo three separate cleaning processes, plus chlorination, to 
meet state Department of Health Services standards governing human contact with 
the water, allowing its use on golf courses, ball fields and greenbelts of 
future condominium complexes. Plans also call for the reclaimed water to be 
poured into stream beds and pumped into commercial high-rises for use in 
flushing toilets. A small amount of industrial use is planned. 
</P>
<P>
"You could swim in it or run through the sprinklers," Harold Bailey, the city's 
water reclamation coordinator told an audience at a recent water reclamation 
seminar. "We don't advocate drinking it." 
</P>
<P>
The water must be cleansed of much of the salts that could make it useless for 
irrigation and relieved of some of the nitrates and other nutrients that might 
cause changes in habitats farther downstream. To prevent even higher salinity, 
the city of San Diego and other jurisdictions are reserving the right to 
regulate water softeners, which dump salts into the sewage. 
</P>
<P>
The Regional Water Quality Control Board will be asked to amend several "basin 
plans" to allow the reclaimed water to be poured into, for example, the San 
Diego River. Before that can be allowed, Foley said, engineers will have to 
prove how they will control nutrients, mosquitoes and other changes that could 
affect birds and marine animals farther downstream. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates argue that all of the water will be sorely needed. In 1987-88, the 
county used 580,000 acre-feet of water -- 319,800 (55%) from the Colorado 
River, 204,400 (35%) from Oroville Reservoir near Sacramento and 55,800 (10%) 
from local sources. (An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover an 
acre to a depth of one foot. It is equivalent to 326,000 gallons, and is about 
enough to serve the needs of an average family for a year.) 
</P>
<P>
As San Diego continues to grow over the next two decades, demand will soar to 
800,000 acre-feet, but the Colorado River and State Water Project will deliver 
no additional water in 2010: just the 524,200 acre-feet. Local sources will 
provide less, just 60,000 acre-feet. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves a deficit of more than 200,000 acre-feet yearly. Reclamation is 
intended to fill the largest gap, 100,000 acre-feet (13%). Water conservation 
programs must provide 80,000 acre-feet (10%), and desalination of ocean and 
brackish water is forecast at 35,800 acre-feet (4%). 
</P>
<P>
Though the total cost of reclaiming water is estimated at $731 an acre-foot -- 
far more than the current $280 per acre-foot price of today's imported water -- 
metropolitan system planners believe that it will be cheaper than the marginal 
cost of developing, transporting and treating some new sources of potable 
water. And with the cost of desalination estimated at $1,450, reclamation is 
clearly a better buy. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, reclamation, like conservation and desalination, gives San 
Diego a greater degree of independence from imported water. Located literally 
at the end of the state's aqueduct system, the county is highly vulnerable to 
supply cutbacks during a drought.

MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS NOTE GROWING PERIL FROM CLIENTS 
</P>

Social worker Kathleen Kott recalls the time a psychotic woman came at her with 
a butcher knife. 
</P>
<P>
Kott, an Orange County mental health worker, was interviewing the woman to 
determine whether she needed to be hospitalized. Kott looked away a moment to 
phone for an ambulance, then looked up to see the client charging her. 
</P>
<P>
"She was moving the knife slowly from side to side," said Kott, who wrestled 
the weapon from the woman's grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Michael Foust remembers the day he was working at the county's 
Santa Ana mental health clinic when a patient reported to a small anteroom for 
a psychological test, calmly took out a gun and shot herself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two years later, the incident still shocks him -- not just that it 
happened but because he knows how much worse it could have been. "Potentially 
she could have used the gun on any one of us," Foust said softly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incidents on Minds 
</P>
<P>
Recent incidents in Los Angeles County, including one in February when mental 
health worker Robbyn Panitch was stabbed 31 times and killed by a patient, have 
mental health workers in neighboring Orange County worried that violence could 
strike them too. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators are discussing installing hidden alarms in each of their eight 
outpatient clinics. They are also beefing up staff training in how to calm 
agitated patients, adding a seminar this summer in crisis intervention and "how 
to defuse an explosive situation." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of mental health workers' safety has drawn statewide concern. 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) has introduced a bill that requires 
county mental health agencies to draft a security plan. In the absence of such 
a plan, the bill says, county workers may refuse to meet with a potentially 
dangerous client. 
</P>
<P>
And, troubled by the Panitch slaying, the state mental health director, Michael 
D. O'Connor, recently urged county mental health agencies to work with employee 
unions to improve their training in preventing assaultive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The hope is to make a potentially dangerous job less dangerous. Attacks on 
workers are rare, mental health officials say; most mentally ill people are not 
a threat to anyone but themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increasingly Volatile 
</P>
<P>
But around Southern California, county mental health administrators and 
psychiatric technicians alike acknowledge that the people they treat -- usually 
people too poor to afford private therapy -- are increasingly volatile. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with people here who've been through state hospitals, who are 
off medication . . . hard to handle," said Alan V. Albright, an Orange County 
mental health coordinator who is in charge of staff training. "It's not like 
we're in private practice and can pick and choose who we treat." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, many of the county's clients are homeless and mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
And some of the patients who visit county outpatient clinics have carried guns, 
knives -- or, in one December, 1987, incident, a homemade hand grenade. 
</P>
<P>
So administrators are quick to acknowledge that a mental health worker could be 
killed in Orange County too. 
</P>
<P>
"I always live in the nightmare of what happened" in Los Angeles County, said 
Timothy P. Mullins, Orange County mental health director. "It's going to happen 
somewhere, sometime. . . . We do not run clients through metal detectors. We 
haven't yet reached that state of siege." 
</P>
<P>
Agreed Douglas C. Barton, deputy mental health director: "These things can 
happen anywhere in L.A. or San Diego -- or Santa Ana. We have a very similar 
patient population in our mentally disabled homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Part of their problem in treating these difficult patients, Barton and other 
experts on mental health explained, has come from frequent budget cuts for 
mental health as well as a major policy shift in treating the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, schizophrenic, manic-depressive and other seriously mentally ill 
patients were held in state mental hospitals. But in the early 1960s, new 
anti-psychotic drugs allowed many of these people to make a remarkable 
recovery. In addition, legislation discouraged "warehousing" mental patients 
and freed them from mental hospitals to be cared for in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
But local officials contend that they were never prepared for the seriously 
disturbed patients who came home. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, these patients would not be treated in Orange County," 
Barton said. "They would be in state hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
But local mental health professionals cannot send many of the chronically ill 
patients back to state hospitals because some of the facilities have closed 
over the last two decades. "Twenty years ago, we had 30,000 beds available for 
civil commitment. Now we have only 2,500 beds available for civil commitment," 
Barton noted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$200-Million Cut Vowed 
</P>
<P>
And the coming fiscal year could be worse, Barton predicted. Because if Gov. 
George Deukmejian does not get the budget he wants, he has threatened a 
$200-million cut in all mental health funds -- about a $13-million cut to 
Orange County mental health. 
</P>
<P>
In this tense fiscal environment, there is not a lot of money to spend on 
hidden alarms or security guards. 
</P>
<P>
Although concerned about safety, the county's mental health professionals 
stress that they also want to balance that with preserving the "therapeutic 
environment" of a clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps it's negligent of us, but we don't routinely inquire if people are 
carrying weapons," Foust said. "The whole nature of this business is trying to 
engender some kind of safety or trust" between therapist and patient. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason also, some mental health workers react with horror to the 
suggestion that perhaps they should carry guns. And some workers say they don't 
want sheriff's deputies or security guards at their clinic. 
</P>
<P>
There is one exception, however. Foust's Santa Ana clinic has two armed 
sheriff's deputies on guard during work hours -- but they are there because the 
neighborhood, along 17th Street near Bristol Street, is regarded as a 
high-crime area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning Buzzers 
</P>
<P>
The county's seven other out-patient clinics are "wide open -- there's minimal 
security," Barton said. The Fullerton and Anaheim clinics do have a warning 
buzzer in some, but not all, offices; otherwise there are no alarms. 
</P>
<P>
But working with or without guards and alarms, workers say they have learned 
through experience to treat each client with caution. 
</P>
<P>
They speak of counseling clients with the office door open so neither the 
worker nor the client is "trapped." They say they alert co-workers to walk 
frequently past the door when they are counseling a difficult patient. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran social workers Kott and Aurora Young say they wear comfortable clothing 
so they can run from a client if they have to. "We dress so we can move -- 
loose clothing and not real high heels," Kott said. 
</P>
<P>
They and other workers also speak of learning to stay calm, to let an angry 
patient "ventilate." 
</P>
<P>
Always, they say, a therapist must be alert to the patient's mental state, 
because to relax and daydream can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Could Lose a Finger' 
</P>
<P>
Working in county mental health is "like being in a factory job where if you 
don't pay attention you could lose a finger," psychologist Foust said. 
</P>
<P>
Agreed psychologist Douglas Schiebel: "The key element is to be very aware of 
who's in the waiting room, be open to cues of agitation. The most fatal mistake 
is to ignore someone who is agitated. That will push them over." 
</P>
<P>
But it is hard to stay cool when the patient in front of you is also 
threatening to kill you, clinical social worker Ralph DeMarco said. "You have 
your stomach churning. As a professional, we often practice denial -- that this 
is not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Edward Oliver recalls one street-wise patient who sat down in 
front of him and said: "What do I have to do to get put in a long-term hospital 
-- kill you?" 
</P>
<P>
"I think I just kept talking to him," Oliver said. "I put him in a 
board-and-care home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confident About Safety 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, confidence about safety was expressed by several workers in the 
county's emergency hold facility, which is for patients who are homicidal, 
suicidal or so disordered that they must be legally detained. But then, these 
employees work in a locked ward where they can place a patient in restraints or 
inject calming medications, whether the patients agree with that or not. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is pretty safe," said nurse Barbara Murillo, service chief of the 
unit. "Not that we let our guard down for a moment." Murillo said she continued 
to work at the unit during a recent pregnancy, and "I did my share of holding 
feet, holding arms" when patients were placed in restraints. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most dangerous situations, many workers said, is outside the locked 
unit and outside the clinics, during field evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
In this situation, one or two mental health workers respond to a report that 
someone is deranged -- and might need to be hospitalized. (Under Section 51-50 
of the state Welfare and Institutions Code, a person can be hospitalized 
against his will for 72 hours if a designated mental health worker declares him 
"gravely disabled" because of a mental condition, or a danger to himself or 
others.) 
</P>
<P>
Because calls to evaluate suspected "51-50s" can be unpredictable, the workers 
often call police to back them up. But sometimes they are on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most dramatic accounts of abuse, threats and even attacks on mental 
health workers come from field evaluations. Kott was menaced with the butcher 
knife on an evaluation. Schiebel once answered a call at a "lovely home" in 
Laguna Hills and discovered the distraught homeowner inside, brandishing a tire 
iron. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Giusti, a nurse who works out of the Santa Ana clinic, counsels patients 
but also performs most of the clinic's field evaluations several days a week. 
</P>
<P>
After doing this for three years, he said, he doesn't think the work is that 
dangerous. Still, he acknowledged, "when I was a rookie in this field, bad 
things happened all the time. I've had my brains knocked in. I've been hit, 
kicked, bit." 
</P>
<P>
But these days, Giusti tries to prepare as much as he can for each evaluation. 
Also, he said, "I know how to remain calm, how to talk in a calm soothing 
voice" even when clients "get in my face and maintain a threatening posture." 
</P>
<P>
A young man with a ready sense of humor, Giusti dresses casually for his calls. 
Although he carries a leather briefcase full of paper work for ordering 
involuntary hospitalizations, he often goes on his calls dressed in jeans, a 
T-shirt and perhaps a bulky sweater. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Delusional' Woman 
</P>
<P>
He answered a call last week about a "delusional" young woman at the main 
courthouse in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, a blonde with dirt-smudged bare feet, was sitting near a county 
information kiosk. She had been passing notes to county marshals that said: 
"God has his own timing.. . . The reason for fear God is the perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The marshals and Giusti didn't think the notes made any sense. 
</P>
<P>
Giusti wanted to talk to the woman to determine whether the rest of her life 
made sense. "Sometimes as we know them more, they get a little more flaky," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The blonde laughed and talked freely to Giusti. She said she had just gotten 
out of jail and was waiting for her husband's attorney to meet her. She said 
she could have $100,000 cash if she wanted it. Yes, she was sleeping well. No, 
she didn't want to see a doctor, she said, explaining: "Today's food technology 
is going to be tomorrow's doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Giusti was joined by another mental health worker, Wilbert Jacobs, who offered 
the woman a bed in a nearby shelter. She accepted, then suddenly walked away 
from them, hopped on an escalator and disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs and Giusti debated whether she was sick enough to be held in the county 
emergency unit. Jacobs didn't think so. But Giusti thought she was getting 
"more grandiose" in her thoughts the longer she talked. He and Jacobs found the 
woman again as she emerged from an upper-floor restroom. Now, however, she 
wasn't interested in the shelter; she was determined to wait for the attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Giusti made his decision to hold the woman after calling the office of the 
attorney she had named and learning from an office worker that the lawyer was 
not coming for her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to go ahead and pick her up," Giusti said. 
</P>
<P>
To head off a struggle or an attempt to flee, Giusti alerted the county 
marshals that he was going to hospitalize the woman, then asked her to step 
over to their booth. When she obediently walked into a small office inside the 
kiosk, a marshal stepped in front of the door, blocking it. Giusti informed 
her: "At this point you are not free to leave." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm a Free Person' 
</P>
<P>
The woman rebelled. "I'm a free person and I don't take drugs," she said 
angrily. 
</P>
<P>
Giusti began quietly calling for an ambulance and filling out his 51-50 forms 
as the woman, resigned to being detained, sat quietly in the marshal's office. 
</P>
<P>
"We initially tried to get her some shelter but as we stayed with her longer, 
she kind of deteriorated," Giusti said. He called her "gravely disabled" 
because she was barefoot, had no way of obtaining food and shelter, and had 
"grandiose" thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman was silent as a marshal led her to a waiting ambulance. But as 
she climbed aboard a stretcher, she yelled at Giusti, "You guys ripped me off!" 
and then cursed him. 
</P>
<P>
Giusti merely shrugged. "I've been damned to eternity. It's the third time this 
week. She's not happy but she handled it better than most people do." 
</P>

COLLEGES WOOING MINORITY STUDENTS YOUNGER AND YOUNGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Billups is the kind of high school student that the outreach staff of UC 
San Diego administrator Victoria Valle Staples works so hard to lure to the La 
Jolla campus. 
</P>
<P>
Billups, who graduates next month from Castle Park High in Chula Vista, has a 
solid grade point average and test scores, plays the snare drums for the 
school's marching band and plans a career in electrical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
He is also black, and UCSD -- through Valle Staple's recruitment office -- 
targeted Billups early in his senior year to receive special phone calls, 
letters and tours designed to sell him on UCSD over other universities also 
eager to have him. 
</P>
<P>
Billups is one of several hundred black and Latino students throughout 
California that UCSD flagged last fall for red-carpet treatment, and, in his 
case, the effort paid off by the May 1 deadline for students to decide where 
they would go. Billups will enroll in UCSD's Warren College in September. 
</P>
<P>
But, in their attempts to attract more non-whites and non-Asians to the 
University of California, UCSD and the system's seven other undergraduate 
campuses find they must aggressively compete against each other annually for 
what is a very small pool of only a couple thousand eligible students. They buy 
computer lists of eligible students, throw lunches and schedule special 
lectures, distribute fancy brochures and encourage personal contacts from 
minority undergraduates. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of black and Latino UC students has grown during the last 
five years, the percentages still lag considerably behind their representation 
in California's school-age population. 
</P>
<P>
UC recruitment counselors, as well as those from the California State 
University system, have moved to expand programs that tell their story -- and 
that of higher education in general -- earlier in the high- school lives of 
students, and even at the junior-high level. Such programs include writing 
seminars, campus tours and summer enrichment sessions. Some have been in place 
several years, especially in the San Diego area. But their effects have been 
only gradual in expanding the number of UC-eligible students each year. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, university officials say they must offer curriculum and other 
assistance as early as the primary school grades as a way to acculturate Latino 
and black children to the benefits of doing well, to expose them to science and 
other potential academic majors and to encourage them to view post-secondary 
education as a common and reachable goal if planned early enough. 
</P>
<P>
For example, officials at UCSD's Third College and San Diego State University 
have jointly applied to the National Science Foundation for $1.6 million to set 
up a countywide resource center to promote and sustain math, science and 
engineering courses for students, beginning at elementary levels. 
</P>
<P>
Already, a smaller foundation grant has been given to San Diego State to 
operate after-school math enrichment for second- and third-graders in the San 
Diego city school district. San Diego State President Tom Day has put his 
prestige behind parenting seminars being offered at several inner-city schools 
to promote parent or guardian involvement in their child's education. Several 
UCSD professors spend their own time working with county secondary schools 
across a variety of academic areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an obligation to serve San Diego and Imperial counties with outreach 
because that is our service area," Joseph W. Watson, UCSD vice chancellor for 
undergraduate affairs, said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 freshman class at UCSD was 68% white, 20% Asian, 8.2% Latino and 3.1% 
black. Those figures compare to all UC freshmen, who were 57% white, 26% Asian, 
9.3% Latino and 5.3% black. The trend over several years shows a modest 
increase in Latino students but very little increase in blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us (college campuses) are overwhelmed with under-represented 
students," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
Valle Staples, who heads student outreach and recruitment, has already begun 
planning her strategy for the fall, 1990, freshman class even though she is 
still tallying up the number of affirmative-action students, known as SAA 
students, who chose UCSD for this fall. 
</P>
<P>
She will compile lists of names of Latino and black seniors-to-be whose 
academic records, received through counselors and through a countywide 
consortium that helps identify these students, may meet UC admission 
requirements. Other students come to her attention through the UCSD Early 
Outreach program, which works with several hundred students targeted for 
special tutoring, lectures and summer enrichment as early as the ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Valle Staples will also send letters to students enrolled in AVID (Advancement 
Via Individual Determination) that most county high schools now offer, a 
program providing promising minority students with extra tutoring, counseling 
and encouragement to overcome socioeconomic or other barriers to entering 
college. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At a Premium 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the early outreach programs are carried out only in San Diego 
County, UCSD recruiters go after potential senior Latino and black applicants 
in Orange and Los Angeles counties as well, because of the larger numbers who 
live in those urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Even so, we end up only with a couple hundred applying who definitely can meet 
requirements, and they are at a premium because every other major university is 
going after them as well," Valle Staples said. Because most Latino and black 
students who are in college-preparatory classes find themselves able to meet UC 
admissions standards, they usually opt for major universities and leave the Cal 
State schools struggling even harder to meet their own affirmative-action 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
The major universities competing with UCSD, in particular UCLA, Stanford and UC 
Berkeley, have several attractions that UCSD must work hard to counter, 
including their location in larger urban areas, longer traditions, and major 
college sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
"UCSD is seen by students as very different," Valle Staples said. "We have a 
real challenge to let students know of not only the academic quality here but 
of campus life as well. And it helps if we can have that message delivered by a 
person or a student who looks like they do." 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa May, now a UCSD sophomore from San Fernando, originally thought she 
would attend Cal State Fullerton but came to the La Jolla campus "just to take 
a look" during her senior year and found herself "impressed by a black young 
man" who told her both the good and bad points about attending the university. 
</P>
<P>
Billups of Castle Park High said that a campus tour arranged through his school 
"caught my interest . . . it was the first time I had ever been here and I 
found the people I talked to were sort of friendly, easier to communicate with 
than I thought. And having someone I could call with questions about my 
application, that was really helpful." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Multiple Acceptances 
</P>
<P>
Billups' counselor at Castle Park, Willie Lassiter, said universities "spend an 
awful lot of time with students individually and in groups, especially in 
getting them the opportunity to see what a college campus is like." 
</P>
<P>
Many students receive multiple university acceptances, and only in the spring 
do they begin to focus on where they will go. UCSD increases its contacts 
during that period, and it holds a two-day open-house in mid-April, during 
which students are paired with undergraduates and spend the night on campus and 
attend classes with them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to scare anyone, but we want the students to know that the 
university is a serious business and, by going to as many classes as possible, 
they learn now that they must continue to work hard," Michael Kane, academic 
adviser for UCSD's Third College, said. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, we get that connection going with other undergraduates, because they are 
our biggest support group." 
</P>
<P>
The effort is also intended to show students that counseling and academic 
assistance is available even after they get to campus, should they run into 
problems with studies or social adjustment, Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar Vallecillo, a senior at Tribuco Hills High in Orange County, made up his 
mind during the two-day open-house. Vallecillo was impressed, in part, because 
non-SAA students with solid academic backgrounds whom UCSD also wanted as 
freshmen were invited as well by Valle Staples. 
</P>
<P>
"The mixing is deliberate," Valle Staples said. "All these kids have the same 
aspirations and, in all of my recruiting, I am careful not to reinforce 
stereotypes" of students not being qualified. "So I won't have a reception just 
for affirmative-action or non-affirmative action students." 
</P>
<P>
Vallecillo said he realizes he is a role model for Latinos. "If more Hispanics 
like myself can go to college, fulfill my dreams and goals, then maybe we won't 
be such a minority. If I can make my mark, we won't be on the bottom of the 
list." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Narrowest Way' 
</P>
<P>
Because so few Latino and black students are at UCSD, Third College Provost 
Cecil Lytle said the stereotype of being unqualified is hard to break. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling that you've gotten in somehow unfairly," said Lytle, "and it 
is always drawn in the narrowest way so as to not see that ability and 
motivation can be measured in a variety of ways." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to campus perception of minorities at UCSD, Vice-Chancellor Watson 
said that, until recently, UCSD had fewer academic offerings than Berkeley or 
UCLA and was still seen largely as science-oriented and with unappealing 
extracurricular offerings to ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Now perhaps a black student may still be the only black in a class but not the 
only one in a department, and I would call that a hopeful sign," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD, as do all UC campuses, admits 6% of its freshman class on the basis of 
individual talent or special criteria, which can encompass athletes or 
musically talented students or ethnic minorities whom counselors say have the 
potential to succeed in college even though they started too late in high 
school to meet all admissions requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"By no means is every (minority) student a special admit," Watson said. "But 
let's be honest, if we are going to have reasonable numbers of certain ethnic 
groups on our campuses, for the next decade we are going to have to admit 
students who do not meet all the eligibility requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"But I also want to say that we are still admitting relatively good students . 
. . to not admit these people would be justified only if the view of their 
lower eligibility is seen purely as personal consequences of student actions 
and not reflecting at all the circumstances outside of the family" such as the 
poorer state of inner-city schools and neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I think to just have the university cut out a generation of people and prolong 
a problem would not be the way to act." 
</P>
<P>
But, because Watson and others are uncomfortable with prolonging special 
admissions, they are pushing the university in the direction of a more active 
role in public schools to prepare more Latino and black students. They make no 
promises of instant success, conceding that many individual programs have 
existed over the past decade, seemingly doing little to increase overall 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, recently established programs to guarantee students admission to 
UCSD as juniors if they take a prescribed two-year course load at community 
colleges have led to more white and Asians transfering than blacks and Latinos, 
Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The major thing to improve matters is really going to be getting students the 
right study habits to achieve, beginning at the primary school level," Watson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We run into somewhat of a dilemma here," said Lytle of Third College, who 
helped prepare the math-science grant proposal to the National Science 
Foundation. "Our normal function is not to teach math in the fifth grade, but 
we do have an obligation to share our resources. So, while we can't go out and 
do the curricula at the (kindergarten) through 12th grade, we can take 
initiatives in setting forth ideas and showing that we care in a broad sense." 
</P>
<P>
Watson said that, for example, although the chemistry department at UCSD has no 
inherent responsibility to interact with elementary schools, the university 
teacher education program "can serve as the vehicle for bringing in teachers 
from chemistry." 
</P>

A DESPERATE DASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The level of desperation felt by many illegal immigrants to the United States 
was poignantly captured by Times photographer Don Bartletti last Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
While on an assignment just north of the border, Bartletti saw a man walking in 
a ditch alongside Interstate 805. 
</P>
<P>
Two U. S. Border Patrol vans were nearby, apparently in pursuit. To escape 
arrest, the man bolted onto the freeway into the path of three cars, seemingly 
without looking. 
</P>
<P>
The man narrowly missed being hit, just a few yards north of a sign warning 
motorists to watch for pedestrians -- a sign that may have saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of others, especially at night, have not been so lucky in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, this scene seems bound to be repeated as long as desperate people, the 
Border Patrol and high-speed traffic mix so dangerously in the South Bay.

EVERYONE'S BACK YARD

<P>
Several supporters of offshore oil drilling have accused their opposition of 
selfishly whining, "Not in my back yard." I agree that there is some element of 
hypocrisy in claiming environmental concern while living the Southern 
California life style. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Exxon oil spill in Alaska has demonstrated to the whole country that 
Prince William Sound is in fact everybody's back yard. Some of us may not have 
even heard of Prince William Sound before March, but the price we are now 
paying for gasoline proves how close we are to that oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, though, there is an impact even greater than the price of gasoline. 
Every night we are shown on television what it would be like to have oil slicks 
2 feet thick on our beaches. In our harbors. In the lagoons. In our front 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
I hope everybody in San Diego County car-pools to the workshop scheduled for 1 
to 7 p.m. Monday at Carlsbad's Public Safety Center. Comments from the public 
have been invited.

TO 'LOVING OWNER': 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following letter could have been written on behalf of any animal that has 
been abandoned by its "loving owner" -- for whatever reason. This letter is 
intended for the owner of the extraordinarily faithful red chow-like dog that 
was seen along Otay Lakes Road from the middle of March until early May. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, as I drove to and from work, I hoped that I would not see the dog. 
Then, I began to worry that I would see it -- dead along the roadway as it was 
sleeping within a foot or so of the pavement on an extremely dangerous curve. 
Even though I felt that someone had abandoned it, I found it difficult to 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
As the weeks passed, the dog remained in the same area -- and had lost a great 
deal of weight. Surely this dog had been abandoned. I stopped early one morning 
-- hoping to entice the dog into my car. As I approached, it moved off into the 
brush bordering the lake. (Did I hope to find an owner -- take it to the animal 
shelter where it would, perhaps, find an owner, or be "put to sleep" -- or, did 
I only want to relieve my own empathy with this animal's abandonment by someone 
it loved?) 
</P>
<P>
A small container of food appeared along the roadside -- replenished by a young 
lady driving a small camper -- obviously another of the daily commuters who had 
been impressed by the dog's faithfulness. 
</P>
<P>
I placed a call to the South Bay Animal Shelter. Only partially completed with 
my story, I was interrupted with, "Is this about the dog on Otay Lakes Road? We 
have been out there several times, and we have been unable to catch the dog." 
End of conversation. I felt somewhat consoled by the fact that I was not the 
only one concerned, but now what? 
</P>
<P>
Each morning and evening, I looked for the dog. On several occasions, I would 
see it sleeping peacefully within only a few feet of the roadway, with its nose 
pressed against the tin container. If only the owner could witness this 
heart-rending sight. 
</P>
<P>
Where are you anyway? And what could be your reason for leaving this dog to 
survive on its own? 
</P>
<P>
The dog has not been there in recent days. I don't know whether it has run away 
or been killed. 
</P>
<P>
But if, by printing this letter, only one animal owner is made aware of the 
consequences of their actions when they decide that a "pet" is no longer wanted 
and abandon it -- then, the red chow-like dog has proved its point.

LOCK THEM UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the May 7 commentary, God save us from the self-appointed lobbyists 
for the criminal subculture. Like Ellen Geis, the author of the commentary 
"More Efficient Use of Jails Needed" (May 7), they use any and all issues to 
argue for reduced penalties for criminals. Now they have the audacity to argue 
that it is up to the individual citizen to protect himself . . . they claim 
that government has no responsibility. Well, I assert that the government does 
have such a responsibility, and, as a law-abiding citizen, I want to see all 
violent criminals (and most of the others) locked up. 
</P>
<P>
The author asserts that we have enough money to keep up with the growth of the 
prison population. Not true! Prisons are overwhelmed with inmates, and this is 
after performing a sort of triage in which only the more violent offenders are 
incarcerated. Today, the percentage of violent, hard-core inmates is higher 
than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
The author also raises that old, fake claim that jails and prisons do not 
reduce the crime rate. They certainly do reduce the rate if there is a 
reasonable expectation of being caught and the penalty is more than a slap on 
the hand. A prison sentence certainly does eliminate the crimes that would be 
committed by that one person. 
</P>
<P>
Like it or not, America has a lot of criminals, and we need a way to remove 
them from society, because whether Ms. Geis knows it or not, they cause a lot 
of pain and we have an obligation to try to prevent that. 
</P>
<P>
I agree that conventional prisons are very costly, but the alternative is not 
to "release" every criminal back on the streets. The sensible alternative is to 
find less expensive ways of segregating criminals from society. Work camps 
where inmates help to pay for their upkeep is the direction we ought to go in. 
</P>
<P>
In publishing a commentary like this, I think you ought to identify just who 
Ellen Geis is representing. "Plaintiffs" does not tell us who they are.

'POLITICAL CLICHES' MARKED BUSH TALK, SHEVARDNADZE SAYS

Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze accused the U.S. Administration of 
conducting a foreign policy of "empty political cliches" in a blunt assessment 
Saturday of President Bush's policy-setting address May 12. 
</P>
<P>
While not responding directly to Bush's proposal for an "open skies" policy 
permitting unarmed surveillance flights over the superpowers, Shevardnadze said 
much of Bush's speech appeared to indicate a step backward for superpower 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprised me by its tone, and I would even say by its somewhat old-style 
ideological tinge and sometimes edifying emphasis," Shevardnadze told the 
Communist Party newspaper Pravda in an interview carried by the Tass news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed to us that our political dialogue had already moved to a different 
category and removed the blinkers of ideological rhetoric and that we could 
conduct it without empty political cliches," the foreign minister said.

LATINOS INVITED TO STAY HOME FOR COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM HOPES TO STEER THE FAMILY-ORIENTED TO LOCAL OPPORTUNITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There is a plethora of research on the topic, but eighth-grade English teacher 
Quality Quinn Sharp needs look no further than the raised hands of her own 
students for similar findings: 
</P>
<P>
Of the 31 ethnic minority students in her classes at San Marcos Junior High 
School -- virtually all of them Latino -- 24 say they want to go to college. 
But of those, 21 don't want to leave home in their pursuit of higher education. 
Their attitude, shared by many Latino students according to studies about why 
so few attend four-year universities, will seriously limit their scholastic 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, educators know that, despite the best intentions of idealistic 
13-year-olds, most of them -- and the great bulk of minorities -- will not 
graduate directly from high school to a university when the time comes. 
</P>
<P>
Some will not qualify scholastically. Others will lack the encouragement of 
parents or peers to pursue higher education. Some will have insufficient money 
for tuition or books. Some will be sidetracked by marriages or jobs. Some won't 
have the self-esteem necessary to see themselves as college material. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cultural Decision 
</P>
<P>
And many won't go to a university because there is none near their home, and 
they don't want to pull up stakes from familiar surroundings and strong family 
ties in order to move to a strange place. That decision to stay put is made by 
many students, but is especially prevalent within the Latino culture, studies 
indicate. And Sharp's own classroom polls validate the finding. 
</P>
<P>
Given that reality, Sharp is starting a program in San Marcos intent on 
shepherding as many of San Marcos' minority students as possible to college, 
without leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
Of anywhere in North County, Sharp figures the potentially college-bound 
eighth-graders in San Marcos should have an advantage, what with the coming of 
San Marcos State University in 1991, and the opening of the freshman class in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
In San Marcos, a child can attend junior high, graduate down the road to high 
school and, upon graduation, attend the new university immediately or, 
depending on circumstances, attend Palomar Community College -- also in San 
Marcos -- for a year or two before moving on to the state university. 
</P>
<P>
Without leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
All these students need, Sharp says, is the proper catalyst, a matchmaker of 
sorts to unite student with school. 
</P>
<P>
With that notion, Sharp is spearheading a program called "Ready, Set, Go," 
funded by $23,000 from a La Jolla-based foundation that wants to remain 
anonymous but which is intent on seeing more Latino children set their sights 
on a college diploma without having to leave home if they don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an opportunity here we need to capitalize on," Sharp said. "College 
doesn't need to be -- and shouldn't be -- a missed opportunity for culturally 
diverse students, especially in this city." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Facets of Program 
</P>
<P>
The multifaceted program is designed to identify students -- especially Latinos 
-- who as early as seventh-grade start showing interest in post-secondary 
schooling but aren't sure how to channel it or keep that desire alive in the 
coming years. 
</P>
<P>
Once the students are identified -- and Sharp is hoping that 40 seventh- and 
eighth-graders will enlist in the program before the end of the current school 
year -- a number of activities will begin, designed to mentally, socially and 
emotionally escort them all the way through college graduation. 
</P>
<P>
* Study skill classes will be held before and after school, and during the 
summer vacation, so students can learn how to learn and to improve grades. 
</P>
<P>
* Professional tutorial support will be provided, free, to those students 
needing special attention and motivational speakers and minority role models 
will be presented to the students to encourage them to set their sights on a 
college diploma. 
</P>
<P>
* Special efforts will be made among the teachers and counselors in junior 
high, high school, Palomar College and the state university to ensure that the 
students take the appropriate courses for advancement. 
</P>
<P>
* Field trips will be taken to Palomar College and the new San Marcos State 
University campus -- even before the first buildings are constructed -- to 
familiarize the students and their parents with the college settings and to 
remove some of the mystery and fear of such places. 
</P>
<P>
* Special aid and instruction will be offered on such technical matters as how 
to fill out applications for financial aid and job placement, and special 
activities will be planned to improve school-parent communication, ranging from 
newsletters to group picnics, to enlisting parental support in encouraging 
their children to pursue a college education. 
</P>
<P>
One of the built-in benefits of the program, Sharp notes, is the development of 
a group of students who will identify with and support one another as they 
share their aspirations to go on to college. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Crucial 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, winning student support may be the least of the challenges, Sharp said: 
"Convincing students that they should want to go to college is sometimes as 
easy as tapping them on the shoulder and saying, 'Do you want to think about 
college? I want to show you how you can get there.' You can see the gleam in 
their eye that they'd like to. 
</P>
<P>
"But getting the parents to buy into this will be a harder sell. We're going to 
have to show them that 50% of all new jobs being created will require 
post-secondary education, and that, if they want their children to do well, 
they're going to have to be supportive about college." 
</P>
<P>
Other professionals, including university recruiting and outreach officials, 
echo Sharp's belief that, more often than not, especially in the Latino home, 
it is the parent who has to philosophically buy into the notion of the child 
attending college. 
</P>
<P>
If the college is away from home, the job is even more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Students from the Imperial Valley have a hard time making the break from home 
to come here," said George Hutchinson, director of student outreach services at 
San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to visit the home and spend time with the parents, especially in 
Hispanic households, and let them know that college is safe. Many of them 
haven't had their own experience of going to college, and it's especially hard 
if it's their first child who wants to go to college," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp hopes that her job will be easier because, in San Marcos, the student 
won't have to leave home but simply needs the motivation, the grades and 
parental support to attend a four-year college just a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
Programs like "Ready, Set, Go" are not unusual. The county Department of 
Education sponsors a program it calls AVID (Advancement Via Individual 
Determination) in which more than 2,000 students countywide, primarily blacks 
and Latinos, receive a wide variety of services and support intended to see 
them into college. The students participate in AVID as an elective course 
starting in seventh-grade and continuing through high school. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 teachers in 10 school districts -- including San Diego, 
Oceanside, Vista and Escondido -- are trained in an AVID curriculum designed to 
motivate and prepare their charges for college. The program also provides such 
services as tutorial help from college students assigned to the very high 
schools from which they themselves graduated. The student tutors are paid $6 an 
hour -- a tab picked up by the host school district as part of its cost of 
participating in AVID. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indication of Success 
</P>
<P>
Mary C. Swanson, one of the program coordinators, said the success of AVID is 
clear: 90% of its participants over the past two years graduated immediately 
into four-year colleges. During their high school years, they raised their 
grade point average from 2.2, a low C, to 3.2, a low B. AVID graduates who 
attend SDSU have an average GPA of 2.46, compared to the average GPA of 
freshmen at SDSU of 1.9. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson says she is disappointed that the San Marcos Unified School District 
does not participate in AVID and suggests that the district is trying to 
"reinvent the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
But San Marcos officials say they respect AVID and may indeed plug into it as a 
component of "Ready, Set, Go." They don't now participate in AVID, said Supt. 
Mac Bernd, "because of economics." 
</P>
<P>
"We think our program will accomplish the same thing, and be more 
cost-effective, because we have a private foundation that will foot the entire 
bill," he said. "With AVID, we'd have to commit district resources -- teachers 
and tutorial money -- that are in short supply." 
</P>
<P>
Universities offer their own programs as well to encourage minorities to attend 
their schools. Besides a general outreach program, for instance, SDSU "adopted" 
Granger Junior High School in National City three years ago. The university 
provides tutorial help, support groups and other activities for the students 
through high school with the hope that, by the time they graduate, they will be 
ready to move on to college. 
</P>
<P>
Ed DeRoche, dean of education at the University of San Diego, says there can 
never be too many programs to encourage minority students to attend a four-year 
college. 
</P>
<P>
"Most kids need support and encouragement to go to college, but minorities need 
it more," he said. "Most (non-minority) kids receive encouragement already to 
go to school, in such subtle ways as their own peers saying things like, 'We're 
going to college. How about you?' But most minority kids don't have peers 
saying that to them. They need to get that support somewhere else."

Gov. Roy Romer's state airplane was pressed into service as an air ambulance to 
transport an injured peregrine falcon to a bird clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's pilot, Lt. Lloyd White, was asked if he could carry the falcon 
from Lamar to Denver on Thursday, said Bryant Will, district manager of the 
Colorado Division of Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
"No problem," White told Will. "It will be nice to have a real aviator fly with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
The falcon, which had a cut on its right shoulder, was captured Wednesday by 
falconer Dale Eddleman, Will said. The falcon could have suffered the injury by 
hitting a fence or telephone wire. 
</P>
<P>
"The peregrine hadn't eaten for so long it was too weak and too hungry to be 
wary as Eddleman walked up and captured it by hand," Will said. 
</P>
<P>
The bird was taken to the Birds of Prey Rehabilitation Foundation in 
Broomfield. The governor's plane was needed when a flight by a local flying 
service was canceled.

UNDUE FORCE, RACISM CHARGED IN SHOOTINGS BY DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fast-food restaurants and strip malls around the "Welcome to Lancaster" 
sign at the Avenue K exit of the Antelope Valley Freeway present an image of 
safe, homogenized suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
But last month, the Carl's Jr. restaurant at that intersection was the scene of 
a fatal shooting that has sparked allegations against Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies of excessive force and racial bias. 
</P>
<P>
To many, the incident and three other recent shootings by law enforcement 
officers reflect the Antelope Valley's transformation from a cluster of sleepy 
desert communities into an urban area with urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It was shocking," Lancaster Mayor Lynn Harrison said of the Carl's Jr. 
shooting. "We're not used to things like that here. Residents are feeling the 
pressures of change, and I'm sure law enforcement officers are feeling the 
pressures as well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acted Accordingly 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said she thinks that the deputies saw a "life-threatening situation" 
and acted accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
On April 11, deputies confronted Betty Jean Aborn, a 50-year-old black 
transient armed with a butcher knife, at the Carl's Jr. after responding to an 
armed robbery call at a nearby business. When Aborn lunged at them, three 
deputies opened fire, authorities said. She was hit 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
Ensuing protests by the Antelope Valley chapter of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People included a march last month by black residents 
around the sheriff's station. And a federal mediator from San Francisco has met 
with authorities and about 35 black residents to discuss Aborn's death and the 
fatal shooting by a deputy six months ago of Robert Moriya, an Asian student. 
State NAACP President Jose De Sosa helped set up the mediator's visit and 
attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death Investigated 
</P>
<P>
Like all deputy-involved shootings, Aborn's death is being investigated by the 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office in conjunction with Sheriff's 
Department homicide investigators. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the district attorney's office cleared Deputy Terry Rice in the 
Nov. 4 shooting of Moriya, a 19-year-old Lancaster resident who had crashed his 
car into a freeway underpass after a night of drinking. Rice shot and killed 
Moriya after he charged Rice and attempted to wrestle away his gun, 
investigators concluded. 
</P>
<P>
But NAACP member Mike Kirkland said: "I don't think either of those two people 
could have mustered enough force to seriously threaten the officers, especially 
with the expertise, backup and guns they have available to them." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Gary Vance, commander of the Antelope Valley sheriff's station, predicts 
that the investigation of the Aborn shooting will conclude that deputies acted 
properly. He said he is willing to work with black leaders but sees no need for 
outside intervention and rejects the racial allegations about the two 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand why that jumps to their minds," Vance said of the black 
leaders. "But no way is that a connection. I don't see any racial tensions at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
As further evidence that race had nothing to do with the Aborn shooting, Vance 
said, one of the deputies involved is Latino and another is white and married 
to a black woman. 
</P>
<P>
But Harrison said she thinks that, regardless of whether the Aborn shooting was 
justified, the involvement of an outside mediator may be a good idea. "If the 
members of the minority community feel there is a problem, then for them there 
is a problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal mediator, Ada Montare, said she can recommend -- but cannot require 
-- police-community forums or human relations training for officers. But 
Montare said it is unlikely that she will suggest such action since the 
Sheriff's Department has made itself accessible to NAACP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resolves Disputes 
</P>
<P>
Montare works for the Community Relations Service of the U.S. Department of 
Justice, which has no investigative powers. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems the area is in an era of change with people moving from the Los 
Angeles area," she said of the Antelope Valley. "It could be that tensions are 
beginning to take place." 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale's population grew 17% last year, and Lancaster's grew 10%. But there 
were grim accompanying numbers: Overall crime went up 33% in the Antelope 
Valley in the first quarter of this year, with the crime rate per 1,000 people 
increasing 8%. 
</P>
<P>
The three shootings this year contrast with only one deputy-involved shooting 
in each of the previous two years in the Antelope Valley. All three occurred 
within the past six weeks; the most recent was Wednesday when deputies shot and 
killed a man who charged a deputy with a rake after a two-hour car chase in 
which the suspect rammed a police car. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Samuel Hooker, president of the Antelope Valley's NAACP chapter, said 
his group requested outside help because the Aborn and Moriya shootings show 
that deputies are quick to use deadly force against minorities. The NAACP 
chapter has located Aborn's daughter, 19-year-old Mona Aborn, and are 
consulting with lawyers about filing a wrongful death suit on her behalf, 
Hooker said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials estimated the Antelope Valley's population at 
135,000 in 1985, up from 107,000 in 1980. But a continuing influx of residents, 
which includes a significant number of minorities, has pushed the valleywide 
population to more than 200,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent available data on ethnic makeup dates from 1985 and showed a 
population of 81% white, 10% Latino, 5% Asian and 4% black, with a longtime 
concentration of blacks in the Littlerock and Sun Village communities east of 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
The Aborn incident began at 4:45 on a Tuesday afternoon. Investigators say 
Aborn, a transient whose last known address was in Inglewood, stole several ice 
cream bars from a convenience store across the street from the Carl's Jr. A 
clerk challenged her, then called police after she threatened him with a 
10-inch butcher knife. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Account of Events 
</P>
<P>
Investigators give this account of the events that followed: 
</P>
<P>
Seven deputies responding to the call found Aborn sitting behind a table in the 
back of the restaurant, where she was a familiar face. 
</P>
<P>
Aborn held the deputies at bay with a knife. Several deputies moved customers 
and employees out of the dining area while four deputies and a sergeant tried 
to calm the woman. She screamed that they would have to kill her. The sergeant 
shot her with a Taser stun-gun. It had no apparent effect. An autopsy report 
said one Taser dart was embedded in Aborn's forehead, but other darts may have 
been blocked by several layers of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, Aborn lunged over the table at a deputy with the knife above her 
head. Three deputies -- William Phelton, Tony Ortiz and James Vetrovec -- 
opened fire. Twenty-eight shots were fired; the autopsy showed that Aborn was 
hit 18 times, mainly in the torso and legs. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker and others question whether it was necessary for the deputies to fire 
that many times. They also ask why deputies did not attempt to subdue Aborn by 
other means, or back off and negotiate as police do in barricade situations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way I believe those men had to shoot that woman," Hooker said. 
</P>
<P>
Vance responded: "People who aren't in law enforcement may see more 
significance in the number of rounds fired. Unlike in the movies where people 
fly back after they're shot, in real life they tend to keep going. I think each 
deputy fired until he perceived the threat had been eliminated. I can't 
remember a shooting where the deputies counted how many times they fired. 
Either you're justified in shooting or you're not." 
</P>
<P>
Vance noted that deputies first used the Taser gun. 
</P>
<P>
"The Taser gun usually works," Vance said. "Before they have time to make other 
plans, she attacks, and they have their guns drawn. . . . A barricade suspect 
is different because you contain the area." 
</P>
<P>
In the Aborn case, the deputies were pursuing an armed robbery suspect into a 
public place, Vance said. "They were intent on arrest," Vance said. "We don't 
negotiate with armed robbers." 
</P>
<P>
Aborn was arrested in Pasadena in 1983 on charges of assaulting a police 
officer with a pair of scissors, court records show. The charges were dropped 
when Aborn agreed to undergo mental health treatment, a Pasadena court official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deputy Exonerated 
</P>
<P>
In the Moriya shooting, the district attorney's inquiry found that Rice was 
justified in shooting Moriya five times because the unarmed youth charged him 
repeatedly, even after being wounded. Moriya's blood-alcohol level was 
determined to be 0.17%. The legal limit for drivers in California is 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Rice remains on leave for psychological stress suffered since the shooting. The 
county rejected a $5-million claim filed by Moriya's family, and Los Angeles 
attorney Albert DeBlanc said he is preparing a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
DeBlanc says he has witnesses to refute the official findings. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason to believe it was necessary for him to shoot an unarmed boy," 
DeBlanc said. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker said the fact that Aborn and Moriya were members of minority groups 
cannot be overlooked in an area that is populated mostly by conservative 
whites. Hooker acknowledged that the two incidents have come at a time when the 
Antelope Valley NAACP chapter is trying to become more visible. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have some kind of voice," he said.

FAMILY FILES CLAIM AGAINST OFFICER WHO SAVED WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last November, a young waitress named Margaret Parkinson was run down by a 
drunk driver as she helped a friend unload a bicycle from a car on a 
fog-shrouded street in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson, 24, lost her lower right leg and nearly bled to death before two 
Torrance police officers saved her life by applying a makeshift tourniquet they 
fashioned from a rope and a buck knife. 
</P>
<P>
Since the accident on Redondo Beach Boulevard, Parkinson has emerged from a 
coma and is slowly recuperating at a rehabilitation center in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance police officers have been lauded for their efforts: Parkinson's 
father wrote a letter saying he was "terribly grateful" to Officer Devin Chase 
for saving his daughter's life. And the South Bay Police and Fire Medal of 
Valor Committee presented Chase and fellow officer Jerry Wallace with the 
Distinguished Service Award for their "courage and self-control" in rescuing 
Parkinson. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for Parkinson, who was left partially paralyzed and brain-damaged 
by the accident, delivered a strikingly different message this month: a 
$6-million negligence claim that blames Officer Chase and the city for the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragic irony," conceded Parkinson's mother, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
Chase said he was floored when he learned of the claim. 
</P>
<P>
"You save someone's life," said Chase, 27, "and you are trying to do the job 
the best you can. . . . Down the road all these people come up, and 
unfortunately they are mostly attorneys, and they say how you are supposed to 
have done things differently." 
</P>
<P>
The claim centers on Chase's actions before the accident, not afterward, said 
Parkinson's father, Lucius (Jim) Parkinson. It alleges that Chase drove past 
Maggie Parkinson before the collision but failed to warn her not to stand 
behind her double-parked car on the fog-blanketed thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
"If my daughter is going to be crippled for the rest of her life and I can find 
compensation," Parkinson said, "I'm going to look for it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Finished Work 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 5, 1988, Maggie Parkinson and Ella Schwartz had just finished working 
their Friday night shifts as waitresses at the Cheesecake Factory in Redondo 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It was past 2 a.m. on Saturday morning when Parkinson, who had moved from her 
hometown of Carlsbad to Torrance two months before, stopped to drop Schwartz 
off at her apartment at 3920 W. Redondo Beach Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The two women double-parked on the four-lane boulevard to unload the bicycle 
Schwartz had ridden to work, Nancy Parkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chase was driving west. A California Highway Patrol report on 
the incident says Chase recognized the danger of the two women standing, 
shrouded in fog, in the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
Chase stopped to make a U-turn to warn them but, before he could turn, a car 
driven by Eduardo Banda Hernandez passed in the opposite direction, said CHP 
spokesman Richard Richards. Just seconds later, Hernandez's swerving car missed 
Schwartz but slammed into Parkinson, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's leg was nearly severed and she stopped breathing. Chase could not 
find a pulse. But with the assistance of Wallace, Chase stopped the bleeding 
and kept Parkinson alive with CPR until paramedics rushed her to county 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Parkinson wrote Torrance Police Chief Donald Nash in March to say, 
"Maggie's life was unquestionably saved by (Officer) Devin Chase's competence 
after the accident and for that we are most terribly grateful." 
</P>
<P>
But attorney Robert Kennedy, hired by Jim Parkinson, said he questions what 
happened before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
CHP reports seem to indicate that Chase could have turned more quickly, and 
perhaps turned on his warning lights to alert the two women, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Chase denied that, saying passing cars prevented him from turning. "They 
basically say, 'You didn't have a crystal ball, so you screwed up,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
The claim against the city also says trees lining the boulevard had not been 
trimmed, blocking out a street light that would have illuminated the road. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Parkinson, a retired petroleum geologist, said he had "some sense of 
misgiving" about filing the claim. "But my primary interest is my daughter's 
well-being, and she is never going to function like she did before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly $300,000 of a $1-million health insurance policy for his daughter has 
already been used up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez pleaded no contest to a drunk driving charge in February. He faced up 
to three years in prison, but he failed to appear at his sentencing in March 
and authorities said they believe he has fled to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Parkinson said that Hernandez had no insurance and that the family does not 
think it will ever be able to collect damages from him. He wonders how he will 
pay his daughter's bills when the $1-million coverage runs out. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Parkinson said she has left her job as an art teacher at Carlsbad High 
School in order to tend to her daughter, who lives at an Escondido 
rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman, once a powerful swimmer, now requires a prosthesis and a 
walker just to take a few painful steps, her mother said. She has trouble 
speaking and her short-term memory is impaired. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors hope for an 85% to 90% recovery, Nancy Parkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just beginning to stretch her wings and find herself," she said of 
Maggie's recent move to Torrance. "She was a very pretty girl. I don't know 
what else to say. It's a heartbreaker."

HANDLING OF WRIGHT PROBE HAS DIXON'S STAR ON RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Julian C. Dixon realized that the people of his district were aware of his 
new-found prominence in Washington when the nature of his mail changed. 
</P>
<P>
Letters about Dixon's ethics probe of House Speaker Jim Wright suddenly started 
to appear alongside the usual constituent complaints about Medicare and mail 
delivery, and soon the Wright mail outweighed all the rest. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed as though the folks back home were as taken with the ethics 
investigation as official Washington as they flooded Dixon with mail praising 
his political courage and his "statesmanlike" handling of the case. 
</P>
<P>
But for Dixon, who has always shied away from the media spotlight that now 
follows him from Capitol Hill to Culver City, there was no cause for cheer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired," the congressman said while awaiting a flight to Washington last 
week. "You have your ups and downs in this kind of job. You can't help but 
identify with the person having these problems. And that's depressing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tumultuous Time 
</P>
<P>
This has been a tumultuous time for Dixon, 54, chairman of the House Committee 
on Standards of Official Conduct. The probe of Wright (D-Tex.), who is accused 
of improperly using his office for financial gain, has put him at risk of 
alienating some of the most powerful members of Congress. But his handling of 
the case has also spawned enormous amounts of positive publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Dixon's friends and supporters are talking of positive political 
ramifications. They say that Dixon (D-Los Angeles), who has often been named as 
a likely successor to Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, is now better 
positioned to assume the powerful post if Hahn retires in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
He may also be poised to play a larger role in black political affairs, they 
say, noting that political commentators are already praising Dixon's low-key 
style, his diligence and his talent for acting as a conciliator. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a great opportunity for Julian to prove himself," said Inglewood 
City Councilman Daniel K. Tabor, a Dixon protege. "He'd make an excellent 
supervisor, but there's no reason to rule out other offices." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon, however, was unresponsive about his future as he sat at the American 
Airlines terminal Tuesday in a stylish leather jacket and loafers. The 
congressman, who is known for his regal bearing and his reserved, almost 
Zen-like manner, said this is not the time to speculate on his next move. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not been thinking of how to turn this splash of publicity into some 
kind of dividend," Dixon said. "That's not my style, and it never has been. I'm 
not inclined to run for anything except reelection at this point. But I would 
certainly consider Hahn's seat later." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Genuinely Happy 
</P>
<P>
Those closest to Dixon say he is genuinely happy in Congress. He and his wife, 
Betty, spend most of their time in Washington, like most congressional couples. 
When the two are in Los Angeles, they occasionally entertain close friends at 
their Fox Hills townhouse. People who have seen him in social settings say 
Dixon has a terrific wit. He enjoys sharing a few drinks and listening to jazz 
on his stereo, and is also said to be a restaurant connoisseur. 
</P>
<P>
But the overriding passion in Dixon's life has always been politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Julian always aspired to hold public office, and his friends were always 
dedicated to helping him realize that ambition," said Herbert Carter, executive 
vice chancellor of the California State University system, who has known Dixon 
since the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Southwestern Law School in 1967, Dixon got his political 
start by working on civil rights causes and for politicians, such as then-state 
Sen. Mervyn M. Dymally, now a congressman representing Compton and other 
southern Los Angeles County communities. He also worked on Tom Bradley's first 
campaign for mayor. When the 63rd Assembly District seat opened in 1972, Dixon 
won it in a tough race against a large field of candidates 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formed Alliance 
</P>
<P>
Dixon eventually rose to the third-highest position in the Assembly and formed 
a close alliance with its second-ranking member, another rising star named 
Howard L. Berman. In 1978, when Dixon ran for the 28th District seat in 
Congress, the political machine headed by Reps. Berman (D-Panorama City) and 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) played a key role in getting him elected over 
two other strong candidates, then-state Sen. Nate Holden and then-Los Angeles 
Councilman David C. Cunningham, in a bruising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Today Dixon maintains close ties to the Berman-Waxman organization. And he 
remains popular in his solidly Democratic district, a racially mixed, mostly 
middle-class area that includes Inglewood, Marina del Rey, Ladera Heights, 
Baldwin Hills, part of the Crenshaw District and Culver City. Since the hotly 
contested race 11 years ago, he's never been seriously challenged. 
</P>
<P>
District activists give the congressman's office high marks for keeping 
constituents happy. They say Dixon has also been there during times of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Gardner, president of the Baldwin Hills Estates Homeowners Assn., said 
Dixon's office acted quickly on requests to secure federal aid for the 
residents of that area when a devastating fire destroyed 48 homes in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Outstanding Legislator' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that he's around much," Gardner said. "But he is certainly 
active. I can't think of a thing Julian has done that would tarnish his image 
as an outstanding legislator. The attention he's getting is long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
Ronni Cooper, president of the Ladera Civic Assn., said Dixon's office also 
lent its support to her community when residents there opposed plans for an RTD 
bus yard on the Centinela Drive-In site. "What's nice is that they're not 
afraid to take positions," Cooper said. "And when you can show that you have 
your elected officials on your side, you generally come out on top." 
</P>
<P>
In other areas, supporters credit Dixon for helping to obtain federal funds for 
the Communications Bridge, an organization that offers low-income people 
training in the communications field, and for the Inglewood Technical 
Institute, a technical training program based in the Inglewood schools. 
</P>
<P>
Those and other projects are tracked by an intensely loyal staff. Patricia 
Miller, Dixon's administrative aide, has been with the congressman since his 
state Assembly days 17 years ago. Others date back to his 1978 election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Defies the Norm' 
</P>
<P>
Bevan Dufty, who served as Dixon's chief legislative assistant for seven years 
before leaving Washington to become the federal legislative analyst for the RTD 
in Los Angeles, said Dixon's quiet style of service is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"He defies the norm of American politics," Dufty said. "He is not hungry to 
churn out press releases or do other showy things. . . . He is a very 
self-effacing man who is very thoughtful and rational. . . . He also treats 
people well. You always feel like you're part of a team when you work for him." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his anonymity, Dixon, whose political convictions and voting record 
generally follow classic liberal Democratic lines, has been a major player in 
Congress almost from the start. 
</P>
<P>
He was named to the powerful House Appropriations Committee during his first 
term, and has since used the post to secure federal funds for such major Los 
Angeles projects as Metro Rail. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Dixon was included on one longtime congressional observer's list of 
the 12 most underrated members of Congress. On the same list was a little-known 
Republican senator from Indiana named Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon was the first congressman to introduce a legislative amendment calling 
for economic sanctions against South Africa. In 1984, he and other congressmen 
were arrested during a protest outside the South African Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the District of Columbia Appropriations Subcommittee, Dixon is 
charged with overseeing the government of embattled Mayor Marion Barry. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Dixon chaired the committee that mediated a rules dispute 
involving the Rev. Jesse Jackson at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. 
Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., a prominent Los Angeles attorney who has known Dixon 
since high school, said Dixon forged a compromise that eliminated unfair 
delegate selection practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackson felt the rules weren't fair," Cochran said. "But Julian was able to 
walk through what many considered a mine field and resolve the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Carter said Dixon has always had a conciliatory style of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to talk about how to be an effective leader," Carter said of their 
early years together. "Julian was very clear in his mind that he did not hold 
himself out to be a black leader. He wanted to be an effective politician and 
he was more interested in resolving issues than in shouting about them." 
</P>
<P>
In that way, Dixon is reminiscent of Mayor Bradley, who also has been called a 
"colorless" politician. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said he and Bradley have a good working relationship. He said he also 
considers Bradley to be an "honest person." But he added that it's too early 
for him to speculate whether Bradley, who is being investigated for possible 
financial irregularities, has broken any laws. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bradley, Dixon is also occasionally accused of not doing enough to promote 
the cause of blacks. Three prominent black Southside politicians, Assemblywoman 
Maxine Waters, Assemblywoman Gwen Moore and state Sen. Diane Watson, all 
Democrats, declined to be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strained Relationship 
</P>
<P>
Waters, a fiery inner-city lawmaker who is a close ally of Jesse Jackson and 
another possible candidate to succeed Supervisor Hahn, is said to have a 
particularly strained relationship with Dixon. In an interview, Dixon 
cautiously said the two are "good acquaintances." 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of black politics, however, Dixon offered a passionate 
self-defense. "A lot of black politicians speak out on issues (of concern to 
blacks) and do a very good job," Dixon said. "But mine is a different style. I 
don't measure my success by how many times I see my picture in the paper or on 
television. . . . I would rather use (persuasion) than force." 
</P>
<P>
It's that style that has won Dixon so many accolades from his colleagues. Rep. 
Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), a close friend, said Dixon is one of the few 
members of Congress capable of handling the thorny Wright case. 
</P>
<P>
"He's taken an awful and thankless job that no one wanted and has handled it 
very well," Levine said. "And that gives people confidence in the process. This 
will just enhance his already superb reputation in Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said he plans to step down from the ethics panel, though he couldn't say 
when. He will see the Wright matter through. Then, he expects to chair the 
panel's investigation of one of Wright's most vocal accusers, Assistant 
Minority Leader Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who is accused of ethics violations 
involving a book deal. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner, the Baldwin Hills activist who has followed Dixon's career for years, 
said he wouldn't be surprised if the congressman happily faded back into the 
shadows after that. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you serve quietly and go unrecognized," Gardner said. "And sometimes 
you get your 15 minutes of celebrity, as Andy Warhol said. This is Julian's 15 
minutes."

CURBS PROPOSED FOR DEVELOPERS OF APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A citizens advisory committee has recommended temporary controls on apartment 
development in San Pedro, but slow-growth advocates charge that the compromise 
measure does not go far enough to curb a building boom that threatens to mar 
the single-family complexion of the seaside community. 
</P>
<P>
Because the recommendations are directed at lots larger than 6,000 square feet, 
they would do little to stop what residents have complained about most: the 
razing of single-family homes on small lots to make way for apartments. 
Instead, the controls primarily would limit developers who string together lots 
to put up larger apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a first, significant step toward reduced density," declared committee 
chairman Noah Modisett Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adopted Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
Countered Shanaz Ardehali-Kordich, an anti-development activist on the 
committee: "The areas that we're most concerned with, that most need to be 
conserved and protected, are not getting any more protection. . . . I don't 
think it was a compromise. I think it was a sellout." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed restrictions were adopted Wednesday by an overwhelming vote of the 
San Pedro Community Plan Advisory Committee, a 25-member panel appointed by Los 
Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores to address what has become the hottest 
issue in San Pedro: apartment development. 
</P>
<P>
Although no roll call was taken at the meeting, members estimated that only 
four of the 21 present voted against the plan, which calls for the City Council 
to adopt an interim control ordinance -- a temporary law -- that would limit 
but not ban building while the committee discusses permanent zoning changes. 
</P>
<P>
It is now up to Flores to review the proposed ordinance and decide whether to 
submit it to the council. "Obviously, she's going to take a good look at it," 
said her San Pedro deputy, Mario Juravich. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance targets areas zoned for multiple-family developments, 
particularly those designated RD1.5, which permits an apartment unit for every 
1,500 square feet in a lot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction Limited 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations, which apply to RD1.5 areas and those with higher-density 
zoning, provide that: 
</P>
<P>
* On lots 6,000 square feet or larger, apartment developers may put up only one 
unit for every 2,000 square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
* No single building may contain more than four apartment units, although more 
than one building would be permitted on a lot if the lot is large enough. 
</P>
<P>
* When two or more lots zoned differently are tied together into one lot, the 
more restrictive zoning shall apply. 
</P>
<P>
* Alleys may not be included in the size of a lot. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the committee recommended that developers be required to landscape 
100 square feet of lot space for each apartment. And, in an effort to preserve 
historic buildings, the ordinance says that any building on the local landmark 
list of the San Pedro Bay Historical Society may not be demolished or altered 
without city permission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smaller Lots 
</P>
<P>
Although the proposed ordinance would curb developers of large apartment 
complexes, slow-growth advocates complain it does nothing to curb apartment 
development on lots smaller than 6,000 square feet. According to Juravich, 
Flores' deputy, most individual lots in San Pedro fall into this category, with 
many of them 5,000 square feet or less. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-development activists are most worried about areas that are zoned for 
multifamily development but are composed of mostly single-family homes. 
Developers are coming into these areas, razing old homes and putting up "shoe 
box" apartments, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Ardehali-Kordich and other slow-growth advocates have pressed for temporary and 
permanent restrictions that would allow only single-family homes or duplexes on 
such lots. 
</P>
<P>
But under the committee's recommendations, a developer may build the same 
number of apartments -- three -- on a 4,500-square-foot lot as could be built 
on a 6,000-square-foot lot. "They're still going to be able to build just what 
they've been building," Ardehali-Kordich said. 
</P>
<P>
But committee vice chairman Bill Lusby, who said he drafted most of the 
proposed interim control ordinance, countered that the building industry would 
be devastated if the zoning was changed, even temporarily, to allow only 
duplexes on small lots. 
</P>
<P>
"That means no building, because nobody will build a duplex," he said. "Nobody 
will tear down one house to build two houses." He said to restrict development 
to duplexes would be tantamount to a moratorium on new apartments on most lots. 
</P>
<P>
Both Lusby and Modisett said they believed that other controls -- particularly 
the landscaping provision -- will encourage developers to put up apartments 
that are more aesthetically pleasing than those of the shoe box variety. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Modisett said, he does not believe that the committee would have 
accepted a plan that would limit apartment development to duplexes. 
</P>
<P>
"I could tell the sentiment of the members of the committee," he said. "They 
felt that would be taking away too much of the economic freedom of the people 
who own that property."

TORRANCE BEACH NEIGHBORS RAISE VOICES AGAINST NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents who live near the Torrance Beach parking lot say it happens every 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
On warm Friday and Saturday nights, the sigh of breaking waves on a sandy shore 
is interrupted by the blare of car stereos, the crash of breaking bottles and 
the laughter of teen-agers hanging around the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids use the parking lot for a play area and a meeting area and they play 
excessively loud music," said Virginia Jones, who has lived across the street 
from the lot for 25 years. "It even jars the windows and the doors, the music 
is so loud." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loitering After School 
</P>
<P>
Torrance police patrol the lot, but neighbors say that has not eliminated the 
problem, which sometimes includes noise and loitering after school. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents are so upset about the noise that they have asked the city of 
Torrance to take over the lot, which is operated by the Los Angeles County 
Department of Beaches and Harbors. The county provides maintenance and staffs 
the entrance from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police responding to complaints about noise and loitering usually warn the 
youngsters and send them home, said Torrance Police Sgt. Ron Traber. If police 
find someone drinking, they will make an arrest or order the person to dispose 
of the alcohol, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude of the individual and conduct dictate to the officer what action 
to take," Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, the City Council will discuss problems at the lot, which runs 
alongside Paseo de la Playa between Paseo de la Concha and Paseo de Suenos. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Manager LeRoy Jackson said he will recommend that the city not 
seek responsibility for the parking lot, saying there is little else the city 
can do to address the problems of noise and loitering. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, president of the Torrance Beach Homeowners Assn., said her group will 
meet early next month to discuss what solutions it will recommend to the 
council. She said she has no preference on who operates the lot. 
</P>
<P>
She suggests that the county increase staffing or close the lot after school 
when teen-agers tend to loiter there. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the problem has existed for several years and that she has made 
several complaints to Torrance police and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Racing in Lot 
</P>
<P>
She said she has seen youngsters race cars up and down the parking lot and 
nearby streets. She said she has seen some teen-agers defacing walls and 
verbally abusing elderly residents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful area and it's for the public," she said. "We just want to 
straighten these things out." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Klinger, deputy director of the Department of Beaches and Harbors, said 
the county installed a heavy steel-pipe swing gate in August to keep teen-agers 
out of the lot at night. The lot previously had a wooden gate that youngsters 
often broke to get past, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county contracts with a company to staff the lot, where visitors pay $4 to 
park all day. The lot closes at 8 p.m., and the metal gate is locked. 
</P>
<P>
However, the gate has not eliminated the problem, Klinger said. Cars often 
remain in the lot after the gate is locked and people continue to gather there 
late into the night, he said. Cars can exit over metal spikes in the pavement 
that prevent cars from entering. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been doing the best we can," Klinger said. "We are working closely with 
the Police Department. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Traber said most of the complaints about the parking lot are received during 
the summer. It is not uncommon for a patrol car to be summoned to the lot two 
or three times in one night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those responsible for the problems are teen-agers and young adults in their 
early 20s, most of whom live in Redondo Beach and Torrance and on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intermittent Problem 
</P>
<P>
"They make a little noise, do a little dope and it's disruptive," he said, but 
the problem is intermittent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as bad as you would think," he said, "but I still sympathize with the 
people who live there." 
</P>
<P>
The noise and loitering on the lot is "crazy" on the weekends, according to 
Luis Gonzalez, 19, a Torrance resident and avid surfer, who blames much of the 
activity on local high school kids who have nothing better to do on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Gonzalez complains that the Torrance police have been heavy-handed in 
regulating the parking lot. "They harass us for nothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keiko Traynor, who has lived across the street from the parking lot since she 
moved from Maryland three years ago, said she was awakened at 3 a.m. recently 
by loud music coming from a car in the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Traynor, who said she has never complained to the police, said she doesn't mind 
the noise during the day, but "not all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Norman Kuska, who has lived across from the lot for more than 25 years, said he 
knows his neighbors have complained, but he thinks the noise is "par for the 
course." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me like it bothers other people," he said. "But I think that 
they have to keep it under control because it can get out of control."

QUESTION OF GAY AND LESBIAN RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bible-beating smugness snaking many of the faces last Monday night at the 
Santa Ana City Council chambers underscored why I rooted for Orange County 
Cultural Pride from the Council members' breezeway. 
</P>
<P>
I grew up in Cypress next door to a family of three girls and two boys headed 
by a lesbian couple named Elaine and Linda. They were nice women raising decent 
children who all turned out heterosexual. I attended Bible school with the 
children. I learned respect for the women from my parents. Unfortunately, a 
conspiracy of silence bubbled in my neighborhood. Elaine and Linda felt 
compelled to identify themselves as biological sisters in the face of contrary 
evidence. Most of the adult neighbors supported the lie by changing the subject 
when questioned by their own children. 
</P>
<P>
Out of respect for their privacy, Elaine and Linda are pseudonyms. This plus 
their presentation of themselves as siblings stems from having swallowed 
intolerance and bigotry -- the rigidity masqueraded by Christian Alert and its 
cohorts as "traditional values." 
</P>
<P>
Christian Alert and its ilk assume that lesbians and gays are "sodomites" and 
that a pride festival would misrepresent the community. I beg to differ. As a 
board member of the county's lesbian and gay hot line, I have found that 96% of 
all the callers seek alternatives to the bar scene. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the interests of Santa Ana's gays and lesbians -- as well as those of 
their brothers and sisters in Orange County's 27 other cities -- reach far 
beyond the bedroom. They are taking responsibility for themselves! They look to 
OCCP to promote the facts on all aspects of their lives. They can do without 
the kind of falsehood-breeding which sent my neighbors Elaine and Linda into 
hiding more than 20 years ago, and which still prevents self-acceptance for 
thousands of homosexual women and men today.

REALISTIC FINANCIAL HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roberto Godinez is a young man with a critical problem. Several weeks ago he 
learned that one of his kidneys was not functioning and that the other was on 
the verge of shutting down. Without dialysis treatment, or a kidney transplant, 
he faced certain death within a matter of weeks, doctors at the UCI Medical 
Center, where Godinez was hospitalized, told him. 
</P>
<P>
But Godinez, whose wife is expecting the couple's fourth child, is an 
undocumented worker from Mexico. And he has no money or medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The UCI Medical Center is a hospital with a critical problem. It is losing 
money, the only one of the five state university hospitals doing so. Last 
fiscal year the hospital reported an $8.6-million operating loss. This year the 
loss may run more than $13 million. Continued losses, in fact, may force the 
medical center to stop treating indigent patients or eventually go bankrupt and 
close down, one Irvine campus official warned earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The two critical problems meet head on daily. People like Godinez need medical 
help. But patients like Godinez, who are on Medi-Cal or other public programs 
that do not cover the costs of treating indigent patients, exacerbate the 
shortage of county, state and federal funds hospitals face. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a problem that affects only the UCI Medical Center. But in Orange 
County it is the UCI Medical Center that has borne the brunt of the burden. The 
center has only 6% of the total hospital beds in the county. Yet it treats more 
than 50% of the county's indigent patients. In fact, about seven out of of 
every 10 people it does treat have no private insurance and represent a 
financial loss. And the more poor people that are treated, the more money the 
medical center loses. 
</P>
<P>
The medical center staff knew that when they admitted Godinez. And they knew 
that several days ago when they decided that Godinez would get the expensive 
dialysis treatment that he needs to survive, and maybe even a kidney 
transplant. Godinez is a greater financial risk than usual because there is a 
chance that even the under-funded Medi-Cal program will stop paying in a few 
months because of his undocumented status. 
</P>
<P>
But doctors and hospital administrators had their priorities straight and put 
no price tag on the value of human life. The county and state must do no less 
in providing realistic financial support to the health-care system. There are 
too many people facing death and needless disability to do otherwise.

UCI MEDICAL CENTER'S LOSSES AND THE HEALTH CARE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine appropriately bemoans the fact that there is a projected operating 
loss of $13 million this year at the medical center. It is undoubtedly accurate 
that the major reason for this is that UCI treats 50% of the poor, yet has only 
6% of the hospital beds in Orange County. The fact that UCI, as a teaching 
institution, must spend more per patient than our other hospitals undoubtedly 
accounts for only a percentage of the loss. 
</P>
<P>
However, isn't that what UCI as a training institution is all about? 
Historically, when the current medical facility was the County Hospital, 
virtually all indigent patients were cared for there. Why then should that 
change? 
</P>
<P>
If Orange County possessed a deficit of other hospitals, the answer would be to 
build more hospitals in Orange County and make funds available for treating 
indigent patients. However, we have a surplus of both private and nonprofit 
hospitals in our county. It, therefore, is correct to expect the university to 
care for the overwhelming majority of indigent patients, not only 50%! It is 
just as logical for funds to be made available to UCI for this. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, if Orange County were in a void and did not have at least three 
hospitals that can be considered tertiary-care institutions with the capability 
of treating virtually any disease entity, then the need for a "Super Center" 
able to address the most complicated medical problems would be necessary. With 
all due respect to the academic environment, Orange County's medical facilities 
are excellent and insured patients simply need not travel very far to receive 
the finest medical care available. Whereas UCI Medical Center can supplement 
them, their main function should still be care of the indigent patient and 
training physicians. It is no less true that funds should be made available to 
that institution. However, to invoke excellence or uniqueness of medical care 
as the essence of UCI Medical Center's existence is inaccurate.

THE AIRPORT NOISE-ABATEMENT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reference is made to Rebella's letter "John Wayne Airport Noise Abatement" (May 
14): Even if he has established one of the most comprehensive noise-abatement 
programs in the country, it still has a long way to go before it becomes as 
effective as he apparently thinks it is. 
</P>
<P>
An excellent illustration of conditions and effectiveness can be witnessed 
almost every morning at very shortly after 7 o'clock. Usually there are two or 
three Douglas types following one after the other, then a two-engine job like 
AirCal used to fly and lastly one of the English-made AirBus four-engine types. 
It has been my experience to note that all of the Douglas birds, seemingly all 
of the same model, vary significantly in noise emission and all are louder than 
either of the following different types, and, of course, the British-made plane 
is the least loud of any. My conclusion is that not only is there a difference 
in performance by make and model but also in the way the pilots comply. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, striking an average over each quarter gives a false sense of 
security. One plane traveling very quietly can pull the average down 
significantly while, if evaluated separately, it would indeed show that the 
violations are blatant and quite injurious. 
</P>
<P>
I am reliably informed that noise of this type is insidious and compounds upon 
itself, which makes it essential that Rebella evaluate the commercial carriers 
on the same basis as general aviation, i.e., on a single basis, and certainly 
should not only exercise the prerogative of expulsion of the violaters, but 
also publicize his dedication to have the standards observed.

END OF THE VITACOURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a regular user of the William R. Mason Regional Park. I frequently use the 
park for walks but mostly . . . run and exercise there in the morning before I 
go to work. Until May 10, the park had a VitaCourse routine available along 
trails in the western part of the facility. VitaCourse equipment allows users 
to exercise and stretch their bodies for a more complete workout than just 
jogging or walking. 
</P>
<P>
For no apparent reason, the manager of the park, without any attempt to assess 
the value of the Vitacourse and the frequency of its use, removed all of the 
equipment. He erroneously claimed that it was not being used, that it was in 
disrepair and that park users only wanted signs indicating how far they had 
run. 
</P>
<P>
I, for one, used the VitaCourse heavily and I saw others using it on numerous 
occasions. I don't understand why such unnecessary removals are made without 
questioning users, without providing supporting reasons and without review by 
the county.

THE AIRPORT NOISE-ABATEMENT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George A. Rebella's letter response (May 14) to William Monroe's letter 
regarding airport noise is filled with the same political and bureaucratic 
nonsense that constantly surrounds this whole subject. For anyone to take the 
position that the number, altitude and noise level of flights passing directly 
over our home on Balboa Island is somehow acceptable indicates a total lack of 
knowledge of the true situation. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to invite Rebella and any officials he would like to bring along 
to have coffee with us on our patio on Ruby Avenue any morning at 7:03. Then, 
and apparently only then, will he perhaps realize the intolerable conditions 
for the residents of our island created by the routing of 100% of John Wayne's 
commercial flights directly over our heads. A spreading of the misery by the 
adoption of perhaps three or four additional takeoff vectors would at least 
allow for a fair exposure by other neighborhoods of Newport Beach to the burden 
now borne by those of us directly under the present flight path. 
</P>
<P>
The official position that BAe-146 aircraft do not make enough noise to be 
objectionable and therefore somehow do not count in the daily tally indicates 
either plugged ears or fuzzy thinking on somebody's part. With the upcoming 
increased capacity of the passenger terminal and the already authorized further 
increase in the number of flights, it is absolutely ridiculous to exclude any 
multi-engine commercial jet aircraft from noise control restrictions. 
Admittedly, the 737s and certainly the MD-80s are louder than the BAe-146s. 
However, to term the latter quiet and unobjectionable is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
It is time for our airport and elected officials to stop talking in riddles and 
start doing something. I am hoping for a response to my invitation.

UCI MEDICAL CENTER'S LOSSES AND THE HEALTH CARE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The plight of the poor and the necessity for medical research and education 
have come into horrible conflict in our county. Orange County and the state are 
relying on an institution whose primary purpose is to expand knowledge, teach 
physicians and improve health care for all of us. The UCI Medical Center cannot 
be expected to carry the burden of indigent health care. 
</P>
<P>
How tragic it would be if health care in Orange County deteriorated. How 
precarious our lives would become if our only Level 1 trauma center closed, our 
nationally recognized burn center shut its doors, our extraordinary neonatal 
intensive care facility no longer saved our children. 
</P>
<P>
UCIMC is a precious resource. We should not stand by and watch the crisis in 
indigent health care jeopardize an institution whose existence is crucial to 
all of the people of Orange County. UCIMC should not become a victim to 
circumstances over which it has no control.

TRIP 'FROM POVERTY TO MILLIONAIRE' TAKES JUST 1 SPIN 
</P>

They say money can't buy happiness, but Richard Pruneau would argue the point. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old plumber, who grew up in Thousand Oaks, said he went from rags 
to riches Saturday, winning $1 million in the state lottery's "Big Spin." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed. I mean, I can't believe I went from total poverty to millionaire," 
Pruneau said in a telephone interview from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Pruneau said he had been unemployed for several months before moving to Orange 
County a month ago to take a job. While out of work, he stayed for a time in a 
San Bernardino County motel room; "welfare paid the bill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has 2 Daughters 
</P>
<P>
Pruneau said he is married with two young daughters, including 6-month-old 
Hillary, who was born blind. 
</P>
<P>
After his lottery winnings are taxed, Pruneau will get about $40,000 a year for 
20 years, which will "definitely help me take care of her on a long-term basis 
and get the things we need for her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pruneau said he will "get a business going and pay back all my 
debts." 
</P>
<P>
Pruneau said he "just wrote a check for my last $40" to pay for a videotape of 
his "Big Spin" appearance. The television show was taped Saturday morning for 
broadcast later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought 1 Ticket 
</P>
<P>
His appearance on the "Big Spin" resulted from his purchase of a single ticket 
for the lottery's Cash Register game. The ticket paid $100 and allowed Pruneau 
to enter a drawing for a chance to become a "Big Spin" contestant. 
</P>
<P>
Word that his name had been drawn came last week when he was out changing the 
gasket on the oil pan of his truck. 
</P>
<P>
He knew something was up when he returned and his brother and sister were 
jumping up and down. "Normally, I don't even get a hello," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Big Spin" contestant Jennifer Byrnes, 20, of Calabasas, was not as lucky as 
Pruneau, but she said her $40,000 prize was "awesome" nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
The minimum "Big Spin" award is $10,000. "I was counting on $10,000 so no 
matter what I won, I'd be really happy," Byrnes said. 
</P>
<P>
She added: "Forty thousand dollars is a lot of money for me; I'm going to 
hopefully be able to put . . . a down payment on a condo or house."

Photo, Balloons, Displays and Grape Expectations Despite enduring waits of two 
hours in an eight-mile-long traffic jam, visitors to the sixth annual Rancho 
California Balloon and Wine Festival on the shores of Lake Skinner were 
rewarded at wine-tasting booths, antique car displays and hot-air balloon races 
Saturday. The festival, which continues today, also features grape-stomping 
competitions, an arts-and-crafts show, jazz and folk music, a tribute to Elvis 
Presley and the crowning of Miss Temecula Valley. And all to celebrate what the 
Temecula Valley Chamber of Commerce calls a celebration of the valley's 
"natural resources and award-winning wineries." Admission is $3 per person 
including parking, with wine tasting an additional $6 per person. DAVID McNEW

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRAFFIC SIGNALS TO BE IMPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traffic signals on one of the busiest stretches of Pacific Coast Highway and 
Sepulveda Boulevard in the South Bay will be synchronized and upgraded in a 
$1.3-million project scheduled for this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Improvements aimed at relieving congestion along the 2.2-mile segment will be 
made from Rosecrans Avenue in Manhattan Beach to Pier Avenue in Hermosa Beach. 
They include a new double left-turn lane on southbound Sepulveda Boulevard at 
Manhattan Beach Boulevard and the installation of a green left-turn arrow on 
Sepulveda at 2nd Street in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In another project approved by the California Transportation Commission last 
week, changes will be made in the San Diego Freeway interchange at Rosecrans 
Avenue in Hawthorne to reduce congestion and accidents, officials said. The 
$412,000 project, scheduled for this fall, will eliminate the off-ramp from the 
freeway to westbound Rosecrans and widen the off-ramp to eastbound Rosecrans to 
include a left-turn lane onto westbound Rosecrans.

ROSE AFFAIR STIRS MEMORIES OF MCLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BLUM, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This time, the restaurant is Jonathan's Cafe in Franklin, Ohio. The characters 
are named Ronald Peters, Thomas Gioiosa, Paul Janszen and Michael Fry and the 
star is Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen years ago, it was the Shorthouse Steak House in Flint, Mich. The 
characters were Clyde Roberts, Jiggs Gazell, Ed Schober and Ed Voshen and the 
star was Denny McLain. 
</P>
<P>
Now, baseball is investigating "serious allegations." Then, it was reviewing 
"certain off-field activities." 
</P>
<P>
Just like now, there was a new commissioner. Just like now, the major 
allegations first surfaced in Sports Illustrated. Just like now, there was a 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows what will happen to Pete Rose. What happened to Denny McLain is 
well documented. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can tell you is that I received the most horrible advice in the history 
of the world," McLain said this week. Just 3 1/2 years after his troubles 
began, 5 1/2 years after he won 31 games, Denny McLain was out of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He'd been a star after Detroit won the 1968 World Series. Big money, big cars, 
jetting around in his private plane. Life in the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 17, 1970, Sports Illustrated said he'd been in the wrong lane. He was 
the cover story, with bold headlines in yellow-and-red letters: 
</P>
<P>
"Denny McLain and the mob" 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball's Big Scandal" 
</P>
<P>
McLain was alleged to be a gambler and a bookmaker and SI reported that he 
associated with Mafiosi linked to Tony Giacalone, whom the magazine said was an 
enforcer for Joe Zerilli, then Detroit's crime boss. 
</P>
<P>
Some of it was true, McLain later admitted in his book, "Strikeout: The Story 
of Denny McLain." 
</P>
<P>
"I was gambling in 1967," he wrote. "The number of my bets was fairly high, but 
the stakes weren't -- usually only $50 on each football or basketball game. No 
baseball? I never bet on baseball! . . . Betting baseball is a losing 
proposition, even if you're inside the game." 
</P>
<P>
The story of McLain's downfall began in 1963, when he became friends with Edwin 
K. Schober, a marketing vice president for Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Co. 
Inc. in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
As McLain achieved prominence on the field -- he was 16-6 in 1965 and 20-14 in 
1966 -- he began to start business ventures. Among other things, he played the 
organ at nightclubs. Six days after the World Series, he was playing a Las 
Vegas hotel. 
</P>
<P>
One of those nightclubs he performed at was the Shorthouse Steak House, 50 
miles northwest of Detroit. A bookmaker named Charles Roberts ran it. McLain 
got to know Roberts and together with Schober, began placing bets with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning is great, but for me, the appeal of gambling was the excitement," 
McLain wrote. "I loved the action. Having a monetary interest, regardless of 
the amount, in the outcome of a game made it that much more exciting to watch. 
If I lost, well, at least I had fun in the process. And if I won, so much the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Early in 1967, McLain and Schober decided they would rather be bookies than 
bettors, and agreed to become partners in a new bookmaking operation with 
Roberts and Jiggs Gazell, whom Roberts was betting with. 
</P>
<P>
McLain invested $5,700, but a short time later found out that he and Schober 
were victims of a con job by Roberts and Gazell. McLain told Schober he was 
quitting. 
</P>
<P>
Schober later called McLain to tell him that Hubert Edward Voshen placed a bet 
with their operation on Williamston Kid, a 19-2 shot who won the eighth race at 
Detroit Race Course on Aug. 4, 1967. Voshen won $46,600 and Schober said they 
had to pay him off. McLain, surprised that the venture was still going, lent 
Schober some money and never heard about it again. 
</P>
<P>
SI said that Voshen got Giacalone to talk to McLain, and said that Giacalone 
was rumored to have stepped on McLain's toes, causing an injury. McLain denied 
it, saying he hurt himself in a clubhouse rage after Boston knocked him out on 
Sept. 18, 1967, and further aggravated the foot at home that night. McLain 
didn't pitch again until the final day that season. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Commissioner Bowie Kuhn found out that the story was coming out 
and called McLain to New York for a meeting on Feb. 13, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Just tell us what went on and we're all going to get on with the 
rest of our lives,"' McLain remembered this week. "We did, except he suspended 
me. I still think he lied to us." 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn, who took office on Feb. 4, 1969, issued a statement after the meeting 
saying he was "reviewing certain off-field activities" that "did not involve 
the playing or outcome of baseball games." 
</P>
<P>
Six days later, Kuhn took action. "Mr. McLain's involvement in 1967 bookmaking 
activities and his associations at that time leave me no alternative but to 
suspend him from all organized baseball activities pending completion of my 
review of the situation," Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
For six weeks, McLain was an outlaw, not knowing what would happen next. 
</P>
<P>
"He suspended me before everything was even done," McLain says now. "Kuhn 
reacted to the pressure of the press. There was no question about it, Bowie was 
one of those guys very interested in pleasing in the press." 
</P>
<P>
McLain thinks Rose is fortunate that Kuhn's no longer in baseball. "Had Bowie 
been in office, Pete would be suspended." McLain said. "Pete was very lucky 
(Peter) Ueberroth was the commissioner. And all the things I hear about (A. 
Bartlett) Giamatti are positive." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball players didn't have a grievance system then like they do today. It was 
adopted on May 24, 1970, three months too late for McLain. Still, his lawyers 
told him not to get the Major League Baseball Players Assn. involved or to 
contest Kuhn's action in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talked out of it by my attorneys," McLain recalled. "I hadn't been 
around the block enough to realize what rights I had. At that point in time, I 
hadn't sampled the real world, it was still the candy world. 
</P>
<P>
"My attorneys felt they wanted to get this matter behind us as quickly as 
possible. I was told I should not talk to Marvin Miller. My lawyers in Detroit, 
they told me that if I even talked to Marvin, I would lose my representation." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, now retired and a consultant to the players' association, said that he 
tried to change McLain's mind. "When the news broke, I met with Denny and 
talked to him about what his rights were without getting into the facts of the 
case with him. I explained that it was not just a question of guilt or 
innocence. That if he is found guilty of what has been alleged, that doesn't 
mean that the punishment will necessarily be upheld. In other words, the 
punishment still has to fit the crime. Denny decided for his own reasons not to 
appeal it." 
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Kuhn decided to suspend McLain until July 1. He essentially found 
him innocent of any specific wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that McLain in 1967 or subsequently has been guilty of 
any misconduct involving baseball or the playing of baseball games," Kuhn wrote 
in his decision. "McLain's association in 1967 with gamblers was contrary to 
his obligation as a professional baseball player to conform to high standards 
of personal conduct, and it is my judgment that this conduct was not in the 
best interests of baseball. It therefore must be made the subject of 
discipline." 
</P>
<P>
McLain couldn't believe it. He still doesn't. "I was suspended for 
association," he said this week, sounding angry as he thought of Kuhn. "That 
was the most incredulous part about the entire deal. You're suspended because 
you had drinks with a guy. Or because you bet with a guy. That's what I don't 
understand. That's what never made any sense at all." 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn, who hasn't spoken with McLain since, still says he made the correct call. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had any question," he said this week. "I've always thought that it was 
the right decision. I still do. Fair, both ways." 
</P>
<P>
He got criticized for leniency and for harshness, probably because all previous 
gambling suspensions had been clear-cut decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the McLain case was essentially new territory," Kuhn said. "Nothing 
was on-point. It was pretty much its own kind of case." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, looking back, believes an arbitrator or a judge would have blocked 
Kuhn. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the entire suspension would likely have been reversed. There are some 
arbitrators who are terrible. I can't think of any arbitrator who would hold up 
that suspension." 
</P>
<P>
McLain decided not to contest it. He was not indicted by the grand jury and 
went 3-5 after he came back. He was suspended twice during the remainder of the 
season -- once for dumping water on two reporters and again for carrying a gun 
on an airplaine. 
</P>
<P>
After the season, he was traded to Washington and went 10-22 in 1971. In 1972, 
he went 4-7 for Oakland and Atlanta and March 26, 1973, three days before his 
29th birthday, the Braves released him. 
</P>
<P>
McLain finished with a record of 131-91 -- 114-57 before the suspension, 17-34 
after it. He got into trouble with the law and served 29 months of a 23-year 
sentence for racketeering, extortion, conspiracy and cocaine possession. Now 
he's on probation but he says he couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
He also has some thoughts on Rose's plight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just praying it's not as bad as it appears to be," McLain said, speaking 
with admiration. "Even if it is, I don't care what he's done, it should not 
effect his eventual induction into the Hall of Fame."

PADRES' TEMPLETON DANCES, THEN DELIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all his 33 hard years, the man can still catch Saturday night fever. It hit 
Garry Templeton around 9 p.m. here. It hit him, of all places, while he was 
standing in the on-deck circle before the sixth inning with his Padres leading 
Philadelphia, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
As he swung a lead bat, the Padre shortstop was confronted by a giant mascot 
known as the Phillie Phanatic. The hairy green intruder jumped into Templeton's 
face and began dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton, bat still in hand, suddenly danced with him. Moved his hips back and 
forth. It looked like something out of a teen-ager's video with a step that 
Templeton is way too cool to admit has a name. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just grooving," Templeton said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, Templeton's dance continued. Only this step had a title: the 
home run trot. It provided the Padres with the clinching run in a 3-2 victory 
in front of 28,866 at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton took nemesis Don Carman deep to left field for his first right-handed 
out-of-park homer in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
It was a night that featured starter Dennis Rasmussen's first victory since his 
first start of the season (April 7) -- he allowed just one earned run in five 
innings. It was a night of Greg Harris' third save in four games -- he didn't 
allow a hit in the final four innings. 
</P>
<P>
And for the second consecutive evening, Carmelo Martinez had an extra-base hit 
(triple) to drive in the the Padres' first two runs (in the third), giving him 
twice as many RBIs in two days as he had in the previous 18. 
</P>
<P>
But when looking for reasons that the Padres have won season-high five 
consecutive games and moved to within a game of first place, look no further 
than their captain and veteran, who just recently was sidelined with more of 
his chronic knee problems. Their dancing machine. 
</P>
<P>
"When you put him out in the middle of the diamond, you've got a leader," 
Manager Jack McKeon said of Templeton, who has certainly led the past two 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was his first day back in the lineup after missing three games with a 
swollen left knee that some worried would be the beginning of the end of him. 
All he did was go two for four with a double and an RBI with four flawless 
assists in the field as the Padres won, 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Saturday, in which Templeton had to face Carman, a left-hander who 
had mistreated him worse than any pitcher in his 13-year career, holding him 
hitless in 12 previous at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't say?" Templeton asked afterward. "I've never even gotten a hit off 
of him? Man." 
</P>
<P>
If he sounded surprised, well, in the fourth he lined a single to right. Then 
in the sixth, with his team leading, 2-1, after Martinez had his fourth RBI in 
two nights, he was a hit in a couple of ways. 
</P>
<P>
First, about the Phanatic, who spends much of the game taunting opposing 
players and umpires or racing around the foul lines on his three-wheeled motor 
scooter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's funny, he's one of the best in the league," first baseman Jack 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like him on the field," McKeon said. "He rides that darn bike all over 
the place, somebody is going to get hurt. He's going to run over somebody, and 
there's going to be trouble. Those guys belong in the stands." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, the beast can dance. And when he approached Templeton in the sixth 
inning of a tight game, he was just the creature Templeton wanted to see. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm standing there, and all my attention is out on the pitcher, and sometimes 
it's good that I think about something else for a second," Templeton said. "I 
was glad to see him start dancing. I just tried to groove with him." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after leadoff hitter Jerald Clark singled and was thrown out attempting 
to steal, it was Carman's turn to groove. He threw was was supposed to be a 
sinker but looked like a fastball, which didn't confuse Templeton. 
</P>
<P>
"It was right over the middle of the plate, I know that," said Templeton, who 
last hit a right-handed homer out of the park on Sept. 5, 1987 against St. 
Louis. Overall, the switch-hitter has just 20 right-handed homers (34 
left-handed). 
</P>
<P>
Those worrying about his knee will be heartened that he made around the bases 
fine and plans on continuing that mobility until he is too old to care about 
his knees. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who talks about the knee does not know what is going on," said 
Templeton, who has started 37 of 44 games at shortstop. "I'm going to get 
swelling from time to time, it's going to hurt, but it's not going to get any 
worse. And I'll be playing until I can't stand it." 
</P>
<P>
Which at least one Padre hopes is for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"Having that experience in the lineup, you can't put a price on that," said 
Jack Clark, who had two doubles and scored a run Saturday. "(Templeton) doesn't 
get as much recognition as he should. Having him out there keeps us in the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of recognition, how would you like to be the No. 2 relief pitcher on a 
team with Mark Davis as No. 1? That is the role taken by Harris, who relieved 
Rasmussen Saturday with runners on first and second and none out in the sixth. 
He struck out Dickie Thon, walked Dwayne Murphy, retired Darren Daulton on an 
RBI groundout and struck out Bob Dernier to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
In the final three innings, only one other runner reached base, and that was 
when Harris hit Tommy Herr in the elbow on a two-strike fastball in the 
seventh. He now has three saves and hasn't allowed an earned run in his past 
three appearances (5 2/3 innings). Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although outfielder John Kruk wasn't following protocol Saturday afternoon 
behind the batting cage when he asked Manager Jack McKeon, "So, am I playing 
tomorrow or what?", yes, Kruk is probably playing today. Look for him to come 
off the 15-day disabled list against Phillies right-hander Bob Sebra, probably 
giving Jack Clark a breather in right field. On May 4, Kruk injured his right 
hip diving for a line drive off the bat of Chicago's Andre Dawson. Look for 
outfielder Jerald Clark to be sent down. He has started the past two games and 
gone three for seven during that time, but he made an error in right Saturday 
and overall is hitting just .167. . . . Pregame memories involved former Padre 
Chris Brown, the injury-plagued third baseman who was released by Detroit 
Friday after hitting .193 in just 17 games. Some players and officials 
remembered the time he injured his heel tripping over a foul line in Montreal 
-- "The next day I guess they lowered the foul line," said one. Most, though, 
remembered his bruised tooth root, suffered when a ball thrown from the 
outfield in batting practice hit him in the face. "The doctors had a good laugh 
at that one," said one Padre. Noted Tim Flannery on the release: "It's not the 
first time somebody has had great talent and not done anything with it." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bowa, the former Padre and a third base coach for the Phillies since Aug. 
11, wistfully watched his old team take batting practice Friday night. "Hey, I 
hope these guys win it, they've got a lot of guys I really like," Bowa said of 
the Padres, a team he managed from the winter of 1987 to May 28, 1988. "Tell 
you what, there's four on that team that I would have liked to have last year." 
He was referring to the acquisitions after McKeon took over -- Jack Clark, Walt 
Terrell, Bruce Hurst and Dennis Rasmussen. Bowa also talked about players he 
disliked who were finally shipped out after Bowa had departed. "It's funny how 
everybody who I said couldn't play, Jack has finally gotten rid of," Bowa said. 
"I didn't want Chris Brown -- he was Chub Feeney's (former club president) man 
all the way. I didn't want Stanley Jefferson. I didn't want Andy Hawkins. All 
three guys are struggling someplace else, they are all gone now. But when I was 
manager I couldn't get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon has suddenly put on his trader's hat and spent much of Thursday's off 
day and Friday's pregame time making calls about prospective deals. The Padres' 
biggest hopes are with the Seattle Mariners, from whom they would love to pry 
pitcher Mark Langston. The Mariners want Eric Show and catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. 
McKeon would also like to do something with the New York Mets, who now don't 
need just a catcher (Gary Carter is injured) but also a first baseman (Keith 
Hernandez is injured). McKeon could gladly accommodate with minor league 
catcher Alomar Jr. and either of two first baseman -- Kruk or Carmelo Martinez. 
In return, the Padres could pick up center fielder Lenny Dykstra, reliever Rick 
Aguilera and minor league pitcher David West. McKeon is also talking with the 
Phillies about reliever Steve Bedrosian or Jeff Parrett and third baseman Chris 
James.

TYSON ACID TEST FOR 'MOUTHPIECE OF CHAMPIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALLACE MATTHEWS, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is the bravest man in boxing today? 
</P>
<P>
Here's one vote for Dr. Richard Kaufman, a dentist who designed the so-called 
"Mouthpiece of Champions," a device that resets the jaw of a boxer and 
supposedly improves his ability to take a punch. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman claims no boxer has ever been knocked out while wearing it, but he 
admits it was worn by Michael Olajide when he was stopped by Iran Barkley and 
by Donny Lalonde when he was stopped by Sugar Ray Leonard. Said Kaufman: "I 
don't count TKOs." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Kaufman's mouthpiece, and his reputation, face by far their toughest 
test July 21, when Carl Williams wears it into the ring to fight Mike Tyson. 
Williams, known for his tinkling chin, has yet to be knocked down while wearing 
the Kaufman Special. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman said part of Williams' problem in taking punches was the poor condition 
of his mouth, with many rear teeth missing, causing a misalignment of his jaw. 
Kaufman says the mouthpiece resets Williams' jaw in a position that makes his 
entire body "kinesiologically stronger." 
</P>
<P>
And, Kaufman adds, the same type of mouthpiece was worn by Bonecrusher Smith 
when he fought Tyson, and it will be recalled that the Clutcher did, indeed, 
stand up for 12 rounds. So how does the good doctor think The Truth will do 
against Tyson? "With my mouthpiece, he can probably go at least five rounds 
with Tyson," Kaufman said. "If he keeps his ... hands up." 
</P>
<P>
For Sale: Two slightly tarnished Golden Boys. Well-spoken, marketable, rare 
white variety, popular with the opposite sex, do great pre- and post-fight 
interviews. Looking for title shots despite recent setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Sold, to ABC, which sprung for the weekend package of Donny "Golden Boy" 
Lalonde vs. World Boxing Council light-heavyweight champ Dennis Andries on June 
24, followed by Bobby "Matinee Idol" Czyz vs. International Boxing Federation 
light-heavyweight champ Prince Charles Williams on June 25. 
</P>
<P>
Lalonde, coming off a creditable showing against Sugar Ray Leonard in November, 
deserves another shot at his former crown. Czyz, coming off a loss to WBA champ 
Virgil Hill, is the type the networks seem to love, win or lose, and he and 
Williams fought an exciting match last time, the Prince winning on a 
ninth-round TKO. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the most attractive match would have been Czyz-Lalonde, but that 
would've violated the Golden Rule of Network Boxing: Don't knock off a Golden 
Boy sooner than you have to. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Duva and Shelly Finkel flew out to Los Angeles to observe 6-6, 315-pound 
Tony Mandarich in a boxing workout. Mandarich, the Michigan State offensive 
tackle chosen second in the National Football League draft by the Green Bay 
Packers, has said he wants to fight Tyson and is willing to postpone his 
football career a year to do it. Duva and Finkel, rejecting suggestions that it 
is all a negotiating ploy, came away impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw a guy as ferocious and strong as this guy," Duva said. "He's all 
strength and he outweighs Tyson by 100 pounds. He can pick Tyson up and throw 
him out of the ring." 
</P>
<P>
Sorry Lou, but any boxing person can answer that claim in just three words: Too 
Tall Jones. 
</P>
<P>
IBF middleweight champ Michael Nunn will defend his title against former IBF 
champ Iran Barkley, on HBO, in August. The questions are where and when. In the 
running are Trump Plaza (Aug. 11), the Las Vegas Hilton (Aug. 12) and Caesars 
Palace (Aug. 19). Promoter Bob Arum wants Trump, because he believes the Los 
Angeles-based Nunn's career needs some East Coast exposure, but Nunn's manager, 
Dan "Hollywood" Goossen, wants to keep Nunn fighting in front of friendly West 
Coast fans. 
</P>
<P>
More Duva on Mandarich: "He's a better athlete than Tyson. He runs a 4.6 40 
(yard dash)." Sorry, Lou, but that's been tried already, by Alfonzo Ratliff and 
Tyrell Biggs, among others. Problem is, you run out of ring after 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Don King's idea of staging an undercard of Hollywood stars boxing one another 
to prop up a Tyson-Jose Ribalta fight in Los Angeles is the same as telling the 
public, "This fight is garbage," in different words. 
</P>
<P>
The self-styled "World's Greatest Promoter" sold Tyson-Williams to Trump for a 
bargain-basement $1.5 million -- half his original asking price and the lowest 
site fee for any Tyson fight since he won the title in November 1986. And, he 
let potential Tyson opponent Adilson Rodrigues, with whom Tyson could have made 
about $10 million in Brazil, get away. Instead, "Maguila" will fight Evander 
Holyfield July 15. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes Cruz and Joe Manley turned him down, so Buddy McGirt faces Derrick Kelley 
at the Felt Forum in New York May 25, in preparation for a CBS network date 
with Tony Baltazar on July 9. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent spasm of lunacy, I turned to Mitch Green for some insight into the 
Tyson-King alliance. How long, I asked Blood, did he think Tyson and King would 
stay together? 
</P>
<P>
"Not long," he said, sounding serious and thoughtful. "Not long at all." 
</P>
<P>
Why? "Because I'm going to kill both (of them)."

METS' GREGG JEFFERIES HITS ON HARD TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gregg Jefferies has never failed for this long in his short baseball career, 
and it's beginning to push the already-introverted New York Mets' rookie 
further inward. 
</P>
<P>
"He's eating himself up a little bit every day," batting coach Bill Robinson 
said. "Every time he makes an out, he acts like it's the end of the world. He 
comes back to the dugout muttering to himself, then proceeds to step on his 
lower lip. He's trying too hard and not having enough fun out there." 
</P>
<P>
If Jefferies caught the public's attention at the end of 1988, he's lost their 
imagination already at the start of 1989. No one dares utter the word "phenom" 
anymore. And no one seriously refers to him as a potential rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Jefferies, hitting .198 with no homers in his first 29 games 
this season after hitting .321 in the same number of games last season, has 
slowly but inexorably faded into the growing group of impotent Met hitters 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
He's been benched, platooned, then put back in the lineup every day. He's gone 
so far as to change his locker because "there weren't any hits" in the previous 
one. 
</P>
<P>
At the plate, though, really nothing has changed. He's still lunging at bad 
pitches, still uppercutting, and still "pulling off" the ball -- "the three 
worst mistakes a hitter can make," Robinson said. He's made an obscenity out of 
one of the most beautiful swings in the game, a stroke so level that even Don 
Mattingly admired it. 
</P>
<P>
But even if his stroke isn't level, Jefferies is trying to maintain a level 
head. "I won't let the pressure of everybody else's expectations beat me," he 
said. "I know what I can do, and I know I can hit." He says he's simply been a 
victim of overaggressiveness and bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sick and tired of people telling me to hang in there," he added. 
"Everybody keeps coming up to me and saying that I'm hitting the ball hard and 
that I'm eventually going to get my hits." He ran his fingers through his hair, 
sighed, and laughed sarcastically. "I don't need to hear that. I know that. I 
don't need to hear a thing about hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding, the slump has transformed Jefferies into a solemn figure 
around the Mets' clubhouse. Before games, he's barely noticeable, keeping to 
himself rather than joining his teammates in a card game or some banter. He'd 
prefer to sit by his locker and clean his bat. 
</P>
<P>
The cocky grin and swagger of the '88 Jefferies are gone for now. And so is the 
respect from the opposing pitchers. After a game in late-April, Chicago Cubs' 
relief ace Mitch Williams said snidely, "All I know about Jefferies is that 
he's short and not swinging the bat too well right now." 
</P>
<P>
"Pitchers aren't even working on me this season, and that really bugs me," 
Jefferies said. "I've seen fastballs right down the middle, even with runners 
on base." 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies hit rock-bottom on April 15, when he went 0-for-5 against the St. 
Louis Cardinals and dipped into a 1-for-28. After lining out sharply to left 
field on his first at bat, the normally self-contained Jefferies walked into 
the runway and threw his first major league temper tantrum. He ended up kicking 
a door and a ladder. "I don't know what the ladder was doing there," he said. 
"But it really didn't matter. I would've kicked anything." 
</P>
<P>
Thinking he lost his job and would soon be heading for triple-A, Jefferies met 
with Manager Davey Johnson the next day for a one-hour closed-door meeting. 
Johnson, allaying his player's fears, told Jefferies he wasn't going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"He's my future," Johnson said later. "He's got all the tools to be a big 
player in this game and help us win a lot of games. I can't let him get so down 
that he gets away from himself." 
</P>
<P>
Promoted from triple-A Tidewater last Aug. 28, Jefferies made his adjustment to 
the majors seem like child's play -- the play, that is, of a 20-year-old child 
prodigy. For most of September, he dominated the back pages of the New York 
newspapers, and one paper even pumped him for National League Rookie of the 
Year. In his first full week in the major, he hit .440 with two doubles, a 
triple, and three homers. He finshed at .321 with eight doubles, two triples, 
and six homers. It was a hard act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the buildup, if I hit .310 this season, it might still be a 
disappointment," Jefferies acknowledged during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
While his fielding was suspect during his minor league career, Jefferies could 
always hit. He hit .343 in rookie league, .354 in class-A, .367 in double-A, 
and .282 at triple-A.

CARTWRIGHT'S GAIN COULD BE KNICKS' LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY KORNHEISER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most intriguing of the four NBA conference semifinal series continues to be 
Chicago vs. New York, because it's the only one that continues. Detroit and the 
Lakers swept their opponents, though they were discreet enough not to parade a 
broom along the alien court like the win-goofy Knicks did in Philly; Phoenix 
needed only five games to derail Golden State, the Little Engine That Couldn't 
Quite. 
</P>
<P>
The focal point of the Knicks-Bulls series, justifiably, has been Michael 
Jordan, whose presence on the court is like Sinatra's on stage -- you can't 
take your eyes off him. If you're a Bulls fan, you'd have to be encouraged by 
Game 5, even though Chicago lost. (The next sentence is pretty scary; you may 
want to exercise parental discretion before letting your children read it.) 
Jordan got 38, but it was an unkempt 38; he rimmed a covey of open jumpers, and 
went 11:58 of the second period without scoring a single point. Yet even 
without Jordan being Jordan, Chicago still managed to be only a 3 away from 
tying the game within the last two minutes against a wounded lion of a team 
that won 26 in a row at home earlier in the season. New York can't play much 
better than it did. Jordan can. 
</P>
<P>
Knicks Coach Rick Pitino might have made the savviest of all postgame comments, 
when he said, "We can't keep worrying about Michael Jordan. We have to worry 
about the Knicks' offense." 
</P>
<P>
Historically, Jordan ringing points up like call waiting doesn't ensure a 
Chicago victory. When he gets 40 or more, the Bulls are 6-4 in the playoffs; 
when he gets 50 or more, the Bulls are 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks aren't losing just because of Jordan-they're also losing because 
they've been heatedly defended. During the regular season New York averaged 
116.7 points, third best in the NBA. Through four playoff games against Chicago 
that average was 101. Game 5 was the first time New York didn't play incognito. 
</P>
<P>
The Knick whose offense had lapsed most dramatically was Patrick Ewing. He 
averaged 22.7 points in the regular season, and 17 in New York's three playoff 
losses. After being compared to Rip Van Winkle, Ewing detonated for 32 in Game 
5. But the irony of the series is that while Jordan's the player of impact, the 
player of destiny has been the one guarding Ewing -- "pushing him, that's all 
I'm doing, just pushing him" -- Bill (Would Someone Hand Me My Oil Can) 
Cartwright. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Mr. Bill. 
</P>
<P>
The same Mr. Bill who labored long and drearily for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
"You're (something smelly), Mr. Bill," Garden fans would serenade, "really 
(something particularly smelly)." 
</P>
<P>
Does he who whiffs last whiff best? 
</P>
<P>
He'd been drafted by the Knicks in 1979, played for three winning teams in 
eight years, and came to symbolize the frustations of the franchise. He played 
a soft center; a nice shooting touch, but no warrior banger. (People looking at 
Cleveland's Brad Daugherty, in their nightmares, see Mr. Bill.) By the close of 
last season everybody in New York had given up on him. Cartwright was 
ineffective at big forward, where he'd been posted after Ewing's arrival. His 
points (11.1) and rebounds (4.7) were dropping off the table. His 
fits-and-starts playing style resembled a cab trying to go up Sixth Avenue in 
rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
So it was with glee, and the intoxicating scent of unbridled larceny, that the 
Knicks announced last summer they'd traded Mr. Bill to Chicago for Charles 
Oakley. Not only had they dealt age for youth-Cartwright is 31, Oakley 25-but 
they'd dumped an unwelcome player and brought in a stud rebounder. On Chicago, 
Oakley averaged 13 rebounds a game for two years. He was just what the Knicks 
needed alongside Ewing. Not only that, but he scored 12 a game, which was more 
than Cartwright. A steal? The Brinks job should have been so thorough. 
</P>
<P>
All season long the trade still looked aces. Oakley's numbers (12.9 points, 
10.5 rebounds) surpassed Mr. Bill's (12.4, 6.7), and Oakley was the signficant 
addition as New York vaulted from 38 victories to 52. But here in the playoffs 
Mr. Bill has reopened debate by elevating his game beyond what anybody thought 
possible. He has been shoving Ewing off the low block, and entirely out of the 
paint. Ewing, consequently, is getting the ball out of his comfort zone and 
shooting from unpleasant distances. In Game 5, Ewing, who most assuredly is a 
warrior banger, was suddenly and stunningly dominant, particularly at the end 
of the game when it mattered most, scoring seven of the Knicks' last nine. (Mr. 
Bill had fouled out by then.) But in the Knicks' three losses, Ewing shot 43.8 
percent; usually he shoots 56.7. Cartwright averaged 16 points, one behind 
Ewing. They shouldn't be that close even if they lockered together. 
</P>
<P>
"Numbers don't mean a lot as far as I'm concerned," Cartwright said in his 
familiar, self-effacing husky whisper. "Are you helping your team? This is a 
team game." It would be fun to report that a thin smile of vindication crossed 
his lips, but Cartwright remained expressionless. "I'm not into that anymore," 
he said. "It takes away from what I'm thinking about, which is winning games 
and having the possibility to do something I've never done before -- play for 
the Eastern Conference championship." Now the smile appeared. "After that it's 
only one more step to the NBA championship." 
</P>
<P>
Turning thoughtful again, Cartwright reviewed his tenure in New York with a 
surprising affection. Disdaining Byron's "Sweet is revenge," for Bacon's "A man 
that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green," Cartwright said, "My goal 
isn't for any revenge in New York. I established myself here. I became 
financially secure here. Now all my goals are about being on a successful team 
that has a chance of winning it all."

THE LAST OF A REDSKIN GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So football old is Dave Butz that he played when his sport actually was 
seasonal. The nephew of a former secretary of agriculture explained a habit he 
now will be forced to break: 
</P>
<P>
"I would step up my workout routine as the wheat (near his Belleville, Ill., 
home) changed color. Wheat goes from green to light green to a mixed color to 
golden. When it got real yellow, I was ready to go to training camp." 
</P>
<P>
No longer. And when news that Butz will not miss the Midwestern wheat harvest 
this season, that the oldest NFL starter last year and the Redskins' all-time 
leader in games played was calling it quits, a minicam blitz hit his home. 
</P>
<P>
"One person was so excited," wife Candy Butz said, "he blurted out: 'You just 
blew China off the front page.' " 
</P>
<P>
By announcing his retirement, although certainly in no retiring mood, the 
38-year-old Butz severed the last and largest link between the winningest 
coaches in Redskins history. 
</P>
<P>
George Allen brought Butz to Washington in 1975 for what seemed a sinfully high 
price: two first-round draft choices and a number two; Butz leaves Washington, 
after a firm shove from Joe Gibbs, with two Super Bowl rings and enough warm 
memories to keep the longest glory glow flickering. 
</P>
<P>
Allen ordinarily is an unerring judge of football talent. Too late did he 
realize that the core of players he left after the 1977 season would help 
another coach realize his Super Bowl dream for the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
John Riggins came with Allen and, like Butz, left involuntarily. So did Joe 
Theismann, George Starke and a couple of Marks, Moseley and Murphy. Now Gibbs 
has made another of those painful decisions for which he gets paid so 
handsomely. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is saying so, but this tense ending probably followed a familiar theme: 
Butz believes loyalty should cause the Redskins to carry him another season; 
the Redskins believe that happened last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say what I'll be doing (in the future)," Butz said. "Somebody 
with more intelligence than I have might come up with a fantastic idea I might 
just jump all over." 
</P>
<P>
Here Butz paused. 
</P>
<P>
"Meaning I'm open for suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
Retirement day was too hectic for meaningful reflection; besides, he had done a 
good deal of it fairly late in his career. While doing so, Butz answered 
critics, some of them Redskins coaches, who whispered he was too gentle to 
realize Hall of Fame potential. 
</P>
<P>
"Every quarterback I hit knows I hit him," Butz said. "If you mean do I have 
the ability to blindside a quarterback or hit him in the middle of the back as 
he's throwing the ball, I have absolutely no problem with that whatsoever. To 
hit him with 300 pounds, plus about another 30 pounds of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Because my problem in getting to him is immense. Once I'm there, I'm gonna hit 
him. But if I had to hit that quarterback -- I could take his legs out from 
under him, break his legs or whatever -- I wouldn't do it. I'd still hit him 
high. 
</P>
<P>
"I've broken collarbones, dislocated a few shoulders on some quarterbacks. On 
one quarterback, I heard the bone break, when Karl (Lorch) and I hit him. He 
was trying to get up and I said: 'Stay down; you're hurt.' " 
</P>
<P>
Generally in the NFL, if a player lasts four years he can survive another five 
or so. It has to do with coming to terms with pain and experiencing teamwide 
ecstasy. That's why Butz could play hurt and play Santa with equal enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"I love people who have the willingness to learn," he said at an especially 
pivotal time. "People that have a quest, a thirst for learning, to be better, 
to improve themselves. I'd give up all-pro for a team, a defensive unit, that 
wanted to be the best it could be, that got after somebody, that played the 
defenses that were called. That's what we're tryin' to do here." 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen days later, the Redskins won Super Bowl XVII. 
</P>
<P>
Games with the Cowboys were semiannual Armageddons during nearly all of Butz's 
14 years with the Redskins. At a critical moment once, fourth down in Texas 
Stadium, Butz was within heartpounding earshot of Cowboy bickering. 
</P>
<P>
Danny White tried to lure Butz and his buddies offsides with a long snap count. 
When that didn't work, White called an audible. Almost instantly, Butz could 
hear the Cowboys center, from his hunkered-down position, turn his head toward 
White and mutter: "No ... no ... no." 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins soon threw that lousy judgment for a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Butz has seen the evolution of football to a year-round business. Minicamps. 
Daily grunts through the weight room during the offseason. Intrusions such as 
these seem less offensive when salaries rise as they have. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, all but a few of the Redskins -- players, officials and 
exceptional people with ordinary titles -- Butz recalls most fondly no longer 
are with the team. His generation of players has been absent for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Butz talked about that shortly before the start of the 1988 season. Leaning 
against a wall at Redskin Park, he looked toward the far end of a practice 
field perhaps 150 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
"The 10-yard line," he said. "Just to the right of the goal post as we're 
looking. That's where I've stretched (during warm-ups) ever since I came here.

"Theismann and Moseley used to be close by. Brad Dusek was around. (Tom) 
Beasley and Curtis Jordan were around. (Ron) McDole and (Pat) Fischer. I used 
to eat lunch with Fischer. You feel like a piece of you left each time one of 
them did." 
</P>
<P>
Dean Hamel and some other thoughtful Redskins surely are thinking something 
similar.

GLENDALE WINS VOLLEYBALL TITLE OVER HARVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROCKY PINHEIRO, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someone forgot to tell the Glendale High volleyball team that it wasn't 
supposed to have a chance at winning the Southern Section 3-A Division title 
Saturday at Marina High in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Dynamiters won decisively over top-ranked and previously unbeaten Harvard, 
taking consecutive games, 16-14, 15-12, 15-12. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweeping Harvard is the sweetest feeling in the world," Glendale senior 
outside hitter Chad Blatchley said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (16-5), which won all 15 games in five playoff matches, fell behind in 
the first game, 9-2, as Harvard sophomore Mark Shoptaw and junior Rick Osterloh 
were nailing their spikes. 
</P>
<P>
The Dynamiters recovered, however, and behind the kills of senior Joey English 
and Blatchley pulled to within a point of Harvard, 13-12. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden swing in momentum rattled the Saracens, who passed the next serve 
out of bounds to fall into a 13-13 tie. 
</P>
<P>
After both teams scored on kills, Glendale took advantage of consecutive 
Harvard passing errors to take the first game. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard jumped to an 4-1 early lead in game two and extended the advantage to 
7-2. English, who had a match-high 21 kills, then took control, and, with a 
combination of his kills and four double-hit calls on Harvard (18-1), the 
Dynamiters evened the score, 8-8. Glendale took its first lead of the game, 
10-9, on a block by Brent Hoxie and Rick Callister and never trailed again en 
route to a 2-0 lead in the match. 
</P>
<P>
"After we won the first two games I was confident we'd take the match," 
Glendale Coach Jack Trotter said. "But we played Harvard earlier in the season 
and went up two games to none and they came back and beat us. That obviously 
didn't happen tonight, and I'm just elated with this championship." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale bolted to a 6-0 lead in the third game, but Harvard rallied to within 
13-12. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard, however, committed two unforced errors, including a backcourt 
violation that ended the match, and Glendale had won its first title in 11 
years of volleyball at the school.

AFTER WILD FIRST INNING, HARBOR DEFEATS CYPRESS IN REGIONALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The public address system at Rancho Santiago College was playing cartoon theme 
songs before Harbor College's Southern California regional playoff game 
Saturday against Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why it was such a looney-tunes first inning for Harbor starting 
pitcher Pat Ahearne. 
</P>
<P>
* First, there was the ground ball that exploded up out of the dirt off second 
baseman Mike Stone's glove for a base hit. 
</P>
<P>
* Then there was the curve ball that skipped past catcher Gus Mungaray and 
ended up in left field after Mungaray sailed it past third base, allowing a run 
to score. 
</P>
<P>
* And then there was the routine pop fly into shallow left that shortstop Tony 
Liebsack misjudged, and turned it into an RBI single for Cypress' Doug Yates. 
</P>
<P>
And after Cypress scared up three runs in that inning, Ahearne was waiting for 
the 200-ton weight to drop. 
</P>
<P>
Things returned to normal after that, however. Ahearne held Cypress scoreless 
after that, and Harbor (31-13) exploded for seven runs in the fifth for a 
come-from-behind 7-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had a little bad luck at the start," said Ahearne, who scattered 10 
hits across nine innings to improve his record to 10-4. "It seemed like when 
they hit the ball, no one was there or the ball would hit a perfect spot. But 
after that we worked out the little bugs." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor meets Cypress (33-14) in the championship game of the double-elimination 
tournament today at 11 a.m. at Rancho Santiago. If Harbor wins, it goes on to 
the state playoffs next week in Sacramento. If it loses, it will play a second 
game against Cypress later this afternoon to determine the regional champion. 
</P>
<P>
"Some teams still don't believe we're for real, I guess," said Harbor Coach Jim 
O'Brien. "But I guess when we're on the bus or the plane for Sacramento, maybe 
then they'll believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's fifth-inning outburst made a believer of Cypress starter Dennis 
Burbank (12-5). Burbank, a 6-foot-4 right-handed transfer from Pepperdine, 
struck out four and allowed only one hit in his first four innings. 
</P>
<P>
But Harbor jumped on the hard-throwing Burbank for six consecutive hits to open 
the fifth, including RBI singles by pinch hitter Frank Fields and center 
fielder Ryan Karp, and a run-scoring double by George Baker. Burbank got two 
outs, but then David Kushan lined a double. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were a little intimidated by Burbank's size at the start," O'Brien 
said. "But then the guys started coming back to the dugout saying that he was 
losing his speed." 
</P>
<P>
Ahearne, on the other hand, got stronger as the game went on. He pitched out of 
jams with two runners on base in each of his first five innings, but gave up 
only one hit after the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The defense sparkled behind Ahearne in the late innings as well. In the eighth, 
first baseman Danny Parente made a slipping, off-balance throw to Ahearne to 
get pinch-hitter Chris Hunt. On the next play, Liebsack ranged far up the 
middle at shortstop and gunned down Cypress' Terry Tewell to take away another 
base hit. 
</P>
<P>
Ahearne struck out six, and got Yates, Cypress' clean-up hitter, to watch a 
fastball go by on the outside corner for strike three in the ninth with a 
runner on. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of time to rest in the dugout (while Harbor rallied in the 
fifth)," Ahearne said. "Now I get to sit back and hopefully watch a good game 
tomorrow and then get ready to go to Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor got eight of its ten hits in the fifth inning, but made them count. 
Liebsack and Kushan led the Seahawks with two hits apiece.

TEAM SPIRIT HELPS ADVANCE TOROS TO NCAA II GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So you think golf is a game strictly played by individuals? 
</P>
<P>
Don't tell that to the team at Cal State Dominguez Hills. The Toros benefited 
from a little teamwork to advance into Tuesday's opening round of the NCAA 
Division II Championships at the Lake View Country Club in Erie, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Led by a pair of 69s recently by Jeff Manare and Enrico Montano, the Toro team 
came from 13 shots behind in the final round to capture the title of the last 
Western regional qualifying tournament. The victory advanced the team to the 
national finals. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an amazing feat," said Dominguez Hills Coach John Johnson. He compared 
the comeback to a football team "being four touchdowns behind after the end of 
the third quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Five players constitute a golf team, with the highest score in each round 
thrown out. That format is appealing to the Toros, who may be one of the most 
close-knit group of golfers around. A first-place finish in any of three 
Western regionals would have advanced the team. But the best Dominguez Hills 
could do was second place in the second regional. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after falling behind at the end of 36 holes in the third and final 
regional event, the Merced Invitational, the five Toro players went out to 
dinner together. Led by No. 2 Ray Fawcett and No. 4 Montano, the talk that 
night, and again the next morning at breakfast, was spirited. 
</P>
<P>
"We told each other to refuse to give up," Montano said. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Manare, who carries an average of 77, heeded the advice. "It really fired 
us up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Montano said the dinner table talk was about "bearing down and making a few 
pars." 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out," he continued, "we got a couple of birdies." 
</P>
<P>
Golf is a sport most often portrayed by television as a one-on-one experience. 
You sink the putt, you win. You miss it, you lose. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf is such an individualized sport," said Montano, who was a ranked youth 
player in tennis before taking up golf six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On the collegiate level, most players have their own pros and their own home 
courses. They often practice alone. Collegiate coaches are many times no more 
than organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson sees his role in a team concept somewhat differently. "My job is to 
motivate them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall he put his charges through conditioning runs and even during the 
season he insists that they lift weights. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is regarded as somewhat of a character. He has authored several books 
on golf and football and has campaigned to take American football worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
He has spent the last five years researching the effect of weight training and 
conditioning on golfers. A book is forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"This year I concentrated on getting them in shape," Johnson said. "I think it 
paid off." 
</P>
<P>
College golfers must carry their own bags and often the toughest thing they 
must endure is walking through lunch when tournaments run late. It's not 
uncommon for players to bring food onto the 10th tee. 
</P>
<P>
To the layman, eating a hotdog and walking a golf course doesn't seem like 
much, but according to Johnson "if you walk 36 holes you got to be in shape." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's difficult for golf to shake its glitzy, loner image. Even the team 
concept on the collegiate level isn't helping, because most people don't 
understand it. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, tournament golfers not only play for their schools but also as 
individuals. On any given day a player is not only scoring for a team but may 
be battling one of his teammates for low-medalist honors. At 72-hole 
tournaments, days can go by without players from the same school speaking to 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
And so, the feeling of pulling for a teammate is atypical of this game. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Dominguez Hills enters a team in the nationals for the second time in five 
years because a few players were willing to break with tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there will be individual competition in Pennsylvania, too. In all, 
90 of the top individual golfers on the Division II level will be competing in 
the four-day event. And, oh yes, each of the Toros -- Manare, Fawcett, Rich 
Chartrand, Montano and Bob Hayes -- will be shooting for a medalist spot. 
Johnson has sent individuals to this tournament in five of the last seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
As compared to the 1985 team, which finished seventh in the nationals, the 
current Toro team is about two strokes off the pace. But Johnson is confident. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1985 we didn't have the depth we have on this team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, five years ago the team was led by All-American Mack Smith, who 
finished eighth in the individual competition. He carried a 74. Of the five men 
competing this year, any one is capable of lowering the team average. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson sees the team peaking at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
"They're ready to play, and I think they will do well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills, however, rates little more than an underdog roll. The team 
from Florida Southern is expected to be an easy winner. 
</P>
<P>
But then, a little teamwork and who knows?

STINGING LOSS FOR P.V. HIGH IN BASEBALL PLAYOFF OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the long course of 28 seasons, Palos Verdes High baseball Coach Gil 
Eberhard has experienced his share of bitter defeats. But he couldn't remember 
any that hurt more than Friday's 4-3 loss to Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, he knows the pain will linger. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," he said, pacing in front of his dejected players, "that's the 
bad feature about games like this." 
</P>
<P>
It's the way the Sea Kings lost that will haunt Eberhard. 
</P>
<P>
In command most of the way, Palos Verdes let its CIF-Southern Section 5-A 
playoff opener slip away at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Three errors in the last two innings opened the door for four Millikan runs, 
wiping out a 3-0 lead and a stellar pitching effort by right-hander Steve Hoye, 
who baffled the Rams all day with a steady diet of curve balls. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen anyone like (Hoye)," said Aaron Seja, Millikan's lead-off 
hitter. "We see mostly fastballs in our league." 
</P>
<P>
Seja, hitless in his first three at-bats Friday, faced Hoye for the last time 
with two outs in the bottom of the seventh inning and the tying run on second 
base. With the count 3-2, Hoye threw a curve ball that Seja half-heartedly 
swung at, just trying to make contact. 
</P>
<P>
The weakly hit ball easily could have been handled by a Palos Verdes infielder, 
as Eberhard pointed out. But instead it sailed past Hoye and skipped through 
the middle of the infield to tie the game, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Seja then stole second and advanced to third on a throwing error by catcher 
Mike Hoye. Dante Powell grounded to shortstop Lance Haworth, whose high throw 
pulled first baseman Jon Jacobson off the bag, allowing Seja to score the 
winning run as Powell safely dove into first. 
</P>
<P>
The play set off a wild celebration by Millikan, which has never lost a 
first-round playoff game in eight seasons under Coach Dan Peters. Meanwhile, 
stunned Palos Verdes quietly gathered in its dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Peters realized his team was fortunate, considering the way Steve Hoye pitched. 
The junior allowed only five hits and one walk. Unfortunately for Hoye, the 
walk led to Millikan's tying run in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were in trouble when he could throw his breaking pitch for a strike 
any time he wanted," Peters said. "We never got a chance to run." 
</P>
<P>
Millikan (18-8), the Moore League runner-up, will face Ocean League champion 
Culver City (21-6) in the second round Tuesday. Palos Verdes finished with a 
17-11 record. 
</P>
<P>
Five South Bay teams will play second-round games in the CIF-Southern Section 
baseball playoffs Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5-A Division, Bay League quad-champion Hawthorne (17-12) will play at 
home against top-seeded Lakewood (23-3), the Moore League champ. Francisco 
Cordova pitched a four-hitter Friday to lead visiting Hawthorne past Alemany, 
4-1. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A Division, Santa Fe League champion Mary Star (19-6) faces Morro Bay 
(17-5) at Fromhold Field in San Pedro, while El Segundo and St. Bernard play 
away games. Second-seeded El Segundo (22-5) plays at Orange Lutheran (14-10-1) 
and St. Bernard (19-5) travels to meet Agoura (14-7). 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran rallied to defeat Miraleste, 7-5, on Friday and spoil what 
would have been an all-South Bay match-up between the Marauders and El Segundo. 
St. Bernard advanced with an 8-4 victory over Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
In the Small Schools Division, third-seeded Chadwick (15-5) will play at home 
against Villanova Prep (12-7). Senior right-hander Greg O'Riordan (7-0) pitched 
a three-hitter and struck out nine to lead the Dolphins past visiting Boron, 
6-0. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo and Mary Star each received first-round byes in the 2-A baseball 
playoffs, and having a week off was a welcomed relief for Mary Star Coach Frank 
Ponce de Leon. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us time to recooperate and get some sore arms healthy," he said. "We 
need a little break. This is a good time to prepare for the next step. Put it 
this way, I'm glad to be in the second round. Usually Mary Star teams have a 
tough time getting past the first round." 
</P>
<P>
Ponce de Leon said the Stars have reached the second round only twice since 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Star will send senior right-hander Rick Ibarra (9-2, 1.97 ERA) to the 
mound Tuesday against Morro Bay, a team Ponce de Leon recently scouted. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo's baseball season came to a disappointing end Friday with a 17-2 loss 
at the hands of second-seeded Riverside Poly in the 5-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Sea Hawks should be in better spirits Thursday night at the 
baseball awards banquet at the Los Verdes Country Club in Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
The program will include a dedication of the Redondo scoreboard to the late 
Denny Johnson, a former Sea Hawk assistant coach, and a testimonial for former 
head coach Harry Jenkins, who stepped down last season after guiding Redondo to 
10 league titles in 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $17 and can be obtained at the school or by contacting Athletic 
Director Steve Shaw at 379-5421, Ext. 206. 
</P>
<P>
It's unusual in baseball for freshmen and sophomores to make an impact on the 
varsity level, but the South Bay boasts several young stars. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a soph-frosh team any coach would love to have: 
</P>
<P>
1B -- Danny Manjarrez, El Segundo sophomore (.309, 5 home runs, 29 RBIs); 2B -- 
Paul Lemire, Miraleste sophomore (.387); SS -- Grant Hohman, St. Bernard 
freshman (.400); 3B -- Antone Williamson, Torrance sophomore (.463, 4 home 
runs, 37 RBIs); OF -- Armando Fernandez, Hawthorne sophomore (.452, 5 home 
runs, 24 RBIs, 18 stolen bases); DH -- Cody Beason, Mira Costa freshman (.368); 
RHP -- Armando Cervantes, Bishop Montgomery sophomore (6-1, 1.80 ERA); LHP -- 
Pat O'Hara, Palos Verdes sophomore (5-3, 2.60 ERA); UTIL -- Brett Newell, El 
Segundo sophomore (7-1, 3.90 ERA, .390).

SOFT TOUCH MAKES COHEN HARD TO BEAT ON THE COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Cohen thinks he might pursue an advertising career once his tennis career 
at Cal Lutheran ends. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, along with completing the class work required of a marketing 
major, Cohen employs subliminal techniques of the soft sell in his tennis game. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have trouble playing me because of my style," Cohen says. "I 
don't hit the ball as hard as most players at the college level. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets into an opponent's head. Once he thinks, 'I can't believe this guy is 
beating me,' that's when I know I'm going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Cohen has been a pretty good advertisement for the Cal Lutheran tennis 
program, which is enjoying another successful campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, at Christ College in Irvine, Cal Lutheran won its third consecutive 
NAIA District 3 tournament team championship. Cohen defeated teammate Matt 
Simpson to win the singles championship and also teamed with Simpson to win the 
doubles title. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Cohen and the Kingsmen will begin play in the NAIA championships at 
Rockhill Country Club in Kansas City, Mo., where they will try to improve on 
last season's 17th-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran, which finished the regular season 14-13, is ranked 20th among the 
35 teams that are expected to take part. Defending-national champion Lander 
College of Greenwood, S.C., Texas College of Tyler and the University of West 
Florida are among the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"All year we've been beleaguered by injury after injury after injury," said 
John Siemens, who is in his ninth year as coach of the Kingsmen. "How we do 
back there depends on our draw and how well bodies hold up." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, in fact, is the only Cal Lutheran player who is not nursing an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Paavo Salmi, the team's No. 1 player for most of the season, has two bad 
ankles, Simpson has been bothered by elbow and thigh problems, Mike Gennette 
has a strained Achilles' tendon, Brian Turner's wrist, ankles and shoulder are 
tender and George Kovacs has a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran's hopes, therefore, would appear to be riding on Cohen, who was 
26-8 during the regular season and is the only ranked player (64th) on the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony doesn't give away points. He's a counterpuncher more than anything else," 
Siemens said. "He cuts you and slices you and you bleed to death, and you don't 
even know you're bleeding because he does it so softly." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, 21, lost only five matches in three years at El Camino Real High before 
enrolling at Cal State Northridge upon graduation in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But he never got the chance to compete at Northridge. He redshirted his 
freshman year, after which the school announced that it was dropping its men's 
tennis program. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple friends said they were thinking of transferring to a school called 
Cal Lutheran," recalled Cohen, who grew up in Woodland Hills. "I had never even 
heard of Cal Lutheran." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen transferred to Pierce College for the 1988 spring semester and went 
undefeated in the regular season before losing in the Western State Conference 
tournament quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
He transferred to Cal Lutheran in February, and, despite missing the first 
three weeks of the tennis season because of a transcript delay, has become the 
team's top contender for individual national honors. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Groff had the best finish ever by a Cal Lutheran men's tennis player when 
he reached the quarterfinals of the national championships in 1987.

RAYBURN WINS EVENTFUL STREET STOCK EVENT AT SAUGUS SPEEDWAY 
</P>

A succinct recap of Saturday night's 25-lap, 28-minute, 
yellow-flag-and-tow-truck-filled NASCAR Street Stock oval main event at Saugus 
Speedway -- brought to you by Tom Kimmel of Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
"My right front tire decided to go flat on the 21st lap," Kimmel said, sounding 
not a bit perturbed. "Don't ask me why. I couldn't make the turn." 
</P>
<P>
But Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley could. Rayburn, 25, who began the race third 
behind points leader Steve Nickolai of Simi Valley and pole-sitter Kimmel, 
nickeled and dimed his way to his second main event win of the season before 
3,319 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
The race featured six yellow flags (four in the first 13 laps) and no more than 
seven laps were recorded at one time in the 24-car race -- 25 if you count the 
track tow truck, which made three appearances. 
</P>
<P>
A tow-by-tow description: 
</P>
<P>
On Lap 8, Mike Mandel of Arleta spun out in Turn 2 and was hitched up and 
rolled away. 
</P>
<P>
On Lap 13, Karl Lasater of Sepulveda slammed into the wall in the backstretch 
and was wheeled to the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Eight laps later, Kimmel appeared to roll straight into the wall in Turn 1 
while Rayburn and the rest of the pack made left turns. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been tough to have passed him," said Rayburn, who survived a 
final yellow flag and coasted to the checkered flag. "I would have banged a 
little on him at the end. But they were waving the black flag at me earlier a 
couple of times because I was banging on him, so I figured I better mellow 
out." 
</P>
<P>
In a thrilling, 15-lap figure 8 Street Stock main event, Russ Beckers of 
Sepulveda and Rayburn dueled for the lead amid heavy traffic before Beckers, 
who began the evening sixth in the points standings, edged Rayburn at the 
checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Crow of Canyon Country finished third. 
</P>
<P>
In the 40-lap Sportsman main event, Will Harper of Tarzana led from pole to 
checkered flag for the second time in as many weeks to post his second 
main-event win of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, 34, who began the evening fourth in the points standings, finished 
ahead of Keith Spangler of Northridge, who began the race in second position 
for the second consecutive week. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett Yamada of North Hollywood won the 25-lap Mini Stock main event. 
</P>
<P>
Frank White of Los Angeles won the Sportsman semi-main and Ken Wilson of 
Lancaster won the Street Stock semi-main. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Estes and Roger Theobald, both of Saugus, and Pat Mintey Jr. of Canyon 
Country each won eight-lap Sportsman heat races.

CARPENTER, DUPREL SHARE BAD FORTUNE IN SPRINT FINALS

<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday was a day of watching for La Mesa's Ken Carpenter at the third stop of 
the seven-city Sundance Juice Sparkler Grand Prix of Cycling. And he did not 
like what he saw at the San Diego Velodrome in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
First, Carpenter watched as fiance Renee Duprel was involved in a nasty spill 
in the first race of the women's sprint match final. Then he watched as rival 
Curt Harnett of Canada raced past him with a surprising move to easily win the 
first race of the men's sprint final. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter never recovered from the mental lapse and lost the best-of-three 
event, 2-0. Duprel could not continue with injuries suffered in the crash with 
Connie Paraskevin-Young and lost by forfeit. Duprel led, 1-0, because Young was 
disqualified for not leaving her enough room at the top of the track. But 
Duprel said she could not race again. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred on the final turn as Duprel tried to pass Young by going 
over the top. Young, a bronze medalist at the 1988 Olympics, and Duprel were 
side-by-side when Duprel hit the wall, and the two cyclists went sprawling down 
the track. Both suffered cuts and abrasions and banged their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just coming around, and she just took me up to the rail because she was 
in danger of me coming around," Duprel said. "I remember thinking 'this was 
going to be a bad one.' If she did it gradually, it would have been legal, but 
it wasn't that gradual. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it was her fault, that she took me down. It was pretty radical." 
</P>
<P>
Young had a different view. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what happened was that we were very close to each other, and she got 
herself out of control, and she couldn't come back," Young said. "You think I 
want to go down? You've got to be kidding me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry we went down, but it's one of those things. If you want to look at 
it that way, she took me down." 
</P>
<P>
The judges didn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
After the crash, Carpenter had a dilemma. Part of him wanted to see his fiance, 
and part of him knew it was better to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking, 'God, I want to go over to the trainer and see how she is,' " 
Carpenter said. "But I knew the best thing was to stay away. I'm just one more 
person going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter also had to think about his first race against Harnett, who beat him 
in the final last week in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But Harnett took advantage of Carpenter's first-race lapse to win easily. 
Carpenter took the lead but then took his eyes off Harnett, who immediately 
accelerated and raced past before Carpenter knew what had happened. Harnett 
followed that race with a close victory to clinch the event. 
</P>
<P>
"The first race my mind was somewhere else," Carpenter said. "But Curt did a 
really good move."

finished the inning by scoring the winning run as El Capitan defeated visiting 
Orange Glen, 1-0, in an opening-round San Diego Section 3-A softball playoff

LEARNING TO LOVE THROUGH STORYTELLING; 
</P>
<P>
THE TEMPLE OF MY FAMILIAR BY ALICE WALKER (HARCOURT BRACE JOVANOVICH: $19.95; 
432 PP.; 0-15-188533) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Luci Tapahonso, Tapahonso is an assistant professor of English at the 
University of New Mexico. Her most recent book of poetry is Breeze Swept 
Through (West End Press). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The origin stories of tribal people long ago were accounts of hardship, 
optimism, love and finally, of endurance. These stories are still told today in 
various contexts and to listen to the storyteller is to participate in the 
re-creation of an entire people. It is to participate in the rhythm of ancient 
voices, complete with nuances and laughs of delight. Or cries of grief. It is 
to participate in songs, to listen to stories animals have to tell and to 
believe worlds other than this one exist. Through the storyteller, we 
experience the dreams, the hopes, pain and the love of a people. We understand 
it is this love that will outlast us all. 
</P>
<P>
The storyteller in this account is Alice Walker, the acclaimed poet and writer. 
She asks us to suspend learned literary expectations and become part of the 
evolution of a people. "The Temple of My Familiar" is technically a work of 
fiction -- it is also the moving account of the outside forces imposed upon a 
tribal people, the fears and grief thereof and it speaks directly to the 
strength of love and the resilience of all living parts of this world -- 
humans, animals, birds, and the Earth itself. This mode of storytelling has 
nothing to do with linear time, detailed maps or chronological order. It is as 
simple as telling stories in one's kitchen (which does happen) or over iced tea 
on the back porch. In this setting, gestures, nuances in narration and facial 
expressions make it clear as to who is speaking. 
</P>
<P>
The novel begins with Zede, who weaves beautiful peacock feather capes for 
celebrities in America. This once-revered art was taught to Zede by her mother, 
who also learned from her own mother. The capes were once part of the ritual 
ceremonial regalia worn by her ancestors in South America. In San Francisco, 
Zede sells the exquisite capes to support herself and her daughter, Carlotta. 
The capes have become a fashion showpiece and available only to the rich and 
extravagant. Zede is one of the last remaining survivors of her aboriginal 
community and the stories following are heartwrenching accounts of the 
colonization of a people. Through Zede's and other characters' voices, we 
experience the effects of Christianization on native people and the effects of 
"civilization." The stories are first-hand accounts and draw us in immediately 
and the events are not obscure historical facts, after all. It is real and 
painful. The power of the oral tradition is overwhelming. We understand the 
loss and pain when American Indians speak today of the Cherokee Trail of Tears 
or the Long Walk of the Navajos, their eyes glistening with tears. Walker 
intends it to be this way as history creates us, and centuries or decades have 
no meaning in this context. 
</P>
<P>
The six major characters in this book tell their stories to each other. We are 
eavesdroppers. We are fortunate as their voices are distinct, poetic at times, 
and always filled with the love of language and of humor. This is particularly 
true with the elderly characters -- Lizzie, Hal, Shug and Celie. 
</P>
<P>
Celie and Shug, who are familiar to many from Walker's novel, "The Color 
Purple," are content, independent women in this story. Their deaths are not 
events to mourn but rather, a continuum of life on another level. Readers are 
not saddened as Walker teaches acceptance of the inevitable in a gentle, caring 
manner. The novel contains a strong sense of connectedness between generations 
and between women and an equally strong underlying current of loss and grief. 
</P>
<P>
Fanny and Lizzie are two of the strongest characters in "Temple." They are very 
intuitive and their stories are bursting with innate strength, incredible 
psychic abilities and a belief in more than this world. Through them, we learn 
of other life forces and other planes of existence. Through them, we examine 
the evolution of gender roles and the possibility of an existence of a true 
egalitarian society before the institutions of family, marriage and patriarchy 
were established. 
</P>
<P>
This book is a celebration of ordinary life and of everyday emotions. Whether 
it is Lizzie and Hal cooking gumbo and telling stories, the aroma of fresh 
homemade bread or the sounds of children in the next room -- our senses are 
alert. The simple rituals that are preparation for a storytelling session 
focuses on small and memorable details: " . . . Suwelo watched TV much less 
himself now that Miss Lizzie and Mr. Hal talked to him . . . he was in the 
habit of covering it whenever it was off. Mr. Hal contented himself with 
tugging at a corner of the shawl and straightening the edge. The small ritual 
completed, a gesture that seemed unconsciously designed to close off completely 
an erroneous and trivial point of view. Mr. Hal settled back to take up his 
narrative where he had left off . . . these talks . . . were not conversation. 
They were more perceived as deliveries Suwelo was grateful to receive." 
</P>
<P>
Racism is a daily issue for many people of color and this is addressed deftly 
and with compassion. For instance, when Mr. Hal tells Suwelo about the purchase 
of a home: "No doubt the neighbors thought the house too fine for 'niggers' . . 
. I don't think black people were allowed in that part of town then. But we 
were so discreet they hardly ever saw us. We never sat or stood on our stoop . 
. . there was an alley behind the house and we always went in the back way . . 
. we kept it spotless, this house, the grass clipped and the hedges trimmed. In 
the early years we worked on the grass and hedges at night. It was nicer than 
anything we'd ever dreamed of living in." 
</P>
<P>
Walker explains that anger and violence will not change the world, but an 
appreciation of each other will improve our lot here. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, "The Temple of My Familiar" is a novel about love -- in all its forms; 
love for spirits and spirituality, love for the land and plants, love for all 
people -- regardless of color, sexual preference or age -- and love for all 
living things. It is about compassion for the oppressed, the grief of the 
oppressors, acceptance of the unchangeable and hope for everyone and 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Walker has written beautifully about dreams, the power of stories -- and 
about the remarkable strength of our own histories.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING BY GILDA RADNER (SIMON &amp; 
SCHUSTER: $17.95; 269 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX RAKSIN

<TEXT>
<P>
"Portrait of the Artist as a Housewife" is the title Gilda Radner initially 
intended for this book, which she had envisioned as "a collection of stories . 
. . about things like my toaster oven." Fate dealt her a considerably less 
humorous topic, however, in late 1986, when she was diagnosed with ovarian 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
One might think Radner among the least well-equipped to grapple with such a 
demon in print, for the comedienne's best-known characters on the original 
"Saturday Night Live" -- little girls at slumber parties or on first dates -- 
seemed to spring from a still-innocent spirit. Radner's style of comedy, 
however, like that of her colleagues on the show, was precisely the kind that 
drew its inspiration from inner pain. John Belushi, for example, Radner's 
mentor and best friend on the show, might have seemed to practice only 
diverting slapstick -- throwing himself in the air and splashing on the hard 
set in one skit, threatening to stab himself in another -- but his work had a 
manic attribute that seemed driven by necessity, as if living life on the edge 
was a way of palliating inner fears. Similarly, Radner's characters, as she 
recounts here, often were drawn from turbulent childhood memories. 
</P>
<P>
Because Radner's comedy had this serious, introspective side, the spirit of 
honesty and bravery that is so apparent in these pages comes as no surprise. 
This is not to imply, however, that Radner wasn't devastated by the diagnosis, 
for it came two years after she had married actor Gene Wilder, giving up her 
self-destructive behavior (such as chain-smoking) to begin a new, domestic 
life: Around Wilder, Radner writes, "The brash and feisty comedienne turned 
into this shy, demure ingenue with knocking knees." 
</P>
<P>
First on Radner's new agenda was to bear a child, but when she found she 
couldn't sustain a pregnancy, she began the regimen of tests and operations 
that the majority of this book chronicles, often with great humor: "I saw the 
dye running through my reproductive system on a closed circuit screen in the 
examining room," she writes. "There I was, lying on a table with my legs spread 
apart, watching the worst show I'd ever seen on television. The show was 
called, 'My Tubes Were Closed.' " 
</P>
<P>
These pages are not always so lighthearted, though, for as Radner's title 
suggests, "It's Always Something" is essentially a collection of bittersweet 
stories about living with what her therapist calls life's "delicious 
ambiguity." It is about "not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and 
making the best of it." One day in the midst of her chemotherapy treatments, 
for instance, Radner puts on a raincoat and goes walking on the street. A car 
comes by and splashes her with mud: "That's me," she says loudly to herself, 
"'Cancer Woman'! You can do anything to me. I can walk through storms. I can 
get splashed by cars. I can have millions of treatments. You can radiate me, 
you can give me poisons, but you can't destroy me because I'm Cancer Woman!"

What happens to that youthful formality of purpose?

(I feel like I'm lost, do you? Listening to everyone

<P>
applauding a play I missed.) Spring here in L.A. today, 
</P>
<P>
ninety or so, everything in bloom. I drive my four- 
</P>
<P>
year-old to preschool and turn off Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
into a stakeout. Top-lit cop cars jacknifed onto lawns,

<P>
a chopper churning the smog, an amplified voice:

Give up while you can. Come out with your hands raised. 
</P>
<P>
My kid doesn't look up from her book, The Big Orange Splot. 
</P>
<P>
All the hyper-tense police phrasing doesn't phase her.

But who's in that house? Finally, we're allowed to pass,

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: CITY MOVES A USER'S GUIDE TO THE WAY CITIES WORK BY 
STEPHEN FRIEDMAN (MCGRAW-HILL: $22.50; 310 PP.)

"City Moves" initially seems too good to be true, with intriguingly titled 
chapters (e.g., "The Theatrics of City Life") promising to demystify the ideas 
of hundreds of urban and regional planners. And unfortunately, this is a case 
where first impressions prove correct, for in order to view all of these 
theories in one glance, Stephen Friedman is forced to stand at such a distance 
from them that colors fade and details become obscure. 
</P>
<P>
Failing to evoke the wonder of cities -- the way they choreograph social 
rituals, for example, or parent their populations -- "City Moves" is burdened 
by verbose definitions ("Community has been defined by the sociologist Gideon 
Sjoberg as 'a collectivity of actors sharing a limited territorial area as the 
base for carrying out the greater share of their activities' ") and curious 
statistics whose origins are left unexplained (Why does Los Angeles -- a city 
made of suburbs -- not even make his top-22 list of the most "suburbanized 
major U.S. Cities"?). 
</P>
<P>
Reminiscent of a high school geography textbook, this dry text might help 
explain American students' chronic apathy toward geography. In a National 
Geographic Society survey conducted last year, for instance, less than 25% of 
first-year American college students could find Japan, Iran or other newsworthy 
countries when presented with a world map.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE SPIRIT OF NATIVE AMERICA BEAUTY AND MYSTICISM IN 
AMERICAN INDIAN ART BY ANNA LEE WALTERS (CHRONICLE BOOKS: $16.95; 120 PP.)

These essays and color photographs of clothing, housing, weapons and icons are 
especially striking because they show how traditional Indian culture has done 
away with the dualisms that rock Western culture: Dualisms between art (what 
Westerners believe they see in a museum or theater) and life (the daily 
routine); dreams (diverting reveries) and wakefulness ("reality"); nature (that 
which is outside of us) and culture (that which we create). In traditional 
Native America, Anna Walters shows, dreams offer direction in life, culture 
emerges from nature (which is both inside and around us) and art and life are 
intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
An example of the latter is suggested in a photograph of Indian sheaths for 
rifles which had been inherited from Western settlers. Transforming the merely 
efficient objects into cultural artifacts, the sheaths were richly painted to 
reflect nature's harmony and tapered into long, thin strands of hide at the 
rifle's end to suggest the source of the object's destructive power. This 
crystallizing of invisible forces is the principle purpose behind all of the 
art portrayed in these pages. As one "artist-spirit" fictionalized by Walters 
recounts, "When I was a young child, I already knew there were playful spirits 
in the wind, in the lizard sitting motionlessly on my hand. . . . I felt there 
was something that was unseen in me, but nevertheless was the link to 
everything else here." 
</P>
<P>
Walters' "spirit-voices" sometimes grow tiresome, breathlessly intoning the 
same message about spiritual omnipresence ("The nations live! My spirit lives! 
The spiritual world is everywhere!"), but more often they convey a message 
reassuring to those concerned about the ephemerality of life. "Having been born 
into the (Indian) nations," one voice says, "I know with profound certainty 
that infinite life is beauty."

LOCKLIN POEM IN BLANK VERSE

<P>
It's all been a joke, right? All these weeks as you've been publishing this 
pedestrian prose in your poet's corner, you've been laughing and nudging each 
other, knowing none of it could pass Emily Dickinson's definition of poetry. 
</P>
<P>
And now the denouement -- "Homage to John Cage" -- the epitome of non-poetry! 
At least Gerald Locklin has a sense of humor.

I'm sorry, but in printing "Homage to John Cage" you should not have listed

<P>
I rise in defense of private, copyright property: for the "text" of Gerald 
Locklin's "Homage to John Cage" is identical with that of my poem, "The Lazy 
Man Says Hello to God" (Christopher's Books). 
</P>
<P>
I ask you: Is this plagiarism, or is it not? 
</P>
<P>
I omitted registering my poem with the Guinness Book of World Records as the 
world's shortest. I held off because I saw a logical question whether a poem 
with no words at all could be said to possess extension or duration -- an issue 
which Locklin's non-text raises in alluding to John Cage. Unlike Locklin's 
heavy-handed art object, however, mine was a bona fide expression of its 
fictive protagonist's ruling passion (laziness), which later in the "narrative" 
would prove itself in a haiku only 4-5-3 syllables long.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ARTURO TOSCANINI CONTEMPORARY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE MAESTRO 
BY B.H. HAGGIN THOMAS HATHAWAY, EDITOR (DA CAPO PRESS: $13.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

This copious paperback began life as two volumes from the sharp pen of B. H. 
Haggin, a 50-year veteran of New York music criticism. The first segment 
consists of Haggin's conversations with the Italian conductor, the second of 
statements Haggin collected from musicians who had performed with the maestro. 
Toscanini (1867-1957) is an excellent subject for personal reminiscence, since 
the colorful conductor is almost as famous for his legendary tantrums as he is 
for his musical prowess. Haggin himself was Toscanini's equal in vanity, yet 
these two men developed a warm friendship, perhaps because they formed a mutual 
admiration society. Toscanini allowed Haggin to attend rehearsals; this sign of 
favor becomes particularly interesting in light of rumors that Toscanini 
periodically ordered lights turned up in the hall during rehearsals while staff 
scoured the balconies to see that nobody was concealed there. 
</P>
<P>
Toscanini's pronouncements on the great composers were no more respectful than 
his views of contemporary musicians. On one occasion a member of the orchestra 
commented that Toscanini looked in good form. Toscanini replied despondently: 
"I am an old man." But Maestro, the musician persisted, "think of Verdi. He 
lived to be 87." "Verdi!" Toscanini snorted scornfully. "He was a sick old man. 
I am strong; I will live longer than Verdi."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: PATRIOTS THE MEN WHO STARTED THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION BY

This history of the American Revolution focuses on the great men and decisive 
acts that are part of our national mythology. The author undertakes to make the 
historical figures appear human, neither glorifying heroes nor dismissing 
traitors. His conversational style and simple presentation bring the issues 
alive. Of John Adams, he writes: "When the debate over the Articles of 
Confederation moved from committee to the floor of the Congress, John Adams 
joined those delegates who assailed Dickinson's one-state, one-vote provision. 
Now that his hard work had brought him wealth and eminence, he couldn't agree 
that property should count for nothing." Although the breadth of material may 
lead some to dismiss the book as superficial, Langguth has produced a history 
exciting enough to interest teenagers and a treatment of the idea of heroism 
serious enough to engage history buffs. "For those who have decried the 
mushification of American history," wrote Jody Powell in his review of 
"Patriots" in these pages, "A. J. Langguth has provided a spicy, toothsome 
respite."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: GIRL, 20 BY KINGSLEY AMIS (SUMMIT BOOKS: $8.95)

Originally published in 1970, this satirical novel reflects 1960s England 
through the perverse prism of two classical musicians. The narrator, Doug, is 
the music critic for a London daily; his chum, Roy, is a composer, conductor 
and violinist knighted for solidly second-rate contributions to England's 
cultural Establishment. Sir Roy, propelled by a voracious appetite for 
ever-younger girls -- his wife has worked out a mathematical equation that 
describes the increasing age differential -- drags Doug along as abettor to his 
middle-aged lechery. 
</P>
<P>
An undercurrent of "incoherent yelling" is carried on throughout the story by a 
series of secondary characters: the toddler son of Roy's latest marriage; his 
daughter's boyfriend, who, when not screaming wordlessly in the background, 
goes about hurling accusations of "fascist" at anyone within earshot; unnamed 
caterwaulers in dimly lit nightclubs. In the course of his forced exposure to 
the pop culture he'd rather deplore from afar, Doug begins to see "the possible 
virtues of Bruckner's 8th Symphony" and to feel "sorry for having too hastily 
rejected those musical works which consist of a stated period of silence under 
concert conditions." As always, Amis' aim at the modern world, not to mention 
eternal human foibles, is dead on.

UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICS OF CULTS IN CONTEMPORARY AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
CULTS &amp; CONSEQUENCES THE DEFINITIVE HANDBOOK EDITED BY RACHEL ANDRES AND 
JAMES R. LANE (PUBLISHED BY THE COMMISSION ON CULTS AND MISSIONARIES, COMMUNITY 
RELATIONS COMMITTEE, JEWISH FEDERATION COUNCIL OF GREATER LOS ANGELES: $14.95, 
PAPER; 250 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Russell Chandler, Chandler is a Times religion writer and author of 
Understanding the New Age (Word Publishers). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the visibility of so-called destructive cults may have dimmed from 
media attention somewhat, many of these groups are every bit as active now as 
they were 10 to 15 years ago. And, according to this encyclopedic reference 
book, families, social service agencies, religious leaders -- as well as 
would-be joiners and ex-cult members -- urgently need to understand the 
dynamics of cults in American society. 
</P>
<P>
The volume, dedicated to Maynard Bernstein, the late Los Angeles cult educator, 
is an anthology of previously published articles and excerpts plus some 
original contributions. They were written by people who have viewed the 
multifaceted cult scene from a variety of perspectives: psychiatrists, 
psychologists, educators, lawyers, former members, parents, and deprogrammers 
and "exit" counselors. 
</P>
<P>
The editors note that perhaps as much as 12% of U.S. cult membership is Jewish, 
though only 3% of the American population identifies with Judaism. Yet, while a 
Jewish perspective shapes the book, it steers away from sectarianism. Material, 
for example, by evangelical Christian sociologist Ron Enroth of Westmont 
College is included, and the book's observations and insights should prove 
valuable to people of any -- or no -- religious background. 
</P>
<P>
"Our disagreement with cults does not focus on the content of their beliefs," 
the editors say early on. "Rather, we are concerned with what is, in our 
opinion, deceptive proselytizing and unethical conduct. . . . We are also 
concerned about the political activities of these organizations." 
</P>
<P>
"Cults &amp; Consequences" explores a panoply of topics: defining "cults" and 
what makes some destructive; how and why people become involved in cults; how 
cult recruiters operate and how indoctrination takes place; various ways 
members leave cults and why some stay out while others return; the role and 
perspective of parents, and legal issues in deprogramming and child custody 
when parents split over cult involvement. 
</P>
<P>
The approach is not glib: The work both recognizes and wrestles with the fact 
that there often are perceived benefits to cult membership and that complex 
moral and psychological "shades of gray" are involved. 
</P>
<P>
For example, exit counselor Steve Hassan, a former member of the Unification 
("Moonie") Church, says he finds it "particularly hard . . . to use a deceptive 
technique like the one many cults use to recruit, even though it is temporary 
and used for the purpose of helping people to regain autonomy. . . . My choice 
is based on the lesser of the evils. I would rather misrepresent myself than to 
encourage the use of forced interventions or do 'nothing.' " 
</P>
<P>
Readers will find the concluding section on resources and references especially 
helpful. Dozens of cult awareness and exit assistance organizations are 
included. The list of books and articles is much more limited. But co-editor 
Andres, who is director of the Commission on Cults and Missionaries for the 
Jewish Federation Council of Los Angeles, asks readers to send her "any and 
all" cult-related material for future reference. 
</P>
<P>
The book has some annoying glitches, such as occasionally not identifying the 
beginning or ending of excerpted materials, omitting items from the table of 
contents, inappropriately indenting passages, incorrectly breaking lines and 
pages, and typos. Patches of dull writing could be livened up considerably with 
a little astute editing. 
</P>
<P>
More serious is the book's patchwork-quilt format, which makes for uneven 
quality and considerable repetition. 
</P>
<P>
The book would be easier (and quicker) to read and more riveting if Andres and 
Lane had decided to be authors instead of editors, assimilating and quoting 
from their abundant materials and excellent sources but writing their own 
manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the format is not without strengths. Most chapters conclude 
with a useful study guide with questions for both group and individual use. 
Some are provocative: "If your salvation could only be achieved by getting 
other people to join with you, would you lie to get them to join?" And: "Where 
do you think the line is drawn between non-coercive and coercive exit 
counseling?" 
</P>
<P>
The frequent use of summaries, and lists of questions or points set off in 
boldface print or ruled boxes, make it easy to find specifics and skip over 
material not all readers will need, such as legal technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
The handbook was designed to help a broad range of professionals as well as the 
general public; it will provide all a comprehensive and objective overview of 
cults and a gold mine of thoughtful answers and tested, practical suggestions 
for action. 
</P>
<P>
Some may feel disappointed not to find more definitive information about 
specific cult groups -- by name -- telling how to combat them individually. The 
editorial decision not to do that was no doubt influenced by fear of hostile 
cult litigation, which, in fact, long held up the book's publication. 
</P>
<P>
That the editors and publisher of "Cults &amp; Consequences" weren't finally 
intimidated is itself laudable; that there was pressure to suppress the book 
underlines how much it is needed.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catherine Collins' article was ostensibly about foreign investment in U.S. real 
estate, yet the entire article dwelt on Japanese investments. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that everyone is jumping on the bandwagon to author a book or an 
article on Japan-bashing because the subject is beginning to hit a responsive 
chord with the public, with each publication tending to reinforce and heighten 
its fears and, of course, to make a buck or two for the author. 
</P>
<P>
Collins is basically parroting what others have written and adds no new 
insights. We are probably the world's biggest owner of foreign real estate, and 
yet we can't control even the smallest of nations through that ownership. 
</P>
<P>
In the L.A. Times (Washington Scene, Feb. 26), a Canadian was quoted: " . . . 
serious estimates indicate that more than $50 billion have been invested in 
U.S. real estate by foreigners since 1983. Somewhat surprisingly (emphasis 
mine), 57% of that total investment originated in Canada, 28% in Europe, 7% in 
the Pacific Rim, 6% in South America and the balance. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the fear of foreign ownership is nothing more than fear of 
Japanese ownership and the surprise expressed in the quote is quite 
understandable, given the emphasis of the media on blaming Japan for our 
shortcomings. Our emphasis should be more on how we can become more competitive 
and regain our former world pre-eminence in commerce. We seem to have forgotten 
we are still the most powerful economic nation in the world.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The April 30 section contained two letters concerned with the increase in 
foreign real estate investments in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to remind the writers that as American citizens, we are not forced 
to sell our property -- except during World War II, when the government 
imprisoned citizens and forced them to sell their assets. 
</P>
<P>
One letter writer suggested that legislation be proposed to limit foreign 
investment in our country. I would like to suggest that the writer organize his 
friends and neighbors into a group that will not sell to foreign buyers no 
matter how much profit they stand to make. After all, it is his friends and 
neighbors who are deciding freely to sell their homes. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the letter writers will stand behind their thoughts when a buyer offers 
them hundreds of thousands of dollars for their homes. Slam the door in their 
faces and say, "Hell no, we won't sell!" But please, leave the government out 
of it. I for one would like to have an option when someone offers me a good 
return on my investment.

Every country in the world has restrictions on owning property except the 
United States. Oregon, a state, will not sell coastal property. Minnesota only 
leases land around lakes. 
</P>
<P>
A real estate man told me the Japanese are their best customers. Even our high 
prices are cheap to Japanese. Americans are in Tokyo stimulating interest in 
investments in the United States. The citizens of U.S. are selling out their 
own country. Many of the silent majority care, but feel helpless. 
</P>
<P>
Our elected officials should pass laws limiting foreign investment in business 
and lease land only -- never sell it!

AT HOME: WRIGLEY: LONG BEACH DISTRICT DRAWS YOUNG BUYERS; 
</P>
<P>
PALM-LINED STREETS, AFFORDABLE PRICES REVIVE INTEREST IN WRIGLEY NEIGHBORHOOD.

<P>
Until a decade ago, the sleepy Wrigley district of Long Beach was headed into 
decline. The half-century-old mix of custom Spanish, Tudor and Colonial Revival 
homes fell out of favor with younger couples, many of whom were attracted 
instead to newer housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
Then a change began to take place. Younger home buyers rediscovered the allure 
of the district's quiet, palm-lined streets and solidly built houses at 
affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a lot of character," said Chris Kowal, an eight-year resident whose 
1932 house retains an original chute where ice blocks were delivered in the 
pre-refrigerator age. "It's not like moving into a new tract, where all the 
houses look the same." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents say the area named for chewing gum magnate William Wrigley 
has become very popular over the past couple of years, particularly among 
first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in great demand," said Len Crites of Coldwell Banker. "It has a 
predominance of Spanish-style homes that are real popular right now. Most of 
the homes are small -- two bedroom and one bath -- and they're perfect for 
young couples starting out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Situated for Commuting 
</P>
<P>
Sindy Verdugo of Landmark Properties-Century 21 said the area is attracting 
out-of-town home buyers priced out of fashionable neighborhoods like those in 
Torrance or the Belmont Heights section of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Working couples appreciate the area because its central location is well 
situated for commuting either to Los Angeles or business centers in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Also, residents say they hope that some of the luster of the city's revitalized 
downtown two miles to the south will rub off on Wrigley. Long Beach's downtown 
is undergoing a major high-rise building boom that has brought thousands of new 
jobs to the city. 
</P>
<P>
A $752-million, 22-mile light-rail line to Los Angeles is being constructed 
along Long Beach Boulevard, Wrigley's eastern boundary. And a popular bicycle 
trail to the beach runs along the Los Angeles River, at its western edge. 
</P>
<P>
Wrigley "is one of the most up-and-coming areas of the city," said Long Beach 
City Councilman Ray Grabinski, who represents the district. 
</P>
<P>
The district, however is not without its troubles. 
</P>
<P>
For years, prostitutes have prowled the sidewalk in front of a row of 
low-priced motels along Pacific Coast Highway, the district's southern edge. 
Residents complain that hookers sometimes drive into the neighborhood with 
their customers. 
</P>
<P>
The southeast area of Wrigley is plagued by some older, run-down apartment 
buildings, and crime rates are higher. The area outside of Wrigley on the east 
side of Long Beach Boulevard is considered so rough that firefighters briefly 
adopted a policy this year of refusing emergency runs in the area without 
police escort. 
</P>
<P>
And last summer, the neighborhood was invaded by millions of midges -- 
non-biting mosquito-like bugs -- that breed in the nearby river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Wrigley residents say they are combating the problems. They resurrected their 
homeowner association about three years ago and built it into a potent force 
that politicians credit as being one of the most powerful voices of its kind in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Residents picketed along Pacific Coast Highway's motel strip last summer to try 
to hamper the activities of prostitutes. The City Council recently enacted a 
law based on a Wrigley-backed idea that will allow the city to yank the permits 
of motels that operate as bases for prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Christmas Tree Lane 
</P>
<P>
While battling blight, the Wrigley Assn. also has done its share to show off 
the virtues of the district. 
</P>
<P>
One of its most successful efforts is the revival of a four-block-long 
"Christmas Tree Lane." A treasured annual event in the 1950s and 1960s, 
residents decorated a park median and draped thousands of holiday lights in the 
stately cedar trees along Daisy Avenue. Caroling, the Christmas display and 
free candy canes attracted a nightly throng of slow-moving cars with children's 
faces pressed against the windows. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Baker, a 40-year Wrigley resident who heads the association, said 
residents' efforts are paying off in soaring home prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Property values are increasing by leaps and bounds. It's just amazing," he 
said. Areas that had been considered marginal, such as those near Pacific Coast 
Highway, are now being recommended by real estate agents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Houses are being listed from $170,000 to $250,000, having leaped $50,000 or 
more in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethnically Diverse Group 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest change is the people who are moving in . . . young professionals, 
engineers, doctors," realtor Verdugo said. The area traditionally has been an 
ethnically diverse group composed of working-class couples and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Coldwell Banker's Crites said home prices have risen so fast in the past year 
that some first-time buyers may be priced out. The same two-bedroom, 
Spanish-style house that was considered overpriced last summer at a list price 
of $183,000 recently sold for $207,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Wrigley might be getting out of reach now for a lot of people," Crites 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The rising prices reflect a reborn appreciation of the quality of many of the 
older homes. Though modestly sized, the houses feature hardwood floors, 
mahogany trim, tile roofs, oversized fireplaces and coved plaster ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
The area is undergoing a renovation boom. Many of the old homes, recently sold 
after being rented for years or lived in by a longtime owner, are a 
do-it-yourselfer's challenge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historical Preservation 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quiet area. Everyone tries to take care of their house," said Ignacio 
Mireles, looking up as he planted divots of St. Augustine turf in the front 
yard of his four-bedroom home. Mireles and his wife, Irma, estimated that the 
house they bought six years ago for $105,000 has easily doubled in value. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have launched their own historical preservation movement. 
</P>
<P>
The residents on two blocks of Eucalyptus Avenue are attempting to win 
designation for it as a historical district. The move would protect the 
architectural character of the neighborhood and make changes in the appearance 
of houses subject to approval by the city Cultural Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Davis, one of the organizers of the drive, said the two blocks have the 
oldest, most valuable and beautiful homes in the district. The two dozen homes 
were built in 1929 by a development company under the control of Wrigley. While 
other contractors built homes throughout the district, the Wrigley name was 
applied to the entire area, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Wrigley because all the areas are custom made," she said. "You feel you 
are in Spain (or) Italy. It has so much romantic charm." 
</P>
<P>
Davis lives with her husband and son in their dream home. She said they bought 
the two-bedroom house with a library from the original owner, a woman who lived 
there 60 years, ever since her father gave her the house as a wedding gift. The 
doorways are arched, the fireplace is sheathed in marble and the sunken living 
room steps up to the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
While Wrigley's residential areas are rebounding, the commercial district is 
lagging. Many of the businesses along the two main corridors -- Willow Street 
and Pacific Avenue -- are older, mom-and-pop-type operations that are long on 
practicality and short on yuppie slickness. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Grabinski, however, predicted that Pacific Avenue may evolve into 
one of the city's most chic shopping districts once merchants realize they are 
a few blocks from Wrigley's increasingly upscale crowd.

THINGS THAT FIRST-TIME BUYERS SHOULD NOT DO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
While there are dozens of things that first-time buyers should do, there are 
also many that they shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't go out and buy a car or some other big-ticket item because the more you 
owe, the less you can borrow," said Linda Orr, president of the Irvine-based 
brokerage Real Estate Marketeers. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't change jobs unless you'd get a decent-sized pay increase because you 
want to show the lender job stability." 
</P>
<P>
Also, don't get surprised by any long-forgotten blemishes on your credit 
record. 
</P>
<P>
"Run a credit report on yourself through TRW (or some other major 
credit-reporting agency) to see if there are any black marks on your record, 
and clear them up now, so there won't be any surprises when you are trying to 
get your loan," Orr said. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, smart buyers start getting their ducks in a row ahead of time."

OTHER BENEFITS AVAILABLE WHEN FINANCING WITH VA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM MAHONEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are several other benefits, besides no down payment, to VA financing. 
</P>
<P>
The interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan guaranteed by the VA is 
generally one-half to one percentage point below the conventional rate. 
Fixed-rate loans are generally from 11% to 11 1/2%; the VA is 10 1/2%. The 
difference may bring down the monthly payment enough to tip the balance in your 
favor if you're a borderline qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
With the VA loan, you also save significantly on closing costs, since the VA 
has strict limitations on the costs to veterans. The buyer still has to pay the 
prorated interest and taxes, but the seller pays for the discount points. 
</P>
<P>
That's a major up-front savings to the buyer and not necessarily a drawback to 
the seller, since the amount can be negotiated into the sales price. 
</P>
<P>
Since the VA requires that property taxes be included in the monthly payments, 
you also have to pay tax impounds of one month to six months of taxes, 
depending on which month you buy the property in. 
</P>
<P>
There is a 1% funding fee that's charged, but the veteran can add that to the 
mortgage amount. With the VA loan, there is no charge for mortgage insurance, 
which is often slapped on first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The only other significant costs are roughly $300 for the appraisal and $200 
for title insurance. The first monthly payment is also due at closing, but 
since you need to have that money in the bank to qualify, that shouldn't be a 
hitch. WILLIAM MAHONEY

U.S.-JAPAN FIRMS IN REFERRAL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oakwood Corporate Apartments, the lodging company that specializes in providing 
long-term accommodations for business travelers and corporate executives, has 
signed an agreement with Tokyo-based Asahi Homes Ltd. that calls for the two 
companies to operate a reciprocal guest-referral program. 
</P>
<P>
The deal marks Oakwood's first overseas involvement in the lodging industry. 
Terms call for the two companies to launch cooperative marketing and 
guest-referral activities designed to attract Japanese business travelers to 
Oakwood apartments in the U.S. and American business travelers to Asahi's 
lodging facilities in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
An executive of Los Angeles-based R&amp;B Management Co., the company that 
manages Oakwood's 64 U.S. facilities, said the agreement is expected to lead to 
additional transactions.

The Times reported on April 30 that its testing had discovered Alar on apples 
sold by Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods Market in Beverly Hills. Mrs. Gooch's has 
challenged those test results and asserts that its own testing revealed no Alar 
in three of the four types of apples tested by The Times.

A story Thursday on San Gabriel City Councilman Frank Blaszcak's call for an 
investigation of city "irregularities," said that part of a lot owned by former 
Planning Commissioner James Dickson was used for a gas station owned by Fred 
Paine. The gas station is owned by Dickson. The story also erroneously said 
that Paine had subdivided a property into six lots. The correct number is five. 
It was also reported that Blaszcak had sued 11 current or former city officials 
for libel. Six of those being sued are civic leaders, not city officials.

MAKING WORK SAFE

<P>
Alan Andre, a 22-year-old steelworker, was crushed to death on a steel-cutting 
machine in a gruesome accident in a Vernon steel mill in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
His death and its cause were officially reported as required by law, just like 
the deaths and the causes of most of the other nearly 10,000 Americans who are 
killed each year while at work. 
</P>
<P>
Less certain to be reported is the cause of death of the estimated 50,000 
workers who die from sometimes hard-to-detect occupational diseases or the 
injuries of 5.5 million workers who are hurt on the job annually. 
</P>
<P>
But often entirely unreported are many violations of health and safety 
regulations issued to prevent those on-the-job illnesses, injuries and deaths 
like that of the young Vernon steelworker. 
</P>
<P>
Many agencies of the federal, state and local governments have been created to 
investigate unsafe working conditions and order them corrected before they kill 
or injure workers. However, there is general agreement that the government 
agencies do not have nearly enough investigators to cope with all of the health 
and safety problems of the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
So, many companies and unions have their own health and safety committees that 
add to government efforts to protect workers on the job. In recent years, 
though, a new way of increasing workplace safety has been developed. 
</P>
<P>
Small, non-governmental committees for safety and health have been set up in 
cities around the country to try on a small scale to make up for the shortage 
of government health and safety enforcement officers and also to help train 
workers to protect themselves on the job. Louisa Gratz, a founder of the 
private Los Angeles Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (LACOSH), 
helped Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Chatten Brown gather 
information for the prosecution of Andre's employer, Reliance Steel &amp; 
Aluminum Co., for failing to train Andre and provide adequate safeguards for 
the equipment that killed him. 
</P>
<P>
A jury found the company and two of its officers guilty of the charges. They 
had to pay $60,000 to help train non-Reliance workers to adopt safe work 
practices. The company was also ordered to set up an extensive safety program 
of its own, including the employment of a full-time safety inspector. 
</P>
<P>
Chatten Brown said LACOSH "makes substantial contribution to worker safety and 
health by advocating stringent standards and effective enforcement of those 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
"It also provides safety and health training for workers themselves," she said. 
"Although this training is the legal and moral responsibility of employers, 
unfortunately, all too often they do not provide the needed training and the 
responsibility falls on the employees." 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Vegas, head of LACOSH, said that the organization also "makes on-site 
inspections based on worker complaints of safety law violations." 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit committee here, like similar organizations in 25 other cities, 
was sparked primarily by unions, but financed with contributions from 
individuals and grants from private foundations and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Unions in Philadelphia and Chicago were among the first to establish their own 
committees on safety and health about 15 years ago and new ones are created 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
The size of each COSH, as they are called, varies substantially. The committee 
here has a budget of about $100,000 a year. The one in New York, NYCOSH, has a 
budget of nearly $700,000. But all of them rely heavily on union volunteers to 
teach both workers and companies how to prevent injuries and deaths on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, representatives of the committees met in Wareham, Mass., and 
agreed to share information and coordinate COSH activities on national health 
and safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
The NYCOSH was selected to serve as a clearinghouse for safety information that 
is distributed to the other committees, but there is no national headquarters 
that directs their functions. 
</P>
<P>
They do follow similar practices, though. In addition to training workers and 
supervisors, they sponsor public conferences on subjects ranging from indoor 
air pollution and asbestos exposure to so-called "right-to-know" laws that 
require companies to provide information about toxic chemicals in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
They bring together rank and file workers, union leaders, company 
representatives and outside experts in workplace safety to, among other things, 
develop new safety programs and improve old ones and to lobby local and state 
governments for improvements in present health and safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
California has an innovative "Cooperative Self-Inspection Program" that allows 
companies and worker safety and health committees to take joint responsibility 
for on-the-job safety. Companies with state-approved, management-worker 
self-inspection programs are removed from regular state inspection lists. 
</P>
<P>
The programs are based on what state officials say is the fact that available 
state resources do not permit regular or exhaustive inspections of all of 
California's workplaces. The self-inspection system uses the knowledge of 
managers and workers to improve job safety and reduces the need for more state 
inspections of workplace hazards. 
</P>
<P>
The safeguard in the system is the assumption that workers and managers will 
keep an eye on each other if there are violations of safety laws that might 
endanger workers or the company. 
</P>
<P>
A far more innovative idea was proposed last year by some national union 
leaders. It calls for either state or federal legislation that would require 
employees in almost all companies to elect members of "worker representation 
committees" that could give workers an official, major role in helping to 
enforce health and safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
While the proposal has won some support in Congress, there is little likelihood 
of Congress adopting it in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
But while that idea is studied, the private committees on safety and health 
continue to expand, increasing the ranks of those willing to help try to reduce 
the number of on-the-job injuries and deaths.

EMPLOYERS FIND THOSE WITH PHYSICAL HANDICAPS CAN DO A FIRST-RATE JOB.

<P>
When Hewlett-Packard was trying to fill a high-level position for a research 
scientist, a job that required some travel, the top contender was a man with a 
doctorate who also had a physical disability, which necessitated the use of a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
So Hewlett-Packard contacted the Job Accommodation Network (JAN), a unique hot 
line that acts as a clearinghouse for information for employers seeking special 
accommodations for workers with disabilities. (The phone number for JAN is 
1-800-526-7234.) 
</P>
<P>
The network was set up five years ago by the President's Committee on the 
Employment of People with Disabilities to help employers determine what 
accommodations are necessary to help a person with a disability perform a job. 
</P>
<P>
On the network's recommendation, Hewlett-Packard bought a portable hand control 
device with a rod-and-pulley system that attaches directly to a car's brake and 
accelerator and works like a hand brake on a bicycle. The $200 device can be 
installed quickly in any car, making it possible for the job applicant to use 
any vehicle in the company fleet. The man with the disability got the job. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, JAN didn't exist and the product probably didn't either," said 
Robert Ingram, affirmative action representative at Hewlett-Packard, the Palo 
Alto-based electronics giant. "I would have tried to track something down, but 
there's no guarantee I could have found anything to accommodate this man. Who 
knows? He may still have gotten the job. But he certainly would have been 
restricted as to some of the things he could be given to do in that job." 
</P>
<P>
Attitudes toward people with disabilities and their role in the work place are 
changing. Indeed, a recent survey by Louis Harris &amp; Associates of New York 
found that: 
</P>
<P>
* The overwhelming majority of managers give employees with disabilities a good 
or excellent rating. 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly all employees with disabilities do their jobs as well or better than 
other employees in similar jobs. 
</P>
<P>
* Eight out of 10 department heads and line managers feel employees with 
disabilities are no harder to supervise than those without. 
</P>
<P>
* Sixty percent of top managers said their companies can provide in-house 
training for people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting away from the idea that people with disabilities are sick and 
need care," said Frances Gracechild, executive director of Resources for 
Independent Living in Sacramento. "That view is really a form of 
discrimination, much like the discrimination suffered by blacks and women." 
</P>
<P>
The difference, she said, is that while minorities may be disliked, "disabled 
people are liked, sort of like sacred cows. 'Here, let us give you a nice 
convalescence hospital to live in the rest of your life.' But that 'kindness' 
is really denying people with disabilities equal rights to participation within 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
And it is that misdirected sentiment on the part of the non-disabled population 
that many advocates believe has provided the biggest hurdle to those with 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not just the lack of ramps and physical barriers that have kept us from 
participating," said Ramona Garcia, who serves on the California Governor's 
Committee for Employment of Disabled Persons. "It is the attitudinal barriers 
that are toughest of all." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest hurdle for Ron Brown, an associate at the California Human 
Rights/Fair Housing Commission, "was proving to myself what I always knew I 
could do." 
</P>
<P>
"Growing up, I heard a lot about what I would never be able to do as an adult 
because of my disability," Brown said. "I grew up with shows like Andy Griffith 
with a real bread winner who could take care of life and I always wanted to be 
one of those fathers. I don't have any children yet but I have proven to myself 
that I could be that breadwinner." 
</P>
<P>
Today approximately one-third of the 36 million people with disabilities are 
employed, according to a recent survey by the National Organization on 
Disability. But that means two-thirds are still unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had any decent data in the past, and we feel that more people with 
disabilities are working today than ever before," said Mary Kaye Rubin, 
legislative analyst for the President's Committee on the Employment of People 
with Disabilities. "The sad fact is that this two-thirds unemployment rate is 
probably an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that the statistics indicate that the U.S. labor force is 
declining, while the number of new jobs is on the rise," she said. "The baby 
boom is over. Companies have discovered they have to go after new sources, 
which will be good for minorities and women, of course. We hope that it will 
spill over for people with disabilities." 
</P>
<P>
With economic independence, people with disabilities can take control of their 
own destiny, said Gracechild. 
</P>
<P>
"But they must do that by applying for jobs and expecting to get them," said 
Gracechild, who says people should use the equal employment opportunity laws to 
protect their rights. "If people with disabilities are willing to settle for 
second-class participation, that is what they are going to get." 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for people with disabilities say everyone benefits from the increased 
independence and participation of this part of the population. 
</P>
<P>
"This new involvement in the work force by people with disabilities is a 
godsend to the economy," said Gracechild. "If you look at the health and 
welfare budget, it is going up exponentially." 
</P>
<P>
Today workers with disabilities hold almost every kind of job in Wendy's 
restaurants. McDonald's Corp. has a McJobs program. International Business 
Machines Corp. said it hired its first person with a disability in 1914 and 
approximately 4% of its current workers have disabilities. For four years, 
Apple Computer Inc. has had an office of special education and rehabilitation 
which works to increase awareness and implementation of microcomputer 
technology for children and adults with disabilities. Honeywell Corp. has a 
Handicapped Employees Council to help employees with disabilities reach career 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
Even the athletic image of a fighter pilot is not immune to change. At Edwards 
Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert, a test pilot's success depends on a 
2,500-member civilian team that includes about 250 people who have the "right 
stuff" in intelligence, training and motivation -- along with physical 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations to allow someone with a disability to perform on a par with 
other employees are often simple. JAN's consultants try to steer employers away 
from stereotypes by dealing with individual functional limitations, such as 
mobility, sight or hearing impairments, instead of a particular disability, 
such as cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
"If you stand back and look at a job from a functional standpoint, many 
activities within a job are often unnecessary," said Barbara Judy, a JAN 
consultant. "Take work hours, for example. A flexible schedule for someone with 
mobility problems will allow him to avoid rush hour. Or for a person who is 
diabetic, allowing him to break a company rule of no food at the desk can 
relieve him of a lot of anxiety. Or for someone who tires easily, maybe someone 
who had polio or someone with multiple sclerosis, a flexible schedule to allow 
for several short breaks makes a job much easier." 
</P>
<P>
Despite fears to the contrary, Juanita Campbell of the President's committee 
said: "It doesn't take a lot of time or money to make the work site accessible. 
It might be a 5-cent pencil or cutting the legs off a desk to accommodate 
someone in a wheelchair. And there are accommodations, like curb cuts, that 
benefit us all." 
</P>
<P>
JAN surveyed employers recently in order to dispel some of the myths and to 
evaluate the costs of accommodating employees with disabilities. Of the 
respondents, 31% said the changes cost nothing, 19% said the costs were $1 to 
$50, and another 19% put the price tag at between $50 and $500. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a JAN consultant helped a heavy construction company keep a 
long-time driver who suffered a back injury. The consultant located a special 
seat that absorbed almost all vehicle vibration and, for the price of a $1,000 
seat, the company kept an experienced worker. 
</P>
<P>
Computer technology has probably had more impact than anything else in opening 
up career possibilities for those with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Personal computers are the great equalizer," said Alan Brightman, manager of 
the innovative education program at Apple Computer in Cupertino. "A computer 
doesn't have any preconceived expectations about you just because you have a 
label attached. It allows us to approach someone with a disability as someone 
who can, rather than someone who can't." 
</P>
<P>
The options a computer offers are dramatic. For someone who is nonvocal, the 
computer provides speech. For a blind person, the computer can print in 
Braille. These people not only work more efficiently but do things previously 
considered impossible. 
</P>
<P>
While there are some federal protections for people with disabilities, they are 
not of the scope as those for minorities and women. The Architectural Barriers 
Act of 1968 was perhaps the first major step forward for those with 
disabilities. It was followed by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which mandated 
that federal contractors take affirmative action to hire and promote people 
with disabilities. But federal contractors provide only 50% of the nation's 
jobs, and there are no designated quotas or goals for hiring the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The Education of Handicapped Children Act of 1975, which was responsible for 
helping thousands of children with disabilities to join the mainstream, may 
have the most profound effect on future employment opportunities for people 
with disabilities. The act opened the education process to children with 
disabilities and, of equal importance to advocates, it exposed non-disabled 
children to people who have physical differences and laid the groundwork for 
future understanding.

HERE'S A GUIDE TO THE STATE'S WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each year, thousands of Californians injured on the job learn that, except 
under the rarest of circumstances, they cannot sue their employers, even if 
they believe that their injuries are their employers' fault. 
</P>
<P>
Injured employees are entitled only to benefits under a no-fault system called 
workers compensation. This system began 75 years ago when employees traded 
their right to sue -- and perhaps lose -- for modest, but sure benefits. These 
include free medical care, now up to $224 a week in lost wages, and small sums 
to compensate for permanent physical losses: $840, for instance, for the loss 
of a finger; $13,000 for the loss of an eye. Since 1975, injured workers unable 
to return to their old jobs have also been entitled to free retraining. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some answers to some commonly asked questions about the system. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Who is entitled to workers' compensation? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Virtually every worker whose injury "arises out of and in the course of 
employment," regardless of whose fault the injury was. A worker is entitled to 
benefits even if he had his affliction to begin with and work just made it 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What should a worker do if he's injured on the job? 
</P>
<P>
A: Report his injury to his employer, who is required to notify state 
government and the employer's workers compensation insurance carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can an injured worker go to his own doctor for the free treatment? 
</P>
<P>
A: Only if he told his employer before his injury that he wants to visit his 
own doctor, clinic or health maintenance organization. Otherwise, to obtain 
free medical care, the injured worker must visit the doctor of his employer's 
choice for the first month of treatment. After that, the worker can pick his 
own doctor for treatment, but must submit to examinations by the employer's 
physicians if they wish to evaluate his case. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What should an injured worker do if he suspects his injury is work-related, 
but is not sure -- if, for example, he is having symptoms such as aches and 
pains? 
</P>
<P>
A: See a doctor. If he thinks your injury is work-related, he is legally 
obligated to inform state government. Then tell your boss. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What if your boss and his insurance company dispute your doctor's 
assessment? 
</P>
<P>
This is often the case with so-called cumulative injuries -- less obvious 
injuries that creep up over a long period. You spend years digging ditches, for 
example, and your back finally wears out. If the company disputes the 
work-related nature of your back injury, then, to obtain workers comp benefits, 
you have to file a claim with the Workers Compensation Appeals Board. 
Ultimately, it will be up to a judge to decide if your injury is work-related. 
Meanwhile, if your back hurts too much to work, you can obtain state temporary 
disability benefits -- a maximum of $224 a week, the same as workers 
compensation benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are there places you can go for advice on how to pursue a disputed claim? 
</P>
<P>
A: Kenneth Draft, acting chief of the information and assistance bureau of the 
state division of industrial accidents, suggests calling one of his 20 
information and assistance officers spread around California. "We'll tell you 
what we think of your case," Draft said. Union officials are usually acquainted 
with the system. Plus there are lawyers who specialize in workers compensation 
cases. You can find them in the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When do I need a lawyer? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can file a case before the workers compensation appeals board yourself. 
But, said Melvin S. Witt, editor and publisher of California Workers' 
Compensation Reporter, which keeps track of developments in workers 
compensation law, "the only sound counsel as far as I'm concerned is that if 
you have any kind of injury that's serious, you should have an attorney." Witt, 
a former insurance company lawyer and chairman of the appeals board, said that 
even well-meaning insurance company claims adjusters are so overworked that 
"cases just sit their on their desks" and injured workers "get the runaround." 
Having a lawyer sometimes helps. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How much does a lawyer cost? 
</P>
<P>
A: Lawyers take these cases on a contingency basis and judges award them from 
9% to 15% of an injured worker's permanent disability award. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do these cases end? 
</P>
<P>
A: At some point, an injured worker's condition stabilizes. It becomes, in 
workers compensation parlance, "permanent and stationary." The doctor says go 
back to work or, if the employee remains unfit to resume his former job, begin 
retraining, said Michael Gerson, who represents injured workers and is 
president-elect of the California Applicants Attorneys Assn. The extent of the 
worker's permanent disability is assessed as a percentage of disability -- 
reflecting his diminished ability to compete in the open labor market. He 
either settles his case with the insurance company or pursues a permanent 
disability award from a workers compensation judge. These awards are usually 
payable in increments of $140 a week. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How would a workers compensation plan under consideration by the Legislature 
change things? 
</P>
<P>
A: All but the lowest-paid workers would get more benefits. The lowest paid 
workers would get less. Temporary disability payments would rise to a maximum 
of $511 by 1992. Mental stress claims that don't involve physical injury would 
be severely limited. Employees would have to pay half of their permanent 
disability awards for job retraining. Insurance companies would be penalized if 
they didn't pay workers promptly. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are the rare circumstances in which an injured worker can sue his 
employer for damages? 
</P>
<P>
A: If his employer physically attacks him, hides knowledge of a hazard -- such 
as a dangerous chemical -- that he knows is giving his workers a disease, 
deliberately removes an equipment safety guard, or manufactures the piece of 
equipment on which his employee gets hurt.

<P>
With workers skilled in reading, writing and math already in short supply and 
that shortage expected to worsen over the next decade, businesses increasingly 
are getting involved in education at all levels. 
</P>
<P>
From tutoring individual students to school district policy decisions, 
employers have discovered that they have a stake in the educational system. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is becoming more and more aware of the fact that students today are 
not prepared to fill the entry-level jobs," said Janet Keyes, Western regional 
vice president of the National Alliance of Business. "Companies that have a 
major entry-level work force are seriously concerned. High school graduates 
can't do the jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Small businesses and those that have need of clerical workers have found that 
they can't expand because they can't find enough qualified help, said Brad 
Butler, the former chairman of Procter &amp; Gamble who now chairs the 
Committee for Economic Development, a nonprofit business think tank. "And," he 
said, "this situation will get a lot worse before it gets better." 
</P>
<P>
"Businesses' interest comes from the fact that our competitive posture depends 
on the quality of our human resources," Butler said. "It's a battle we've been 
losing for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
So concerned is business about the quality of the work force that a 
multibillion-dollar preschool education program proposed by Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.) was embraced by executives of major corporations, including 
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, General Electric and Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
During testimony before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee earlier 
this year, the executives recounted the difficulty companies are facing. 
</P>
<P>
"In our tire plants you can't have a guy who can't read or write running a 
million-dollar machine," Robert Mercer, chairman of Goodyear, told the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric is having trouble finding job applicants who "meet our 
requirement of either being ready to work or ready to train," Frank Doyle, G E 
senior vice president, told the senators. 
</P>
<P>
"Business doesn't usually come to the government asking it to spend more 
money," a Kennedy aide said recently. "They're concerned about not having a 
skilled work force in 10 to 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Businesses now see early education as a worthwhile investment, the aide added, 
because they are spending millions of dollars to retrain people who lack very 
basic literacy. 
</P>
<P>
Butler said that about 25% of American children are not prepared to enter the 
first grade. "They are nowhere near prepared for the learning process," he 
said. While the average is 25%, he said, in some inner-city areas the figure 
may be as high as 70%. So preschool programs -- such as Kennedy's proposed 
Smart Start -- and even prenatal care programs are being encouraged. "Business 
needs to be a vigorous advocate of early intervention," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he noted a steep cost to society. The CED reports that each class 
of dropouts costs America $240 billion in lost tax revenue as well as the costs 
of welfare. Butler said that is a conservative estimate. 
</P>
<P>
By getting involved in the public school system, both in policy and at 
individual schools, businesses hope to improve graduates' basic skills as well 
as lower the dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to make a lot of changes in public school management," Butler said. 
"We need to change the corporate culture of education." 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems, he said, is that most schools are held accountable, in 
terms of funds, only for attendance -- how many seats are occupied. "The 
schools aren't rated on what a child learns," he said, so businesses need to 
participate in policy decisions, from acting as advisers even to encouraging 
their employees to run for school boards. 
</P>
<P>
Companies can help by stimulating and sponsoring pilot projects aimed at 
improving education, Butler said, and education must be deregulated to make 
room for flexibility and participation at the classroom level. 
</P>
<P>
For a more direct approach, corporations can get involved with local schools. 
Through an "Adopt a School" program, business can give employees relief time 
for tutoring and supply books and extra equipment, said Keyes of the NAB. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of Adopt a Schools where we do a lot of tutoring," said Myrna 
Plost, director of public education and volunteer programs at Los Angeles-based 
Atlantic Richfield. "We've also been very active in encouraging education 
reform. We think education is of primary importance." 
</P>
<P>
Arco also awards grants to educational programs, Plost said. For example, she 
said the company donated $300,000 so the movie "Stand and Deliver" could be 
aired on public television. The film, based on a true story, shows how Garfield 
High School math teacher Jaime Escalante turned around a group of poorly 
performing students. 
</P>
<P>
The company also is a sponsor of the Jaime Escalante Mathematics Awards, which 
recognize outstanding math teachers who motivate their students to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
While early intervention and reforms in public education will help produce 
better qualified future employees, lack of basic skills remains a serious 
problem in the work force today. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been very, very difficult for businesses to acknowledge," Keyes said. 
"You don't want to admit you have a work force that's unable to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
For many companies, it has become a situation that can't be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, there were enough (skilled) people coming in the door so 
companies didn't have to worry," Keyes said, but many companies are now working 
with community colleges and adult schools to help people who are unable to fill 
out a job application. 
</P>
<P>
Other businesses, she said, are working with colleges and adult schools to help 
their employees learn basic skills, "to bring them up to speed for that 
company." 
</P>
<P>
With technology being introduced in the workplace, employers are much more 
willing to retrain workers, Keyes said, and many do so on a continual basis. 
</P>
<P>
A two-year study of American productivity, released this month by the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, cites a lack of proper on-the-job 
training as a real flaw in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of what passes for training is just following Jill around on the job," 
said Suzanne Berger, head of MIT's political science department. "Many times, 
formal training programs are extremely narrow and simply gear up people for a 
specific assignment."

COMMUTING BY ELEVATOR

<P>
The investment industry has been very good to Gene Morgan, so good that he 
could afford to live just about anywhere he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
But wasting precious hours on the freeway commuting from his downtown Los 
Angeles brokerage to a home at the beach, in the hills or even in nearby 
Hancock Park is something that this 65-year-old ex-Marine simply could not 
abide. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, his commute is vertical and takes about a minute by elevator, from his 
30th-floor condominium at Bunker Hill Towers to the building's Plaza Level, 
which houses the offices of Gene Morgan Financial. 
</P>
<P>
"It simplifies my life," Morgan said of his decision to live and work in the 
same locale. "I waste absolutely no time on the freeways." Across the country, 
more such "city within a city" projects are going up in urban and suburban 
areas, affording an option for workers who like the idea of a commute on the 
hoof. 
</P>
<P>
Many are in self-contained high-rises where residents can also shop for 
groceries, go to the dentist, get their hair cut and work out on weight 
machines. Others are in sprawling communities, such as Century City, that also 
feature fancy hotels and restaurants, movie houses and other forms of 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
As highways become more clogged and home prices spin further out of reach in 
some metropolitan areas, observers say, such mixed-use projects are bound to 
become more important fixtures on the urban landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"The future for that is very, very bright," said Rocky Tarantello, a real 
estate consultant and a professor of real estate and urban economics at USC. 
</P>
<P>
To date, such developments have tended to work best in condensed or older 
cities such as Chicago, Boston, Minneapolis and San Francisco, which, unlike 
Los Angeles and Houston, are not completely reliant on automobiles to function. 
(Washington, on the other hand, has restrictions on building height that make 
funding such developments less economically rewarding.) 
</P>
<P>
Chicago boasts one of the most successful projects -- Water Tower Place -- with 
the Ritz-Carlton hotel, condominiums, restaurants, theaters, a myriad of 
service establishments and an upscale shopping mall anchored by Marshall 
Field's and Lord &amp; Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Located near Lake Michigan on prestigious North Michigan Avenue, Water Tower 
Place also benefits from traffic at nearby cultural institutions and the 
presence of thousands of residents and workers in nearby high-rise condo, 
apartment and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Los Angeles. With its utter dependence on autos, its lack of a 
downtown residential base, its far-flung suburban and exurban communities and 
the after-hours bleakness of its downtown core, the city has not lent itself to 
much mixed-use development. (The early effort at mixing offices and retail 
space in Arco Plaza, for example, has proven disastrous for the merchants.) 
</P>
<P>
"Not all cities are so hospitable to mixed-use projects," said Norman Elkin, 
vice president of Urban Investment &amp; Development Co., a Chicago development 
subsidiary of JMB Realty. "In Los Angeles, that's a problem. What do you hook 
on to?" 
</P>
<P>
Bunker Hill Towers, with its proximity to the Music Center and the Museum of 
Contemporary Art, is as close as the city now comes, although other projects 
are under way and some others -- such as Broadway Plaza, California Plaza and 
Citicorp Plaza -- almost qualify, but for the lack of residential space. 
</P>
<P>
In Tarantello's view, a number of factors are converging that will make 
development of mixed-use buildings more appropriate for California. In the past 
10 years, the nation's population has increased about 16%. At the same time, by 
his estimate, the number of licensed drivers has risen 60% while the number of 
new roads is up only 5%. Meanwhile, with the surge in population, city 
infrastructures are strained, yet government officials face consumer outcries 
at the mention of tax increases to upgrade facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, the congestion and traffic patterns are as good now as 
they're ever going to be," Tarantello said. "The only viable solution is not 
building more roads but intelligent land-use planning. 
</P>
<P>
"You can no longer zone houses over there, a shopping center on the corner and 
office buildings over here," he added. "We are going to have to start pushing 
things together. The key to success is traffic mitigation -- taking cars off 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
From the worker's viewpoint, living near the office in a mixed-use project 
could prove a mixed blessing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a workaholic, it might not be good at all (because) you'd be more 
inclined to go to work at all times of the day and night," said Dean Schwanke, 
director of real estate development information service at the Urban Land 
Institute, a Washington organization that has studied the mixed-use phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, he added, being close to home would give one the flexibility to 
take frequent breaks. "Obviously," he said, "it would save on auto wear and 
tear." 
</P>
<P>
Surveys by the institute have shown that employees are not inclined to live in 
the same project where they work. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that developers of mixed-use buildings have found it difficult to 
integrate parking for permanent residents and retail customers or office 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of that, future mixed-use projects are expected to consist 
primarily of side-by-side structures -- say, a high-rise office and retail 
building joined by corridors to a high-rise residential building. 
</P>
<P>
"You will see less stacking," said James J. Didion, chairman of Coldwell Banker 
Commercial Group in Los Angeles and a member of the Urban Land Institute's 
mixed-use council. Vertically stacked, mixed-use projects that attempt to do it 
all "are very costly to build and very difficult to integrate."

MORE PEOPLE ARE WORKING AT HOME

<P>
It all started quietly enough in a rambling old house on Harper Street in West 
Hollywood in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Felice and Boyd Willat needed a part-time business that would keep the cash 
rolling in while they were between movie and television production jobs. Felice 
came up with an idea for a "personal organizer," a sort of super-duper 
calender/to-do list. Boyd, whose art directing credits include "Ordinary 
People," designed a distinctive vinyl binder. And thus was born the first Day 
Runner. 
</P>
<P>
Some five years later, the Day Runner was hardly a hobby. Annual revenue was 
$10 million, and there were 65 employees, 34 telephones and six computers 
operating the business. But the Willats were still running their Harper House 
business out of their two-story, 3,000-square-foot house on Harper Street. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty wild," recalled Felice, who has since moved the business into 
corporate quarters in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Although she still cringes at memories of the zoning enforcement official who 
outlawed the late-night deliveries and the safety inspector who found the 
gerry-rigged telephone and electrical wiring, Felice would not trade in her 
days of running an at-home business. 
</P>
<P>
"We liked being at home. Both our children were born at home," she explained. 
"We are home people." 
</P>
<P>
And so are an increasing number of other workers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Home Business Assn., some 27 million Americans now 
work out of their homes on at least a part-time basis. The figure, researchers 
say, includes about 13 million home-based business owners, about 3 million 
employees who are allowed to work from their home instead of the traditional 
office and about 11 million workers who use a home office to supplement their 
at-work activities. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for choosing to work at home vary, but not a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Most at-home entrepreneurs cite the need to keep overhead low and the 
convenience of a nearby office during the early stages of a new business. Other 
important reasons for choosing the home hearth over the corporate office 
include the obvious benefits of avoiding a lengthy and hassling commute and the 
inevitable office distractions, such as ringing phones and coffee klatch 
gossiping. Still others say they want to spend more time with their families. 
</P>
<P>
But the bottom line to all the reasons, explained Jack M. Nilles, a former 
researcher at USC, is that at-home workers want more control over their time. 
</P>
<P>
"These people want to fit their work life into the rest of their life, not the 
other way around," said Nilles, who recently opened a consulting firm that 
helps companies create at-home work opportunities for their employees from his 
own Los Angeles home. "Everyone likes to be in control of their life." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to becoming more popular, working at home has become a whole lot 
easier, thanks to a wide range of technological advances, such as personal 
computers, fax machines, modems, scanners and call-holding telephone features. 
These advances not only give the home office many of the conveniences of the 
corporate environment, but they allow the at-home worker to remain in easy 
communication with the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Still, despite its obvious benefits and growing ease, working at home is not 
for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Many workers need and want the hubbub of the office and the face-to-face 
exchange of high-minded ideas and down-and-dirty gossip. Others need the 
discipline of regular hours and direct supervision from a boss. Still others 
need a regular change of environment. 
</P>
<P>
Who has the temperament to work at home? 
</P>
<P>
Paul Edwards, a Santa Monica writer and co-author of "Working at Home," called 
the ideal at-home worker a "self-managed person." 
</P>
<P>
"These are people who take initiative, people who are extroverted," he 
explains. "These are people who use home as a base, rather than a resting 
place. These are people who don't -- and won't -- feel isolated. These are 
people who want to be in charge of their own destiny and have the capacity to 
do just that." 
</P>
<P>
Least likely candidates for at-home work assignments are people who need 
regular social interaction with their colleagues and hands-on supervision and 
approval from their bosses. This type of person includes the insecure and the 
immature, as well as someone relatively new to a particular assignment who 
needs on-site direction to understand his duties. 
</P>
<P>
It also includes the person who expects to climb the corporate ladder, since 
"out of sight, out of mind" often applies when promotions are being 
contemplated. Furthermore, experts say single people who live alone do not like 
to work at home because, more so than married people, they get a great deal of 
social contact from the office. 
</P>
<P>
However glorious and liberating it sounds, working at home comes with some 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
At-home workers, particularly home-based entrepreneurs, must be able to set a 
daily agenda for themselves -- and stick to it. No hanging around the 
television or refrigerator. No long breaks in the garden, or at the kitchen 
stove. There has to be a routine. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't stick to my routine, then I'm always rushing around and I never get 
any real time off from the job," observed Trish Hawthorne, a private college 
admissions counselor who has been working out of her Berkeley home for the past 
three years. "That's a sure way for the job not to be fun anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Although goofing off is an obvious pitfall, so is becoming a workaholic. With a 
desk full of chores awaiting completion just a few steps away from the rest of 
life, many at-home workers become consumed by the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I could work a lot more," said Jeff Thompson, a Riverside general contractor. 
"The real problem is knowing that work is just one step away from the family 
room television. But finally I've had to cut my work day off at a certain time 
and be done with it." 
</P>
<P>
At-home workers must also be willing, and able, to handle the inevitable 
feelings of isolation that a remote office inevitably generates. Many offset 
the disconnected state with regular outings or telephone calls just to stay in 
touch with the outside world. Others bring employees into their home to enliven 
the working scene. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Bernstein, who has operated a full-service public relations firm from her 
Los Angeles home for more than a decade, recalled that it only took her a month 
to realize that she needed a co-worker in the house to keep her happy and 
motivated. In the years since, the staff has grown to six and has gradually 
taken over the wing of the house that was once home to Bernstein's three sons, 
who are now grown. 
</P>
<P>
"I always say I never lost a son, I just gained another office," Bernstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Full-time at-home work may be fine for the entrepreneur who has more control 
over his business opportunities. But most experts recommend that corporate 
employees spend no more than four days a week at home. "Otherwise you lose 
touch," said Gil Gordon, a telecommuting consultant from Monmouth Junction, 
N.J. "You need to get into the office and press the flesh, and let others see 
that you still exist." 
</P>
<P>
Added Nilles: "There's a real danger in becoming a tele-hermit."

<TEXT>
<P>
* Find a separate room for the office. 
</P>
<P>
* Set definite work hours. 
</P>
<P>
* Arrange for child care for children under 5. 
</P>
<P>
* Get "dressed" for work. A bathrobe over your PJs doesn't count! 
</P>
<P>
* Have a separate business telephone and use either an answering machine or 
answering service for after-hours calls. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep your contacts with colleagues and co-workers alive and current. 
</P>
<P>
* Get out of the house at least once a day. 
</P>
<P>
* Treat household interruptions as though you were at the office. In other 
words, they do not exist. 
</P>
<P>
* Learn how to tell your family -- firmly but nicely -- that you are working 
and do not want to be interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
* Make sure you have a door on your office space and be sure to close it when 
you have finished working.

WILL NEW-FANGLED CABLE SERVICE SAVE ART FILMS FROM OBLIVION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
South of Los Angeles, the list of theaters offering high-brow, low-budget 
movies outside the mainstream is short and growing shorter. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Port in Corona del Mar, the Balboa Cinema in Newport Beach and 
the Bay in Seal Beach, there are few venues for such movies, the Art Theatre in 
Long Beach being the latest to give up the ghost. 
</P>
<P>
True, in recent years the Edwards Town Center in Costa Mesa has been devoting 
at least one of its screens to more venturesome fare, like "Pelle the 
Conqueror" and the appearance earlier this month of the gritty British comedy 
"High Hopes" at the AMC MainPlace in Santa Ana was another hopeful sign. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that intellectually challenging films like "La Lectrice," now 
playing at the Balboa, are sometimes gone before there's time to get to the 
theater. Then -- because of disappointing box office -- they may not make it to 
local video stores for years, if at all. If they are up to the standards of 
"Babette's Feast," "Au Revoir les Enfants," "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" 
or "Manon of the Spring," rental outlets may stock one or two copies. 
</P>
<P>
The Z Channel seemed to be the last best hope for such films. But now, sadly, 
that outlet plans to show nothing but sports starting June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Could Cable Video Store, the new, pioneering "pay-per-view" system unveiled 
earlier this week by Comcast Cablevision of Orange County, be the salvation of 
the "little" movies that rarely make it to the mall or the chain video store? 
</P>
<P>
With the new system, now being installed in Newport Beach, subscribers can 
purchase a single movie simply by hitting two buttons on their remote control. 
The cost ranges from $1.99 to $3.99. A good sign, albeit a small one, is that 
the charmingly offbeat "Some Girls" is among the Cable Video Store's May 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
For the present, pay-per-view operations like the Cable Video Store are aiming 
for the same blockbusters as the video stores and movie channels like HBO. With 
a relatively small national subscriber base of between 750,000 and 1 million, 
they have little choice. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, said Ken Nimmer, Cable Video Store's vice president for 
programming, as the subscriber base expands and competition for the "big" 
movies intensifies, programming smaller movies may become economically 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Across this country -- if not across this county -- there are surely enough 
movie-goers who survived campus Bergman, Bunuel and Godard festivals to support 
the works of John Sayles and Spike Lee. Especially if all they need to do is 
press a button and pay $3.99.

RANDY LEWIS: GRASS-ROOTS HERITAGE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS HAS MORE IN THE WAY OF DOWN-HOME CULTURE BUT ORANGE COUNTY IS 
CATCHING UP. IN A COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In many ways, Orange County couldn't be farther removed from New Orleans if it 
was on Pluto. For instance, in New Orleans there are dozens of great blues, 
jazz, rock and R&amp;B clubs within walking distance or a short ride from one 
another. It quickly becomes apparent that no place worth going is more than a 
$3 cab fare away. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the bonanza of acts that trekked to the Crescent City specifically 
for last week's 20th annual Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival (another thing Orange 
County doesn't have), New Orleans sees more great pop music in an average 
weekend than we get in a year. 
</P>
<P>
But that's to be expected: New Orleans, the Fertile Crescent of American music, 
has a couple of centuries' jump on us as a hotbed of activity, culturally 
speaking. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you can't help but be overwhelmed at the bounty. In a single night -- 
and a Sunday at that -- I was able to see R&amp;B great Irma Thomas in one 
club, zip across town to see Charmaine Neville at Muddy Water's, walk down the 
street to Jimmy's and catch Cyril Neville &amp; the Uptown All-Stars 
alternating with brother Art Neville and his band. From there, we hopped back 
to the 711 Club in the French Quarter to find old-time jazz crooner Al 
Broussard at the piano, jauntily spinning out requests as daylight crept up 
Bourbon Street. 
</P>
<P>
Back here, the only thing you're likely to find hopping all night long on a 
Sunday is the popcorn machine at 7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
Still, what struck me this year when I went to New Orleans for the fest weren't 
the glaringly apparent differences. For the first time, I started noticing some 
similarities. 
</P>
<P>
And not just the easy ones, like the omnipresence of corporate America a la 
Wendy's, Burger King and Thom McAn. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more pleasing parallels: I realized that the tough choices I faced 
there ("Hmm, do I go see Dr. John or Ironin' Board Sam; John Hiatt or Katie 
Webster; Richard Thompson or Queen Ida?") wouldn't necessarily end once I got 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
That's a "problem" that didn't exist even 5 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The planning calendar I carry has room for a dozen entries under each day, and 
periodically I find myself running out of room. Just this weekend I can point 
to no fewer than 36 events taking place right here in Orange County, and that 
doesn't include a plethora of ongoing art exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
The variety extends from some of the same musical folk I just saw in New 
Orleans -- the Robert Cray Band at the Pacific Jazz Festival today at the 
Pacific Amphitheatre -- to poetry readings, a performance of Benjamin Britten's 
epic "War Requiem" at the Performing Arts Center and a performance-art 
presentation at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, that doesn't make us New Orleans. But at least we're heading in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
At least one big difference remains, though. 
</P>
<P>
Notice how upwardly mobile the vast majority of our cultural choices are? One 
of the greatest things about New Orleans is that, as the birthplace of jazz and 
all, it treats folk culture with the same respect as any of the so-called "high 
arts." (Perhaps even more, if the financial difficulties plaguing the New 
Orleans Symphony in recent years are any indication.) 
</P>
<P>
That distinction hit home during a rare lull that occurred only because a 
tornado knocked out one day of festival activities. That day, I hopped the 
Canal Street ferry -- which must be the last free ride of its kind -- over to 
Algiers on the opposite shore of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its being a stone's throw (well, for Dave Winfield maybe) from the 
hustle-bustle tourist haven of the New Orleans French Quarter and its nonstop 
night life, potpourri of restaurants, tacky souvenir stands and peep shows, 
Algiers is a world away. 
</P>
<P>
In that respect, Algiers reminded me of Santa Ana, which also borders an area 
(Costa Mesa) where cultural opportunities abound. Furthermore, both Algiers and 
Santa Ana are cities with pockets of great beauty and some magnificent old 
homes located just blocks from neighborhoods that are decaying. 
</P>
<P>
Searching for a homey neighborhood joint where I might find a decent plate of 
red beans and rice, I found instead countless "For Sale" or "For Rent" signs. 
Suffering a dearth of eateries or thriving businesses, Algiers is home -- not 
coincidentally -- to an equally large number of street-side liquor stores and 
neighborhood churches, each offering its own brand of escape, comfort and 
relief from the squalor. 
</P>
<P>
On the half-hour, electronic bells of the Trinity Lutheran Church echoed Bach's 
"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" through deserted streets, sounding like the Good 
Humor Truck of Salvation. 
</P>
<P>
It was precisely this sort of abject poverty that gave rise to some of the 
greatest music we have: blues, jazz and gospel. And here, we well might find 
parallels in the mariachi and conjunto music of Santa Ana's Latino community, 
the bar-band blues of the struggling factory worker in Anaheim, the Southeast 
Asian folk music of thousands of Vietnamese immigrants in Garden Grove and 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps instead of working so hard to zone these sorts of neighborhoods out of 
existence, we ought to look to them for the non-materialistic riches they can 
offer. The presence of a "Salsa '89" festival today at the Orange County 
Fairgrounds is a perfect example because it places Mexican music, dance, food 
and other components of this community's cultural soul in a well-deserved 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see more of that red carpet, so often reserved for 19th-Century classical 
European arts, extended to the grass-roots cultures of our own back yard, like 
they do way down yonder in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
How about a good, earthy all-night blues bar for starters?

The final vote is expected Monday on a Newport Beach ordinance that will move 
the curfew on city beaches an hour earlier to 11 p.m. The move is to help 
reduce noise and traffic that oceanfront residents blame on late-night 
beach-goers. All 6 miles of city-owned beach now close at midnight.

'I THINK THAT IT'S BECOME THE COOL THING.' PAT WILL, CO-CHAIRMAN GRAD NIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
PARENTS BUILD SAFETY INTO GRAD NIGHT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to prevent alcohol and drug use on graduation night, Huntington 
Beach High School parents on Saturday put away their business suits, donned 
their blue jeans and took up a fistful of penny nails they will use to build a 
place for the graduates to party safely. 
</P>
<P>
The parents, many of whom are upscale professionals, have come together each 
Saturday since last September to remodel the high school's gymnasium to fit the 
senior's choice of theme for the traditional Grad Night celebration, "Jungle 
Safari." 
</P>
<P>
The set is being built in an unused building on another part of the campus and 
will be moved into the gymnasium just before the June 15 event. 
</P>
<P>
And, like many other high school grad night parties, this one will also run 
until the wee hours of the dawn. However, unlike other similar celebrations, 
this one is designed to be alcohol- and drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing this for several reasons. First, we love our kids. We want them 
to have a memorable evening following their graduations, but we want to make 
sure that they do not put themselves or the community at risk by the use of 
alcohol or drugs," said Pat Will, 51, co-chairman of the 1989 Grad Night 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last to Adopt Idea 
</P>
<P>
Will said Huntington High is the last high school in the district to adopt a 
plan for providing an all-night safe and sober party for the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen it work elsewhere and were encouraged by many of the seniors to put 
something together for them. So here we are," Will said, adding that parent 
volunteerism for the project has been "infectious." 
</P>
<P>
The party will be open only to graduating members of the class. The $50 ticket 
price includes all the food and non-alcoholic drinks that the graduates can 
consume. The gym will also have a dance floor and casino area. During the 
event, a drawing for a trip for two to Hawaii will also be held. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside the converted gymnasium, the students will stay until the event 
breaks up early the the next day. Will explained that by not allowing the 
students to go in and out of the building, the chance of them getting access to 
alcohol is minimized. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents have been great. We've even had one parent donate some time from 
his architectural firm to provide us with blueprints of the sets," Will said. 
"(And) I think that kids are really getting behind this. I think that it's 
become the cool thing." 
</P>
<P>
The professions represented by the parents include airline pilots, doctors, 
lawyers, teachers and real estate investors. They are bound, according to Will, 
by the concern that graduation night activities have led to growing numbers of 
alcohol-related deaths and injuries on Orange County roads and highways. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it's wonderful that these folks have come out to help like this. 
And they've been here since the start," Will said of the 75-parent committee. 
"I think that besides the friendships that have been created, it gives many of 
the parents an artistic outlet that they don't often get a chance to explore." 
</P>
<P>
For the parents, the energy directed toward producing the extravaganza has 
often been enjoyable, if not slightly tiresome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Paint by the Numbers' 
</P>
<P>
"I paint by the numbers -- literally," said Huntington Beach English teacher 
Jan Osborn, 37. "I paint, I glue, I eat lunch," Osborn quipped as another panel 
was being painted and readied for the event. 
</P>
<P>
"I teach in this district, and I know that there is abuse of drugs and alcohol. 
I am so glad to see that we are taking this problem seriously and are doing 
something about it," Osborn said. 
</P>
<P>
For parent Randy Barsh, 46, the grad night party means that students will have 
a place to go after graduation that is both "cool" as well as safe. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one great bunch of guys and gals. So far, they won't let me near a 
hammer, but I'm good with the glue gun," Barsh said.

EL ADOBE RESTAURANT PICKETED BY WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Employees picketed the historic El Adobe restaurant in San Juan Capistrano on 
Saturday in a labor dispute with owner Richard O'Neill, former state chairman 
of the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic landmark, and it seems their wage scales are as antiquated 
as the building," said Steve Beyer, spokesman for Hotel and Restaurant 
Employees Union Local 681, which represents the picketing workers. 
</P>
<P>
The 79 El Adobe employees have worked without a contract since March 10 and 
continue to negotiate for a new pact, Beyer said. Although the union members 
have voted to authorize a strike, Beyer said the union does not plan one. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't afford to strike," Beyer said. "The wages they make do not allow 
them to put any money away." 
</P>
<P>
But restaurant workers, ranging from busboys to bartenders, were urging 
customers not to eat there Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, a rancher and restaurant owner who is no longer in political office, 
said the picketing "is bound to hurt the restaurant, but they'd have to do that 
every day to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough to Compete 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said that the restaurant has had union employees for at least 30 years 
but that numerous non-union restaurants springing up in southern Orange County 
make it tough to compete for business. 
</P>
<P>
El Adobe manager Elias Meza said: "There are a lot of new restaurants. There 
are going to be more . . . coming in, and to my knowledge none of them are 
going to be union." 
</P>
<P>
Beyer claimed O'Neill "told his lawyer to get rid of the union. You would 
expect a former state Democratic Party chairman to have sympathy for working 
people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Neill said: "We're not trying to throw anybody out. It's a continuous 
negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
Meza also denied the union's allegation that the restaurant's negotiator has 
threatened to eliminate health and pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"It should not have gone this far," Meza said of the picketing. "We've given in 
to a lot of their (union) demands. . . . We're not trying to be a union buster. 
No, we're not trying to take their medical benefits away. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're trying to do is stay open," Meza said. "Our lawyers are continuing 
to meet and continuing to negotiate. We're not at a dead end here." 
</P>
<P>
Many employees, including some with 19 years' experience, earn minimum wages, 
Beyer said. The union is seeking raises of up to $2 an hour for the workers, 
some of whom are paid $6 an hour now, he said.

Q &amp; A WITH JIM FREGOSI; 
</P>
<P>
ANGEL HALL OF FAME MEMBER RECALLS GOOD TIMES, AND THE NOT-SO-GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angel Hall of Fame doubled its roll call last week when former shortstop 
and manager Jim Fregosi became only the second player to join its ranks. It was 
an appropriate, if not overdue choice, considering that Fregosi was a player 
during the team's infancy and a manager during one of its finest moments, a 
division title in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Fregosi was drafted by the Angels in 1960 and soon established himself as the 
club's leader and one of its most consistent performers. In his 11 seasons with 
the Angels, Fregosi was selected to six All-Star teams and earned one Gold 
Glove. Even now, he holds Angel records in at-bats, hits and triples. You can 
find him in second place in games played, runs, doubles, extra-base hits and 
total bases. In short, a record to be admired. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Angel owner Gene Autry offered Fregosi the chance of a lifetime: Come 
back to California and manage the team he once played for. Fregosi couldn't 
refuse. 
</P>
<P>
The results were mixed. Fregosi led the Angels to their first division title in 
1979, but two seasons later, he was presented with a pink slip. Injuries and a 
slow start contributed to his dismissal, as did his inability to communicate 
with players and media alike. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Fregosi has spent four seasons managing the highly successful 
Louisville minor league team, where he finished first twice, and then was 
chosen to manage a not-so-successful Chicago White Sox, who finished fifth each 
of the three seasons Fregosi was there. He was fired after the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
Fregosi persists. He has applied for the Toronto Blue Jay managing vacancy and 
says the years have taught him much. After his recent induction ceremony at 
Anaheim Stadium, Fregosi, accompanied by his wife, Joni, and 4-month-old 
daughter, Nicole, talked about the Angel and post-Angel experience. 
</P>
<P>
The interview: 
</P>
<P>
Question: Can you describe what it's like to return to Anaheim Stadium and have 
a night to call your very own? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It's just so much fun for me to come back here and, you know, sit and 
talk to Gene (Autry) about baseball. I have so many friends here because I 
lived here so long. My wife never knew me as a ballplayer and she didn't know I 
excelled in athletics or anything like that, so it's kind of a kick for her. 
Actually, I told her before we sat down for the induction ceremony Wednesday 
night, "They only want you to talk for five minutes at the ceremony." She's 
from Kentucky, so she says, "Y'all know I'm not gonna talk." 
</P>
<P>
But this is a good feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Nice to feel appreciated, is it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Appreciation is in your own mind. I've had such great relationships in this 
organization, with the fans here in Anaheim, with the media here. They knew I 
was a good player. And I say I was a good player, because I was not a great 
player. But I took a great deal of pride playing hard and playing tough. Those 
things mean a lot to me. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What were the circumstances of you becoming an Angel? 
</P>
<P>
A: I had signed originally with the Boston Red Sox. I played a year of D-ball. 
They don't even have D-ball anymore. You see, they have different 
classifications: they had D, C, B, A, AA, AAA. D-ball at that time was really 
the lowest classification you could play. I was drafted in the expansion draft 
by the Angels from the Red Sox. So, as a young kid, I had a chance to go to a 
big-league camp, which was the first camp they ever had in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Remember much about that camp? 
</P>
<P>
A: I remember everything about it. I was around a lot of veteran players. To 
me, they were all-stars: Eddie Yost, Rocky Bridges, Del Rice, Bob Cerv, Ted 
Kluszewski and all those type of guys. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did you feel as if you had caught the break of the century? 
</P>
<P>
A: I really did. I was with the Boston organization. I probably would not have 
had an opportunity to get to the major leagues as quickly as I did with the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Q: At the risk of asking too many "Do you remember?" questions, do you recall 
the first time you met Gene Autry? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yeah, we were riding a bicycle down the main street of Palm Springs. Gene 
was leading the whole way. We used to ride bikes from the hotel to the 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
Q: And Autry led the team on this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Oh, yeah. It was such a fun thing. Here's an expansion ballclub that Gene 
got into very late. In fact, though I might be mistaken, I think he went to the 
owners' meeting that one year just to get the radio rights for KMPC and ended 
up owning the ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Autry has often said that he regards you as a son. Did you realize you had 
such a special place in his heart? 
</P>
<P>
A: Oh, yeah. We've been friends. It wasn't an owner-player relationship. We 
were good friends. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You've said that when you played for Autry he was one of the few owners who 
took a real interest in the person in the uniform. What was he like to manage 
for? 
</P>
<P>
A: He never interfered. He never bothered. When you won a ballgame, he would 
call you on the phone and say, "Tell the boys: Nice going." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Looking back on that first managing job with the Angels, what do you think 
about most? 
</P>
<P>
A: It really started something in Anaheim. I mean, '78 and '79 was the first 
time we went over two million people in attendance; the excitement in the whole 
area when we won in '79; it started all this. That's how I feel about it. And 
it put baseball in Orange County on the map. I really believe that someday that 
the California Angels will draw three million fans. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The area certainly has the population base for it. 
</P>
<P>
A: Consistency. If you talk about the California Angels winning division titles 
back-to-back or getting in a World Series, then there's no reason why they 
can't draw three million people here. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What were your strengths and weaknesses when you managed the Angels? 
</P>
<P>
A: First of all, I had a very difficult time with the media. Most of the 
writers that were here knew me when I was a player as opposed to a manager. As 
a player, you speak for yourself. As a manager, you speak for the entire 
organization. I thought the one thing I did well is that I brought pride into 
the organization. I was proud I played as many years as I did. And I was proud 
of the fact that I had Angels written across the front of my uniform. Coming 
back to manage -- I was on a flight from Pittsburgh -- I had a ton of notes 
written up. But when I got here, I threw them all away. I said, "Hey, this is 
not me." And all I did was preach to them to have pride in the uniform and that 
this was the greatest place to play, so why not be proud of the fact that 
you're a member of the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There's a story about you during your days with the Texas Rangers. 
Apparently, you booted a ground ball late in a game and it cost the Rangers a 
victory. So the next morning, the newspaper story said something to the effect, 
"Because Jim Fregosi couldn't field a routine ground ball, the Rangers lost 
another one." 
</P>
<P>
That day you called the reporter into the dugout. You told him to sit down. You 
told him you had just one thing to tell him. He said, "What's that?" And you 
said, "I just want you to know that NO ground ball hit to me is ever routine." 
And then you laughed. 
</P>
<P>
True story? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yeah (laughing). 
</P>
<P>
Q: Also, were you aware that sportswriters around the country referred to your 
post-game scowl as "The Stare?" 
</P>
<P>
A: You know what, I was never really aware of that until . . . (turning to his 
wife) Joni, do I stare? 
</P>
<P>
Joni: Yep, but not negatively. But you're not doing it to be mean. 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, I guess everybody has their own quirks. But when I first managed, it 
was a very difficult thing. I mean, the transition from a player to a manager. 
If you talked to writers about me as a player and then you talked to them about 
when I first managed for the Angels, as opposed to when I managed for the 
Chicago White Sox, I think you'll find a whole other story. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The word was that you were a great guy as a player and not so great as a 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
A: But that was here, though. I matured. If a writer asked me a question as a 
player, I had no qualms about answering. But the toughest thing as a manager 
when they started asking me questions, was that I had to think about how to 
protect my player, how to protect my organization. But that was part of 
maturing and growing up and learning how to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did you make it look easier than it was winning that division title here in 
1979? 
</P>
<P>
A: Oh, it wasn't easy. Like I say, the toughest thing to do is win the first 
time. You're beating all the odds. You're talking about an organization that 
had existed for 17, 18 years and had never won. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There's a group of baseball people who contend that some of those minor 
league teams you managed in Louisville were better than the White Sox teams you 
managed. Any truth to that? 
</P>
<P>
A: I had a lot of great players in Louisville. I had a lot of great players. 
But I loved (Chicago). It was a great city. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did you handle situations better in Chicago than you did with the Angels? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think I learned a lot through my first experience. And every time you 
manage, you hope you learn a lot more. I was a much, much better manager 
winning 71 games last year than I was when we won a division here in '79. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In what ways? 
</P>
<P>
A: In every way. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Would it have been better if the first managing job had been someplace other 
than here? 
</P>
<P>
A: Probably. But then they may not have won in '79, so they'd never have that 
first one. But I think the four years of experience I had at the minor league 
level really taught me a lot about managing. I think that anybody who wants to 
make a career in managing should manage in the minor leagues first. It's a very 
difficult thing to start managing in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is it about managing that keeps people coming back? 
</P>
<P>
A: The thrill of victory. Players who have played and been successful know what 
it feels like to succeed. There's nothing greater than to be a player, that you 
did the job, won the game, got a hit, whatever. But when you can't play 
anymore, the only thing that you've got is that you reap all the benefits from 
the players on your team. You steal a little bit from that one, and a little 
bit from that one. But you always take the losses 15 times harder as a manager 
than as a player. 
</P>
<P>
Q: That's why Gene Mauch quit; he said it was too hard to take the losses. 
</P>
<P>
A: It's tough to handle a loss. You are responsible. You accept all those 
responsibilities when you take the job. How about working on a rundown play for 
72 hours in spring training, then on opening day of the season, (somebody) 
screws it up? 
</P>
<P>
How about working on covering first base and then on the third game of the 
season, you lose the game because the pitcher doesn't cover first base? But you 
know in your heart that you've worked on all those things. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How interested were you in the Angel managing job after Cookie Rojas was 
fired late last season? 
</P>
<P>
A: I called (Angel vice president) Mike Port and told him I was interested in 
the job. And that was it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Never got to a formal interview? 
</P>
<P>
A: Uh, uh. They had something in mind in the way they wanted to go, the 
direction they wanted to go with. It's not a personal thing, which is all part 
of growing up and maturing in this game. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Another recollections question: Tell us about the trade that essentially 
sent you to the New York Mets for a young pitcher named Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
A: Here's a guy who has probably had the most fantastic career. There's really 
no pitcher who has had the career that Nolan Ryan has. A lot of people say he's 
only a .500 pitcher. But he's going to win 300 games, strike out more people 
than anybody in history -- he's already done that -- and he's going to go into 
the Hall of Fame. And I can tell my grandkids that I was traded for him. That's 
pretty nice right there. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You're enjoying the good life in Sarasota, Fla. You fish, you golf, you 
play, in your own words, "Mr. Mom." But do you ever get the urge to manage? 
</P>
<P>
A: Oh, yeah, I want to get back in it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did you think when you won that first division title that you might be on to 
something? That it might be the beginning of something? 
</P>
<P>
A: I thought I was going to be here forever.

AUGUST GETS VICTORY AND A REPRIEVE; 
</P>
<P>
MILWAUKEE PITCHER STRENGTHENS HIS SPOT IN THE ROTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a perfectly good reason why the Milwaukee Brewers haven't announced 
their starting rotation for the team's next series: they don't have one, at 
least, not the kind written in stone. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they have a collection of question marks and dilemmas, including the 
one involving the fall from grace of Don August, the Mission Viejo resident who 
made a name for himself by virtue of a 13-7 rookie season in 1988. August, a 
member of the 1984 Olympic team, was summoned from the minors last June and 
hasn't looked back . . . until now. 
</P>
<P>
With success came expectations -- and August had plenty of them, the least of 
which included a slow, almost glacial-speed start in 1989. Given the opening 
day honors, August lost, 2-1, to the Cleveland Indians, but only gave up one 
earned run in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, August has struggled and the Brewers have struggled with him. He 
entered Saturday evening's game against the Angels with a 2-5 record and a 
bloated 4.88 earned-run average. Word was that Saturday's performance would 
help shape the look of the Brewer rotation for days to come. In essence: if 
August pitched well, he'd remain a member of the five starters; if not . . . 
welcome to the bullpen, Don. 
</P>
<P>
He stays. 
</P>
<P>
August pitched augustly. He allowed eight hits, but only in the first and 
seventh inning did they come in bunches. Devon White cranked one of the balls 
into the upper reaches of the right field seats early on, followed later by 
Lance Parrish's homer to left. The White homer was disturbing -- the ball just 
sat there in the strike zone -- but it was the pitch to Parrish that almost 
ruined the night for August. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead by a run at the time, August only had to get through the seventh and help 
would be on the way, mainly in the form of standout reliever Dan Plesac. But on 
the first pitch, Parrish reached out and lofted the ball deep to left. The ball 
clanged against the seats seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
August turned to watch a one-run lead become a tie game. He kicked at the dirt 
on the pitcher's mound and then waited abjectly as home plate umpire Al Clark 
tossed him another ball. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Howell flied to left for the first out, but then light-hitting Kent 
Anderson singled, as did Claudell Washington. All of the sudden, a game, to say 
nothing of a place in the rotation, was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Help arrived. Johnny Ray grounded into a double play, ending the inning and, 
for the moment, ending August's worries. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers went on to score four runs in the eighth, enough of a cushion to 
stave off a mild rally by the Angels in the bottom half of the inning. Plesac 
eventually arrived, dashing Angel hopes with his eighth save. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been struggling also," Plesac said. "But he threw much better tonight. 
Sure, in the back of your mind you're trying to pick Augie up." 
</P>
<P>
Said August: "We won, that's the main thing." 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone noticed the difference in August's performance, including the 
man who matters most, Manager Tom Trebelhorn. For a nice change, Trebelhorn 
said, August challenged hitters rather than the other way around. It showed, as 
he gave up only one walk. As for the eight hits, five of them were singles. 
</P>
<P>
"He's pitched about three times good, about three times fair and about three 
times poor," Trebelhorn said. "But tonight he went out and did a good job. And 
he didn't walk anybody ahead of those guys (who hit homers). Solo home runs 
will rarely beat a starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to see him throw the way he's capable of throwing." 
</P>
<P>
So August may be safe after all after gaining the victory. He lasted those 
seven innings. He allowed only those two runs. And he provided the Brewers with 
a rare road win. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this will give us something to build on," Plesac said. 
</P>
<P>
For the Brewers and August.

AZTECS CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEWS: ESPERANZA COMES AWAY WITH 3-A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
The Southern Section track and field championships were long over, and the 
crowd of 4,000 had deserted the Cerritos College stadium when it dawned on Al 
Britt. The Esperanza High School boys' track team had won the 3-A title. 
</P>
<P>
It was such an unlikely prospect that there was not a single Aztec athlete left 
in the stadium to accept the championship plaque. Britt, Esperanza coach, sent 
an assistant coach to race after triple jumper Clayton Tharrington, who had won 
with a leap of 46 feet 8 1/2 inches and was headed out to the parking lot, to 
collect the plaque. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza has a long history of Southern Section championships in football and 
baseball, but this was the school's first track title. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 13 athletes Esperanza had entered in the finals Saturday, six were 
sophomores and one was a freshman. This, too, helped make it unlikely that 
Esperanza could actually win the team championship. 
</P>
<P>
But Esperanza's kiddie corps came through. The Aztecs scored 52 points in seven 
events and won the title going away, thanks to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tharrington's victory in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A victory in the shotput by Chuck Underwood, a senior who qualified for 
Friday's Masters meet with a 56-9 1/4 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A victory in the 400 meters by sophomore Roshawn Sims in 49.62 seconds. 
Sims also was fourth in the 200 in 22.13. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A third-place finish in the pole vault by sophomore Trevor Lycett (13-6). 
</P>
<P>
 -- A second-place finish in the 4 x 1,600 relay (3:22.68) and a fourth-place 
finish in the 4 x 100 relay (43.56). 
</P>
<P>
Britt was at once delighted and stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"All the kids had gone home," he said. "A lot of our points came after the meet 
was over. The field events ran so late. No one knew." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would have to call his athletes to let them in on the good news 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have to let them know we won. They'll read it in the paper and say, 
'Really?' " 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, San Clemente sophomore Tim Martin hunkered down in the 
starting blocks surrounded by sprinters of some renown for the 4-A 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
The field included Curtis Conway of Hawthorne, who will play quarterback at USC 
next fall; Andre Green of Long Beach Poly, an up-and-coming junior; junior 
Chris Alexander of Hawthorne, and Erik Allen, a sophomore at Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was even with the Hawthorne trio and Green as the five seemed to match 
strides for the first 40 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Conway pulled away for the victory in a wind-aided 10.44. Green was second in 
10.61, followed by Alexander in 10.62. 
</P>
<P>
Martin ran 10.68 for fourth, just ahead of Allen's 10.71. 
</P>
<P>
Martin qualified for the Masters meet where he will face the same four runners 
plus four others, all trying to advance to the state meet. He also will be an 
alternate in the 200. He was fifth in the 200 in 21.96. Conway ran 21.25 for an 
impressive double victory. 
</P>
<P>
Things were not so clear-cut in the 3-A 3,200. Through the mile mark, any one 
of the nine runners seemed to be poised to take the lead. A different runner 
had led each lap. But Jimmy Rodriguez of Santa Ana Valley was unwilling to 
share the lead with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
He bolted from the pack and buried a classy field in 9:12.28. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Nielsen of Mater Dei waged a spirited duel with Angel Martinez of San 
Gabriel for second. Martinez passed Nielsen going down the backstretch on the 
final lap. Nielsen waited going around the curve, then blew past him for second 
in a personal-best 9:15.62. Martinez was third in 9:17.16. Nielsen also 
finished third in the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, Nielsen and Martinez qualified for the Masters meet. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Other county qualifiers for the Masters meet included: Eric Whitcomb of 
Valencia, second in the 2-A pole vault (14-6), and Brian Ziller of Trabuco 
Hills, Sean Rogan of Irvine, Josh Herndon of University and Brad Williams of 
Servite in the pole vault. . . . Louie Muniz of Woodbridge qualified in the 300 
intermediate hurdles (38.88). . . . Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia was second 
in the 2-A long jump and triple jump to Russell White of Crespi and will 
advance. . . . Doug Nichols of Edison was second in the 4-A 800 in 1:52.15, a 
personal best. Mike Terry, a freshman from El Modena, won the 3-A 800 in 
1:55.17 but did not advance. . . . Joe White of Capistrano Valley was second in 
the 4-A 400 in 48.89. . . . Andy Marrone of Dana Hills was the final qualifier 
in the discus with a throw of 163-11. . . . Eddie Lavelle and Greg Shryock of 
Corona del Mar and Mike Nielsen of Mater Dei advanced in the 1,600 meters.

WOODBRIDGE PULLS TOGETHER TO WIN 2-A CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nine hours of leaping, running, sprinting and throwing, the Woodbridge 
High School girls' track and field team left the Southern Section championships 
Saturday evening without a single individual victory or record-breaking 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
A sad day for Warrior fans? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Woodbridge left the meet smiling -- with the 2-A division title trophy 
hoisted high above their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Relying on great depth, Woodbridge won its second consecutive girls' 2-A title, 
scoring 61 points in front of 4,000 at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, who have finished in the top three for the past five years, were 
followed by St. Bernard with 51 points. Lompoc and Walnut tied for third at 44. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Woodbridge, Orange County was well-represented by several 
individuals, including Canyon's Allison Franke, who won the long jump and her 
second consecutive title in the triple jump, and Edison freshman Shelley 
Taylor, winner of the 4-A 800- and 1,600-meter runs. 
</P>
<P>
But Woodbridge's victory was a team project all the way. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see we didn't win anything as far as the events go," Woodbridge Coach 
George Varvas said. "We got second five times, but we don't have the studs like 
some teams. Our kids knew they had to perform under pressure today, and that's 
what they did." 
</P>
<P>
Kaci Keffer was the only Woodbridge athlete to qualify for Friday's Masters 
meet, also at Cerritos. Keffer finished second in the 3-A 300-meter hurdles in 
44.89 seconds, the ninth-fastest time of nine qualifiers. Keffer also placed 
second in the 400 meters, and helped Woodbridge to a third-place finish in the 
1,600 relay. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge gained a big boost in the distance events with Cathi Peck (second in 
the 1,600, fourth in the 3,200), sister Laura Peck (third in the 1,600) and Amy 
Robles (second in 800, fifth in 1,600) contributing heavily. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's Taylor, in just her first year of track, provided two of the meet's 
greatest surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's time in the 1,600 -- 5:05.10, the fastest county time this season -- 
ranks second on the all-time county freshman list. The leader? Three-time 
Olympian Mary Decker, who ran 4:40.4 as a freshman while at Orange High in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor was equally impressive in the 800, not so much for the time 
(2:15.33, a personal record by 4 seconds), but how she managed to scramble from 
near last to victory in the final 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor did so gradually at first, passing several fast-fading runners at the 
600-meter mark. With about 100 meters to go, Taylor was in fifth place. But 
with a kick that highlighted her near-perfect mechanics, she caught and passed 
all four runners, including Capistrano Valley's Laurinda Mulhaupt, who finished 
fourth, for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised, I didn't think I had it in me," Taylor said. "After the 
first lap, I started to doubt myself, but I just said 'Now, Shelley, you can do 
it.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is really the first time I've run to my potential, or close to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Franke, a senior en route to Southern Methodist in the fall, won her second 
consecutive 3-A triple jump title with a leap of 38-feet. She won the 3-A long 
jump at 17-9 1/2, and placed second in her speciality, the discus, an event she 
has won twice before at this meet, at 153-7. 
</P>

After an off-year in 1988, El Dorado senior Lori Svoboda won her third 3-A 
title in the high jump with a leap of 5-10. Svoboda, whose lifetime best is 
5-10 3/4, made three attempts at 6-0, which would have tied the county record, 
but came close only on her third try, scraping the bar with her back on the way 
down. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A high jump, Mission Viejo's Lisa Fager won at 5-4. Fager also placed 
second in the triple jump at 39-7 1/2.

It was the sort of thing that doesn't happen every day. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Megonigal Duley was paying for two pairs of shoes at Bullock's at South 
Coast Plaza when she noticed that the navy blue pair she was wearing needed 
some polish. Where could she get her shoes shined in the mall? 
</P>
<P>
"The salesclerk couldn't come up with anything," Duley said. "So another guy 
behind the desk opened a brand-new container of shoe polish and polished my old 
pair," she said. "Talk about service. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
Duley, a retail specialist with the commercial properties division of Grubb 
&amp; Ellis in Newport Beach, is the sort of customer that virtually every 
retailer wants -- a busy young professional with a family and more money than 
time. 
</P>
<P>
To keep customers like her coming back, more retail outlets are bending over 
backward to provide customer service -- everything from faxing shoppers' mail 
to making their reservations for theater shows. 
</P>
<P>
"Nordstrom was the forerunner. Now shoppers are demanding it," said Lenhard P. 
Preszler of Huntington Beach. Preszler, who owns three strip shopping centers, 
attended the spring convention of the International Council of Shopping Centers 
last week in Las Vegas. Several of the sessions there focused on finding better 
ways to cater to customers, a matter of increasing concern in the competitive 
retail market. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts at service one-upmanship have led retailers, for example, to advertise 
added toilets and to install two-way speakers in mall directories. 
</P>
<P>
Saks Fifth Avenue at South Coast Plaza will serve preferred customers lunch and 
wine as they shop, and the store has even sent a gift-bearing Santa in a 
limousine to its best customers' homes on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Amen Wardy, the exclusive women's boutique at Newport Center Fashion Island, 
will dispatch a van full of designer apparel to its longtime customers, who can 
try the clothes on in the comfort and privacy of their own homes, then send 
back what they don't want. 
</P>
<P>
And Bullock's at South Coast Plaza now employs a full-time concierge who keeps 
bus schedules, lists of local hotels and a stack of menus from better 
restaurants in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the increasing emphasis on service reflects the fact that consumers 
have noticed the extra attention and are saying they want even more. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers are aware that they're being courted," said Maura Eggan, a 
spokeswoman for South Coast Plaza. "If it's a case of the same or very similar 
merchandise, the customer will go to the store that gives them something 
extra." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intense Competition 
</P>
<P>
And in an upscale center such as Fashion Island or South Coast Plaza -- which 
vie for Orange County's most affluent shoppers -- the competition among stores 
can be intense. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the South Coast Plaza Bullock's -- situated only steps away from the 
service-oriented Nordstrom -- has begun making extra efforts to spoil its 
shoppers. And the pampering is offered by employees at all levels. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Graham, a group vice president with Bullock's, told of overhearing two 
customers at the Costa Mesa store recently who were looking at a $380 sweater. 
</P>
<P>
"One said: 'This is just too expensive. I'll buy it when they mark it down,' " 
Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
"So I said, 'Do you want us to call you?' I wrote down her name and number, and 
when the sweater finally went on sale, I let her know. She couldn't believe it 
(and) said, 'Fine, send it out.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hand-Addressed Notes 
</P>
<P>
And the emphasis on service does not stop when the customer leaves the store. 
I. Magnin sales clerks send hand-addressed note cards referring to items 
customers have bought and offering further assistance. 
</P>
<P>
And these days, more stores than ever are willing to make a refund on almost 
any item being returned, no matter how expensive, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had customers come in with tinsel hanging off their trees the day after 
Christmas," Lewis Skelton, a regional vice president with Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 
told participants at the Las Vegas trade show. "They can still get their money 
because we build a bond." 
</P>
<P>
Parisian, a Birmingham, Ala.-based department store chain known for its 
top-notch service, takes back furs "even when we've seen the person wear it on 
the weekend," said Harold L. Abroms, executive vice president and chief 
operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of service can pay off big. Parisian's sales average better than $250 
per square foot (a basic retail performance yardstick) -- making it the No. 2 
grossing chain nationwide among department stores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Returns 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees, however, that a generous return policy always leads to 
greater customer good will. The Forgotten Woman, a boutique chain that 
specializes in upscale apparel in larger sizes, is one retailer that will not 
take back merchandise. Ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't sell used goods," Nancye Radmin, Forgotten Woman's owner and founder, 
told a convention audience. "I wouldn't want to wear someone else's bathing 
suit. Would you?" 
</P>
<P>
Some shoppers will try to abuse a return policy, she added. "I had a woman in 
Beverly Hills tell me her husband hated a dress -- after I saw her photo in the 
newspaper wearing it," Radmin said. 
</P>
<P>
So Forgotten Woman puts its efforts into other niceties. The Fashion Island 
store in Newport Beach, like others in the chain, includes a "Sugar Daddy Bar" 
stocked with free coffee, tea and other goodies for the men accompanying 
shoppers at the store. "We even have portable blenders in some stores, now that 
everybody's on Opti-fast liquid protein diets," Radmin said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, smaller retailers such as Forgotten Woman are obliged to go the extra 
mile if they are to compete with a Bullock's or a Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lists of Purchases 
</P>
<P>
The Yves St. Laurent Rive Gauche store in Costa Mesa, for instance, keeps 
detailed lists of what its repeat full-price customers buy every season, then 
calls them when a new collection comes in."We see what might complement a 
wardrobe. With St. Laurent, you can always mix and match and it's unbelieveable 
what you can do with a piece you've had for 5 years," said Josee Sievert, 
manager and buyer for the store 
</P>
<P>
The Polo/Ralph Lauren Shop, also at South Coast Plaza, will replace belts or 
buttons for customers. "I'll strip something in the store if I had to, to 
replace a piece that someone has lost," said Terry Barbour, menswear manager at 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
For others, taking care of customers has meant simply going back to basics. 
</P>
<P>
When the Coronado Center in Albuquerque, N.M., decided to take the plunge and 
expand its restroom facilities, the mall sent out invitations to the grand 
opening where "a seat has been reserved in your honor." A plunger marching band 
paraded around the center and Mr. Whipple was there to cut the toilet-paper 
ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
"The mall turned a negative into a plus," said Weldon Joe Larsen, senior vice 
president with Homart Development Co. of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
What it all amounts to is an industry realization that the way to keep 
customers is to keep them happy. 
</P>
<P>
"The shift in customer preference is real," agreed Leslie Wexner, chairman of 
the board of the Limited Inc., a women's clothing chain. "Ultimately, the 
consumer is always our boss."

<P>
Customers aren't the only people benefiting from the big emphasis on service. 
</P>
<P>
Nancye Radmin, owner of the Forgotten Woman chain of upscale women's apparel 
stores, is convinced that a good salesperson is more important than good 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how women say the good men are all either married or dead? Well, I 
feel the same about salespeople," Radmin told retailers attending the 
International Council of Shopping Centers spring convention last week in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
To attract and keep the good sales people, Radmin acknowledged that she would 
do just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I go out and steal 'em," Radmin said. "And I'll pay double what someone else 
is paying to get you." 
</P>
<P>
The chain offers other rewards as well. In addition to paying commissions on 
sales, Forgotten Woman offers everyone from the president to the cleaning crew 
a profit-sharing plan. 
</P>
<P>
Fattening employees' wallets isn't the only way firms inspire loyalty among 
their personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The most successful retailers "build in an extraordinary sense of family and 
community" among their employees, said Anthony J. Stokan, a founder of Anthony 
Russell &amp; Associates, a Toronto-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
One Canadian developer picks up half the cost of any self-help course its 
employees choose to take, Stokan said. "At the end of the year, if the employee 
has stuck with the program -- detox or smoking or whatever -- he or she is 
reimbursed for the full cost of the course," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart, the Arkansas-based discount store chain, is testing a 90-day program 
in which some sales staff members wear buttons with a dollar bill that read, 
"If I don't smile and greet you, please take my dollar." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the test period, any salesperson who still has his or her dollar 
bill is to send it to company Chairman Sam M. Walton. Walton "will autograph it 
and return it," Skelton said. 
</P>
<P>
Smile and the world smiles with you -- or at least buys from you.

STOCK WATCH: BECKMAN SPINOFF, NEW PRODUCT GET A HO-HUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beckman Instruments in Fullerton has spent $50 million in research over the 
past 3 years for a single new product line called a clinical chemistry 
analyzer, President Louis Rosso said last week. 
</P>
<P>
For that kind of money, some investors may be expecting a breakthrough that 
will shake the clinical laboratory industry. 
</P>
<P>
But even though analysts expect the new product line to be successful, they 
said it is unlikely to have more than a moderate impact on future business of 
the Orange County maker of diagnostics equipment and analytical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
And that attitude also typifies the reaction on Wall Street to the pending 
spinoff of Beckman Instruments this summer by parent company SmithKline Beckman 
Corp., a Philadelphia pharmaceutical giant. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman, analysts note, tends to be a steady but unspectacular performer. In 
1988, for example, its earnings grew a respectable 9.3% to $42.5 million, while 
revenue increased 11.4% to $770.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
This year, analysts expect revenue to grow about 10%, with earnings growth a 
little higher. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of predictable growth will make Beckman a stable but not dynamic 
investment after the total spinoff by SmithKline, which is merging with a 
British drug company, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline spun off about 15% of Beckman's shares to outside investors last 
November. But the company is not yet considered by analysts as a "true 
investment play" because SmithKline still owns the lion's share of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman stock closed Friday at $19.625 per share, down 25 cents for the week on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's an interesting company. But to most people, it won't impress them 
as exciting," said Linda Miller, an analyst with the New York brokerage firm of 
PaineWebber. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Beckman won't grow at a torrid pace is that it already has a large 
and established position in markets in the United States and dozens of foreign 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Also, thousands of different products are used by medical instruments buyers, 
which means that a new product might be highly advanced, but its sales won't 
necessarily shoot through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they consider a new biological research instrument developed by 
Beckman to be superior to other products on the market, but it will account for 
only about $15 million, or 2%, of Beckman's sales for next year.

THE BROTHERHOOD OF ETERNAL LOVE, 'PSYCHEDELIC EVANGELISTS' OR STREET-SMART DRUG 
DEALERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elliott Almond 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1966, John Griggs robbed a man of LSD at gunpoint, according to a former 
friend's testimony before a grand jury. The act dramatically changed Griggs' 
life. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Glen Lynd testified in 1973 before the Orange County Grand Jury, 
Griggs experimented with the LSD, "threw away his gun and was running around 
hollering, 'This is it.' That's how it all began." 
</P>
<P>
Lynd in 1973 was describing the origins of the Laguna Beach-based Brotherhood 
of Eternal Love, which by then was alleged to be an international drug ring. 
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood grew from humble beginnings to become a multimillion-dollar 
underground organization, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
When Griggs stole the LSD in 1966, he and Lynd were members of the Street 
Sweepers, an Anaheim car gang that was rumored to be into petty crime. Griggs 
was never arrested for the LSD robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not know much about lysergic acid diethylamide, Griggs did like 
the results of his experimentation, according to Lynd's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
WITH THE DRUG CULTURE on the rise in the United States, Griggs and the Street 
Sweepers were turned on to a new scene. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1966, they moved from their Anaheim haunts to Modjeska Canyon, 
where they became "psychedelic evangelists," says Dion Wright, who befriended 
Griggs in Laguna Beach 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
They rejected their material ways, and the old Street Sweepers incorporated as 
the Brotherhood of Eternal Love. They were granted tax-exempt status as a 
religious organization by the state Franchise Tax Board. 
</P>
<P>
There in the Orange County foothills, they began practicing under a Zen yogi 
and joined the spiritual search that was sweeping America's youth. They also 
cultivated their knowledge of narcotics. Thus, by the time they arrived in 
Laguna Beach in early 1967, they were experienced drug users. 
</P>
<P>
"When their house (in Modjeska Canyon) burned down, they all got jobs as 
gardeners for the city of Laguna (Beach) and moved to the beach," Wright, an 
artist now living in San Diego, says. 
</P>
<P>
They grew their hair long, went barefoot, planted vegetable gardens and surfed. 
In effect, the foundation of Laguna Beach's hippie population was laid. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a moment of incredible innocence and romantic idealism," Timothy 
Leary said recently. The one-time Harvard psychology lecturer wrote about his 
involvement with the Brotherhood in his book, "Flashbacks, an Autobiography of 
Timothy Leary." 
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood, whose members lived in a two-block neighborhood in Laguna 
Canyon called Dodge City, opened Mystic Arts World in the Sleepy Hollow section 
of town. Mystic Arts was a Bohemian boutique that became the unofficial 
headquarters of Laguna's hippies. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Leary calls Mystic Arts "the ultimate head shop, a veritable L. L. 
Bean supermarket of hippie gear." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Purcell, who was a Laguna Beach police officer in the hippie days and is 
now the city's police chief, claims that Mystic Arts World was a front for a 
sophisticated drug-dealing operation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, local and federal authorities received grand jury indictments against 
46 members of the Brotherhood in an effort to shatter what law enforcement 
officials considered to be one of the largest drug-dealing operations in the 
United States. Police estimated that about 200 people were involved with the 
group at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
From those indictments came Lynd's revealing testimony and eventual convictions 
on conspiracy and drug charges for 50% to 60% of those indicted, according to 
Ed Freeman, an Orange County assistant district attorney and the prosecutor in 
the Brotherhood case. Lynd was indicted but given immunity to testify before 
the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, there was an apathy from the community (in) that these were harmless 
people," Purcell said. "I think a certain number of people were embarrassed by 
it. I think a lot of people in this town were hoping that they would wake up 
some day and it would go away." 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, the Brotherhood smuggled hashish from Afghanistan, 
which members would process and then can and label as peaches or tomatoes for 
export internationally. They had counterfeit passports, driver's licenses and 
other phony IDs and disguises to help them move freely between borders, 
according to records. 
</P>
<P>
Also, according to testimony before the grand jury, Brotherhood members made 
extensive trips to Mexico where they smuggled marijuana across the border by 
putting the weed in the hubcaps of their automobiles and paying off Mexican 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Lynd testified that he ran nearly 1,000 kilos of marijuana to New York in two 
trips in 1967 and returned with a partner who carried two suitcases stuffed 
with $98,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"You would see them out here in the canyon with rags on their bodies, planting 
corn with their girlfriends and fellow dopers," says Purcell, one of four 
special investigators whose work resulted in the indictments. "Then you would 
see the same person in a three-piece suit under a different name paying cash to 
a Porsche car dealer." 
</P>
<P>
WHILE POLICE RECALL THE Brotherhood for its criminal activity, those who 
associated with members remember it as an idealistic group who wanted to change 
the world through drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The members thought that mind-expanding drugs were the answer to the country's 
ills, says Jimmy Otto, a record-store owner in Laguna who was a friend of 
Brotherhood members and who once participated in the group's ritualized method 
of taking LSD. 
</P>
<P>
They would huddle in remote areas in groups of four and take a dose at sunrise, 
Otto recalls. The group would then read from a psychedelic prayer book that 
Otto called a guidebook for drug experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't take it to party," Otto says. "They took it to find themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The path, however, often was muddled. 
</P>
<P>
When Griggs became disillusioned with Laguna's growing reputation as a hub of 
hippiedom and wanted to start anew in open spaces, the Brotherhood purchased 
property below Mount San Jacinto near Idyllwild in the summer of 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Leary and his wife, who were on a national lecture tour, accepted an invitation 
to live at the ranch. Most of the residents lived in tepees in the peaceful 
valley among chaparral and sagebrush. Wright, however, says he sensed a lost 
paradise the few times he visited the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The deterioration of the group began in earnest in the summer of 1969 when 
Griggs died of an overdose of psilocin, a synthetic drug he was taking for the 
first time. He was 26. According to Leary's book, Griggs took the drug in the 
presence of his wife and three children. 
</P>
<P>
A laboratory report later revealed the concoction contained strychnine, Leary 
wrote. The Riverside County coroner's office listed the death as accidental. 
</P>
<P>
Griggs' death left a vacuum within the Brotherhood, whose members continued 
dealing drugs for the next several years. Some of the group stayed at the 
desert ranch, while others continued to operate Mystic Arts World in Laguna 
Beach; still others sought refuge in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood remained in operation through 1973, when the convictions on 
conspiracy and drug charges were handed down. Elliott Almond

The promise: 'An environment as attractive, as balanced and as enduring as

n the 1920s, an otherwise unremarkable expanse of ranchland was best known as 
the world's second-largest source of lima beans. In the 1960s, it was taking 
shape as a master-planned community. In the 1970s, it was the largest planned 
community in North America.

Today, Irvine, whose residents voted for cityhood in 1971, is a tidy, 
unblemished, well-manicured place to live and work. And, like most communities, 
it has its critics and its boosters. 
</P>
<P>
New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger recently described it this 
way: "Irvine is a world of condominiums and freeways, of shopping malls and 
office towers, in which everything looks as if it had been finished last month 
or will be finished next month, and what is old is what was built five years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
To some residents that newness is part of its attraction. Konrad K. Larson, who 
has lived in Irvine for 19 years, considers it "a very attractive place to 
live. It's new. It does have a . . . lot of parks. The schools are very good" 
and it is safe and clean. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE THE CITY IS contained on about 64,000 acres of what was once part of 
Irvine the ranch, a 108,184-acre bonanza purchased by James Irvine Sr. in 1876, 
when he bought out his partners, acquiring title to all of it. The name has 
stuck, although family ownership of the land had disappeared by 1983. 
</P>
<P>
If the vastness of 64,000 acres is difficult to grasp, consider this: 
Geographically, the town is larger than Boston and San Francisco combined. 
</P>
<P>
For a new city to flourish, "you have to be right in front of a wave of people 
moving toward you," observes Republican lawmaker Gil Ferguson, who was vice 
president of public relations and advertising for the Irvine Co. before he was 
elected to represent Irvine residents in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"As the people marched out of Los Angeles after World War II, they marched into 
Orange County," Ferguson says. 
</P>
<P>
In the path of this migration was what became the city of Irvine. It grew from 
an unincorporated community of fewer than 100 residents (most of them ranch 
workers) in 1960 to a full-service city of about 110,000 (most of them 
homeowners) today. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, all of Orange County was in the path of that migration. What set 
Irvine apart was its heralded master plan, the blueprint to control and shape 
what was to come. 
</P>
<P>
Its origins can be traced to the late 1950s. By then, the Irvine Co. had made a 
tidy fortune farming and ranching the old homestead, patriarch James I. Irvine 
II had been dead a decade and the University of California was looking for a 
place to put a new campus. 
</P>
<P>
William L. Pereira -- the world-renowned architect who brought a pyramid to San 
Francisco, an international airport to Los Angeles, a space station to Cape 
Canaveral and movie sets to "Gone With the Wind" -- brought UC Irvine to the 
site of a one-time hog farm donated by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira, hired first by the University of California, then later by the Irvine 
Co., also brought the concept of villages to the planned community. Pereira 
designed the first of the community's planned villages, University Park, to 
surround the UC Irvine campus. 
</P>
<P>
The village was to be a community unto itself with a unique look and feel, 
employing open space with bicycle paths, parks, roads and greenbelts, and it 
would be regulated by a resident association. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira and Irvine Co. planners expanded the concept to the adjoining property 
that became the rest of the city. As more than 30 villages were added, each 
retained its distinctive qualities but was linked harmoniously with neighboring 
villages. From any point in town, shopping, schools and recreation areas were 
located within walking distance from homes along attractive, well-kept public 
corridors, such as the elaborate bicycle paths that weave through and link each 
village. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone and utility lines were placed underground, and parks, paseos, 
greenbelts and setbacks decorated the landscape within and between the 
villages. This was strikingly unlike the hodgepodge of suburban tracts that 
sprawled across the Southern California basin. 
</P>
<P>
Before incorporation, the Irvine Co. had received from county government 
approval of a master plan for the southern portion of its land surrounding the 
university. Plans were also being formulated for areas to the north. 
</P>
<P>
But after the vote for cityhood in 1971, all plans were combined, and an 
overall master plan for Irvine took shape. The resulting plan outlined how and 
how much of the pristine ranch and farmland would be built upon and, perhaps 
more important, how much would not. Under the plan, two-thirds of the city will 
be developed and one-third will remain open space. 
</P>
<P>
All this was wrapped neatly in a slogan that promised: "We build tomorrow's 
cities today." 
</P>
<P>
AT THE TIME OF incorporation, about 10% of current development had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. promised in 1970 that residents would "live in an environment 
that is as attractive, as balanced and as enduring as the science of urban 
planning can make it. It will be an environment where urban sprawl has been 
stopped before it has started. It will be an environment where nature and man 
both prosper." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, incorporation had its opponents, including the neighboring city 
of Santa Ana, which wanted to bring the valuable real estate within its own 
boundaries. The failure to annex unincorporated Irvine was one of Santa Ana's 
major "tragedies," laments Dan Young, that city's current mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"The city fathers were not aggressive enough in their pursuit of that wonderful 
piece of geography," Young complains. "As a mayor trying to rebuild my city's 
tax base, there is a certain lust in my heart for the Irvine business complex" 
and the tax revenue it produces. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co., which in 1971 owned 85% of the land in the proposed city, 
supported incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Other developers believed that the Irvine Co. was acting against its own 
interest by backing incorporation, enabling residents to have more control over 
the company's developments. 
</P>
<P>
But Irvine Co. Vice Chairman Raymond L. Watson, who was the company's principal 
planner when the master plan took shape, says he believed that "one of the 
yokes of democracy is democracy. We as a company ultimately have to learn how 
to deal with that." 
</P>
<P>
"We may build the parks or the greenbelts, but somebody has to run the programs 
that have the Little League football and baseball and have . . . whatever level 
of police they want to have." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson recalls the company's motives as not quite so altruistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We (the Irvine Co.) had lost the support on the (county) Board of 
Supervisors," Ferguson says. "Our man didn't win. So they were 3-2 against us. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pure looking out for ourselves. We determined it would be better to 
create a city to govern our master plan. It was better to trust our future to 
(city officials) than a (county) board that was antagonistic to our company." 
</P>
<P>
County officials increasingly were siding with surrounding communities 
interested in annexing the unincorporated area, spurring the incorporation 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to (incorporate) or we wouldn't have had any tax base left for the new 
city," John H. Burton, who became one of the first councilman, said at the 
time. "If we didn't stop it, the whole industrial park would have been up for 
grabs." 
</P>
<P>
Some saw incorporation as a means for the Irvine Co. to control decision 
making. Consequently, some candidates for the first City Council seemed to 
campaign as much against the Irvine Co. as for cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, the first City Council was about evenly divided with Irvine 
Co. friends and foes. Larson, an unsuccessful council candidate in that first 
election, suggests today that "it would be an absolute mess out there if it 
weren't for the Irvine Co." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Larson echoed the apparent opinion of many residents, saying: "The 
master plan idea was a very, very good idea. I don't think the county would 
have implemented it. My feeling is the county really didn't care much about the 
outlying area. We were out in the boonies." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the motives, the pluses or minuses, cityhood was ushered in by a 
2-to-1 margin on Dec. 21, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
HAS THE IRVINE CO., which still owns nearly a third of the land in town, 
exerted undue influence? "There was a lot of fear about that. I don't think 
that happened. I do think the company obviously had a tremendous amount of 
influence," says William Woollett, Irvine's first and, so far, only city 
manager. He has announced his resignation, effective Aug. 1, and will be 
succeeded by his current assistant, Paul Brady Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co.'s relationship to the city in the beginning was unusual. The 
master plans drawn by the company eventually served as the basis for the entire 
design of the city. If that worked to the company's advantage, the city enjoyed 
the advantage of not having to deal with numerous developers and landowners. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Catalano, UC Irvine professor of social ecology and former Irvine city 
councilman, says that Irvine "found ways to provide affordable housing in ways 
other communities would not," principally because the city had only one 
landowner and developer to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
In another city, for example, a developer with only one parcel to build on is 
likely to want to maximize his profit on the project, Catalano says. But the 
Irvine Co. has been willing to make somewhat less of a profit by making 
concessions on a particular development because the city in turn has been 
willing to grant the company concessions, such as increased density, on other 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that the company reaps the overall profit it expected, and the 
city wins rare concessions in parklands, greenbelts and other amenities that it 
might not have wrenched from a variety of developers. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. has walked a fine political line but nonetheless has been a 
force in local politics. 
</P>
<P>
Company employees have become involved in city political campaigns, encouraged 
to do so by their employer. But, according to Irvine Co. spokespersons, the 
employees were not instructed to do the company's bidding. In fact, the Irvine 
Co.'s policy has been not to endorse or contribute to Irvine City Council 
candidates, says Larry Thomas, a company vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents, like Larson, believe that the city's increasing population has 
diluted whatever influence the company may have had in city matters. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co.'s Watson likes to draw an analogy to a four-legged stool. 
</P>
<P>
"One leg is the university because it's a vital part," he says. "Another leg is 
the community, the public. Another leg is the city government, which likes to 
think it is the public, but it isn't. It's something different. And the Irvine 
Co. is the fourth leg. 
</P>
<P>
"We each had different jobs to do . . . . I think the stool is constantly being 
tilted one way or the other. I don't think it's ever level. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally you would like to ask, 'Shouldn't it be level?' Maybe there were times 
in which we (the Irvine Co.) had more influence than was a nice balance. There 
are certainly other times when the city government has had more and more. That 
leg is getting longer all the time." 
</P>
<P>
In the view of current Mayor Larry Agran: "Without city government . . . you 
would have had an area that would have looked like the rest of south Orange 
County. Irvine is taking on a distinctive look." 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE ITS self-contained environment, Irvine is not an island unto itself. 
The city has experienced social problems and political scandals not unlike 
other fast-growing American suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Ambition took its toll when former Mayor Dave Baker pleaded guilty last year to 
felony forgery of a $48,000 check during his failed campaign for Congress. And, 
like the rest of the world, even the city's highly regarded school system has 
been unable to avoid drug and violence problems among some of its youth. 
Traffic congestion, perhaps the most universal of maladies, has plagued Irvine 
largely because of regional congestion beyond the city's control. 
</P>
<P>
But success can be measured by the satisfaction of those who live there. 
</P>
<P>
David Sills, a three-term city councilman who is now an Orange County Superior 
Court judge, says: "There are people who simply like Irvine, the facilities and 
the amenities. When they start looking around in other areas, they don't find 
what Irvine has." 
</P>
<P>
Larson believes Irvine is appealing because "people who are the yuppie group -- 
the up-and-coming, high-middle-class -- are looking for a place for the kids to 
play, good schools to qualify them for the universities. And they have yuppie 
neighbors who think like they do." 
</P>
<P>
"I like the concept," says Sue Ann Schappert, a 15-year resident. "I like the 
newness . . . . But it's kind of hard to raise kids here. They get such a 
one-sided view of the world. Everything's so clean, new and green . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Catalano says that "there were a lot of aspirations for Irvine in many 
different spheres of community achievement. I think the overall score card 
would be (that) we've met or exceeded most of them." 
</P>
<P>
"Residents of Irvine, (according to) almost every survey I've ever seen, have a 
higher level of satisfaction with the community and involvement than any place 
in the country," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter where you go today," says Watson, "people have heard of Irvine, and 
they associate it with a . . . successful, well-planned city." 
</P>
<P>
NOT EVERYONE HAS BEEN awe-struck. Mark Baldassare, UC Irvine professor of 
social ecology, says that Irvine has earned only a C grade as a planned 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's certainly been looked at as a model for urban development," he 
says. "But in terms of (being a) success, I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
"Its greatest failure (has been) to combine living and working in the same 
city, and that was the intention," says Baldassare, who concedes, however, that 
he is one who has been able to live and work in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Baldassare says, "housing never really did match up with the jobs 
that (Irvine) provided." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are ample jobs within the city, not all are suited for the 
mostly up-scale residents who can afford to live there. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some high-level corporate jobs available, but certainly for the 
major portion of the work force -- the service workers, the typical 
white-collar workers -- for them, living in Irvine is still a dream," 
Baldassare says. 
</P>
<P>
The two primary job centers in town are the Spectrum, at the junction of the 
Santa Ana and San Diego freeways, and the Irvine Business Center. The Spectrum 
is zoned largely for industrial and commercial uses, and development here will 
include a regional shopping center, offices and more medical-research 
buildings. The Irvine Business Center, located around John Wayne Airport, 
contains primarily office, manufacturing and warehouse space. 
</P>
<P>
The Spectrum will grow from its present 9.7 million square feet of buildings to 
about 46 million square feet in the next decade. The Irvine Business Center 
already has 37 million square feet of buildings on its way to a projected 48 
million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Watson contends that Irvine has been successful in providing jobs for its 
residents but concedes that more than half of Irvine's residents still leave 
town to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
"The object was not to have just a residential suburb, which is what the '50s 
produced," Watson says. "We try to produce a community that has both jobs and 
residences and try to get some sort of balance." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson allows, however, that Irvine "is not like a normal city." 
</P>
<P>
"There are no pawnshops. There are no muffler shops. There are no topless 
dancers. Everything is perfect," he says. "It's not like Harbor Boulevard or 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were planning at the very beginning, the question was always: 'How do 
you keep this from becoming sterile?' " 
</P>
<P>
After nearly two decades of cityhood and three decades of planning, "it does 
have a sterility about it," Ferguson concedes. 
</P>
<P>
NONE OF WHAT MAKES IRVINE the way it is happened by accident, except perhaps 
the fact that the people who live there turned out to be whiter and richer than 
some might have expected. 
</P>
<P>
The population is about 79% white, 5% higher than the county as a whole. 
Latinos account for 10.5% of residents, compared with 19% for the county, 
although blacks and "others" in Irvine amount to 10.5% of the population, 
compared with about 7% for the county. The estimated median household income 
1988 is $55,601, compared with $39,673 for the county. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine was designed as "the city beautiful for the beautiful people," said 
then-Santa Ana City Manager Carl Thornton nearly 20 years ago. He did not mean 
it as a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
One goal was to provide diverse housing. But the question even then was whether 
there would be a diverse racial and ethnic mix. Critics said from the beginning 
that the grand plan would spawn a "lily-white" enclave. 
</P>
<P>
The city has its defenders on that score. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll find Irvine is probably more diverse than any community in south Orange 
County; that's by design, not by accident," Catalano says. "I think Irvine has 
tried perhaps more than any American suburb to have affordable housing. I think 
we've shown that housing for moderate-income doesn't have to be unattractive." 
</P>
<P>
The median resale price of a home in Irvine is $209,000, compared with $211,038 
countywide. Of the 10,300 housing units built in Irvine in the past five years, 
7,750 were affordable only to upper-income families, those earning 20% more 
than the Orange County median income. 
</P>
<P>
Middle-class families earning between 50% and 120% of the county's median 
income qualified for 2,275 of the residential units built in Irvine during the 
same period. The remaining 275 residential units were affordable for families 
earning 50% and less of the median income. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Catalano stresses, "I don't think that we have gone far enough (in 
providing affordable housing)." 
</P>
<P>
Ever-rising home prices are among Watson's disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of housing is so high it is becoming more and more difficult for a 
young family to start here," Watson says. "That wasn't true . . . in the early 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Watson says that the problem results from economic pressures beyond city and 
company control. He concedes, however, that Irvine's very success contributes 
to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand you say, 'I want people to believe this is the best place in the 
world,' " But to the degree people are convinced, they drive prices up. A 
byproduct of soaring prices has been to make development denser, Watson says. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Archbold, an attorney who for eight years lived in a single-family home in 
the Woodbridge village, got married about 18 months ago, and she and her 
stockbroker-husband soon decided that their 1,210-square-foot "cottage home" 
was too small. They abandoned Irvine last year for a 30-year-old house with a 
pool on a quarter-acre lot in north Tustin. "We wanted a bigger lot and a 
bigger house and maybe fewer houses on the block," she says. "We just didn't 
think we could get anything like that in Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
(Still, Archbold profited. She bought her Irvine home new for $113,000 and sold 
it for nearly twice the price. "Not a bad investment at all," she says.) 
</P>
<P>
Former Snowapple neighbor Janice Schmit agrees that Irvine has become crowded. 
</P>
<P>
"The town is getting very overpopulated," she complains. "The traffic is very 
annoying." 
</P>
<P>
But Schmit also expresses what may be the prevailing sentiment-about-town: "I'm 
not terribly unhappy. I still like more about it than I don't like." 
</P>
<P>
WHAT LIES AHEAD FOR this community designed to thwart suburban sprawl and 
intended to nurture a feeling of community? By the year 2020, it is expected to 
have nearly doubled its population, topping 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of residential development, the city is about half finished, but 
expected commercial and industrial growth has not quite reached the halfway 
mark. Negotiations between the city and the Irvine Co. have modified the master 
plan to provide for even greater open space by preserving vast pristine areas 
of wilderness. In return, the company will be allowed to build up to five and 
10 units per acre on land originally designated for one and two homes. 
Meanwhile, the goal remains to provide jobs for residents, as well as 
out-of-towners. 
</P>
<P>
"You've heard it said that Irvine is boring, homogeneous," Agran says. "You 
cannot create a 100-year history in 15 or 20 years. It takes a while . . . ."

Twenty-five years and 37,331 degrees since it was founded, the university 
appears poised for the big leagues. The aim, today as in 1965, is to rival UC 
Berkeley and Harvard. 'The question is, will UCI achieve greatness? The 
opportunity is there.' 
</P>
<P>
In the sunny, book-lined office of UC Irvine Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, a 
dozen distinguished academics gathered recently to honor one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
It was an important, even a historic moment, but there was nothing stiff about 
it. Champagne flowed along with effusive toasts, and Peltason beamed like a 
coach whose underdog team had just run away with the championship. 
</P>
<P>
UCI chemistry professor F. Sherwood (Sherry) Rowland, a founding faculty 
member, had received the Japan Prize for his research on the destruction of the 
Earth's ozone shield. The prize included $400,000 in cash, enough loot to 
inspire enthusiastic chest-thumping, even if the award were not second in 
international status only to the Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
"Sherry Rowland's work is significant to the whole world, and the world has 
recognized him," Peltason proclaimed. "And that work took place at our 
university." 
</P>
<P>
UCI and UC Santa Cruz, both of which opened in 1965, are the newest 
universities in the 120-year-old University of California system, but it is UCI 
that is competing in many disciplines with hallowed Berkeley, UCLA and other 
top institutions across the country for the most prestigious prizes, elite 
professors and brightest students. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, UCI has grown in political muscle and brainpower with the 
additions of the Beckman Laser Institute, a medical research center, the 
western headquarters of the National Academy of Sciences and the Humanities 
Research Institute, a UC think-tank. UCI has also lured world-renowned scholars 
with above-scale salaries and, increasingly, has had to fend off outside bids 
for faculty members such as Rowland, who have done pioneering research at 
Irvine and now are celebrated themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Always land-rich, UCI is beginning to bring in big bucks, too. Private 
donations reached a record $24 million in 1987-88, and research grants, the 
fuel that propels scholarly study beyond state-funded basics, totaled $61 
million. The university, which employs 10,336 administrators, professors, 
clerks, groundskeepers and others, also pumped an estimated $544 million in 
personal income into the economy, with three-quarters of that spent in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The momentum shows no signs of slowing. Twenty-five years and 37,331 degrees 
since UCI was founded, the university appears poised for the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I think UCI is one of the most exciting places in the world of higher 
education," Peltason says. "We're like a kid entering adolescence -- we're 
maturing. UCI is going to be good, and it is going to be big. The question is, 
will UCI achieve greatness? The opportunity is there." 
</P>
<P>
The aim, today as in 1965, is to rival UC Berkeley and Harvard University, and 
the buzzword is destiny. Some caution that striving to accomplish so much in so 
short a time may result in shortcuts in quality, but no one disputes the 
remarkable strides the newcomer already has made. 
</P>
<P>
PLANS FOR A UC campus in East Los Angeles or Orange County began in the 1950s 
when soaring enrollment projections and a suburban building boom convinced the 
UC Board of Regents that Disneyland wouldn't be surrounded by orange groves for 
long and that UCLA alone would not be able to serve the growing metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
And so the search began. More than 20 sites were considered, then rejected, as 
communities competed for the university and the development it would bring. In 
March, 1959, the Regents selected 1,000 acres of gently rolling property on the 
Irvine Ranch because of its sweeping view of the Santa Ana basin, its location 
in the center of an urbanizing county and the planned web of freeways that 
would link it to metropolitan Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
UC officials also saw a rare and exciting opportunity to nurture a new 
community around the campus in cooperation with the Irvine Co., the development 
firm that owned the more than 100,000 surrounding acres of Irvine Ranch land. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, a bitter two-year battle within the Irvine Co. was coming 
to a head. Joan Irvine Smith, then 26 and the only descendant of founder James 
Irvine II on the company's board of directors, wanted to make the 1,000-acre 
tract a gift to UC but faced a wall of opposition from other board members. 
Exasperated, Smith took her campaign public. She called news conferences, wrote 
letters and spoke at rallies. 
</P>
<P>
It worked. In December, 1959, the Irvine Co. agreed to donate the 1,000 acres 
selected by UC. The university's landholdings were completed three years later 
when the Regents purchased from the Irvine Co. an additional 510 acres for $3.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who declined interviews pending the outcome of a suit she filed against 
the Irvine Co. after she was bought out in 1983, wrote in a 1977 account of the 
land fight, "I must admit in all candor my motivations were not entirely 
philanthropic. 
</P>

"It took no crystal ball to see what the location of UCLA had done for (the 
development of) Westwood in Los Angeles. The value of the Irvine Ranch property 
would be greatly enhanced, and there would be great benefits both financially 
and intellectually for the entire surrounding community." 
</P>
<P>
Athalie Clark, Smith's mother, recalled that "Joan was adamant, and she did a 
magnificent job. We all thought the university could do so much for the 
community. It was very much an agrarian community at the time." 
</P>
<P>
The university "gave an entirely different tone to the county," says Clark, now 
in her 80s and active as a philanthropist and a member of the UCI Foundation 
Board of Overseers. "Twenty-five years ago, the future of UCI was unknown 
because it was a new campus. I don't think anyone could have foretold the great 
impact it has had even outside the county." 
</P>
<P>
THE EARLY YEARS of the university were exciting and experimental for students, 
administrators and planners. Daniel G. Aldrich, dean of agriculture for the UC 
system, who was chosen to be UCI's first chancellor in 1962, three years before 
the university opened, assembled the founding faculty and provided a vision 
that lasted until his retirement in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
One of Aldrich's first appointments was Peltason, who in 1964 was lured from 
the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana to be vice chancellor of student 
affairs. Twenty years later, in September, 1984, Peltason succeeded Aldrich to 
become UCI's second chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
Now chancellor emeritus, Aldrich, 71, calls himself "the institutional memory." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich saw a relationship between campus design and academic goals and, with 
architect William L. Pereira, set out to create "a sense of destiny, a focal 
point for the campus and . . . the feeling that (the Irvine campus) was part of 
a major institution." 
</P>
<P>
On the dry, sloping ranchland, Pereira, who also was the architect for the 
first village in what became the city of Irvine, carved concentric circles, 
with half a dozen boxy, modernistic buildings clustered around the campus ring. 
At the center, a 35-acre arboretum was planted with trees and shrubs from 
around the world. Now called Aldrich Park, it is the heart of UCI. The vigorous 
founding chancellor, who often can be found strolling there, never walks past a 
scrap of litter without stooping to pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back to 1962, what did Aldrich expect UCI to become? "Exactly what it 
is," he replies. What kinds of advances will occur in the next 25 years? "More 
of the same," he says succinctly. "It all goes back to what we who came to 
Irvine were charged with building. UCI was a research university from the day 
we opened our doors. We did not begin as a two-year school that would one day 
become a four-year university. We offered Ph.D. programs on the day we 
started." 
</P>
<P>
During the late 1960s and early '70s, while Berkeley and other campuses were 
torn by angry, destructive Vietnam War protests, Irvine was distinguished by 
relative calm. When Gov. Ronald Reagan declared a state of emergency at 
Berkeley in May, 1969, and sent in the California National Guard, UCI students 
staged a peaceful boycott of classes. And when nine UCI students who traveled 
to Berkeley to observe and report on the conflict were arrested there, Aldrich 
used $900 from his own pocket to bail them out. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't caught up with a whole mess of regulations, telling students, 'You 
can't do this; you can't do that.' There was an atmosphere of responsiveness," 
Aldrich says. "And unlike a campus in an urban setting where a rally would move 
into city streets, and frustrated students would look for things to lash out 
against, there was nothing surrounding Irvine but fields. After walking a few 
miles across fields, the enthusiasm flags." 
</P>
<P>
A potentially serious clash between students and administrators at UCI occurred 
in February, 1969, when about 40 students staged a five-day sit-in in an 
English department writing lounge to protest the firing of three popular 
teachers. The students laid in for a siege with sleeping bags, peanut 
butter-and-jelly sandwiches and stacks of stereo records. They were "vexed," 
according to a newspaper account of the time, to discover that a professor had 
taken the stylus out of the stereo in the lounge. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the sit-in was more of a slumber party than a hostile takeover, 
some campus officials and community residents urged Aldrich to call police. 
</P>
<P>
"These students were very intent on expressing their concerns, and I said, 'So 
long as they are not obstructive or destructive, so be it,' " Aldrich says. But 
he told the student leader of the protesters that "'the moment some faculty 
member says to me, 'I've got to use the writing center for my class,' you'll be 
obstructing the business of the university. You'll have to leave or you will be 
trespassing and you will be arrested." 
</P>
<P>
The standoff that Aldrich dreaded came four days into the protest, when a 
professor told the chancellor that his class was scheduled to meet in the 
lounge. Aldrich called the student leader, Mike Krisman, and told him he had to 
clear out in time for the Monday class. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the weekend, I did a lot of second-guessing. I thought I had set myself 
up for a confrontation," Aldrich recalls. "I thought on Monday I was going to 
have to go out there and arrest them and the whole thing was going to blow up." 
</P>
<P>
Then, late Saturday night, Aldrich got a call from Krisman. "He said, 
'Chancellor, we'll be out.' And the next day, they were. They cleaned up the 
place and had it all spic and span." 
</P>
<P>
Violence did visit UCI during the Vietnam era -- when an arson fire gutted a 
campus Bank of America branch in October, 1970. Revolutionary slogans had been 
painted on the building, but the arsonist was never caught, so authorities were 
unable to prove who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Characteristically, Aldrich said, UCI students reacted in a positive way. 
Dozens came to the bank site after the fire to help board up the building and 
clear away debris. 
</P>
<P>
COMPARED WITH THE political involvement of the Vietnam era, the late 1970s and 
early '80s were marked by a quiet, internal focus. Students at UCI and around 
the country were interested in career paths, and the university's energies 
returned to its academic and research roots. Student activism meant adding a 
video-game contest to the annual "Nerd Week" festivities in 1980 and 
celebrating the UCI water polo team's first National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
championship the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Faced in 1978 with allowing the struggling engineering program to languish or 
making the commitment necessary for it to grow, UCI officials concluded that a 
great university needs strong professional programs. The result: a commitment 
of new funds and a 30% increase in the engineering faculty during a single 
school year, 1978-79. 
</P>
<P>
The university's efforts to solicit private donations began to pay off when, in 
1981, the Marilyn and Richard Hausman Chair of Ophthalmology, UCI's first 
endowed chair, was established with a $250,000 gift. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Rowland released his findings that showed that chlorofluorocarbons, a 
substance that causes the breakdown of the ozone, had tripled in the earth's 
atmosphere in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
And UCI's research partnership with private industry was launched that same 
year, when the Nelson Research &amp; Development Co. agreed to build offices 
and laboratories on campus that would be shared with medical school 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Also in 1983, UCI gave up its longstanding plans to build a research hospital 
on campus. UC Regents killed the plan because of fierce opposition from 
community leaders who backed the proposed Irvine Medical Center (now under 
construction). Aldrich bowed to the Regents, but UCI Medical School Dean 
Stanley van den Noort did not, leading to a split that resulted in Van den 
Noort's replacement as dean in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
UCI remained an enclave of liberal thought in Republican-dominated Orange 
County. It was one of several sites under consideration for Richard M. Nixon's 
presidential library until spring, 1983, when the Academic Senate voted to 
accept the archives only if the former President would relinquish all claims to 
control of materials displayed there. The Nixon Archives Foundation then 
scratched UCI off its list and later found a home in Yorba Linda, Nixon's 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
Such independence continues today, with UCI faculty members among the most 
vociferous community opponents to the planned San Joaquin Hills toll road, 
which would stretch between the Costa Mesa Freeway and San Juan Capistrano, 
running parallel to the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways. UCI administrators, 
however, strongly favor construction of the county's first toll road, which 
would make the university's undeveloped acreage easily accessible and 
commercially valuable. At issue is the preservation of the fragile wildlife 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
RAY WATSON, vice chairman of the Irvine Co., has watched the university, city 
and company grow together and, on some issues, grow apart since he came to 
Orange County in 1960. In actions such as the Nixon Library vote and the 
faculty opposition to the toll road plan, UCI has influenced thought in Irvine 
and throughout the county, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"The university was at first the stimulus but ultimately the conscience of the 
community," Watson says. "Historically, universities have walls around them, 
figuratively, and professors like to think that it is more important to discuss 
the problems of the world than to participate in the community. But there has 
always been an interrelationship with UCI and the community." 
</P>
<P>
Watson, now 62, accepted a job as the Irvine Co.'s first architectural planner 
in 1960 because he was intrigued by the chance to design a city in cooperation 
with a new university. He set up his shop on the first floor of the old Irvine 
family home, and Aldrich worked upstairs in temporary university offices. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked together, trying to figure out how this great university and this 
town could reinforce each other," Watson says. "We had a lot of expectations 
that the campus would be something special. The university was the glue that 
held together a very special group of men and women during those early days." 
</P>
<P>
The relationship among the Irvine Co., the university and the city of Irvine, 
incorporated in 1971, has shifted with the interests of each partner. Watson 
likens the relationship to a stool, with all the partners thrown out of kilter 
if one leg grows longer and stronger than the others. 
</P>
<P>
"For that stool to be stabilized, all the legs have to be the same length," 
Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
The stool teetered precariously in the late 1970s when UC Regents considered 
taking the company to court over a 15-year-old contract that binds the parties 
together to this day. The Regents challenged a deed restriction prohibiting 
commercial development on the 510 acres purchased from the Irvine Co. in 1964, 
arguing that times -- and Orange County land values -- had dramatically 
changed. Legal proceedings were never pursued, and when Donald Bren bought the 
company in 1983, negotiations were renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Bren and Peltason finally reached an agreement last summer: UCI will be 
permitted to develop 2 million square feet of office space on the property, 
clearing the way for its long-planned research park, and all lease profits will 
be used fund a special endowment, the Bren Fellows. Bren, who has contributed 
millions to UCI for projects including the Bren Events Center, also donated $1 
million to begin the endowment. 
</P>
<P>
Peltason has called the agreement "a clarification" of the original deed terms; 
Watson refers to it as limited permission for the university "to compete with 
the Irvine Co. in the real estate business." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Irvine also has battled with the patriarchal company over 
development proposals, but has maintained a generally friendly relationship 
with UCI, according to Mayor Larry Agran. Growing pains -- usually related to 
parking shortages and traffic excesses -- have caused occasional flare-ups, but 
the city and university have more often worked in partnership. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Theater, a 750-seat showplace now under construction on a 2.3-acre 
site donated by UCI, is perhaps the best example of this cooperation. Plans for 
the theater, originally proposed more than 15 years ago, nearly fell through 
late last year when the low bid came in at $17.6 million, more than $5 million 
over budget estimates. UCI, one of the three partners in the construction, 
kicked in an additional $1.8 million and the city and the Irvine Theater 
Operating Co. raised the remaining $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
When the first shovelful of earth for the theater was turned in March, it was a 
triumph for university and community supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come a long way," Peltason said at the ground-breaking ceremony. "We 
have just a little bit more to go. And then it will be opening night." 
</P>
<P>
Agran, who supported the theater project, says he would like to draw on the 
energies and intellect of the university in future projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship has been strengthened because we need each other to 
accomplish mutual goals," he says. "Our challenge now is to involve the 
engineers, the social scientists, those who are knowledgeable about air 
pollution or toxins in the environment in the urban problems we face. We need 
to involve that intellect in the day-to-day life of the city." Irvine residents 
feel great pride that theirs is a university town, Agran says. "I think without 
UCI, Irvine would be largely indistinguishable from the other suburban 
municipalities along the freeways to San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPING THOSE community ties is part of UCI's maturation and a priority for 
the chancellor. Peltason, 65, who spent a decade as chancellor of the 
University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana and started his academic career as a 
political science instructor at the University of Missouri, uses those 
communities as models. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see UCI and Irvine become like a Midwestern university town," he 
said. "An Ann Arbor, a Champaign-Urbana, a Columbia, Mo. Those were 
agricultural centers that gave rise to universities, and there is community 
support and interaction that goes back for years and years. We're still young, 
but we're getting there." 
</P>
<P>
Peltason's overtures to the community have taken many forms. He formed the 
Chancellor's Club, a circle of wealthy and influential county residents who 
offer advice and bring other potential donors into the fold, and he has 
launched community-support groups to strengthen university ties with citizens. 
The chancellor has also encouraged university officials to participate in 
Irvine affairs, take appointive posts and run for local office. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on private donations has paid off. The university's fund-raising 
office, headed by Vice Chancellor John Miltner, brought in a record $24 million 
last year and has begun an ambitious five-year capital campaign to raise 
another $195 million. 
</P>
<P>
One prominent professor, who once was skeptical of the power push, is now a 
believer. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack is doing more on community outreach and touching bases with the ruling 
elite of Orange County," says the professor, who has held leadership roles at 
UCI for more than 20 years. "He is doing very well at that, and some who didn't 
see the need, including me, have become convinced that it is very useful for 
the university. It is bringing in enormous amounts of money." 
</P>
<P>
Peltason also has presided over UCI's entrance into the high-stakes competition 
for star scholars from around the world. In recent years, the university has 
recruited literary critic J. Hillis Miller from Yale University, evolutionary 
biologist Francisco Ayala from UC Davis and French literary critic and 
philosopher Jacques Derrida, who travels to UCI from Paris to teach one quarter 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
Next on the chancellor's recruiting list are top graduate students, the next 
generation of university professors and undergraduate honors students. 
</P>
<P>
"The real future of the university is in people," Peltason says. "One of my 
most important jobs is bringing the best, smartest people to UCI and supporting 
the ones we've already got." 
</P>
<P>
Peltason, who is expected to retire in 1991, is the bridge to that future. And 
the next century is almost tangible at UCI, where 30 buildings are under 
construction and student enrollment is expected to nearly double, from 15,000 
to 27,000 by the year 2005. In a few years, the direction for the coming 
quarter century will be set. 
</P>
<P>
The next boom is inevitable. The challenge for UCI is to rise in quality as it 
swells in size.

ORANGE COUNTY AND UCI: A MARRIAGE NOT EXACTLY MADE IN HEAVEN

Times' Orange County Life section.

<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after an eminent educator named James March was recruited in 1964 from 
Carnegie Tech to become UC Irvine's first dean of social sciences, he 
celebrated his first Fourth of July in Orange County as was his custom: He flew 
the American flag in front of his house. 
</P>
<P>
I had dropped by to see him that morning and told him: "If you fly that flag, 
everybody around here is going to assume you're against the United Nations, in 
favor of impeaching Earl Warren and think that the fluoridation of public water 
supplies is a Commie plot." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't believe me and left it flying. The next day, a neighborhood committee 
of members of the John Birch Society called on him to ask if he wanted to join 
the local chapter. 
</P>
<P>
This is but one of dozens of similar incidents that greeted the impressive -- 
and startled -- corps of educators who were recruited to help launch UCI's 
vision of itself as the "Harvard of the West." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County and UCI weren't exactly a marriage made in heaven. A lot of 
unsuspecting educators who were regarded as moderates or even conservatives in 
their previous lives found when they arrived here that they were instantly 
suspect as left-wingers. 
</P>
<P>
So were the students. A 1967 resolution of the board of governors of the United 
Republicans of California asserted that "a deliberate effort is being made to 
admit only liberally oriented students to Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
I remember a newly hired English professor, who had left a prestigious job at 
an Eastern university, coming into my office at UCI waving a copy of The Times. 
He had just read the account of a speech by Dennis Carpenter, then vice 
chairman of the Republican State Central Committee (later a state senator from 
Orange County), who said -- among other things -- that he would like to see a 
UCI "program of recruitment that would hire young, shaven, all-American types 
to teach the kids something instead of trying to influence them politically." 
</P>
<P>
This new professor was middle-aged, bearded and politically liberal. He was 
also one of the best in his field. I remember the panic in his eyes that 
morning as he faced the cold reality that he had sold his home in the East. His 
name escapes me because he didn't stay the route, as so many of us did. 
</P>
<P>
I joined UCI in 1966 as a lecturer in the English department and spent 21 years 
teaching there. From close up, it strikes me that in its brief life, UCI has 
already gone through five rather distinct stages: euphoria, disillusionment, 
activism, apathy and technocracy. I have a feeling the latter is going to be 
around for a long, long time. 
</P>
<P>
The euphoric stage lasted until about a year after UCI accepted its first 
students. Those were the years when we all went out and watched the campus 
literally grow out of the brown hills of the Irvine Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
It was an exciting time, a whole new element of great promise introduced into 
what had been for so many years an agrarian society. And at the same time the 
buildings were going up, human resources were being recruited to write on a 
brand-new academic slate -- a challenging prospect that seduced some potent 
academicians into coming to this new and unproved school. 
</P>
<P>
UCI and Orange County were able to cohabit briefly in a superficial sort of 
harmony. The good citizens were mildly upset over the irreverent selection of 
an anteater as a mascot, but things were relatively calm until the San 
Francisco Mime Troupe arrived on campus for a performance in the spring of 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
Then, quicker than you could say "criminal communist conspiracy," the 
UCI-Orange County honeymoon was over -- and disillusionment set in. The Mime 
Troupe's performance was called "Civil Rights in a Cracker Barrel," and UCI 
instantly was accused by the political right in Orange County of providing a 
platform for a passel of subversives. 
</P>
<P>
This was Chancellor Dan Aldrich's baptism of fire, and he simply refused to 
cave in to the pressures on him to cancel the Mime Troupe performance. It also 
established Aldrich in the years to come as possibly the only administrator in 
the UC system who could have maintained bridges between the Orange County 
community and the UCI student body 
</P>
<P>
during the activism of the 1960s and early '70s. He refused to allow the 
Neanderthals on either end of the political spectrum to polarize the community 
and the campus to a point beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
The Mime Troupe performed, and Orange County was outraged -- albeit typically 
most of the outrage came from people who hadn't seen the show. 
</P>
<P>
During the activist years that followed -- when campuses all over the nation 
were in ferment -- UCI functioned, uneasily and occasionally violently, under 
the steady-as-you-go hand of Aldrich. Speakers who were barred from other 
campuses -- including representatives of both the hard right and the hard left 
-- spoke at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Orange County Coordinating Republican Assembly passed a 
resolution calling for Aldrich's ouster because he "supported, permitted and 
protected activities of left-wing organizations on the UCI campus." As perhaps 
a harbinger of 1988, the American Civil Liberties Union was cited as a 
"left-wing organization." 
</P>
<P>
Those of us on the UCI faculty were catching it from two directions during the 
activist period: the Orange County political reactionaries who were riding 
high, and some of the more excessive of the activist students on campus. It 
wasn't very well understood then -- nor is it now -- that radical students had 
more trouble with liberals on the faculty who didn't see themselves as 
revolutionaries than with the conservatives with whom they could shout and rail 
and call names and then go away mutually satisfied.I remember a good many 
sessions in my campus office in which I told radical students from my classes 
that they were narcissists who were a hell of a lot more interested in the 
choreography of action than in producing real social change. But whatever their 
motivation -- and there were plenty whose zeal was strictly high-minded -- they 
were exciting and did help accomplish some important social changes: the 
rejection of Lyndon Johnson, the 18-year-old vote, the ultimate cashiering of 
the Vietnam war, for starters. Contrasted with the present pale lot, I enjoyed 
them. 
</P>
<P>
They probably look better in retrospect than they did at the time, because the 
students who followed them swung almost to the opposite end of the spectrum. At 
least the narcissism of the activists was directed toward social change; with 
this new group, the major -- sometimes the total -- concern was with individual 
well-being. I allowed students to select their own writing topics, and almost 
overnight, the topics changed from the environment and civil rights and social 
reform to investments, jobs and how-I-found-God. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of the change were all over the campus. I knew we were in trouble when 
there was a massive resurgence of fraternities and sororities -- heretofore 
moribund -- at UCI in the mid-1970s. Instead of demonstrating against 
Watergate, UCI students built the world's largest ice cream sundae (4,584 
pounds of ice cream) in the plaza that a few years earlier housed political 
rallies. Shortly afterward, when a call came from the few surviving activists 
for a demonstration against the on-campus sale of Coors Beer (for its alleged 
racist personnel policies), four people showed up -- and the apathetic period 
was in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
State politicians helped it along. Govs. Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown (whose 
father had been so instrumental in building the superb UC system) squeezed the 
university economically, and UCI began to lose some of its finest faculty. 
Plans to make UCI the equal of UCLA and Berkeley were jettisoned. The Harvard 
of the West became a dim memory. 
</P>
<P>
That was probably UCI's most difficult stage, although it seemed to please the 
local citizens. We weren't rocking many boats. Several of my activist students 
came back to visit during this period, and as a result, I wrote a nostalgic 
essay for Harper's called "Apathy on the Campus." It produced an avalanche of 
letters -- mostly angry -- from students all over the country. One -- not 
untypical -- called me "an over-age liberal living vicariously through 
recollections of his students' burning banks." So much for the apathetic 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in the early 1980s, Orange County's high-technology industries, which 
had been flirting for years with UCI, decided to escalate the relationship into 
a full-time affair, and UCI hasn't been the same since. Nor is it likely to be 
for some years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Aldrich, who had a warm relationship with local industry but never climbed 
into bed with it, retired. Jack Peltason, who had been around at the beginning 
of UCI, returned to lead this campus to new and unexpected heights with 
enormous infusions of corporate money and private gifts and grants, based in 
large part on UCI's potential contributions to high technology. 
</P>
<P>
I was winding down at UCI when all of this started to happen, and I watched it 
almost as if I were outside the whole operation. Enrollment went up 
dramatically, and classrooms were overcrowded. It was impossible to walk 
anywhere on campus without stumbling over construction equipment. New money 
made it possible to lure faculty stars away from other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
But somehow it all -- at least to me -- had the impersonal feeling of an 
aircraft factory that had just landed a big contract and knew its future was 
secure for a long time to come. The rough edges of intellectual ferment were 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it seems to me, UCI is in close consonance with the community in which 
it has finally settled comfortably. There are still some occasional academic 
high jinks that unsettle the community, but instead of being front and center, 
they are lost in the much larger picture of burgeoning technocracy. 
</P>
<P>
If all of this is mildly distressing to an "over-age liberal," blame it on age 
and the times -- and a student body that seems to me mostly inert to social 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
When I asked students in two of my classes what they were feeling after our 
invasion of Grenada in 1983, about half of them didn't even know the invasion 
had taken place. I guess that's when I first realized I should be thinking 
about retirement. I don't expect to be around to watch it when -- and if -- the 
pendulum starts to swing back.

On March 15, 1956, when Jose Quintero took the elevator to the fourth floor of 
the Lowell Hotel in New York City, he was on his way to a meeting that would 
change his life. 
</P>
<P>
He was going to meet Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, the widow of playwright Eugene 
O'Neill, to ask permission for the fledgling Circle in the Square theater in 
Greenwich Village to stage a revival of O'Neill's "The Iceman Cometh." The play 
had premiered on Broadway in 1946 to a disappointing reception -- and none of 
O'Neill's plays had been staged in the United States since. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed all in black, as was her custom, Mrs. O'Neill received Quintero and led 
him to her room. "She almost performed a ritual, a strange ritual, with her 
hats," Quintero, who has been teaching at Cal State Fullerton for the last 
several years, recalled last week. After modeling one hat after another -- all 
of them black -- Mrs. O'Neill asked Quintero's opinion of one in particular. 
"That one is the most beautiful of all," he told her. 
</P>
<P>
It was the hat she had worn for her husband's burial less than 3 years before. 
"That was the reason she gave me the rights to do 'The Iceman Cometh,' " 
Quintero said. "It was almost like passing some kind of test." 
</P>
<P>
Quintero's production of "The Iceman Cometh" was a now-legendary smash, almost 
single-handedly restoring O'Neill's flagging reputation in the United States, 
adding momentum to the burgeoning off-Broadway movement, making a star of a 
young actor named Jason Robards Jr. and setting the stage for the director's 
lifelong love affair with the works of the playwright. 
</P>
<P>
After the success of "The Iceman Cometh," Quintero directed the landmark U.S. 
premiere of "Long Day's Journey Into Night," written in 1941 but not published 
or produced until after O'Neill's death, in accordance with the playwright's 
wishes. In all, Quintero has directed 17 works by O'Neill in 32 years (see box 
on Page 54B), including the Tony-winning production of "Moon for the 
Misbegotten" in 1972 and last year's successful revival of "Long Day's Journey 
Into Night" with longtime Quintero collaborators Robards and Colleen Dewhurst. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero, now 65, believes that fate drove him to his close association with 
O'Neill's works. "I really do think it was a kind of destiny because I cannot 
explain it any other way," he said at his home in the Los Feliz section of Los 
Angeles. "I do not believe in accidents." 
</P>
<P>
The director has explored his connection to O'Neill in a series of writings 
over the years, some of which have been collected in a new small volume called 
"Lines in the Palm of God's Hand." Edited by Cal State Fullerton professors 
Joseph Arnold and John Brugaletta, it is the premiere publication of the new 
South Coast Press, a campus-based outgrowth of the South Coast Poetry Journal 
formed by Brugaletta several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero was on campus in Fullerton on Thursday signing copies of the book and 
meeting with faculty members and students. Next Sunday, he will receive an 
honorary doctorate from Cal State Fullerton. It is only the second honorary 
degree ever conferred by the university. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero has been teaching classes and workshops at Fullerton each spring 
semester since 1984, and he says the school is "the closest institute of 
learning to my heart. I have really enjoyed working there more than I have 
enjoyed working in any school, or even in my own workshops, because I have been 
surrounded by people who have been absolutely most encouraging and wonderful to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
"Lines in the Palm of God's Hand" traces his fascination with O'Neill from his 
brief acquaintance in 1949 with the playwright's son, Eugene O'Neill Jr. (who 
later committed suicide) to a letter Quintero wrote to O'Neill biographer 
Barbara Gelb last year on the 100th anniversary of the playwright's birth. 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian-born director had just scored a huge success with a production 
of Tennessee Williams' "Summer and Smoke" when it was suggested that the Circle 
in the Square revive "The Iceman Cometh" in 1956. At that point "I knew very 
little about (O'Neill)," Quintero recalls. "I had no preparation for O'Neill. I 
had not studied him. I had never read any of his plays before." 
</P>
<P>
He picked up a copy of "Iceman" one evening and read it straight through, 
finishing the long work at daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that he was writing about me. From the beginning, I felt that he was 
writing about the kind of landscape which I understood. I mean, I was one of 
the bums (in the bar at Harry Hope's, the setting of the play). I felt like one 
of the bums, he described me so completely. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In the act of reading that play, I really felt the necessity of doing it, not 
realizing that O'Neill had been relegated to oblivion." 
</P>
<P>
After the success of "The Iceman Cometh," Carlotta Monterey O'Neill called 
Quintero to another meeting, this time to offer him the much-coveted rights to 
the American premiere of "Long Day's Journey Into Night," which had just been 
published. (The play already had been performed in Sweden, where admiration for 
O'Neill had never waned.) 
</P>
<P>
Quintero was so stunned by the offer that, according to his recent 
autobiography, "If You Don't Dance They'll Beat You," he immediately felt ill, 
rushed out of the hotel room and vomited on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
The highly successful 1956 production featured Robards as James Tyrone Jr. In 
the 1988 revival at the Neil Simon Theater in New York, Robards played the 
father, James Tyrone. As Robards' roles changed, so did Quintero's perception 
of the characters. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first did the play... my understanding and perceptions were with the 
boys in the play," Quintero said. "This time, of course, I was the age of the 
parents, and so I understood their particular plight so much more, since I was 
much closer to them than I was to the boys. With the boys, it was like 
remembering my youth, and the parents were my actuality, my reality at that 
very moment. . . . It was like a new experience, a new production to me." 
</P>
<P>
In the last years of his life, O'Neill could no longer write because of a 
severe trembling in his hands. In 1987, Quintero was diagnosed with throat 
cancer, and his vocal chords had to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through a dark period, the period where I thought that I was not going 
to be able to communicate at all," Quintero said. "Because life without 
communicating is unthinkable for me, because I've dedicated my whole life to 
communicating . . . I thought, well, a muted life is death. But it has not 
turned out to be so." 
</P>
<P>
Quintero now speaks with the aid of an electronic device that picks up 
vibrations from his esophagus and amplifies them. His voice sounds mechanical 
and alien, but he can speak -- and work. He directed the "Long Day's Journey" 
revival only months after his operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how I sound, really, as long as I can communicate," he said. "I 
am amazed, and I am really grateful." 
</P>
<P>
He is currently directing each of O'Neill's plays for radio broadcast but says 
he will never again direct O'Neill on the stage. "I've done them all -- at 
least the ones I want to do," Quintero said. 
</P>
<P>
His next directing assignment will take him to London, where he begins 
rehearsals next April. "I am going to do now, for the first time, a play by 
someone that I have loved all my life and have been very fearful to do. And 
that is Chekhov," he said. "This will be my first time, can you imagine? I have 
been terrified with Chekhov and yet I have been in love with him all of my 
life, and now I'll get a chance to do 'The Three Sisters'. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable. I thought I was going to die without ever doing a play of 
Chekhov's, but there you are." 
</P>
<P>
Quintero also continues to write and to teach. He has two workshops each week 
in Los Angeles and will leave in September for 7 weeks at the University of 
Houston and 12 weeks at Florida State. He then will return to teach in Los 
Angeles and at Cal State Fullerton before leaving for London. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is natural that when people get to my age, they need to give to the 
young whatever it is they have learned about their craft or their art," 
Quintero said. "And it is a very necessary, very healthy interchange."

Drawing, COLOR, (COVER) During Orange County's first 100 years, the postcard as 
a means of greeting has remained the same, even as the illustrations depicting 
the county have changed. But the county is embarking on its second 100 years, 
and while we cannot predict the future, we can certainly expect that the face 
of Orange County will continue to change dramatically, as will our means 
(robot-dispatched videotapes?) of saying, "Wish you were here." , Craig
