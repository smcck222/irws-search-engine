BALDWIN PARK HIGH SCHOOL ROOMS DAMAGED BY FIRE; ARSON SUSPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An apparent arson Saturday night at Baldwin Park High School caused $170,000 in 
damages to three classrooms, according to Los Angeles County fire officials, 
who said one of the rooms was ransacked before the blaze was set. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters arrived about 9:20 p.m. to find smoke and flames billowing from 
several windows of a classroom wing of the school at 3900 Puente Ave., about 15 
miles east of downtown Los Angeles, county fire Capt. Darrold Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The building had been ransacked before the fire was started," he said. "There 
were desks knocked over, things like that. It's probable that somebody broke in 
and vandalized the place, then set the fire." 
</P>
<P>
Swanson estimated damage to the structure at $130,000, with an additional 
$40,000 to contents at the school, which has an enrollment of about 3,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
School officials could not be reached for comment Sunday. But fire officials 
said suspicious blazes are becoming more common at high schools in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"From my experience, it doesn't take much provocation to start a fire like 
this, whether it's getting an extra day off for a holiday or just getting a bad 
grade," Swanson said. "But we're 95% sure somebody was trying to make a point 
here."

JUDICIAL CHOICES FOR VARIOUS COURT POSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only one Superior Court seat, Office No. 8, is being contested in Los Angeles 
County, and we strongly urge that the incumbent, Judge Lourdes G. Baird, be 
reelected. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Baird, a former federal prosecutor with wide experience, is one of the 
most outstanding jurists currently sitting on the Superior Court bench. That is 
one reason, among many in her distinguished career, that led President Bush to 
submit her name for Senate confirmation as the new United States attorney for 
Los Angeles. Judge Baird's nomination now is pending before the Judiciary 
Committee. Until it acts and the full Senate votes, which may take some time, 
the people of Los Angeles County will want to retain the services of a jurist 
of proven excellence. 
</P>
<P>
For three of the four contested Municipal Court seats, the decision is equally 
clear. In Office No. 13 of the Los Angeles Municipal Court, for example, the 
incumbent, Judge Emily A. Stevens, is an experienced member of the bar whose 
intelligence, fairness and hard work on the bench have won her the respect not 
only of her judicial colleagues, but also of the prosecuting and defense 
attorneys who appear before her. For those reasons, she has been rated well 
qualified by the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. Her opponent has been rated 
unqualified. We urge that Judge Stevens be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in the Antelope Valley Municipal Court Judicial District No. 1, the 
incumbent, Judge Richard E. Spann, is an experienced, highly respected jurist 
with close ties to the community. He has been rated well- qualified by the bar 
association, while his opponent has been deemed unqualified. Judge Spann should 
be elected to another term. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for the open Downey Judicial District seat, the only candidate 
rated well-qualified by the bar association's rigorous evaluation system is 
Marvin Licker. That, coupled with the experience he has gained as a court 
commissioner, leads us to recommend Licker's election to the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Four candidates rated well-qualified by the association are seeking the open 
Santa Monica Municipal Court Office No. 3. Two of them, labor lawyer David B. 
Finkel, a member of the Santa Monica City Council, and Municipal Court 
Commissioner Norman Perry Tarle, are particularly worthy. Both have outstanding 
records of public service and tough-minded but compassionate notions of how 
judges of the Municipal Court ought to discharge their duties. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tarle's five years of applicable, hands-on experience as a court 
commissioner gives him a slight edge in what is, on the merits, a very close 
race. For that reason, we recommend that Commissioner Norman Perry Tarle be 
elected to Office No. 3.

WHITE HOUSE PLAN ON ANTITRUST LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read in The Times that "The Bush Administration on Monday unveiled its 
long-awaited proposal to loosen antitrust laws so that companies can more 
easily form joint manufacturing ventures" (Part A, May 8). 
</P>
<P>
When the government loosened the restrictions on the savings and loans, it cost 
the taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars that it will take generations to 
pay off. 
</P>
<P>
The hoped-for result will be economic growth and a more advantageous 
competitive position in the world. But do they actually know what the results 
will be? Some experts have a different negative opinion. We can't stand another 
goof like the savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
The economic interests have persuaded the government to ignore other antitrust 
laws which have allowed gigantic monopolistic enterprises to take over 
everything in sight. The result is huge profits by the financiers at the 
expense of the workers who actually produce the wealth, many of whom are thrown 
out of their hard-earned jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The duty of the government is to the welfare of the people. The economic 
trickle-down theory is too roundabout, too uncertain, and too devious.

MAYOR'S ACTION IN SHOPLIFT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As your reporters well know, many days I bite my tongue upon reading the 
morning's news. Much of what I read is a snippet of fact nestled in so much 
speculation and distortion that, even when I directly witnessed or caused the 
event under discussion, I don't recognize the story. 
</P>
<P>
Today, I am having a tougher time than usual biting my tongue. On a Saturday 
afternoon in April, I received a call from one of my executive assistants, Jeff 
Matsui. I learned that a Japanese official was in trouble at the airport, and 
that the trouble had started with a claim of shoplifting. From that moment 
until now, I proceeded to do my job. As the ranking officer in this city with 
responsibility for every constituent, and with particular sensitivity to our 
foreign visitors, I called the airport to learn the circumstances firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
I quickly learned the answers to my questions from the sergeant of the airport 
police. My staffer, who had gone to the airport in response to a call from a 
member of our sister city committee hosting the official, did too. The foreign 
dignitary was in custody for shoplifting. There was no accompanying 
disturbance. He had a lawyer representing him. The parties, the store and the 
visitor, were discussing how they wanted to proceed. The store authorities 
decided that they would drop the matter, not because of any pressure or 
suggestion from me or my representative, but of their own volition. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of my duties, I have often been called upon to make inquiries. 
But in 27 years in elective office, I have never urged anyone not to prosecute 
a criminal case and I didn't in this instance. Should the foreign dignitary 
have been prosecuted? Should the police have placed the man in jail? These were 
not questions for me to address, and if these options are still being 
considered, they still are not for me. But, I'll be damned if I'll stop doing 
my job to make inquiries in appropriate circumstances, no matter how 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
So, for those of you who live, work in or visit this city, please know that if 
you run afoul of the law, you will have to take responsibility for the 
predictable consequences. But if you need me, or simply think you need me, to 
make inquiry about a matter, I'll be there and will not be discouraged or 
intimidated out of fear that some irresponsible reporter may distort the facts 
to suggest that my actions were improper.

Black Americans have a 9% greater risk of developing cancer than whites. The 
five-year survival rate is 25% lower than expected, and the mortality rate is 
30% higher than that for whites. Back when I was in medical school, the figures 
were somewhat reversed. 
</P>
<P>
Just as we need to get the educational process out there on how to avoid AIDS, 
we have to get education out there on how to have Pap smears to avoid cervical 
cancer, how to avoid smoking, how to avoid fat in the diet.

(Minorities) need a special invitation to this information because they don't 
always realize it's for them. There is a tendency to think, "Well, this may 
affect the majority population, but I'm too worried right now putting food on

PERSPECTIVE ON THE TRAFFIC CRUNCH;

<P>
ON A HIGHWAY TO NOWHERE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THE 'SMART-CAR' CONCEPT IS A FARCE THAT WILL INCREASE GAS 
CONSUMPTION AND MAKE OUR ROADS EVEN MORE CONGESTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONNIE D. LIPSCHUTZ and LINDA NASH, Ronnie Lipschutz and Linda Nash are 
associates at the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and 
Security in Berkeley. Both have had substantial experience on the freeways. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is, as Hegel would have noted, an element of farce about the 
Transportation Department's initiative to computerize and automate the nation's 
autos and highways. At a cost of no less than $80,000 per auto, (and the cost 
is sure to increase before the project is completed), 100 cars in Orlando, 
Fla., will be outfitted with computerized dashboard maps. This will 
demonstrate, according to Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, that an 
"array of advanced electronics and communications technology will contribute a 
great deal toward reducing vehicle delay, increasing highway capacity and 
improving highway safety." 
</P>
<P>
The reason that this effort is farce, and not credible research, lies in the 
never-ending search for a "technical fix" to what is essentially a social 
problem: the still-growing mismatch between Americans' living and working 
patterns. Suburban sprawl and auto dependency are the crux of the problem, 
rather than axioms of existence as the auto industry, and Skinner, would have 
us believe. Instead of rethinking our development patterns, rebuilding housing 
in our urban centers and investing in adequate public transit, it is easier to 
turn to the auto industry itself for an answer. Not surprisingly, that answer 
is more, but this time smarter, cars. 
</P>
<P>
Building "smart" cars, it is claimed, will allow a massive increase in the 
carrying capacity of existing highways (doubling or tripling them, according to 
Mobility 2000, a group of transportation experts). Not only will this strategy 
enable the government to avoid expenditures on new highways, it will also make 
it possible to impose much of the cost of the new technology on individuals, 
who will have to buy these "improved" autos (if they can afford them). Of 
course, such a strategy ignores the social and environmental costs of an 
astronomical growth in the number of autos on our highways. All that smart cars 
will really do is make it possible to put off, once again, the politically 
difficult decision to invest in urgently needed regional transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, public transit remains an oxymoron; indeed, the goal of 
the "smart car" project seems to be a major increase in the number of private 
vehicles using the highways, which will only encourage the proliferation of 
housing tracts far from commercial and business centers, creating more highway 
congestion. We might with some profit recall our last technical fix for the 
traffic problem, the freeway-building boom of the 1960s and '70s, as a relevant 
lesson. In the meantime, we have been convinced that to relinquish our autos is 
to relinquish our freedom. Instead, we should consider just how free we really 
are while caught in commuter traffic, forced by housing prices to live in 
communities distant from our workplaces and unable to chose a more comfortable 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Another argument put forth in support of this project has been heard before: 
Foreigners are developing the technology and if we don't, too, they will end up 
selling it to us. While there might be an element of truth in this fear, we 
should ask what we will really gain by investing in a technology that is likely 
to make us consumers of more autos (built by whom?) and more oil (produced by 
whom?). The fact remains that those foreigners (in Japan and Europe) have 
developed efficient public transportation systems and have also imposed 
significant taxes on gasoline consumption, both of which help to reduce auto 
use and consequent environmental damage. As a result, foreigners probably see 
the United States, not their own countries, as a promising market for 
improvements in auto technology. 
</P>
<P>
The "smart car" initiative, as it now stands, is no more than industrial policy 
disguised as social problem-solving. It is a myopic world view that would allow 
us to spend scarce dollars on more autos at a time when, as a nation, we are 
trying to deal with the security threats posed by foreign oil imports and the 
environmental threats posed by global warming, urban smog and domestic oil 
production. We might take a moment the next time we are behind the steering 
wheel to ponder the implicit contradictions in our country's domestic policies.

HIGH CLERICS OF ART HAVE HAD ENOUGH; 
</P>
<P>
FEDERAL SUBSIDIES HAVEN'T RESULTED IN MASTERPIECES, JUST A DRAIN ON THE 
TREASURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE FEIN and EDWIN MEESE III, Bruce Fein, a constitutional lawyer in 
Washington, served as associate attorney general from 1981-82. Former Atty. 
Gen. Edwin Meese III is a distinguished fellow of the Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Endowment for the Arts should be abolished. During its 25-year 
life, NEA's billions in expenditures to subsidize the arts community would have 
yielded a higher return on the taxpayers' investment if they had been dedicated 
to the purchase of defaulted junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The arts community should be embarrassed by its fortissimo howling and arpeggio 
braying for more federal taxpayer dollars. Where are the great artistic 
masterpieces that promise to live for the ages because of NEA financial 
midwifery? Have there been any NEA-funded artists who would do honor to Van 
Gogh, Picasso, Mozart, Rubens, Monet, Beethoven, Voltaire or Shakespeare? Are 
there any NEA-supported gems that have proven themselves in the artistic 
marketplace by commanding acrophobic prices at Southeby or Christie auctions? 
These questions are studiously eschewed by the arts community because the 
answers would be unflattering. 
</P>
<P>
The arts community tacitly contends that the American public is too Philistine 
to recognize artistic virtuosity and to offer voluntary monetary support. Thus, 
it is condescendingly implied, NEA funds are required to overcome the artistic 
backwardness of the typical federal taxpayer that warps the working of the arts 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
That arrogance echoes every special interest lobby in America clamoring for 
government protection against free consumer choice and free-market appraisals 
of their goods or services. It epitomizes cultural elitism that refuses to 
contemplate that what is wanting in America's art life is not an enlightened 
citizenry but better art. Are taxpayers to be scolded for failing to perceive 
the terpsichorean vulgarities of Annie Sprinkle as a species of the Bolshoi 
Ballet, or the photograph of a crucifix immersed in a vat of urine as a sister 
of Van Gogh's "Irises"? 
</P>
<P>
Many artists toil in austere ateliers because their lives acquire rich meaning 
through artistic expression. They deserve community respect for the sincerity 
of their artistic convictions, to which their frugal circumstances testify. But 
what should be thought of an artist whose devotion is contingent on feasting 
off taxpayer dollars? He is like the high clerics during the Middle Ages who, 
after pledging poverty, chastity and obedience, demanded the rights to sell 
indulgences and ecclesiastical offices to support mistresses and military 
conquests. Genuine artists are made of sterner stuff. 
</P>
<P>
NEA might be justified if its mission were transformed into a first cousin of 
education. Suppose all of its funds were earmarked to promote the display and 
understanding of acknowledged artistic accomplishment. That mission would 
advance the government goal of public tutelage to strengthen community reason 
and reflection, twin pillars of enlightened democracies. But, at present, such 
NEA expenditures would be extravagant. 
</P>
<P>
Every surplus dollar is urgently needed to underwrite earthbound basic 
education. More than 25% of contemporary Americans are unaware that the Earth 
orbits the sun. Scholastic Aptitude Test scores are abysmal. Occupants of high 
office routinely mistake the Declaration of Independence for the United States 
Constitution in official debate. Most college graduates would display 
bewilderment if asked to elaborate the differences between the Ottoman Empire 
and the Holy Roman Empire, or to recount the contributions to America of 
Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. DuBois, Paul Robeson or 
Langston Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, federal taxpayer funding of arts education when the basic sinews of 
education are atrophying is like giving chocolate cheesecake to a community 
starving for protein nourishment. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the strength, boldness and resiliency of the arts community as a 
critic of government and society is endangered by NEA funding. Human nature 
inclines most NEA grantees to feel a loyalty obligation to their paymaster -- 
and their laudable role as independent commentators, observers and appraisers 
of American life suffers. 
</P>
<P>
NEA's mad drilling for more than two decades to discover artistic genius has 
produced nothing but dry holes. Nothing in the geology of the arts community 
offers hope for a more auspicious NEA future. Chairman John Frohnmayer shows no 
glitter as a talent scout for fledgling genius. Hasn't the time come to declare 
NEA bankrupt and mercifully end the spoliation of the American taxpayer?

PERSPECTIVE ON THE TRAFFIC CRUNCH; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN IS A BODY NOT A PASSENGER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. RICHARD BANKS, R. Richard Banks lives in the Bay Area.

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first half-hour of a recent Saturday that I reluctantly spent in 
school, our instructor attempted to persuade my fellow students that the class 
was not about how "to beat tickets and the system." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to traffic school. I attended an eight-hour session sponsored by the 
National Traffic Safety Institute, whose stated goal in the course was to 
"improve driving habits through changing student attitudes about driving." 
</P>
<P>
The cast of characters ranged from a grandfatherly man who obviously felt out 
of place and embarrassed ("This is my first ticket in 18 years.") to a young 
woman who felt blessed to have been allowed by the judge to attend traffic 
school ("I thought he'd suspend my license."). More interested in keeping our 
insurance rates low with a clean driving record than in expanding our awareness 
about how our attitudes effect our driving, we were not the most enthusiastic 
group of students. Some expressed forthrightly their belief that the class is 
punishment, prison time that must be served to salvage a Department of Motor 
Vehicles record. Our minds were clearly not oriented to learning. 
</P>
<P>
But learn I did, more than I expected, though perhaps not what the instructor 
had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
I learned that although I've had some ticketing experiences I'd rather not 
repeat, other people have experienced worse. One woman, a mother of two, 
received a ticket as she pulled into the driveway of her son's school. Before 
50 wide-eyed and mouth-dropped-in-disbelief kindergarteners, the officer wrote 
her a ticket for failing to come to a complete stop at the stop sign one block 
up the street. Her twin sons both cried, thinking their mother was on her way 
to jail with all the other criminals. 
</P>
<P>
I learned about the perils of going too slow, even if you're legally speeding. 
If you go 60 m.p.h. in the fast lane you can still be ticketed for impeding the 
flow of traffic. I learned ways of explaining to the police why one is driving 
alone in the diamond lane, which is only for car pools. 
</P>
<P>
Some people made their daily commute with a mannequin in the passenger seat and 
explained that they didn't realize the passenger had to be a real person. 
Others simply put a hat on the dog. A strained claim to car-pooling was made by 
a pregnant woman who said she was "driving for two." Then there's the story of 
the mortician who counted as his passenger the corpse in the back of his 
hearse. He noted to the officer that he did have two people in his car. As he 
wrote the ticket, the officer explained that a corpse is no longer a person but 
rather a body, which cannot count as a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the class's most interesting segments, the instructor tackled the 
myth of speeding as a time-saver. Using a chart that showed the travel time 
between two points at different speeds, the instructor explained that going 5 
m.p.h. or 10 m.p.h. faster saves a negligible amount of time, even if you're 
traveling 30 miles. 
</P>
<P>
On a 10-mile trip to work, for example, it's nearly impossible to save even one 
minute. The moral of the story, according to our instructor, is that if you're 
late, you're late; accept it and stop increasing your chances of accidental 
death or injury by playing beat-the-clock. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip back to San Francisco from Portland, I thought about that 
time-speed relationship. Going 5 m.p.h. faster might not save time but going 85 
m.p.h. could cut three hours from what would be a 12-hour trip. So, anxious to 
get back home, that's what I did. 
</P>
<P>
As I said, I learned a lot in traffic school.

HIRMEZ PLAYS TOUGH OFFENSE AND DEFENSE; SOCKERS BEAT DALLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone will remember Waad Hirmez's goal on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone will probably remember that he scored it with his bum leg. 
</P>
<P>
What few will remember is that Hirmez was on the other end of the carpet a 
little more than two minutes later, preventing the Dallas Sidekicks from 
re-tying the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers wound up defeating the Sidekicks, 4-2, before 6,422 in the San 
Diego Sports Arena, tying the best-of-seven Western Division finals at two 
games apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas climbed back from a 2-0 deficit to tie the game early in the third 
quarter following goals by forwards Tatu and Eloy Salgado. Four minutes and 44 
seconds into the fourth quarter, Hirmez slipped by two Sidekick defenders to 
take a soft pass from Cacho and send a 25-footer into the left corner. 
Premature as it was, a celebration ensued. 
</P>
<P>
But Dallas was far from dead. And that's where Hirmez played a role that is 
generally uncharacteristic of him. Suddenly, he was a goalie. 
</P>
<P>
What happened, there was a tussle in front of the Sockers' goal and goalie 
Zoltan Toth partially deflected a shot that began to roll toward the goal line. 
Everybody watched for a split second. Hirmez made a couple of quick steps, 
caught the ball about 16 inches before it reached the line and sent it up field 
to kill the threat. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tiny piece of a huge victory, one that kept the Sockers from being a 
game from elimination. And realistically, one that kept the Sockers in this 
series. Winning three in a row with the final two games in Dallas would have 
been highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez dismissed his defensive play fairly simply, saying: "You gotta play on 
both ends of the field." 
</P>
<P>
But Hirmez is a player who has often been criticized for paying too much 
attention to offense and not enough to defense. He is known for scoring goals, 
not preventing them. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't even sure he would be able to play in this game after he strained his 
hamstring during the Sockers' 4-1 loss in Game 3 Friday. After taking a few 
shots before the game, he decided to give it a whirl. The result was 
satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great shot," midfielder Brian Quinn said. "He hit it real quick." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman figured Hirmez owed him a goal. It was Hirmez who 
allowed Tatu to cut into the box and score the Sidekicks' first goal 1:17 
before halftime. At that point, momentum the Sockers had gained from previous 
goals by forward Jim Gabarra and defender George Fernandez was erased. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt terrible about it," Newman said, "so I knew he wanted to make up for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Gabarra made his shot from 25 feet off Paul Wright's pass, drilling it into the 
upper left corner late in the first quarter. Fernandez scored on a Sidekick 
power play, taking a pass from Wright, who advanced the ball through a host of 
Dallas defenders and tapped his pass into the box. It glanced off Beto's foot 
and Fernandez turned and sent it into the right corner. 
</P>
<P>
Funny how the Sockers do things. They blew two power play opportunities of 
their own, breaking a team record for 14 in a row without a goal and then 
scored when the Sidekicks had a man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas went to a sixth attacker with 2:16 remaining and had several 
opportunities that were ultimately foiled by Toth. Forward Wes Wade took a long 
pass from Fernandez and scored an empty-net goal with 20 seconds to play to 
seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, this victory proved that the Sockers have a struggle ahead 
of them if they are to advance to the championship series. The Sidekicks came 
within a crossbar here and a goal post there of winning, despite the fact that 
the Sockers outplayed them through much of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we did so well, especially in the first half," Newman said. "And 
then you look up at the scoreboard and it's 2-2 or 2-1. It just isn't right. I 
thought 'How can it be?' " 
</P>
<P>
One explanation is that Dallas had more opportunities. The Sidekicks out shot 
the Sockers 31-23 and Toth (4-1) made 16 saves to just seven by Sidekick goalie 
Krys Sobieski. 
</P>
<P>
That the Sockers held steady after the Sidekicks' comeback was an indication 
that they have matured since the regular season. This is a team that has blown 
its share of leads and often gone on to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"We deserved to win (Sunday)," Quinn said. "We didn't lose any intensity when 
they got to 2-2. We kept playing. Sometimes we back off." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Sockers remain as hard to figure out as ever. Nobody has any idea 
what lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know," Quinn said. "In the past every time this team has been asked 
to come back we've done it. I just think this team has been more unpredictable 
than in past years."

LEFFERTS ICES THE METS WITH SAVE FOR PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The ice had turned his shoulder red, and now it was wrapping Craig Lefferts' 
left elbow, getting rid of all those fastballs and sliders that spend their 
postgames in a pitcher's arm and make it tender. 
</P>
<P>
There was the usual talk of confidence and intensity, talk that normally 
follows a close victory such as the Padres' 3-1 workmanlike effort over the New 
York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts was a man who came in and did his job, he said, downplaying the part 
of Sunday's job description that required him to pull the Padres out of a 
bases-loaded situation in the eighth with just one out and the Mets two runs 
back. 
</P>
<P>
No, he said, he didn't feel any pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Just me and the ball and the catcher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Experience, confidence, knowing the hitters . . . that's why he wasn't worried, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've pitched close to 500 games (actually, 483)," he said. "I've done it so 
much, I always have a high confidence level." 
</P>
<P>
He pitched to five simple batters, two in particular in a not-so-simple 
situation in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
That's when he came on, and talk about no room for error: One out, three Mets 
on base and 25,233 spectators edging up in their seats at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. The Padres led, 3-1, but they were slowly letting things slip away. 
</P>
<P>
Weren't they? 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rasmussen started and went 6 1/3 innings, putting the Padres in position 
to win. He left with the Padres ahead, 1-0, and a runner on second. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Greg Harris came on and left them in a delicate situation. He gave up two 
singles in the seventh, allowing the Mets to tie. The Padres went out and 
picked up two in the bottom of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Into the eighth they went and, suddenly, Harris was in trouble. He walked Kevin 
McReynolds. He got Darryl Strawberry to fly to left, but then he hit Mike 
Marshall with a pitch. Then he walked Kevin Elster. 
</P>
<P>
Bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
And here came Lefferts, a man who had pitched just twice in 13 days, sprinting 
in from the left field bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
He struck out pinch-hitter Mark Carreon. 
</P>
<P>
He struck out pinch-hitter Mackey Sasser. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the ninth, he set down the Mets one-two-three. 
</P>
<P>
"Lefferts came in and did his job," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "I'd like 
to get the lead more often so we could go to him. We haven't had many leads." 
</P>
<P>
No. The Padres played their 37th game Sunday. Lefferts made just his third 
appearance in 15 days -- 11th overall -- but got just his sixth save 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Limited duty, sure, but what a job he has done in those six opportunities. He 
blew one opportunity, surrendering a game-losing, ninth-inning homer to Shawon 
Dunston in Chicago a couple of weeks ago. He saved the other five games. 
</P>
<P>
And look at the numbers: Sunday's was the third bases-loaded situation Lefferts 
has worked out of this season. He has inherited 15 runners left on base by 
other Padre pitchers, and he has allowed just two of those to score. None of 
the last 11 have crossed home plate. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I take pride in is the inherited runners," Lefferts said. "Coming in 
with other pitcher's runners on base and making sure they don't score. That's a 
situation I get psyched up for." 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon: "He has a lot more confidence and probably a better idea of 
pitching than when he was with us in '84. He's much tougher out there. Of 
course, 1984 was the first year he was with us, and the experience has really 
benefited him. You can pretty much feel he's going to throw strikes when he 
gets a chance to come in." 
</P>
<P>
He went 2-2 on Carreon and 1-2 on Sasser before striking them out. Sasser's 
strikeout came after a long foul ball down the right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think he had that good of stuff," Sasser said. "I just missed the 
pitch. I think I caught myself guessing. I was looking for something out over 
the plate, and he threw me something up and in. I just swang right through it." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, five Mets faced Lefferts, and none could hit him. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, he got Gregg Jefferies to fly to left, Daryl Boston to fly to 
center and Howard Johnson to ground to the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tough afternoon for Johnson. He was one for five with two strikeouts, 
and it was his base-running error in the first that cost the Mets a chance to 
get an early run off Rasmussen. He was on first with two out and tried to score 
on McReynolds' single down the right-field line. Tony Gwynn's throw to the 
plate beat Johnson by at least 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I sent him and he stopped," said Met third-base coach Bud Harrelson. "I 
confused him or something." 
</P>
<P>
Harris (3-0) got the victory, despite giving up a run-scoring single to 
pinch-hitter Dave Magadan in the seventh and loading the bases in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably need to pay Lefty half of my paycheck," Harris said. "He did a 
great job. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I hate most about today was that Raz didn't get the win. I didn't 
deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre pitching coach Pat Dobson: "It was his pitch selection more than 
anything else. He walked McReynolds on five fastballs, then threw four 
fastballs to Strawberry until he threw a breaking ball. When you're not getting 
your fastball over, your first pitch to the next batter should be a breaking 
ball. Maybe you can throw one of your other pitches for strikes." 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen finished with a season-high six strikeouts, and allowed a run and 
five hits in 6 1/3 innings. He walked three. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been scuffling," Rasmussen said. "I kept the team in the game and didn't 
give up any home runs. Hopefully, we won't forget how we did this today." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres got their first run in the second, when Garry Templeton's single to 
left drove in Shawn Abner. They got two more in the seventh, when Mike 
Pagliarulo and Phil Stephenson scored on Roberto Alomar's two-out single to 
right off reliever Ron Darling. 
</P>
<P>
Darling was making just his second appearance out of the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"My confidence (in Darling) is waning at this point," Met Manager Davey Johnson 
said. "He's been a winning pitcher for me and has thrived in situations like 
today. This basically leaves him behind some of my other relievers until I can 
get some decent outings from him." 
</P>
<P>
Darling said he got a sinker to Alomar down and in. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked to have had it more outside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Alomar: "I've been hitting the ball good. That's why they put me in the 
three spot (in the batting order), to drive some people in. That's what I've 
been doing lately." 
</P>
<P>
Alomar has eight runs-batted in in his last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts suffered a strained left hamstring in the first inning when he 
stumbled over his bat getting out of the batter's box after grounding to 
shortstop. The Padres said it doesn't appear serious and are listing him as 
day-to-day. . . . Padre Manager Jack McKeon said first baseman Jack Clark will 
accompany the team on its nine-game swing through Montreal, New York and 
Philadelphia. Clark, who has been out with a lower back strain, is eligible to 
come off the disabled list today, but McKeon said the earliest Clark may play 
is when the Padres are in New York May 24-27. McKeon plans to keep him off the 
artificial turf in Montreal (May 22-23) and Philadelphia (May 28-30). Said 
Clark: "It's one of the more painful injuries I've had. Operations don't hurt 
as bad a lot of times." Clark said he will be lying down on the airplane today 
to Montreal. "It's a long flight, and a long day with customs and the drive to 
the hotel," he said. "I'll just be glad to get there." . . . Outfielder Shawn 
Abner was ejected after being pulled from the game during a double-switch in 
the seventh, during which Greg Harris replaced Dennis Rasmussen on the mound. 
He was still angry over his at-bat in the sixth, when he was: a) Called out on 
strikes and, b) Called for interfering with Met catcher Todd Hundley's throw to 
second on Joe Carter's steal attempt. Because of the interference, Carter was 
called out. Abner was ejected by home plate umpire Ed Montague when he said a 
few words on his way in from left field as Greg Harris was warming up. . . . 
Tony Gwynn's third-inning single extended his hitting streak to 11 games.

BRUINS STRIKE FIRST, PUT BROOMS BACK IN OILERS' CLOSET, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The brooms were out in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
The fans started chanting, "Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!" on Saturday afternoon at the 
airport where they greeted the Oilers upon their return from Boston after they 
won the first two games of the best-of-seven Stanley Cup Finals. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, the local newspapers carried stories discussing the prospect of a 
sweep of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins knew that the chant would be deafening in Game 3 at Northlands 
Coliseum Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
They knew they would have act quickly and dramatically to change the emotional 
tide that threatened to sweep them out of the series. 
</P>
<P>
Would you believe 10 seconds? 
</P>
<P>
That's all it took for John Byce to score and spark Boston to a 2-1 victory in 
Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
Game 4 will be played at Northlands Coliseum Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the sellout crowd of 17,503 hadn't even found their seats when 
Edmonton's Kevin Lowe won the opening faceoff from Byce, only to lose the puck 
to Cam Neely on the left side. 
</P>
<P>
Neely fired from there, but the shot was blocked by goalie Bill Ranford. 
However, it bounced back into the slot in front of Byce. 
</P>
<P>
With Ranford out of position after the block, the entire right side of the net 
was open. Byce put the puck in. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than six weeks ago, Byce was helping the University of Wisconsin 
win an NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
Five weeks ago, he was appearing in his first NHL game. After signing with 
Boston, Byce made his league debut in Game 6 of the Bruins' opening playoff 
series against the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
In all, he appeared in five games before being relegated to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
And there he sat, through the final two games against the Montreal Canadiens, 
the four-sweep of the Washington Capitals and the first two games of this 
series. 
</P>
<P>
But with center Dave Poulin sidelined because of a sprained knee, Boston Coach 
Mike Milbury decided to take a chance and start Byce on a line with Neely and 
Craig Janney. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a noted goal scorer at the college level," Milbury said. "That doesn't 
necessarily make it at the NHL level. But with the injury, he was the logical 
choice to go to." 
</P>
<P>
Byce's goal tied the record for quickest in a Stanley Cup final. The last time 
these teams met in the finals, two years ago, Glenn Anderson scored 10 seconds 
into the game at Boston Garden that wound up tied when a power failure ended 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty excited about it," Byce said of his chance to start. "You hope 
that guys don't get hurt, but you know that happens sometimes in hockey. I've 
been practicing every day, preparing for something like this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Boston's second goal Sunday came from another unlikely source. 
</P>
<P>
Wing Greg Johnston had only made two previous appearances for Boston in the 
playoffs. But he was playing during the first period when Randy Burridge took 
the puck off the boards on the left side and sent it to Johnston in the left 
circle. From there, Johnston lofted it over Ranford at the 15:04 mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, after failing to get ahead of Edmonton since the opening faceoff of 
this series, finally had a lead to hang on to. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers had only 15 shots on goal in the first two periods, but had 14 in 
the third. They broke through at 5:54 on a power play. 
</P>
<P>
Jari Kurri passed to Esa Tikkanen in the slot. Boston's Bob Carpenter had a 
chance to break up the pass, but fanned. 
</P>
<P>
Tikkanen didn't, putting the puck between goalie Andy Moog's pads from about 35 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
It was the only bad moment for Moog, who faced 29 shots after taking heavy 
criticism for letting the first two games get away. 
</P>
<P>
He was the losing goalie in Game 1, the triple-overtime marathon. And he was 
pulled in the second period of Game 2 after giving up three goals on four 
shots. Edmonton went on to win, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really felt frustration," the former Oiler insisted. "I felt I never 
really had the chance to do my job in Game 2 because of the lack of shots. I 
was yanked. You have to work to feel like you're doing your job out there and I 
was standing around for most of the game." 
</P>
<P>
His job Sunday was made more difficult in the final period when the Bruins 
turned conservative, getting two shots on goal in a period that seemed to be 
played mostly in their zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a little bit too cautious," Milbury said. "We didn't make any plays. I 
think we were fortunate to get the goaltending that we got, in order to get us 
through that fall-back period." 
</P>
<P>
It was a game the Bruins have been awaiting for a long time. Having been swept 
by the Oilers two years ago, they had lost six in a row in the finals to 
Edmonton, hadn't won a game in the finals in 12 years and hadn't won on the 
road in the finals in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Cup Note 
</P>
<P>
The fastest goal ever in an NHL playoff game was scored by the Kings' Don Kozak 
six seconds into a 1977 game against Boston.

BARNES MOVES CENTER STAGE TO GET RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD: TRUE TO HIS WORD, HE BREAKS WORLD SHOTPUT MARK ON HIS SECOND 
TRY WITH A THROW OF 75-10 1/4.

<P>
Sometimes when the stage is set for a world record performance, the show 
doesn't live up to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Barnes was concerned that the setting was too perfect for him to break 
the world record in the shotput Sunday at Jack in the Box Invitational at 
UCLA's Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he did it on his second attempt, a throw of 75 feet 10 1/4 inches, 
breaking the world record of 75-8 set by East Germany's Ulf Timmermann in 1988. 
Barnes earned $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the press that was here and the coverage, the balloons and the money, 
you knew that the timing was right," Barnes said. "But I figured everything was 
too perfect right now. I figured the pressure would be too great, or something 
would happen to screw it up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not usually cynical like that, but it happened like it should. Everything 
was right and I was ready." 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Barnes, 23, break the world record, his series was the best ever: 
71-10, 75-10 1/4, 73-11 3/4, 73-7 1/2, 73-3 1/2 and 74-8 1/4 -- an average of 
73-10 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said he had his best opening throw. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with the attention of the announced crowd of 5,672 centering on the 
shotput ring, with balloons bordering the area and a massive sign reading 
"75-8" planted in the landing zone, Barnes responded on his second try. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-pound ball kicked up dirt near the wooden barrier at the end of the 
landing area that is estimated at 80 feet from the throwing ring. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was farther than it was," Barnes said, "but I didn't want to get 
too excited too fast." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes had said earlier in the week that he was ready to set a world record, 
putting some pressure on himself. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he had a "mind-blowing" throw while practicing at Fallbrook High. 
He wouldn't reveal the distance at the time, but he said Sunday that his 
practice throw, even though he fouled doing it, was measured at 79-2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
As for his world record, Barnes said: "It didn't feel like a dream throw. 
Technically, it wasn't perfect. The release wasn't as solid as I have felt in 
the past. I truly believe there was a chance to go farther. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so good. Usually my big ones come on my last throw, and I don't have 
time to really enjoy them. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of me wanted to pack it in, to enjoy the throw. Then I realized, 'Don't 
cut yourself short.' My training has been so phenomenal that I wanted to jump 
on every throw I could. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have that 79-2 looming over my head, so I know that there's more. I 
want to take time to enjoy this, but I want to keep pushing for it. I have too 
much work under my belt." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes also broke the pending American record of 73-10 3/4, set by John Brenner 
in 1987; and surpassed the 75-foot throw by Brian Oldfield in 1975. That was an 
unofficial world and American record but wasn't sanctioned because Oldfield was 
a professional. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian has always been the best in my mind, so it feels like quite an 
accomplishment to surpass his mark," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes isn't sure what he is going to do with his $50,000 bonus, out of which 
he will repay the $5,200 meet officials spent on insurance against a world 
record. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm building a house in West Virginia, maybe I can use it on that, or check 
out a car," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said he felt like a caged lion while sitting in his hotel room Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"You know you're ready and you're not doing anything," he said. "You're just 
sitting there burning energy and wondering whether you had one too many 
practice throws. You want to get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
Other noteworthy performances Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roger Kingdom, the world record-holder and two-time Olympic gold medalist, 
won the 110-meter hurdles in 13.37 seconds in his 1990 outdoor debut. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joe Falcon, a former Arkansas star, pulled away from the field with 600 
yards left in the mile and won in 3:56.22. Steve Scott, the American 
record-holder, was second in 3:57.32. 
</P>
<P>
 -- PattiSue Plumer won the women's mile in 4:29.54. Romania's Paula Ivan, the 
world record-holder and 1988 Olympic 1,500-meter gold medalist at Seoul, was a 
struggling fifth in 4:38.56. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Danny Everett, a former UCLA star, won the 400 meters in 44.72 and was 
timed in 45 flat for 440 yards, short of the world record of 44.5 set by John 
Smith, now a UCLA assistant track coach, in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
Randy Barnes had a warmup throw Sunday of about 77 feet. His world record was 
the third set in the invitational meet. Others were Renaldo Nehemiah, 110-meter 
high hurdles, 13.00, 1979; and Tom Petranoff, javelin, 327-2, 1983. . . . Roger 
Kingdom was asked about a possible challenge from Tony Dees this year. Dees ran 
a wind-aided 13.09 in the 110-meter high hurdles at the recent Modesto 
Invitational. "I'm still No. 1-ranked in the world and the world record-holder. 
He has to come after me", Kingdom said. . . . Joe Falcon, who won the mile, 
said his goal is to be ranked No. 1 in the United States in the 1,500 meters 
this year. He was ranked No. 3 in 1989. "I skipped the TAC (Athletics Congress) 
meet last year and that was a mistake,"he said. "I won't do it this year." . . 
. Danny Everett said his goal this year is to break 44 seconds in the 400 and 
20 seconds in the 200.

SUNS HOPE TO SHINE IN PORTLAND;

WESTERN CONFERENCE: PHOENIX, UNFAZED WITHOUT THE HOME-COURT ADVANTAGE AGAINST 
UTAH AND LAKERS, HITS THE ROAD AGAIN.

<P>
Sun worshipers not only recognize this scenario, but might embrace it: Their 
Phoenix Suns, underdogs without home-court advantage, open a playoff series in 
a hostile environment where they have lost 20 consecutive games dating to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Only this time, no one is saying the Suns have no chance to beat the Portland 
Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals, not after what they did to the 
Lakers after facing similar obstacles in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, because they eliminated the Lakers in a dominating manner and have had 
nearly a week to prepare, the Suns' underdog status is waning going into Game 1 
tonight at 7 at Portland's Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Adelman, the Trail Blazers' coach, is concerned about lack of preparation 
time and about how tired his players are after needing overtime of a seventh 
game to eliminate the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Adelman says he is concerned about maintaining the home-court advantage 
by winning tonight's series opener. He saw the Suns-Lakers series as a 
cautionary tale. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can hold our serve in the first game, I think we'll be on track," 
Adelman said. "(Game 1) is my biggest worry. The Suns went into L.A. and won 
the first game. I think the first game of this series is the most important 
one." 
</P>
<P>
At least, until Game 2 on Wednesday night at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Portland showed the importance of the home-court advantage by beating the Spurs 
in all four home games, losing all three in San Antonio. Phoenix, however, has 
proven that it isn't that important by winning twice in Utah in the first round 
and twice at the Forum against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a great series, maybe even going seven games," Trail Blazer 
guard Terry Porter said. "If it does, we've got to win all our home games like 
we did against San Antonio. This is going to be tough, because Phoenix is 
playing good ball." 
</P>
<P>
Adelman said watching videotape of Kevin Johnson's performance against the 
Lakers was "horrifying," but he said his team was able to control Johnson at 
times during the regular season. Adelman said Porter will guard Johnson -- 
sometimes with double-teaming and trapping, sometimes not. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give him different looks," Adelman said. "You can't let him 
penetrate like he did against the Lakers. But they have to defend us, too."

NEWSWIRE: BOREDOM BECOMES RACING BLISS FOR EARNHARDT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dale Earnhardt's start-to-finish victory Sunday at Charlotte (N.C.) Motor 
Speedway in The Winston pleased him with its boredom. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of race I wanted to win," he said after dominating the field 
in NASCAR's all-star event. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no question who was best out there today. We won it without any 
controversy. There's no mad race fans out there because their guy got knocked 
out." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to controversial Winston finishes last year and in 1987, the 
first time Earnhardt won the event. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory that capped a $325,000 Earnhardt weekend that was NASCAR'S 
richest ever, he became the first two-time winner of The Winston, which dates 
to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
He also is the first to win the race from the pole and averaged 163.001 m.p.h. 
for the 70-lap, 105-mile event that was run in two parts -- a 50-lap segment 
followed by a 10-minute rest and a 20-lap sprint.

<P>
IT'S NO FUN DEALING WITH TRADER GEORGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Dave Winfield left the Yankees, he left no Biblical allusion unturned, 
completing an ascent that took him from hell through limbo to, finally, the 
company of Angels. 
</P>
<P>
To get him, Angel vice president Mike Port didn't have to make a deal with the 
devil, just George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Port is planning to file a grievance with Commissioner Fay Vincent over 
Steinbrenner's involvement in the Winfield trade. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Just because the trade was announced on a Friday, Mike Witt was in a Yankee 
uniform on Sunday and Winfield didn't receive his trade notification papers 
until Tuesday? 
</P>
<P>
Just because Steinbrenner failed to pay Winfield $100,000 in back bonuses, 
hoping, perhaps, that the Angels would pick up the tab? 
</P>
<P>
Just because Steinbrenner publicly criticized Yankee vice president George 
Bradley for making the trade against his wishes, braying ever so loudly that he 
wanted Winfield back? 
</P>
<P>
Just because Steinbrenner met with Winfield behind closed doors and promised 
him his starting job back if Winfield decided to stay in New York? 
</P>
<P>
Just because Steinbrenner tried to talk Port into accepting either center 
fielder Roberto Kelly or shortstop Alvaro Espinoza instead of Winfield? 
</P>
<P>
After six days of slogging through the mud and the mire, the meddling and the 
muddling, the Angels finally got Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
They also got hit with the bill: $9.1 million, including a one-year contract 
extension plus two option years. 
</P>
<P>
Think the Angels might have gotten off more cheaply if Steinbrenner had given 
his ego the week off, or at least received more attention when he was a child? 
</P>
<P>
The Angels think so. 
</P>
<P>
It's tough to place the blame on this one. Do you fault Steinbrenner simply for 
being Steinbrenner? Or do you fault the Angels, who simply should have known 
better? 
</P>
<P>
The Angels must have been lulled by the tidiness of their most recent dealings 
with the Yankees. Luis Polonia for Claudell Washington and a minor league 
pitcher. No fuss, no muss, and thank you, George, for taking one big headache 
off our hands. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield, though, was going to be different. Too much was at stake. Too many 
tabloids dangled too many headlines. George had to have the last word. 
</P>
<P>
And the first one. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees announced the trade before the Angels, with obvious loose ends 
still showing, which steamed Port. So did the fallout, which had Winfield 
balking and Steinbrenner talking and the Angels grimacing through six days of 
national embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
This is standard Steinbrenner operating procedure: Slash, burn and damage 
control. Act first, think next, alibi later. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner spent a decade debasing Winfield, who might have been 
Steinbrenner's best player, depending on how you feel about Don Mattingly. He 
insulted Winfield. He humiliated Winfield. He sued Winfield. Then he trades 
Winfield and the public reaction waylays Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Steinbrenner loves Winfield. Bradley is the culprit, Steinbrenner 
says. Never should have traded him. Bucky Dent is the accomplice, Steinbrenner 
says. Never should have platooned him. 
</P>
<P>
When Winfield invoked his 10-5 privileges and said he wouldn't go, Steinbrenner 
had six glorious days to grandstand. On Monday, he called Winfield in for a 
meeting -- and accidentally forgot not to tell the newspapers about it. On 
Tuesday, he hung Winfield's old No. 31 in his old Yankee Stadium locker stall 
-- and told Dave not to be a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, Winfield's name graced the Angels' 40-man roster. Whose player 
was he? If he was the Angels', as Port contends, Steinbrenner is in for an 
education. 
</P>
<P>
George, can you say tampering? 
</P>
<P>
In the end, just desserts were distributed. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels got Winfield, who finally gives this rudderless team the superstar 
presence -- both on and off the field -- it has lacked since Don Baylor left in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield got his money, which won't buy him peace of mind, but maybe a piece of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
And Steinbrenner got Witt, a perfect pairing if there ever was one. During the 
spring, Steinbrenner swore that Witt would never be a Yankee because he didn't 
have "the makeup" to pitch in New York. Now, he swears he never said that. 
</P>
<P>
And, by the way, how is Witt fitting in? As well as always. On his first day as 
a Yankee, Witt met the press, refused to shake hands with one writer, asked 
another, "Who are you, anyway?" and soon drove them all off with his usual 
array of scripted, cryptic answers. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Mattingly had to take Witt aside for a short lecture on proper 
media relations. That should have been done years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Steinbrenner is as beloved as ever in New York. Last week, David 
Letterman put a new spin on the old joke and announced "results" of a Late 
Night opinion poll on the Yankee owner. The findings: 
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent say Steinbrenner stinks. Twenty percent say Steinbrenner really 
stinks. 
</P>
<P>
If the Angels weren't consulted, they're expected to lodge their vote with the 
commissioner's office any day now.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
EDGAR MARTINEZ ALSO GETS KEY HITS FOR SEATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 20, Ken Griffey Jr. has already experienced much success at the major league 
level. His Seattle teammate, Edgar Martinez, 27, has had a difficult time even 
making it in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey and Martinez both had big games Sunday at Cleveland to lead the 
Mariners to an 8-7 victory in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
They both hit two home runs. Martinez hit his second of the game and fifth of 
the season after Griffey singled in the 10th, and it gave Seattle a big enough 
lead so that Sandy Alomar's homer in the bottom of the inning left the Indians 
a run short. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez also tripled and singled in five at-bats to raise his average to .358. 
Griffey, who has nine home runs, raised his league-leading average to .375. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a struggle for Martinez, a third baseman. He began his pro career 
at Class-A Bellingham, Wash., in 1983. This is his fourth attempt to become a 
regular for the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago he made four errors in one game to tie an American League record 
shared by 21 other third basemen. He had the sympathy of his manager, Jim 
Lefebvre, who performed the same feat at third when he played for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 5, Oakland 2 -- Chris Bosio pitched a four-hitter at Milwaukee and 
the Athletics lost for the sixth time in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Athletics still lead the West by 2 1/2 games, they have lost their 
aura of invincibility. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Parker, who played a major role in the Athletics' drive to the world 
championship last season, delivered the big hit in the five-run fourth that 
broke it open. He drove in two runs with a bases-loaded single. 
</P>
<P>
Bosio was 3-0 in five April starts with a 1.39 earned-run average, but went 
into this game with an 0-2 record and a 4.09 ERA in three May starts. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa was ejected for the first time this season in the 
fourth inning. La Russa was tossed by home plate umpire Jim Joyce for arguing 
ball and strike calls. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers lead the East by 2 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 3, Chicago 2 -- Cecil Fielder, who hit his 16th home run in the fourth 
inning, singled in the 10th to set up the winning run at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder's single put Dave Bergman on second with two out and Lloyd Moseby sent 
Bergman home with a single. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have won six in a row, including three to sweep the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Henneman pitched a hitless 10th to earn his 10th save in 11 chances. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 5, Boston 4 -- Oakland's skid has enabled the Twins to move to within 
four games of first place in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Hrbek hit the right-field foul pole, just 302 feet away in Fenway Park, 
for a two-run home run in the fifth inning to snap a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins 13 of the last 17 games. Roy Smith settled down from a rocky start to 
get his second victory in six decisions. Rick Aguilera got the last four outs 
for his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 4, Texas 0 -- About the only disappointment for the Orioles during 
their successful 1989 season was pitcher Pete Harnisch. The right-hander, 
expected to become a star, pitched so poorly that he wound up in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
Harnisch is making up for it this season. He held the Rangers to two hits in 
seven innings at Baltimore to improve his record to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Tettleton hit his third home run in four games. In the last five games, 
Tettleton is 11 for 14 and has raised his average from .167 to .245. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Olson pitched the last two innings for his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 4, New York 3 -- When sliding home with the winning run Saturday at 
New York, Steve Sax hurt his ankle and had to skip this one. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees could have used their sparkplug in this one. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 innings, the Yankees were outhit, 17-2, but their second hit of the game 
was a two-run home run by Don Mattingly in the ninth to tie the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals won it with three singles in the 10th. Kevin Seitzer had the third 
hit with two out to drive in the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Storm Davis of the Royals gave the Yankees just one hit before leaving in the 
eighth. DAN HAFNER

VOLLEYBALL TEAM STAGES STIRRING COMEBACK

<P>
Dessert went down easy, but the following course proved a bit harder to 
swallow. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Silva and Janice Opalinski, the first place finishers through two stops 
of the Hilton Flamingo Women's Pro Beach Volleyball Tour, came to an agreement 
Saturday night over dinner. Silva had committed to play with Opalinski through 
only three tournaments and after the finals of Sunday's San Diego Open at 
Pacific Beach, that commitment ran dry. 
</P>
<P>
But Brazil's Silva and San Juan Capistrano's Opalinski were the hottest team on 
the beach, and over dessert, Silva extended that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning Silva-Opalinski suffered their first defeat of the season, a 
15-4 loss in a semifinal of the winner's bracket to Santa Barbara's Eliane 
Roque and Oxnard's Nina Matthies. The loss sent them to the loser's bracket, 
where they won three games and the right for a rematch against Roque-Matthies 
in the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Deja vu it wasn't. Silva-Opalinski fought back from deficits of 10-4 and 14-9 
to win 16-14 and force a seven-point tiebreaker which they won quickly and 
decisively, 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Fatigue was a factor," Opalinski said. "It's very rare to come out of the 
loser's bracket and win, and it's almost unheard of to come back from 14-9 and 
win. But we were able to make the shots." 
</P>
<P>
Roque-Matthies, who had finished fifth twice, served for the match and the 
$6,000 prize money five times, but as their lead dwindled, so did their 
aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"As Jackie got tougher, we got more tentative," said Roque. "Janice, we were 
able to control. It's Jackie you have to watch out for, and we let her get into 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
And the wind took Roque-Matthies out of it. After leading 14-9, they served 
into the wind on three match points, and failed on all. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to serve into the wind," said Opalinski. 
</P>
<P>
Said Silva: "They lost three important serves. I thought then they didn't want 
this game. They had 14 and they were so nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Roque-Matthies started to play scared and Silva-Opalinski, tough on the block 
and using an off-speed game that gives opponents fits, oozed confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we could do it," said Opalinski. "A lot of prayers were answered. 
Jackie and I are very competitive, very tenacious. We want to go for every 
point. The mental edge is such an asset." 
</P>
<P>
That edge was put to a test earlier in the day against San Diego's Karolyn 
Kirby and Colombia's Patty Dodd in the loser's bracket final. Behind 14-11, 
Silva-Opalinski regrouped and pulled out a 16-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to play that many games," Opalinski said, "but I thought we'd be 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
Roque-Matthies split $4,500 for their second place finish and Dodd-Kirby, 
second in the first two stops, won $3,250 for third. Linda Carrillo of Van Nuys 
and Angela Rock of San Diego finished fourth and won $2,200.

LAKES' TIME OFF SHOWS AS HE FINISHES 11TH IN REGIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After competing in the 1988 Summer Olympics, Charles Lakes decided to take some 
time off from gymnastics. He took a job working for various sponsors of the 
Goodwill Games, and traveled around the country promoting the event. 
</P>
<P>
Then in March, Lakes decided he would make his comeback this weekend, in the 
U.S. Gymnastics Federation Western Regional Championships at UCLA's John Wooden 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem with that decision is that Lakes, no longer a college student 
or a national team member, still had to work. That left him little time to work 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a classic example of the plight of the amateur in this country who is 
no longer being supported by the university system," Lakes said Sunday after 
completing the optional competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to start training in March, but I had to make a living. Trying to 
make a comeback while supporting yourself is difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Lakes is one of 36 gymnasts who spent Saturday and Sunday at UCLA attempting to 
qualify for the U.S. National Championships in Denver, Colo., June 8-10. The 
regional was one of three held this weekend, and only the top 72 scorers will 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
The score from Saturday's compulsory competition will count 40% and the 
optional score 60%. The U.S. Gymnastics Federation will compute the scores and 
announce the qualifiers later. 
</P>
<P>
Lakes, a former University of Illinois gymnast, finished 11th overall, with a 
point total of 105.15. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly, the truth of Lakes' remarks were demonstrated in Sunday's optional 
competition -- the top five finishers are either college students or national 
team members. UCLA senior Chris Waller finished first with 56.90 points, 
followed by University of Nebraska freshman Trent Dimas at 56.65. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. national team member and former UCLA gymnast David St. Pierre finished 
third at 56.35; Stanford's Conrad Voorsanger and Jair Lynch at fourth and fifth 
place, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The top scorers from both days are Dimas at 113.50, Waller at 113.45, and St. 
Pierre at 113.15. 
</P>
<P>
Waller, who won the horizontal bar at the 1990 NCAA championships, drew cheers 
from the crowd of 250 when he scored a 9.8 in that event. But Dimas, who placed 
second to Waller in the high bar at the NCAA championships, got his revenge 
Sunday by scoring a 9.9. 
</P>
<P>
Gymnastics Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Thomas, 34, withdrew from the USGF's qualifying regional at Ohio State 
because of a shoulder injury. Thomas was planning on making his comeback this 
weekend. . . . The Los Angeles Turners, the oldest gymnastics organization in 
California that dates to 1879, awarded $2,000 each to the gymnastic programs at 
UC Santa Barbara, California, San Jose State, Cal State Fullerton and 
Washington.

Scott Sharts pitched and batted Cal State Northridge to a 2-0 victory over UC 
Riverside in the title game of the NCAA Division II West Regional Sunday at 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts, a 6-foot-5 right-hander, pitched an eight-hitter and hit his 26th home 
run of the season, a solo shot in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth-ranked Northridge (36-21) advances to the eight-team Division II World 
Series, starting Saturday at Montgomery, Ala. The last time the Matadors 
qualified for the World Series was in 1984, and they won the title. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts, a sophomore from Simi Valley High who transferred from Miami (Fla.), 
struck out eight. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside (39-18) threatened to score in both the second and ninth innings, but 
Sharts got out of both jams. He pitched out of a bases-loaded, no-out situation 
in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside's Bill Jordan also went the distance and he gave up only five hits. 
The Matadors scored their other run with one out in the fifth inning when Craig 
Clayton singled in Kyle Washington, who doubled. 
</P>
<P>
In two victories over Riverside in the regional, Northridge pitchers Sharts and 
Vale Lopez, Saturday's starter, gave up only one run and 15 hits -- 14 of them 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge and Riverside shared the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title.

KERSEE LOSES SLEEP, BUT BRUINS WIN TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD: UCLA WOMEN'S COACH DIDN'T NEED TO STAY UP LATE BECAUSE BRUINS 
CLINCHED PAC-10 MEET EARLY. OREGON TAKES MEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP.

<P>
Bob Kersee, coach of the UCLA women's track team, was up until 2 a.m. Sunday 
morning planning for the Pacific 10 track meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was going to come down to the 1,600-meter relay," Kersee said. 
"Every time I figured it out I thought there was no way we could win it before 
the relay." 
</P>
<P>
Kersee shouldn't have worried, because the Bruins clinched their fourth 
consecutive Pac-10 title before the relay, overtaking Oregon, 116-103, Sunday 
at Husky Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, which trailed Oregon, 61-34, after the first day of the meet, outscored 
the Ducks, 82-42, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Tracie Millett and Janeene Vickers won two events apiece for UCLA. After 
setting a school record of 53 feet 9 3/4 inches on Saturday to win the shotput, 
Millett clinched the team championship for the Bruins by winning the discus 
with a toss of 190-2. 
</P>
<P>
"If Tracie and Janeene do what they did here at the NCAA meet, we'll be in the 
hunt for the national title," Kersee said. 
</P>
<P>
The defending NCAA champion in the 400 hurdles, Vickers won her third 
consecutive conference title in a time of 58.76 seconds. She also won the 
100-meter hurdles in 13.73 and ran the leadoff leg on the Bruins' 400-meter 
relay team, which won in 45.26, despite losing anchor runner Caryl Smith, who 
strained a hamstring in the 100-meter trials Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Vickers finished her day by anchoring the Bruins' 1,600-meter relay team, which 
ran 3:43.13 to finish second behind Arizona State's 3:38.13. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the hardest I've had to work to win the Pac-10 since I've been here," 
Vickers said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's injury-plagued men's team wasn't as fortunate as the women, finishing 
third with 98 points behind Oregon (141) and Washington State (102). 
</P>
<P>
"Oregon did a nice job," UCLA Coach Bob Larsen said. "I was very impressed 
overall with the job Oregon did." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Coach Bill Dellinger was all wet after the Ducks won their first Pac-10 
title since 1986. His team threw him into the steeplechase water pit to 
celebrate the win. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm too old to get thrown in the water," Dellinger said. "I would have rather 
taken a victory lap." 
</P>
<P>
There were some outstanding performances on a cold, windy, overcast afternoon 
before 3,556 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA's Steve Lewis, the 1988 Olympic gold medalist in the 400 meters, came 
back from a hamstring injury to win his second consecutive Pac-10 title. Lewis 
was clocked in 46.10, edging Travis Hannah of USC (46.23). 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA's Brian Blutreich won the discus on his last throw, overtaking Todd 
Wilson of Washington. Blutreich won his second consecutive Pac-10 title, 
throwing 188-10 to beat Wilson (187-8). Blutreich, who threw 184-4 on his first 
throw, improved by four feet six inches on his last throw. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind was terrible," Blutreich said. "I waited a couple of minutes on my 
last throw for the wind to die down and it did. I'm glad I had the experience 
to wait because it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC's George Porter won the 400-meter hurdles in a time of 51.17. After 
undergoing surgery to have a planter's wart removed from his right foot two 
months ago, Porter is still not in top shape, but he had enough to win his 
second consecutive conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Porter also ran a strong third leg for the Trojans' 1,600-meter relay team, 
which clocked 3:05.06 to win but was later disqualified because Hannah ran out 
of his lane on the opening leg. It was a costly disqualification because USC's 
time met the NCAA qualifying standard, and the Trojans have just one more week 
in which to qualify for the NCAA meet, which will begins May 30 at Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maicel Malone of Arizona State was voted the female athlete of the meet, 
winning the 200 in 23.24 seconds, the 400 in 51.93 and anchoring the Sun 
Devils' winning 1,600-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Bates, a freshman from Arizona, was voted the male athlete of the 
meet, winning the 100 (10.45) and 200 (20.92) and anchoring the Wildcats to a 
win in the 400-meter relay (39.56).

BAKERSFIELD WINS THIRD CROWN

<P>
It took four games and 10 hours to accomplish, but Cal State Bakersfield won 
its third consecutive NCAA Division II softball title Sunday at Emerson Park in 
Midland, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners defeated California Collegiate Athletic Assn. rival Cal State 
Northridge, 6-2, in the title game after beating the Lady Matadors, 1-0, in the 
first championship game of the double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (51-21) had scored three runs in the seventh inning to beat 
Bakersfield, 3-2, earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
That meant the Roadrunners (44-11) had to defeat Bloomsburg (Pa.) University, 
4-0, to get another opportunity at playing Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Cathy Lewis (16-5) got credit for Bakersfield's two victories over 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The left-hander pitched a three-hitter in the first game and allowed one hit in 
3 1/3 innings of relief in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Lisa Uranday singled in Michelle Gerry with one out in the 
seventh inning in the 1-0 victory over Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
In the title game, Northridge third baseman Krista Miller's two-out throwing 
error in the first inning led to four unearned runs. JOHN ORTEGA

NEW YORK'S BAN ON LASIX TARNISHES TRIPLE CROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lasix question keeps causing controversy, and horse racing seems to simply 
shrug its collective shoulders and moves on to the next race. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont Park is preparing for the 122nd running of the Belmont Stakes June 9, 
and Summer Squall, the winner of Saturday's Preakness, will not be there 
because the state of New York does not permit the use of Lasix, a diuretic that 
controls respiratory bleeding. Consequently, the Belmont, which should be 
breaking the Triple Crown tie between Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled and 
Preakness winner Summer Squall, will have only Unbridled. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall's managing partner, Cot Campbell, is rejecting the Belmont, and 
the chance to run for a $1-million bonus that goes to the horse with the 
highest finishes in the Triple Crown races, because his colt needs Lasix to 
prevent bleeding. Summer Squall was able to run on Lasix in the Kentucky Derby 
-- in which he finished second -- and in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera, who trains Mister Frisky, the eighth-place finisher in the Derby 
and a distant third in the Preakness, says the best bet in the Belmont is that 
Unbridled, who also usually runs with Lasix, will bleed. 
</P>
<P>
"A mile and a half (the Belmont distance)? That horse will bleed for sure," 
Barrera said. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of his Derby victory and second-place finish in the Preakness, 
Unbridled can earn the $1-million bonus simply by completing the course in the 
Belmont. Besides Mister Frisky, the only other horse expected to run in all 
three races is Land Rush, who was seventh in the Derby and sixth in the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Nafzger, who trains Unbridled, says he can overcome his colt's potential 
bleeding by putting him on a strict diet that includes potassium, which will 
prevent the muscle soreness normally associated with dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what they do," trainer Wayne Lukas said Sunday, "but I just wish 
that at this level -- the Triple Crown and the Breeders' Cup races -- the 
medication rules were the same all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
The Breeders' Cup, seven races worth $10 million, will be held at Belmont Park 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas ran two horses in the Preakness, Land Rush and seventh-place Kentucky 
Jazz, and will run Land Rush in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
"If racing could get the right person -- someone like (former NFL commissioner) 
Pete Rozelle or (NBA Commissioner) David Stern -- then it ought to have someone 
like that running the whole thing," Lukas said. "The way it is now, you can't 
get two people in racing to meet on the same day. They have these conventions, 
discuss the problems, then they go home and don't do anything about them, and 
then they come back four months later to discuss them again." 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Triple Crown bonus point system, when it began four years 
ago, was to encourage trainers to run their horses through the series. 
</P>
<P>
"I shouldn't be knocking the bonus," Lukas said, "because it's money out there 
to be won that we didn't have before, but it hasn't worked and hasn't done 
anything to keep horses in or out of the races. Now we've got a situation in 
the Belmont where a horse (Unbridled) can run the race in 18 minutes and 22 
seconds and still earn $1 million. All he has to do is beat the water truck by 
a neck." 
</P>
<P>
Lukas said that a better idea would be to pro-rate the bonus as extra purse 
money for the Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
Only three of the nine Preakness horses -- Unbridled, Mister Frisky and Land 
Rush -- are expected to run in the Belmont. They will be joined by possibly six 
others -- Video Ranger, fourth in the Derby; Killer Diller, sixth in the Derby; 
Thirty Six Red, ninth in the Derby; Real Cash, 11th in the Derby; Dotsero, 
winner of the Illinois Derby; and Go and Go, winner of the Laurel Futurity last 
year and European-raced this season. 
</P>
<P>
Video Ranger, Killer Diller and Real Cash will run in the Jersey Derby at 
Garden State Park a week from today before their trainers make a decision about 
the Belmont. Neil Howard, the trainer of Summer Squall, talked Sunday morning 
at Pimlico as though he's almost glad his colt won't be there. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to use up some of the horse to move quicker with him in the 
Preakness," Howard said. "Unbridled will be tough in the Belmont. That mile and 
a half should do wonders for him."

SUPER MAY PROVES HIS VERSATILITY, WINS THE MERVYN LEROY HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Regarded primarily a turf specialist, Super May won earlier this year in the 
slop at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday at Hollywood Park, the 4-year-old Super Concorde colt also showed he can 
handle a dry track, providing trainer Richard Mandella with several options in 
the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden perfectly by Robbie Davis, Jack Kent Cooke's California-bred beat 35-1 
shot Charlatan III in the final furlong to win the $211,600 Mervyn LeRoy 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Successful in seven of his 16 lifetime starts, Super May, the fifth choice at 
8-1 in the 12-horse field, won by a head in 1:40 4/5 for the mile and a 
sixteenth. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second stakes and first Grade I victory for Super May, whose last 
triumph on a fast main track had come Jan. 21, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing how tough the turf races are going to come up here with Golden 
Pheasant, Steinlen and Prized, I looked at the nominations to this race and I 
thought it would be quite a bit easier than running against them," said 
Mandella, who won the Wilshire Handicap two Sundays earlier with 16-1 shot 
Reluctant Guest. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd won three races on the dirt before and he's just a better horse this 
year, period. So I thought he had a chance of handling the job." 
</P>
<P>
Super May has lost only once in six 1990 starts. He was second to Shining Steel 
in the Shoemaker Handicap April 29. 
</P>
<P>
"He had lots of little problems as an early 3-year-old," said Mandella. "In the 
four to five months he was off, he developed physically and mentally and is a 
better horse." 
</P>
<P>
Davis has ridden Super May seven times and has five victories and two seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace was real strong (22 3/5, 45 3/5 and 1:09 3/5 for the first six 
furlongs) and my horse was going along just as comfortable as can be," Davis 
said. "I was right about where I wanted to be turning for home because I wanted 
to get the jump on Lively One (the 2-1 favorite) before the quarter pole. 
</P>
<P>
"He fired well just like he always does. When I was running head and head (with 
Charlatan III) I had all the confidence in the world in him because he's just 
as game as can be. He's a very nice horse to ride." 
</P>
<P>
Charlatan III, winless since 1988, was two lengths clear of Lively One, who had 
beaten him in Golden Gate's Kensington Handicap two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bruho was fourth, followed by Stylish Winner, Santangelo, No Marker, Hollywood 
Reporter, Payant, French Stress, Swing Shift and Silent Prince. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
According to Bob Selvin of Handicapper's Report, anyone betting $200 to win on 
horses breaking from the outside post in one-turn races would, through 
Saturday, show an $11,000 profit. Letters Of Love and Duckling Park each won 
from the outside Sunday. . . . Timeless Answer ran the fastest six furlongs of 
the meeting when he won the seventh, a $60,000 overnight handicap, in 1:08 3/5. 
Black Jack Road, the 6-5 favorite, was eliminated at the start when he broke 
several lengths behind the field. The Kennedy Road gelding was acting up in the 
gate when the latch was sprung.

One day after winning the Preakness Stakes, jockey Pat Day shared in a triple 
dead heat victory, only the 18th in modern thoroughbred history, at Arlington 
International Racecourse Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The dead heat came one race after Day rode Quality Exchange to victory the 
$44,360 Smart Deb Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth race, an $18,000 seven-furlong allowance for 3-year-olds, Day rode 
9-5 favorite All Worked Up, which tied with Marshua's Affair and Survival. All 
three colts were timed in 1:24.4. Juvenal Diaz rode Marshua's Affair and Jorge 
Velasquez rode Survival. 
</P>
<P>
The triple dead heat was the first at an American track since Dec. 31, 1981, at 
Suffolk Downs in Massachusetts.

New Passion Play: Christians from around the world gathered over the weekend in 
Oberammergau, West Germany, for a new version of the centuries-old Passion Play 
about the suffering of Jesus, rewritten to cut out some of the anti-Semitic 
passages and images. 
</P>
<P>
The performance also marked the end of a tradition and sparked controversy. For 
the first time in the play's 356-year history, the role of the Virgin Mary was 
played by a married woman, Elisabeth Petre. In the past, only unmarried women 
were allowed to act as the mother of Christ. Director Christian Stueckl had 
faced a barrage of criticism over his casting of Petre. GREG BRAXTON

Lunev Is Staying: Soviet dancer Aleksandr Lunev, who stunned Boston audiences 
with his soaring leaps in the glasnost "Swan Lake" this month, is joining the 
Boston Ballet for the 1990-91 season. Lunev, disenchanted with the 
opportunities he was receiving from his home Kirov company in Leningrad, landed 
in Boston in early April with just the clothes on his back. He quickly was 
signed to dance major roles in the historic Soviet-American "Swan Lake" 
collaborative production, which ended Sunday. GREG BRAXTON

Nielsen Study: Responding to criticisms from the television networks over the 
recent case of "disappearing viewers," the A. C. Nielsen Co. has agreed to 
study the possibility of combining its current "people-meter" ratings system 
with some other kinds of audience measurement. The networks have contended that 
flaws in the "people-meter" system are responsible for the recent drop in TV 
viewing shown in the Nielsen ratings. See "By the Numbers" below for a look at 
the Nielsen families. GREG BRAXTON

Murdersomething: Ken Olin, the sensitive yuppie Michael Steadman of 
"thirtysomething," will play a murderous yuppie in a TV movie this fall about 
Boston's bizarre Charles Stuart case. 
</P>
<P>
Olin has been cast as Charles Stuart, the Boston furrier who duped the nation 
when he told police a black gunman had killed his pregnant wife, Carol. Police 
now believe Stuart killed his wife and then wounded himself in an elaborate 
plot to cash in on insurance policies and then committed suicide in January. 
There's no word yet on who will play Carol Stuart. GREG BRAXTON

Stupid Legislature Trick: The Texas Legislature is trying to lure David 
Letterman to Austin. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives borrowed Letterman's Top 10 list gimmick, and came 
up with a resolution that listed the reasons why Letterman should do a show in 
Austin. Reason No. 4: The Texas National Guard has agreed to keep Cher and 
Shirley MacLaine outside the city limits during Mr. Letterman's stay, using 
excessive force if necessary." The No. 1 reason: Texans will officially address 
Letterman as "The Great White Enchilada From Somewhere South of Poughkeepsie" 
during his stay. GREG BRAXTON

KRONOS MAKES RILEY'S 'SALOME' DANCE, DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the beginning about 25 years ago -- there was Terry Riley's "In C." Some 
called it a monumental breakthrough in droning creativity. Others found it the 
musical equivalent of Chinese water torture. 
</P>
<P>
With-it prophets of the avant-garde related it to the birth of minimalism. 
Fossilized iconoclasts related it to the death of intellectual and/or emotional 
stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, born in 1935, did not choose to wear his high-priest robes for long. 
Younger aesthetic Turks usurped the commercially profitable realm of the 
Xeroxed arpeggio, and the grand old man retreated to his home in the Sierra 
Nevada mountains. He soon turned to other concerns, both spiritual and 
expressive. 
</P>
<P>
Now -- drum roll, please -- comes Riley's "Salome Dances for Peace," a massive 
vehicle concocted for and with the wondrous and, thank goodness, tireless 
Kronos Quartet. At the local premiere of the complete version, Saturday night 
at the Wadsworth Theater, it lasted two hours, not including intermission. That 
is three times as long as Beethoven's most ambitious effort in the same genre. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's "Salome" -- which owes little to Oscar Wilde and less to Richard 
Strauss -- was intended as a sociopolitical ballet. The necrophiliac princess 
of Judea uses her alluring powers, we are told, to create universal peace. She 
becomes a goddess, a modern sorceress, a shaman, a warrior, and, it says here, 
"an influence on the world leaders' actions." 
</P>
<P>
The internal sections of the five-part suite, most of which melt quietly into 
each other, bear provocative titles: "Fanfare in the Minimal Kingdom," "At the 
Ancient Aztec Corn Races Salome Meets Wilk Talker," "Half Wolf Dances Made in 
Moonlight," "Breakthrough to the Realm of the War Demons," and so onward and 
sideways. The titles, alas, are more theatrical than the score. 
</P>
<P>
Riley and his players send their abstracted heroine on a convoluted, ever muted 
odyssey that may be better heard than seen. The music flirts amiably with jazz, 
blues, ragas, Asian modes, repetitive patterns, static rituals, and hoary 
Western traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Melodies are allowed. Melodic fragments are encouraged. Fogies who do not find 
the exercise too soporific can identify traces of Debussy and Bartok, even a 
nod or two in the direction of late Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
It took Riley two years to write "Salome Dances for Peace." It took the Kronos 
virtuosos three years to learn to play it. It took many members of the 
potentially sympathetic audience at UCLA an hour to decide that they had heard 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
The exodus at intermission, and beyond, was alarming. The defectors could not 
have been disturbed by any bold dissonance or unnerved by any dynamic 
onslaught. Riley's "Salome" music is invariably civil. It abounds in gentle 
gestures. Lyricism emerges the dominant impulses. The counterpoint is never too 
complex to be forbidding. 
</P>
<P>
There are passages of striking poise and buoyancy in the work. The flow of 
motivic ideas and the exchange of subtle nuances often beguiles the senses. The 
rhythmic pulses, though occasionally stubborn, dictate an intricate inner 
logic. The writing for contrasting strings remains eminently idiomatic. The 
balances are impeccable, the textures transparent. This, clearly, is the work 
of a master. 
</P>
<P>
If only it were a shorter, tighter, less indulgent work. Riley seems eager to 
crank out music -- much of it undeniably beautiful -- by the yard. One wishes 
he would care more about focusing specific beginnings, middles and ends. One 
wishes he would expend more energy on saying less. As presently constituted, 
his "Salome" lulls and dulls the senses just when a little provocation might be 
most useful. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, the dedicated members of Kronos Quartet -- David Harrington and John 
Sherba (violins), Hank Dutt (viola) and Joan Jeanrenaud -- once again made the 
difficult seem easy and the impossible seem merely difficult. Larry Neff's 
visual designs -- fluid patterns of mottled light projected on a screen behind 
the players -- added the aura of a futuristic juke box.

TOMIJURO V IS GUEST IN KABUKI PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich in ceremony and distinguished musicianship, the 35th anniversary program 
of Kabuki dance by the students of the late Kanya Sanjo V also boasted a 
stellar guest from the Grand Kabuki itself, Saturday at the Japan America 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Tomijuro Nakamura V had led the 1986 Grand Kabuki tour of the U.S., and this 
return visit both honored his hosts and reminded local audiences of his 
extraordinary vigor and dexterity as a dancer. The solo "Tomo Yakko" proved 
especially fascinating because of its mix of conventionalized dance movement 
and relatively realistic gesture. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a short, skirtlike garment over white leggings, Tomijuro stepped with 
unexpected lightness, knees pulled high into the air, accenting these soft 
footfalls with expressive hand motifs and an occasional stamp. Soon the 
vocabulary grew virtuosic: hops on one foot, steps executed while kneeling and 
sitting, plus, finally, complex rhythmic patterns pounded out in place. 
</P>
<P>
As the curtain fell, Tomijuro struck a classic Kabuki pose: holding a paper 
lantern high over his head with one hand, slapping his chest with the other and 
then clenching his fist while grimacing intently. 
</P>
<P>
This meticulously shaped and shaded ferocity also informed his performance of 
the battle duet "Gojo Bashi" opposite the superbly coached Maika Fujima -- both 
in magnificent stiff and wide costumes that heightened the ritualistic 
formality of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
Student performers dominated the rest of the program. Twelve women fluttered 
powder-blue fans and flowed through countless arbitrary groupings in Tazo 
Fujima's "Nagare." Three more decoratively wielded flowering branches and 
golden tassels in "Haru No Shirabe." And Kanfuji Sanjo, Kan-oh Sanjo and 
Kanshizu Sanjo -- dancers who have taken the name of their teacher -- appeared 
in "Hinazuru Sambaso," a traditional offering dance. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Kabuki choreographer Tazo Fujima joined Kangiku Sanjo in "Shizuhata Obi," 
a divertissement derived from the sublime Noh tragedy "Sumidagawa." Their solos 
and interplay looked artful enough, yet much of the emotional power and 
stylistic refinement in this and other selections came from the musicians: a 
nagauta ensemble headed by Yajuro Kineya IV and Sakichi Kineya V. LEWIS SEGAL

POP CAPSULES: UB40'S REFINED REGGAE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past decade UB40 has refined its brand of reggae to the point that it 
hardly relates to the rest of the genre. Friday at the Universal Amphitheare, 
UB40 showed neither the will nor the wherewithal to do the job. Not that it 
doesn't do a job quite well. 
</P>
<P>
Its trademark sinewy lope, a knack for the occasional killer hook and an 
affection for reggae's American soul roots (the focus of the current "Labourof 
Love II" album) has made it perhaps the most successful reggae band in pop. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing on Friday countered the common complaints about UB40: As great as 
some songs, like the horn-punched "If It Happens Again," are, there's a 
sameness to the band's sound; Ali Campbell's voice is pleasant but thin, 
painfully so on some of the soul oldies, and the flashes of brilliance only 
make the relative mediocrity of the rest of the material more frustrating.

POP CAPSULES: RAP LINEUP GOES ONE FOR THREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rap show on Friday night at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim started at the 
pinnacle and wound up in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
This long, delay-filled evening of steadily diminishing returns ended with 
teen-age headliners Wrecks-N-Effect grinding to a wretchedly amateurish 
embarrassment of a finish that was rewarded with scattered boos. 
</P>
<P>
Another young New York rap crew, Redhead Kingpin &amp; the F.B.I., turned in an 
energetic but lightweight middle set. But Def Jef, a more experienced rapper 
based in Los Angeles, made it all worthwhile with a near-perfect opening set 
that was fun, funky, and politically focused -- a textbook example of all 
that's good in rap music (a homophobic comment from Jef also demonstrated 
what's worst in rap). 
</P>
<P>
For 35 deftly paced minutes, Def Jef (real name: Jeffrey Fortson), deejay Erick 
Vaan and a trio of wonderful dancers called the Soul Brothers offered a 
cornucopia of rhyme, rhythm and eye-popping motion. Throughout his segment, Def 
Jef expertly interwove his key themes: rap as a call to party, rap as a 
foundation for friendship, and rap as a vehicle for expressing black pride and 
black protest. Carrying himself with unusual confidence and charm, Def Jef was 
able to be both serious and entertaining. He and his crew made a 
well-thought-out performance seem like casual, happy play. MIKE BOEHM

BROKEN VOWS TRIP UP MINORITIES AT UCSD 'BOOT CAMP'; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHER EDUCATION: PROMISE OF ECONOMIC SECURITY WHILE RIGOROUS PROGRAM PREPARES 
THEM TO COMPETE PROVES TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The offer seemed too good to be true for the diverse group of blacks and 
Latinos hungry for academic advancement: 
</P>
<P>
An intensive one-year academic "boot camp" at UC San Diego to improve their 
math, reading and writing skills so they could then continue as regular 
students through a four-year undergraduate program -- preferably with a science 
major -- and graduate. Better yet, the university would provide full financing 
for at least the first year -- $9,500 in grants as well as campus housing -- so 
that students would not have to work and those who had jobs could quit them and 
spend full time on studies. 
</P>
<P>
And, as the first year nears completion, many of the 16 students who started 
the program believe it was indeed oversold. Four dropped out and the 12 
students who remain have lost a good deal of the excitement they began with 
last September, in large part because of broken financial promises and 
haphazard administration of its two special academic courses. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, many of the students believe they have benefited academically 
from the program, although it remains unclear whether their expectations for 
academic success will be fulfilled by the year of special preparation. 
</P>
<P>
The moving force behind the program, veteran UCSD biology professor Stanley 
Mills, resigned as director last month after angry complaints from students 
that money promised as grants in some cases became small loans, causing 
financial headaches that distracted from their rigorous math and writing 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mills designed the faculty-run experiment to have at least a 
three-year evaluation, there is no question that problems from the first year 
have complicated his original goal: a program not only to increase the small 
percentages of black and Latino students on campus but to have them better 
prepared to tackle different science majors and graduate in greater numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a good education for those who don't have a chance other than to enter a 
junior college somewhere," said Jose Cruz, 19, who plans to major in 
engineering. "But Mills made the program sound like a fantasy" when the 
students were recruited, "saying that everything would be taken care of. I 
think all the financial pressures have taken a real toll on us." 
</P>
<P>
Added 27-year-old Maurice Carlisle, recruited for the program after completing 
a stint in the U.S. Marine Corps: "There's been an incredible amount of hassles 
and financial pressures, and I think most of us have decided that we simply had 
to be willing to suffer through this first year because we want a college 
education." 
</P>
<P>
"We made mistakes," Mills admitted last week, conceding that the student 
complaints contain a good deal of truth. "These students are not woolly-eyed 
lunatics. . . . I did misinterpret certain (financial) data, and we've had 
problems from just shaking down the program." 
</P>
<P>
But both Mills and Joseph Watson, who, as vice chancellor for undergraduate 
affairs, funded the program this year with about $80,000, asked that criticisms 
of Mills' management and his misstatements to students not overshadow the 
effort to try something different to help more minority students succeed at 
UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
"We are testing an approach different from present programs," Watson said. "We 
have doubts about our present programs," which provide tutorial and other 
support for minority students admitted to regular undergraduate programs but 
which have been inadequate in improving minority retention rates and increasing 
grade averages. 
</P>
<P>
Mills said he fears colleagues will interpret his resignation "as saying that 
the program failed. But, even though I have resigned, the program still exists, 
and I think it can still work." 
</P>
<P>
The Computation and Language Skills program (CALS), designed by Mills and 
approved by the UCSD Academic Senate, calls for intensive courses in math and 
writing/reading, taught by graduate students or lecturers and supervised by 
tenured professors. Each course would involve daily instruction from two to 
three hours, substantial one-on-one assistance and a large dose of homework 
nightly. Mills based the concept on an intensive summer program he helped run 
for minority students from Lincoln and Morse high schools admitted to UCSD in 
the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Mills recruited math professor Leonard Haff and English professor Charles 
Cooper, who has designed writing projects for the state Department of Education 
and San Diego city schools, to oversee the two course components. 
</P>
<P>
Mills and Watson at first decided to target former military personnel in their 
planned recruitment of 20 students last summer for the first year, reasoning 
that persons with such background would have self-confidence and maturity 
levels useful in tackling a fast-paced, disciplined academic schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But, because of the short amount of time given Marine Corps administrators at 
Camp Pendleton, the major point of contact, there were few Marines eligible for 
the program who would be leaving the service in time to begin studies in 
September, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the two instructors selected for the classes were asked to beat 
the bushes for potential students, using contacts at community colleges and 
other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We essentially played God," said Robert Curtis, a UCSD graduate student in 
mathematics who taught the math course until he quit in December in anger over 
student hardships resulting from the financial complications. "We really had no 
standards other than finding students who seemed suitable. . . . most of them 
were enrolled on the spot after brief oral interviews with Mills." 
</P>
<P>
When first contacted by Mills, Luis Lopez had already begun his second week of 
study as a junior at San Diego State University, buoyed by a $1,400 grant and a 
$1,000 scholarship for being an outstanding Hispanic student transfer from a 
community college. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, along with three other persons, met with Mills "and, after just a little 
meeting of 10 minutes or so, he admitted all four of us right there. And then 
he began telling us about all the great things we would have financially -- 
tuition, dorms and no need to work so we could study." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lopez suspected he might be overqualified for the first year of 
remedial-type courses, he nevertheless took Mills' advice to drop out of San 
Diego State immediately and enter UCSD. "I took his word, even though I never 
had anything in writing. I figured that I had everything paid for the first 
year and a guaranteed four years at a prestigious university like UCSD." 
</P>
<P>
But Lopez and the other students soon found out that, despite the promises from 
Mills, all students had to qualify for any financial aid through the regular 
application process. And, as such, income from the jobs they had quit at the 
urging of Mills or aid from parents they no longer lived with was considered in 
figuring out what they would eventually receive. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did aid packages end up substantially less than what Mills had 
detailed, the money was delayed because of processing. One former Marine, 
married and with children, had his auto repossessed and dropped out of the 
program. Remaining students were forced to borrow money from friends and from 
Curtis. UCSD's housing director arranged for meal tickets to be advanced to the 
students and found dormitory space, albeit in the university's highest-priced 
graduate complex, a converted condominium, at $800 a month per double room. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got stuck with a $4,000 loan, no grant, no money for food, I said, 
'Hey, minority students have had it hard enough without going through all of 
this,' " Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Given that the course work was basically too elementary for him, he left the 
program and, through the special efforts of UCSD Registrar Ronald Bowker, was 
able to re-enroll at San Diego State this spring despite not meeting 
application deadlines. But he lost both his $1,000 scholarship and $1,400 grant 
from SDSU, and still remains $1,300 in debt to UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Lopez, the older sister of Jose, quit a well-paying job at Children's 
Hospital, sold her car and left a UCSD preparatory program at City College. 
Subsequently, she has had to move several times to find housing she can afford 
given the small amount of aid provided her. Her cousin, Maria Borrayo, left the 
program, unable to support herself without a job. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did I join? I was told by Mills that this was the ultimate program," 
Monica Lopez said. "But, in retrospect, it isn't that exceptional, unless 
you're really someone who has blown a lot of (academic) chances before." 
</P>
<P>
Carlisle, the ex-Marine, ended up having to leave his wife and children with 
relatives in Ohio for the year. Kevin Earl, recruited from a job at the United 
States Homeless Mission in Southeast San Diego, said the bitterness of many 
students resulted "especially from a lack of money provided us during 
transition" to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Student Phillip Harris said, "After being told that all our needs would be 
taken care of, to just come to school and study, we'd get back to the 
(dormitory) and there would be a three-day-to-pay-or-be-evicted notice. So 
you'd spend half a day trying to get that cleared up. There was a tremendous 
amount of stress." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Jackson, a former Navy man, noted that many of the CALS students had 
never received loans before, and they worried incessantly about "owing other 
people money. . . . I mean they were really distraught." As the oldest student, 
Jackson, 38, helped counsel other students to stick with the program despite 
his own inclination at times to quit. 
</P>
<P>
Mills said last week that "I didn't understand how (financial aid) was handed 
out." Watson agreed with student complaints that the money was "both handed out 
quite late and that some things were said (to them) that were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, if they were misled, we have moral obligations to meet our stated 
commitments, but we can't forgo the regular financial aid procedures. . . . I 
can't order the financial aid office to do that." Watson did point out that 
many students have had their financial aid packages revised this spring to 
include more grants and fewer loans. 
</P>
<P>
Mills and Watson believe the program will improve in its second year. Before 
Mills resigned, they already had recruited 14 students for next fall, including 
nine from the military, and say they have been careful to explain financial aid 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the academic success of CALS remains up in the air. Curtis, the 
former math instructor who has kept in contact with most of the students, fears 
that the math course is inadequate to prepare all the students for the rigorous 
UCSD calculus course required of all freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"I fear that some may get slaughtered," Curtis said, partly because he believes 
the CALS course was unable to address the wide range of student preparation, 
where some needed basic algebra instruction at the beginning while others 
already new some trigonometry. 
</P>
<P>
Haff, the math professor who oversees the course and who is now the overall 
program director, said the students "on average" are a motivated group, but, in 
terms of their chances next year, "I want to let the results speak for 
themselves. . . . Our hope is that they will be able to do the course." 
</P>
<P>
English professor Cooper is confident that his literature instructor, Aida 
Mancillas, has improved both the skills level and self-confidence of the 
students in reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only has she done a wonderful job with the course, I believe she has 
provided the students with a lot of personal support and advice, and really has 
gone well beyond simply teaching the course well to be a key person in holding 
the program together," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
But both Cooper and Mancillas had differences with Mills over the content of 
the literature program, with Mills wanting more traditional grammar-based 
instruction. As a result, Cooper and Mancillas don't know whether they will be 
part of CALS next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't decided on that," new director Haff said. 
</P>
<P>
Mancillas said that Mills and Haff dislike her agitation on the part of 
students, in particular by helping them draft several letters to Watson 
demanding that Mills be dismissed form the program. "In any other format, the 
university would welcome such initiative, but not in this case," Mancillas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the financial problems, most of the students look forward to continuing 
at UCSD next fall, and they feel vindicated in part by the resignation of 
Mills. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd recommend it to others as long as they are aware of the financial aid 
limitations," Harris said. "I've been exposed to a lot of new things, and the 
review of math and writing has been really helpful." 
</P>
<P>
Added Kevin Earl, who rooms with Jackson, "We're as diverse a group as you 
could ever find, and the university has played on our decency. You always know 
that nothing comes for free, but it has been worth it academically."

<P>
After more than a century on Earth, you can be excused for detecting a certain 
monotony about life. 
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon Sunday honoring local centenarians, Dwight Chenault was asked for 
some words of wisdom. What thoughts did he have about the days of his life? 
</P>
<P>
"They come and they go," said Chenault, 100, a retired architect who walks with 
a cane. "None of them stay with me." 
</P>
<P>
Chenault was one of 11 honorees at the luncheon, sponsored by the Burbank-based 
American Centenarian Committee. Most continue to be intrigued by the pageant 
unfolding before their eyes. And even the puckish Chenault is staying pretty 
busy. 
</P>
<P>
A fellow of the Society of American Registered Architects, Chenault is going to 
attend the society's annual conference in Boston in November. Last December, he 
planned his own 100th birthday party, with 300 guests at a church in Eagle 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't trust anybody else to do it," said his daughter, Rose Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
The secret of his longevity? "I eat when I can get it, sleep all the time," 
Chenault said, his eyes glinting with mischievous humor. "I don't bother work 
that don't bother me. . . . Actually, I've worked hard all my life." 
</P>
<P>
There's no explaining longevity, said Raphael Cordero, chairman of the 
volunteer committee. But one fact is indisputable: The long-lived are with us 
in greater numbers than ever. And in percentage terms, centenarians are the 
fastest growing segment of the population, with the current total of 54,000 
century-old or older Americans expected to increase to 108,000 by the the year 
2000, according to the National Institute on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
"It's medical science, it's technology," said Cordero, 38, who founded the 
committee to honor and assist the centenarians, as well as get them together 
for social occasions. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "They come from a simpler generation," one less susceptible to 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
And they do things like eat yogurt and take daily walks. 
</P>
<P>
Setrak Boyajian, 106, a former rug salesman and dry cleaner from Hollywood, 
still eats a quart of yogurt a day, made with his own hands using the same 
yogurt culture he brought to Los Angeles 60 years ago. "It gives you more 
sleep," says Boyajian, a stooped man with a forceful handshake. "Nice. It 
cleans your body." 
</P>
<P>
Until he was 95, Boyajian walked a rigorous five miles a day. Now he's down to 
about two blocks. But he still plays backgammon every day and keeps abreast of 
the news. "There are no more morals," says Boyajian, who was born in Turkey and 
came to America in 1906. "There are dirty things all over." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Kline, 101, is another walker, covering as much as 10 miles daily around 
his home in Los Angeles' Melrose area. "It's the main thing," said Kline, who 
stepped away from the luncheon to stroll vigorously through the garden of the 
Sheraton Universal Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
For New Orleans-born Edward Johnson, the secret of longevity is Christian 
charity. "It's loving people who lived on Skid Row," said Johnson, 100, who 
once painted the homes of stars like George Raft. "When I go to bed, I worry 
about people sleeping on the street while I'm in a warm bed." 
</P>
<P>
He said relatives often chided him for giving money to down-and-outers. "They 
said, 'They're making a fool out of you,' " Johnson said. "But it's the Lord's 
business." 
</P>
<P>
There was little piety from the crusty Chenault, who designed homes, schools 
and libraries in Phoenix, where he got to know his famed colleague Frank Lloyd 
Wright -- "a small, irascible gentleman, exceedingly self-centered." 
</P>
<P>
For him, longevity is a matter of the way you run your life. "Take care of your 
own affairs properly," he said, "and treat people decently."

IT'S WHAT WE CALL A 'SIXTH SENSE' -- AN INNATE SENSE OF DIRECTION. NEW RESEARCH 
SUGGESTS ANIMALS HAVE AN INNER MAGNET THAT WORKS WITH THE MAGNETIC PULL OF THE 
EARTH.

<P>
The idea that animals have a "sixth sense" to navigate has long been regarded 
as a folk notion more akin to crystal balls than hard science. But current 
research indicates that a range of organisms -- from bacteria to large mammals 
-- may use internal compasses to get around. 
</P>
<P>
Organisms as diverse as bacteria, butterflies, salamanders, whales and humans 
all contain magnetically aligned material, some of which is known to be 
magnetite (iron oxide). The function of this magnetite may vary greatly among 
species, but the most interesting speculation centers on magnetoreception, the 
theory that some organisms use biological bar magnets to enhance their sense of 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
In many creatures, chains of magnetite crystals form "compasses" that aid 
migration over long distances and the location of food close to home. These 
internal magnets are made through the process of biomineralization -- the 
extraction of minerals from the environment and their conversion into a usable 
form. 
</P>
<P>
Results of some recent research shed light on, among other things, why whales 
and dolphins sometimes beach themselves at certain points. And preliminary work 
with humans suggests to some scientists that man might have biological 
compasses as well, an idea that is met by others with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
The field was once considered "a romping ground for charlatans," according to 
Caltech geophysicist Joseph Kirschvink. But the skepticism surrounding 
magnetoreception subsided in 1975 when then-graduate student Richard Blakemore 
discovered bacteria containing chains of magnetite crystals encapsulated in 
organic membranes. 
</P>
<P>
Each of these crystals is a magnet unto itself, in many respects similar to, 
but much smaller than, the bar magnets used by schoolchildren. A bacterium's 
membrane keeps these individual crystals literally "in line," preventing them 
from lumping together. Held together by the membrane, the individual magnets 
can then work as a team to form a single magnet called a magnetosome. 
</P>
<P>
Bacteria that contain magnetosomes have a great advantage over those that do 
not. While the latter move about in a random fashion, frequently traveling in 
circles, the former are able to swim in straight lines, which allows them to 
cover more new territory in their search for food. 
</P>
<P>
The 20 or more magnetite crystals that make up a magnetosome measure from 400 
to 1,000 angstroms. (An angstrom is equivalent to three-billionths of a foot.) 
At the proper size, these crystals form a magnet that is locked into a specific 
magnetic orientation, such as north-south. 
</P>
<P>
Since Blakemore's discovery, magnetotactic (magnet-containing) microbes have 
been found in oceans and freshwater lakes throughout the world. In addition, 
many higher animals show evidence of using the Earth's magnetic field in 
navigation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Michael Walker and M. E. Bitterman, both of the University of Hawaii, 
trained honeybees to respond to very small changes in local magnetic field 
intensity, thereby augmenting a previous discovery that the bees carry 
magnetosomes within their abdomens. In a study to be published in September of 
this year, Kirschvink and his wife, Atsuko, replicated Walker and Bitterman's 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Work with yellowfin tuna led to the discovery of magnetosomes in tuna skulls, 
and researchers have also located structures in salmon that are identical to 
those found in magnetotactic bacteria. Salmon use odor as a means of 
navigation, and magnetoreception may serve as a backup system. 
</P>
<P>
Work with whales and dolphins by Margaret Klinowska of Cambridge University and 
similar studies by Kirschvink have investigated the possible link between 
magnetoreception and strandings, the inexplicable beaching of migrating 
cetaceans. 
</P>
<P>
To appreciate their results, it is helpful to visualize the Earth as a gigantic 
magnet with its magnetic poles roughly located at its geographic poles. The 
magnetic field over the continents is fairly constant. Not so with the field 
over the ocean floor. Underwater volcanoes along the Pacific and Atlantic 
mid-oceanic ridges spew forth magnetite-containing lava. As the lava cools, the 
poles of the magnetic crystals align in the direction of the Earth's magnetic 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Periodically throughout geological time, the Earth's field has changed 
directions (from a north-south configuration, as we now have, to a south-north 
configuration). When the Earth's field reverses, the orientation of each newly 
formed crystal of magnetite also changes, though the magnetite crystals in 
already-cooled lava do not change their orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Long bands of alternating magnetic pull (north-south or south-north), which run 
parallel to the mid-oceanic ridges are thereby formed. As a result, the ocean 
floor is "zebra-striped" with bands of magnetite -- one stripe oriented 
north-south, the next south-north. Bands of strong magnetic pull (maxima) are 
formed when the Earth's magnetic field is strong in either direction. Much 
thinner bands of weak magnetic pull (minima) are formed as the Earth's magnetic 
field is changing its orientation. 
</P>
<P>
As the continental plates are pushed away from the mid-oceanic ridges in 
opposite directions -- in the continual process of plate tectonics -- new 
magnetically banded ocean floor is created. Whales and dolphins generally ride 
the minima -- the narrow band between the north-south and south-north 
configurations. 
</P>
<P>
Provided that an animal possesses a natural compass, it could use this magnetic 
road map for charting a course through otherwise featureless seas by following 
"roads" of magnetic maxima or "center lines" of magnetic minima. 
</P>
<P>
Using detailed maps of the Geological Society of America's East Coast magnetic 
survey and exact positions of cetacean strandings from Smithsonian Institution 
compilations, Kirschvink has just completed an update of a study done in 1986. 
Results from both studies, as well as Klinowska's studies of strandings in 
British waters, indicate that whales and dolphins tend to beach at coastal 
points of magnetic minima. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers hypothesize that cetaceans follow bands of magnetic minima 
during long-distance migrations. Strandings may occur when the animals, for 
reasons not yet known, follow these bands onto shore at coastal magnetic 
irregulari 
</P>
<P>
ties. 
</P>
<P>
Some dolphins and toothed whales, however, tend to strand near magnetic maxima, 
which indicates that a cetacean's choice as to whether to follow magnetic 
minima or maxima may depend on a variety of factors. For example, during 
migration it might be more practical to follow magnetic minima, while during 
feeding a creature might follow magnetic maxima around seamounts, since these 
are usually areas of great biological productivity and sources of food. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Gordon Bauer of the University of Hawaii has analyzed the head 
regions of humpback whales and several species of dolphins. He found high 
concentrations of magnetite in the cetaceans' skulls in approximately the same 
region in which magnetite has been identified in the skulls of homing pigeons 
and tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Kirschvink's work with human cadavers has so far been inconclusive, but he 
adds, "We know what the (magnetite) structure looks like in lower animals and 
it should be similar in higher animals, including humans." 
</P>
<P>
Humans certainly biomineralize iron -- probably as we do calcium -- from the 
foods we eat. Additionally, magnetic material is detectable in human tissue. 
Indeed, the older the person, the higher the iron content of the brain. What is 
not known is whether this iron is in the form of magnetite and, if it is, 
whether it is used in magnetoreception. 
</P>
<P>
Kirschvink, for one, is not yet ready to embrace the possibility of human 
magnetoreception. Rather, he speculates that magnetite in humans, if it does 
exist, may act as "a trace-metal dump," sequestering harmful trace metals from 
the rest of the body in much the same way that trees deposit wastes in their 
bark. "Once they're (the trace metals) inside a magnetite crystal, they're 
inert," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
R. Robin Baker of the University of Manchester is far less skeptical. He has 
conducted experiments designed to replicate, with blindfolded humans, tests 
that have demonstrated a magnetic sense in pigeons. Baker says his findings 
indicate that humans appear to possess such a sense of direction, which he 
hypothesizes is impaired when the subject is allowed to use other senses or 
cues, such as sight or topography. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that we are unaware of any "sixth sense" is not in itself reason to 
discount human magnetoreception. Baker's subjects tended to abandon the 
hypothetical magnetic sense as soon as other information was made available, 
such as the warmth of the sun or the direction of the wind on their blindfolded 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
As with most species that have been studied, humans prefer some cues to others 
and organize their available senses in a hierarchical way. Pigeons, for 
example, prefer landmarks and cues from the sun and stars when these are 
available and relegate their magnetic sense to a subordinate position. 
</P>
<P>
Further biochemical and behavioral research into magnetoreception may someday 
remove the shroud of mystery that surrounds the notion of a sixth sense in 
humans, while establishing a common chain of magnetite between the lowly 
bacterium and the Earth's highest animal. 
</P>
<P>
The Theory of Animal Migration 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers believe that the theory of magnetoreception may unlock the 
secret of animal migration. Within the tissue of all animals lie magnetic 
particles, which, when bunched together, form a bar magnet. This magnet then 
relates to a set of invisible magnetic "bar codes" on the ocean floor that 
define north and south. 
</P>
<P>
Animals ingest iron oxide particles (magnetite) that form a chain of crystals 
in the tissues, creating an internal magnetic compass. 
</P>
<P>
Underwater volcanoes along the mid-ocean ridges spew forth magnetite-containing 
lava. As the lava cools, the magnetic crystals align with the Earth's magnetic 
field. Periodically throughout geological time, the Earth's field has changed 
directions. When it reverses, the orientation of the newly formed crystal of 
magnetite also changes. As a result, the ocean floor is striped with bands of 
magnetite, some oriented north-south, others south-north. Migrating animals use 
the bands as invisible landmarks.

Italian researchers are testing a new vaccine against pertussis (whooping 
cough) that they hope will be safer and more effective than existing vaccines. 
Current vaccines use inactivated cells of Bordetella pertussis, the 
microorganism that causes the disease, but these preparations have been found 
to produce convulsions or seizures in one of every 750 vaccinated children and 
brain damage in one of 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
The pertussis bacterium produces a toxin that can cause death. Molecular 
biologist Luciano Nencioni and his colleagues at the Sclavo Research Center in 
Siena have genetically engineered the bacterium so that it produces a harmless 
version of the toxin. When used as a vaccine, the harmless toxin stimulates 
immunity against the virulent form. Nencioni said the harmless toxin produces a 
much stronger immune response than a chemically detoxified form that other 
researchers are now testing. 
</P>
<P>
The vaccine is now being tested in 100 children.

THE SIDE EFFECTS OF MARIJUANA

There is good news and bad news about marijuana. The good news, according to 
microbiologist Gerald Lancz of the University of South Florida in Tampa, is 
that the primary active component of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, 
can interfere with herpes viruses, such as those that cause genital herpes and 
some types of birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
THC binds to the external membrane of the herpes viruses and prevents them from 
attaching to cells, so that the cells do not become infected. Lancz cautioned 
that smoking marijuana would probably not produce a high-enough concentration 
of THC in the blood to affect a herpes infection, but he predicted that the 
discovery might lead to new types of anti-herpes drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate study, however, microbiologists Steven Specter and Kirk Trisler 
of the University of South Florida found that THC suppresses the normal growth 
of disease-fighting white blood cells and disrupts their ability to kill tumor 
cells. "The findings suggest that people who smoke marijuana have the potential 
for altered cellular immunity, and their ability to fight infection and/or 
cancer may be suppressed," Trisler said.

FIREFIGHTERS FIND THAT 15 IS A CROWD

<P>
The men at Los Angeles County Fire Station 73 in Santa Clarita are a close-knit 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Too close. 
</P>
<P>
The problem: A new firehouse -- dubbed Station 124 -- was supposed to open May 
1 west of the Golden State Freeway on Pico Canyon Road. The station isn't ready 
yet, so the men of Station 124 have moved in with the regular crew at Station 
73 on San Fernando Road and will be there for at least two more months. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tight squeeze. The 15 firefighters share two showers, two toilets and 
three sinks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all sort of bumping into each other," said Engineer Tom Brady of Station 
124. 
</P>
<P>
"We're crowded," said Capt. Jim Jordan of Station 73. 
</P>
<P>
Station 73 normally houses 12 men. To accommodate the six-man crew of Station 
124, the Fire Department sent one of Station 73's two engines to another 
station in town because "there's no room for the engine or the three guys on 
it," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, Station 124 and Station 73 are operating as independent entities, 
each responding to calls in separate areas. They park their vehicles 
back-to-back, one crew speeding out the rear of the station, the other rushing 
out the front. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Larry Wild of Station 124 said a temporary facility -- two trailers and a 
work bay -- is being prepared for his station, which will serve new housing 
tracts west of the freeway. The trailers, on Pico Canyon Road, eventually will 
be replaced by a permanent building, Wild said. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, who was transferred to Station 124 in a recent promotion, said other 
firefighters eligible for his job declined the post because they knew it meant 
living in trailers and doubling up in Station 73. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the county turned it down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest inconvenience, firefighters agreed, has been the five bunk beds 
stuffed into the sleeping quarters to make room for extra lockers. Paramedics 
generally grab the lower bunks on the theory they will have to hop out of bed 
more often during the night, Wild said. 
</P>
<P>
For men who have not slept in bunk beds since childhood, the beds take some 
adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighter Eric Minlschmidt recalled the first night he slept in one of the 
lower berths. He heard a rumble, felt the bed shake and sat up in bed. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that it was an earthquake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the man above him getting out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
The men generally compete for the coveted lower berths on a first-come, 
first-served basis, Wild said. 
</P>
<P>
Except for captains. They are guaranteed single beds. 
</P>
<P>
"Rank," Wild observed, "has its privileges."

Chlorine, which is normally used for sterilizing water used for drinking and in 
cooling systems, may not be effective against the microorganism that causes 
legionnaire's disease, according to Jeannine Navratil of the Pittsburgh 
Department of Water. The microorganism that causes the disease is much more 
resistant to chlorine than other water-borne pathogens and can colonize hot 
water reservoirs at the end of potable water systems, she reported. 
</P>
<P>
About 700 cases of legionnaire's disease are reported to the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control each year, but that number is believed to represent only a 
small fraction of total cases. About 15% of infections prove fatal. 
</P>
<P>
The organism, Legionella pneumophila, escapes the chlorine by hiding inside 
certain amoebas, which form inactive cysts when stressed, such as by exposure 
to chlorine. These amoebas, she said, can withstand 10 times the amount of 
chlorine normally used to disinfect water and still support legionella growth, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, she said, it may be necessary to use ultraviolet light or other 
disinfectants to kill the L. pneumophila.

<TEXT>
<P>
A 67-year-old North Hollywood woman was killed and three others injured in a 
hit-and-run car crash in which one car ran a red light Sunday afternoon at 
Victory Boulevard and Bellaire Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sirour Mazmanyan was killed when she was ejected from the passenger side of a 
Nissan Sentra when it collided with an American Motors vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Two other passengers in the car were hospitalized. A third received minor 
injuries and was treated at the scene, police said. None of the injured were 
wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
Police were searching for the male driver of the American Motors car Sunday 
night. A witness wrote down the license plate number of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear which vehicle ran the red light, Officer Joanna Needham said. 
The Nissan was traveling on Bellaire and turning left onto Victory about 1 p.m. 
when it was broadsided by the other vehicle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the injured were not released.

<P>
As if greater Los Angeles needed another reason for a traffic jam, consider the 
redevelopment of the old Uniroyal tire plant in City of Commerce, with its 
distinctive Assyrian-style facade. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Trammell Crow is turning the landmark property into a huge commercial 
center -- with offices, shops and a hotel -- but all the construction activity 
is causing regular rush-hour gawker slowdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the developers are advertising an 800 number (1-800-CITADEL) on a 40-foot 
billboard out front that will provide car-phone users with instant background 
material on what all the fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
The good news: A Los Angeles-area landmark is not being torn down, at least not 
completely. The bad news: The redevelopment will take 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Show but Little Biz 
</P>
<P>
Each year at this time, hundreds of studio executives, producers and agents 
flock to New York beseeching the networks to pick up their pilots for new fall 
television series. 
</P>
<P>
The odds are slim: Each network usually picks six to 10 new shows out of a 
combined pool of 80 or more pilots. But in a business where deals are routinely 
done at the flick of a speed dialer, anxious producers think that being close 
at hand to the networks' inner sanctum during screenings will give them an edge 
over their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The popular hangout has become the Regency Hotel, which for two weeks becomes a 
kind of Hollywood-on-the-Hudson where producers, agents and network executives 
schmooze at breakfast and swap rumors every evening in the bar or basement gym. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the thousands of dollars rung up in bar bills and fax lines, 
producers find it often is more for show than business. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the program decisions are made before the grand arrival," admits CBS 
President Howard Stringer. "The whole thing is like one of those old European 
resorts where everybody falls into everybody else's arms and says how wonderful 
it is to see each other." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Please Everyone 
</P>
<P>
Some say California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a Democratic gubernatorial 
hopeful, had political motives for filing the suit that blocked the merger of 
Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
But now that Van de Kamp has won that battle, and most of Alpha Beta's Southern 
California stores are going up for sale, how do consumers feel? It depends on 
which consumer you talk to. 
</P>
<P>
Murray Turner, a customer at Alpha Beta on Topanga Canyon Boulevard in Woodland 
Hills, sided with Van de Kamp. "I don't believe in monopolies," Turner said. "I 
think that monopolies mean higher prices." 
</P>
<P>
But Miriam Leider, another customer, was skeptical. "How can they (a new owner) 
reduce prices?" Leider asked. "They have to make money, too."

EXPORT SALES BOOM FOR STATE'S MEDICAL SUPPLY INDUSTRY; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: MANY SMALL EQUIPMENT MAKERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE FOUND A HUGE MARKET 
OVERSEAS. THEIR FOREIGN SALES ROSE 23% TO $3.8 BILLION LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Matters were grim enough when Larry Beaty and Ed James began to look for a way 
out of their business difficulties in the summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The medical diagnostic kits made by their fledgling Santa Ana company, Zycal 
Ltd., were poor sellers in the U.S. market. In addition, Beaty, the firm's 
chairman, was contending with agonizing disc-related back pains. 
</P>
<P>
Before they could complete their plans for setting the company on a new course, 
a protruding disc paralyzed Beaty from the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
"The injury could not have happened at a more inopportune time," Beaty said 
last week, recalling the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Beaty has been involved in two medical success stories. Doctors 
surgically corrected his back problem, enabling the Santa Ana entrepreneur to 
regain use of his legs. Then Beaty and James used new strategies to correct 
Zycal's problems, directing virtually all their marketing abroad to European 
and Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
Exports now account for 85% of Zycal's sales, and business is suddenly brisk. 
The privately held firm, founded in June, 1988, made its first quarterly profit 
by generating revenue of about $100,000 during the first three months this year 
-- equaling its sales for all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Zycal's surge in sales is a reflection of the growing export-consciousness of 
medical equipment makers. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department last week said sales of American-made goods overseas 
jumped to record levels in March, the most recent reporting period. 
Manufacturers of medical and scientific equipment were among the exporters 
generating the highest sales increases, contributing significantly to the $33.3 
billion in total export sales in March. 
</P>
<P>
Zycal's products -- pregnancy-test kits and devices used to measure tumors and 
hormone and thyroid disorders -- are particularly popular in Italy, Belgium and 
Taiwan. The company's sales are growing so quickly, said James, Zycal's 
president, that the current pace would produce annual revenue of $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The turnaround was given official recognition earlier this month when Gov. 
George Deukmejian presented James and Beaty with a certificate proclaiming 
their firm California's small business "Exporter of the Year." 
</P>
<P>
The award is significant, considering the large number of medical supply 
manufacturers in California. While the state is home to such major medical 
suppliers as Beckman Instruments, Toshiba Medical Supplies and Allergan Co., 
there also are hundreds of small firms. There are 231 companies in the state 
producing surgical appliances and supplies, for example, 111 that make dental 
equipment and 103 that manufacture eye-care products, according to state 
records. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 621 medical instrument manufacturers operate in California -- more than 
any other state -- and nearly half are in the metropolitan Los Angeles area. 
Export data shows that more of these firms are thinking globally. 
</P>
<P>
The value of California's medical equipment exports rose 63% to $3.1 billion in 
1988 from $1.9 billion in 1987. Exports climbed another 23% in 1989, reaching 
$3.8 billion. Medical equipment -- instruments and related products -- is now 
California's fourth-leading export item. 
</P>
<P>
The level of medical equipment exports from California will continue to rise 
because the products have a reputation for high quality, said Gladys Moreau, 
president of International Intelligence Services, a Los Angeles-based trade 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The prospects for growth are excellent," Moreau said. "The level should 
increase because a lot of medical equipment manufacturers don't export 
currently. Some of them will find marketing firms to handle exports -- or will 
do it themselves. Either way, the potential for increased exports is there." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Ritter, an industry analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago, also expects 
continued growth in medical equipment exports. 
</P>
<P>
"Some foreign economies -- some of those in Asia, for example -- are growing 
faster than the U.S. economy," Ritter said. "They have a smaller base of 
installed (medical) equipment and they can afford to buy." 
</P>
<P>
Ritter also said entrepreneurs controlling smaller, less established firms have 
great opportunities to carve niches abroad because the industry giants in the 
United States do not have the same level of name recognition and market sway 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"There could be a tremendous payoff for those who make improvements to current 
technology," Ritter said. 
</P>
<P>
California's World Trade Commission, a state government office responsible for 
promoting export trade, has great expectations for the medical equipment 
industry. The commission's promotion budget, which includes funds for 
subsidizing foreign trade show appearances by California firms, is based on a 
formula that considers sales and job growth in various industries. 
</P>
<P>
The commission considers the medical equipment industry one of its top three 
trade prospects and is funding events designed to promote the business, said 
Paul Oliva, a commission research analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The commission subsidized a Zycal appearance at a trade show in West Germany 
last November, and the show was crucial to Zycal's turnaround, Beaty said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to find customers . . . and distributors," he said. "It made a 
big difference. We were at the right place at the right time."

Capital Cities/ABC Inc. The suit, filed in Los Angeles, claims that Capital 
infringed on the plaintiff's copyrights by broadcasting unauthorized 
duplications of seven movies on KABC-TV in Los Angeles and KGO-TV in San 
Francisco. The suit seeks orders barring the airing of more alleged 
unauthorized reproductions and unstated damages from Capital Cities and Acama 
Films, which does business as Movie Greats Network of Sherman Oaks. (Filed May

NORTHROP SILENT ON WHAT FACILITIES IT MAY CLOSE; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: DEFENSE CUTBACKS MAY MOST AFFECT OPERATIONS IN VENTURA COUNTY, 
HAWTHORNE AND PALOS VERDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Beleaguered Northrop is considering the shutdown of "non-productive" 
facilities, but the company is being stealthy about which locations are the 
most likely to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to answer 'what if' questions," a spokesman declares. 
</P>
<P>
Shutdowns would have the most impact on the Los Angeles-based aerospace firm's 
Southern California employees, who represent 75% of its work force. Most at 
risk are employees at the Ventura County operation, the sprawling Hawthorne 
facilities and the hilltop Palos Verdes research center. 
</P>
<P>
At Northrop's annual shareholders meeting, President Kent Kresa said: "We are 
going to continue to sell non-productive assets -- those holdings that don't 
match the business environment we see ahead of us or where we feel better use 
can be made of the assets." 
</P>
<P>
The company will eliminate 3,000 of its 41,000 jobs this year, after having 
eliminated 2,500 last year, Kresa said. With fewer people, the company will be 
left with more space than it needs. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the firm has sold its corporate headquarters in Century City and a 
manufacturing plant in Anaheim. At the end of 1989, it owned 12.9 million 
square feet of office and factory space, and it was leasing 5.6 million feet. 
Leased space was down 400,000 square feet from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop has tried to sell its Palos Verdes center in recent years but was 
thwarted by city regulations that prevented potential buyers from establishing 
light-industrial operations on the property, according to industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a gorgeous property," one source said. "A lot of it has an ocean view. 
It has an area with swans in it." 
</P>
<P>
The facility is out of sync with pressures for austerity in the aerospace 
industry arising from defense budget cuts and programs being canceled, the 
source said. The cuts have resulted in excess space for Northrop in a number of 
places, including Hawthorne, El Segundo and Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has owned its Ventura County facility in Newbury Park, worth as much 
as $132 million, since the early 1960s. It has 2,000 employees. After 
developing the Tacit Rainbow cruise missile in Ventura, the company elected in 
the mid-1980s to build it in Perry, Ga. Sources say Northrop had planned at one 
point to build the missile at a new plant in Santa Maria, but that facility has 
been sold. 
</P>
<P>
Employees in Ventura have grown increasingly concerned amid mounting 
speculation that Northrop will sell the facility and move remaining programs to 
Hawthorne or Georgia. "You are right on the edge of your seat," an employee 
said. "The attitude is that is going to happen at any time." 
</P>
<P>
In its aircraft and missile sectors, Northrop owns dozens of old buildings in 
Hawthorne and El Segundo, intermingled with newer facilities. Because Northrop 
has invested heavily in research facilities in Hawthorne, it is unlikely to 
abandon the Hawthorne facility entirely -- in contrast with Lockheed's move 
from Burbank. Lockheed recently announced that it would relocate several major 
programs to Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a cost-cutting effort," said Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio. "We may 
shift things around from one facility to another. If we do, it may cause excess 
capacity. And if it does, we may sell that excess capacity or we may not renew 
leases." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Harris, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, estimated that 
Northrop owns 218 acres of land in Hawthorne, worth $410 million. Harris 
speculates that Ventura and a substantial portion of Hawthorne could be sold 
off to help reduce the firm's $1 billion in debt. Kresa said the firm aims to 
be debt-free by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Having lost a number of programs, the industry source said, the company needs 
to consolidate. He noted that the firm ended production of the F-5 fighter last 
year and lost a competition to continue production of a key piece of the 
guidance system for the MX missile. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Northrop has excess space at its electronics division in Hawthorne and at 
its aircraft line in El Segundo on Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The company is unlikely to move production of the F-18 fuselage from El Segundo 
or the Boeing 747 jetliner fuselage from Hawthorne. Large jigs used to produce 
those parts would be difficult to move and very costly to recalibrate at new 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's electronics division in Hawthorne has a relatively new assembly 
building for missile guidance systems. Although it lost the MX program, it is 
believed to be building a guidance system for the B-2 bomber at the unit. It is 
unclear whether that building could be vacated or not. 
</P>
<P>
But Northrop has dozens of small buildings scattered about the Hawthorne area 
that are strong candidates for abandonment, sources said. The buildings, 
painted drab brown in the Northrop color motif, house many of the design 
operations for the advanced tactical fighter program. 
</P>
<P>
Kresa said the company would locate the ATF development program, if it wins a 
competition against rival Lockheed, at its B-2 bomber operation in Pico Rivera. 
That decision should free up some space in Hawthorne. It also appears to be a 
strong commitment for Northrop's Pico Rivera plant, which Kresa called the 
"most modern aircraft development and manufacturing facilities in the nation."

JAPANESE MEAT SELLER HOGTIED IN RED TAPE; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: BUREAUCRATS SAY THEY'RE HOLDING UP SALES OF U.S. BEEF IN VENDING 
MACHINES BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT HEALTH.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An extraordinary scheme to bypass Japan's inefficient distribution system by 
selling inexpensive American beef from coin-operated vending machines appears 
to be headed for the bureaucratic Deepfreeze. 
</P>
<P>
Haruhiko Saito, a meat-selling entrepreneur in this seaport famous for prime 
"Kobe beef," announced with considerable fanfare early last month a plan to 
import seasoned beef from a San Diego meatpacker and sell it from specially 
designed vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
But local health authorities refused to give Saito a permit to sell his packets 
of frozen sirloin and sliced sukiyaki beef. Warning that there is no precedent 
for vending-machine meat sales, they have requested guidance from the Health 
and Welfare Ministry in Tokyo, where an official said the matter is under 
study. 
</P>
<P>
In the ritualized parlance of Japan's powerful bureaucracy, "under study" is 
often a euphemism for "no." At the very least, it means months and sometimes 
years of deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
Saito suspects that a cartel of trading companies and meat distributors, with a 
vested interest in controlling beef imports, is behind the red tape delay. He 
said his lawyers are preparing to file a complaint with the Fair Trade 
Commission, the agency that enforces Japan's anti-monopoly law. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't help but feel that the people who have colluded for years on beef 
imports are now using the question of health standards to hogtie us," Saito 
said. "They don't want us to get a head start before the market is fully 
liberalized next April." 
</P>
<P>
To settle a long simmering U.S.-Japan trade dispute, Japan agreed to replace 
its quota system for beef imports with a 70% tariff, to be lowered in phases 
over several years. Saito had hoped to take advantage of the first stage of the 
liberalization, which began April 1 with quotas being lifted for seasoned or 
marinated beef. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the 70% tariff, Saito figured he could sell imported beef at nearly 
half the cost of comparable domestic beef, if he eliminated the middlemen 
between him and the consumer. His price for seasoned sirloin is about $11 a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
Saito, 53, whose father founded a company distributing Kobe beef in 1935, 
struck out on his own 17 years ago with a plan to import American beef offal, 
or waste parts, which were not restricted by quotas. Visiting the United States 
in 1973, Saito said he watched Reggie Jackson hit a home run when the Oakland 
A's were playing in Yankee Stadium and was inspired to name his new enterprise 
"Jackson Co." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Jackson Co. signed a deal with Hamilton Meat Co. of San 
Diego, which will prepare and package meat specially for the Japanese market. 
The Kobe-based joint venture, Hamilton Japan, was poised to install 1,000 
vending machines by December at gasoline stations, railroad stations, hospitals 
and convenience stores across Japan. Projected sales for the first year were 
$7.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy was to establish distribution channels before the quotas are 
lifted for all imported beef in April, 1991. In three years, annual sales would 
reach $66 million, said Naoki Sakai, Hamilton Japan's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
But only one vending machine has been delivered from the factory. It stands 
empty outside Hamilton Japan's small office, which is festooned with red, white 
and blue banners and decorated with a huge poster depicting a slab of American 
beef. The machine bears the slogan: "Kobe beef, raised in America." 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese consumers have the false impression that American beef is as tough as 
sandals," Saito said. "We aim to correct that." 
</P>
<P>
Saito said he has taken every precaution to make his product safe. The machines 
are equipped with an emergency device that stops operation if the temperature 
inside rises above minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is it they can grant permits for vending machines to sell ice cream and 
box lunches, and not frozen meat?" he asked. "The meat is going to be cooked 
and prepared before anybody eats it, which will pose far less of a health 
problem than food that goes directly into peoples' mouths. Something is very 
strange with their logic." 
</P>
<P>
Nobuhiro Furumatsu, an official in Kobe's public health department, said 
Hamilton Japan did not apply for a health permit until after it announced its 
vending machine scheme in a media blitz. City officials were perplexed, having 
never heard of meat being sold in a machine. After receiving complaints from 
more conventional meat sellers, they decided to turn the matter over to the 
central government in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been contacted by representatives of the local beef industry asking that 
we ensure that health standards are strictly enforced," Furumatsu said. 
</P>
<P>
How to monitor health standards in unmanned vending machines is a vexing 
problem, said Shunsaku Minami, an official in charge of studying the matter at 
the Health and Welfare Ministry's dairy and meat hygiene department. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until now, there has always been somebody at the place of sale to oversee 
the conditions under which the meat is sold. We need to find out how hygienic 
standards are going to be kept under control," Minami said. "I'm afraid I can't 
tell you how long this will take." 
</P>
<P>
Once the ministry drafts guidelines granting permits for meat sales in vending 
machines, Hamilton Japan will need to apply for separate meat retailing permits 
in each municipality where it intends to install the devices, Minami said. 
</P>
<P>
Saito said he believes that a group of trading firms that once made up the Beef 
Importers' Council are secretly lobbying against his plan. Last July, the Fair 
Trade Commission branded the council an illegal cartel and ordered it to 
disband. The commission ruled that the council had colluded to rig bids on 
sales contracts with the quasi-governmental Livestock Industry Promotion Corp. 
but imposed no penalties.

China's wage increases continued to outstrip price rises in April, but urban 
inflation, a catalyst behind last year's bloody political turmoil, is again on 
the rise. 
</P>
<P>
The State Statistical Bureau said prices in urban areas rose 4.6% in April, 
compared to the same month a year ago, while wages for all workers climbed 
10.5% to $4.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, urban inflation averaged only 3.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Western economists said the government was buying social stability in the 
approach to the first anniversary of the unrest last June when troops thundered 
into Beijing to crush mass pro-democracy demonstrations. Hundreds of people 
were killed. China will also host the Asian Games in September. 
</P>
<P>
A major gripe against the government in 1989 was an average inflation rate of 
18%, compared to salary increases of 14%.

Political and social instability, a labor shortage, high prices and rising 
crime are making foreign and local investors look away from Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment approvals fell about 48% to $138 million in April from $267 
million in 1989, the steepest fall in two years, the Investment Commission 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment by the Taiwanese jumped 276% to $139 million from $37 
million during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we were known as an investors' heaven, but these favorable factors 
no longer exist in Taiwan," said Lu Ming-jen, economics professor at National 
Chengchi University. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said local and foreign businessmen were looking for somewhere else 
with a better investment climate. 
</P>
<P>
Constitutional reform protests, high prices and wages, and reports of a rising 
crime rate had slowed foreign investment in Taiwan and were driving local money 
out, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Bureau of Statistics said Taiwan's private domestic investment 
would grow at a real 3.3% this year, down from last year's 5.44%. Domestic 
investment rose 11% to 24% between 1986 and 1988.

The Beijing-owned Bank of China opened for business in Hong Kong last week in a 
70-story, prism-shaped skyscraper that dominates the city's skyline and has 
sparked superstitious worries among residents. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,289-foot-tall skyscraper, designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. 
Pei, is the tallest building in the British colony, which is to be handed back 
to the Communist mainland in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
But the building's four right-angled triangular prisms, placed together to form 
a long, thin square column topped by twin antennas, have been condemned by many 
of the territory's superstitious residents. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars of fung shui -- literally the study of wind and water -- say the 
building's design is a sure sign of bad luck. The sharp edges on the 
interlocking triangles that make up the sides of the building are said to be 
like daggers, the twin antennas that top off the tower like empty chopsticks. 
Both symbols are bad omens, according to fung shui. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the more superstitious residents living near the building have hung 
small mirrors outside their windows to reflect the tower's bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
The project ran eight months behind schedule and millions of dollars over 
budget.

TEMBISA, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sue Ingram felt sick with fear. She didn't know where she would sleep or what 
she would eat. She imagined bugs crawling around her feet and throngs of black 
people who might resent her, even kill her. 
</P>
<P>
Her bags stood beside the door of her warm, secure home. She had packed 
carefully, nothing too fancy but nothing too casual, either. 
</P>
<P>
She took a last look at herself in the mirror: She was 55 years old, a 
descendant of the first white settlers in South Africa, the product of a life 
of white privilege. And she was about to take her first step into a black 
township. She quickly put on some rouge to hide the pale fear. 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later she was in Tembisa, her throat burning from the haze of coal 
smoke. Crowded taxi-vans sped past. Thousands of blacks walked the dirt paths. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram rubbed the rouge from her now-flushed face and began to think that maybe 
her friends had been right all along. Maybe this was a foolhardy mission. But 
it was too late to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
Down a rutted dirt road, past an overflowing trash bin and houses with only 
candles for light, she found Joyce Mkuwane's house. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, Sue, for coming to my home," Mkuwane said. "And thank you for not 
thinking we're animals." 
</P>
<P>
So began an emotional and eye-opening voyage for two ordinary women, one white 
and one black, across generations of fear and distrust in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Black and white leaders are talking to each other as equals these days about 
the country's future. But deal-making alone cannot bridge the divide carved by 
42 years of legal racial segregation and centuries of master-servant 
relationships. Closing that gap begins not with news conferences and formal 
agreements but with people like Sue Ingram and Joyce Mkuwane, in places like 
Tembisa. 
</P>
<P>
Tembisa is a sprawling ghetto of 450,000 people, one of the satellites created 
by South African social engineers as a repository of cheap black labor for the 
white-run factories and homes of Johannesburg. Like most townships, Tembisa is 
hidden from the main thoroughfares and the eyes of white motorists. It is not 
on the way to anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Mkuwane lives here with her husband, Thomas, a son and daughter-in-law 
and a granddaughter. A large woman with a gap-toothed smile, Joyce is 48 years 
old, the mother of three and the owner of several day-care centers. Thomas is a 
supervisor for the state-run bus company, where he started out as a driver 18 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Their home stands in a barren tract with thousands of look-alike concrete 
houses known as "matchboxes," each with four rooms and an outdoor toilet. But 
the Mkuwanes have used their money and carpentry skills to expand their 
matchbox to 10 rooms that cover their small plot of land. 
</P>
<P>
When Sue Ingram stepped through the front door, she found Thomas watching 
television in a living room overstuffed with soft furniture, plants and 
paintings. It was "nice and warm, clean-smelling," Ingram remembers. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, but this is beautiful," Ingram told her hosts and added, modestly, "I'm 
afraid to have you come to my house. I don't have all the nice things you 
have." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram lives 10 miles away on a quiet, middle-class street in Germiston, an 
industrial suburb of Johannesburg. The road in front of her house is paved, and 
no two houses are alike. The manicured lawns and lush shade trees are protected 
by short fences and private security company signs that promise a quick "armed 
response" to reports of prowlers. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram, a small, thin homemaker, is also the mother of three grown children. 
Her husband, Bob, now retired, was a supervisor with the state-run airline. 
</P>
<P>
She had decided to visit Tembisa when she saw an item in the church program one 
Sunday morning about a weekend "Christian encounter" between whites and blacks 
in the township. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read that, my heart gave a little jump," Ingram remembers. She showed 
it to her husband, who said, "That's for you." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after she had signed up, though, Ingram began to have doubts. Concerned 
friends asked her again and again: Was she sure it was the right thing to do? 
Could the actions of one person really make any difference in South Africa? 
</P>
<P>
Ingram had to admit that the closest she had come to a township was when she 
drove past the grass huts of South Africa's rural black homelands. Her first 
thought had always been, "I hope the car doesn't break down." 
</P>
<P>
Making her decision more difficult was a pamphlet being circulated in the 
townships that urged blacks to rise up and kill whites. Anti-apartheid leaders 
had condemned it, and many thought it the work of right-wing whites trying to 
stir up trouble for the government. But it was hard to ignore because, as 
Ingram said, "it was all written down." 
</P>
<P>
As the date of the encounter approached, Ingram twice changed her mind about 
going. She became a nervous wreck, crying over the most insignificant things. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ashamed of myself for being scared," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, faith, or maybe fatalism, saw her through. Whatever happened, she 
figured, the Lord was on her side. If only that would be enough. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her worries began to fade the first night, when she sat down for dinner 
in Tembisa. Joyce covered the table with chicken and mealie pap, a thick 
maize-meal porridge that is the staple of most African meals. Thomas decreed 
that the family would speak only English during Sue's stay. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing, really," she recalled. "They were chatting to me as if I was 
one of them." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that worried her was the Mkuwanes' neighbors. She was afraid that 
they would see the white house guest and make trouble for the Mkuwanes later. 
But Joyce reassured her that "nothing like that will happen." 
</P>
<P>
As midnight approached, Ingram tried to explain, over coffee and dessert, why 
she had decided to come. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see," she said. "You're never too old to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Mkuwane turned the living room sofa into a bed for her guest. "I stay 
here when Tommy and I have a fight," she said with a conspiratorial laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram giggled. "I do that at home sometimes, too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning Mkuwane put a kettle on the stove for tea, and the two women 
chatted leisurely like old friends. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't rush anything," Ingram said later. "When they start rushing is when 
they're too late already. They just live." 
</P>
<P>
The Mkuwanes own a car, but the purpose of the encounter was to introduce their 
visitor to life in a township, so Joyce and Ingram walked two blocks to the 
taxi stand. Black strangers waved, and Ingram, with her host's tutoring, began 
greeting people in Zulu -- "Sabona" for one person and "Sabonane" for a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The women squeezed into one of the private taxi vans that carry millions of 
blacks to work each day. Ingram was nervous, but she tried not to let it show. 
</P>
<P>
"You're in this black taxi with all these black people, and I guess you're a 
bit scared that they might turn on you or something," Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
Walking the streets of Tembisa and riding taxis turned out to be "much safer 
than I thought," she said, adding: "But there are still some blacks who look at 
you with eyes of hate. They hate white people because of apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
As Ingram and Mkuwane talked, they discovered that they shared many of the same 
values and concerns about life, but differences in their background and 
experience were apparent, too. They didn't talk much about those. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Mkuwane had spent most of her life as a nurse, working in whites-only 
hospitals and white homes, seeing the inequities of apartheid up close. 
</P>
<P>
"Our blacks know about whites," she said. "But whites don't know blacks at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
She quit work at a private, multiracial hospital when she overheard two white 
doctors discussing the death of a brain-damaged black child. 
</P>
<P>
"That's minus one garden boy," she quoted one of the doctors as saying with a 
shrug. 
</P>
<P>
One of her most vivid memories was the bloody uprising of 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
"If the police saw four of us on the street, they would start shooting," she 
said. "I didn't know from one day to the next whether my children would come 
home alive." 
</P>
<P>
Although she didn't admit it to Ingram, Mkuwane said, she remains "a little bit 
bitter" about the way whites have treated blacks. "But in my heart of hearts," 
she said, "I want to make friends with whites. I wish more whites wanted to 
make friends with us." 
</P>
<P>
Sue Ingram, on the other hand, had seen little of the effects of apartheid. She 
grew up on a farm near Johannesburg. Her father, a construction foreman, moved 
the family to the city when she was 13. She married and raised her children in 
an environment of white schools, white hospitals, white neighborhoods, even 
white parks. 
</P>
<P>
Although she supported racial reform in South Africa, the only blacks Ingram 
knew were her maid, her neighbors' maids and the black customers at the 
pharmacy where she worked for a time. She remembers those black customers as 
"very proud people" who always insisted, against her recommendation, on buying 
goods with the highest prices even when similar, less expensive goods were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they trusted us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In their long talks, Ingram and Mkuwane tiptoed into politics, to which so many 
conversations in South Africa eventually turn. But both were wary of the 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make her feel at home, to be accepted, so I tried to avoid talking 
about anything I knew would worry her," Mkuwane said. 
</P>
<P>
She was particularly concerned that Ingram might be shocked by some of her 
radical opinions, such as her belief that whites should invite their black 
maids to the dinner table, and her deep suspicion that the government's recent 
reforms are "just more tricks." 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be the sort of person who just succumbed" to the system, Mkuwane 
told a reporter later. "But now I'm very revolutionary. If I know my rights, I 
stand up for them." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram too held back some of her innermost thoughts. She did not tell Mkuwane, 
for example, of her deep concern that a black government would run whites out 
of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
But Ingram admitted to her host that she felt guilty "because of the way you 
have been treated, being pushed into places like Tembisa. Even if you put a dog 
in a pigsty, that dog is going to live like a pig very soon." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram said later she suspected that Mkuwane would support a quick black 
takeover of power in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame her," Ingram said. "But some of the blacks blame everything on 
the whites, and it's not our fault. It's our forefathers'. But that's the past. 
Many of us want it to be different now." 
</P>
<P>
On Ingram's last night in Tembisa, Mkuwane got an urgent call from a friend, a 
black councilor in the township. The councilor was worried that radical young 
blacks, who regard the council as an instrument of white oppression, were 
planning to attack her home. Mkuwane and Ingram rushed to the councilor's 
house. It was late, and Ingram was frightened. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for a place where I could hide," Ingram said. "They offered to 
take me back, but I said, 'I'm in it with you, so I might as well stay.' But I 
was thinking, 'Yes, please take me home.' " 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be a false alarm. But when they got home, Ingram swallowed one 
of the tranquilizers she had packed. 
</P>
<P>
"My poor heart," Ingram said. "Even an hour after taking that tablet, my heart 
was still beating fast." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, Ingram's last day in Tembisa, the Mkuwanes were running late 
for church. Joyce still had to take a bath and iron her dress, so Ingram 
offered to do the ironing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the strangest thing," she said. "I thought, 'Here I am ironing a black 
girl's dress. The first time in my life.' It was unreal." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram was one of 80 whites who signed up for the Tembisa encounter, but 20 
dropped out at the last minute under pressure from worried friends and family. 
Barry Poppleton, the organizer, said he had many more blacks volunteering to be 
hosts than whites willing to be guests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very sad," Poppleton said. "There's so much positive happening in South 
Africa today, but there is still a lot of fear, too. And getting together is 
the only way to prepare people for the social transformation that is coming." 
</P>
<P>
Rain fell that Sunday afternoon, and Ingram and Mkuwane said goodby to each 
other with a long hug in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
"I love Sue," Mkuwane said. "I only wish there were more whites like her." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram was more hopeful. "At least there were a few pink faces in Tembisa," she 
said. "And we have something to tell our friends about." 
</P>
<P>
A day later, Sue Ingram picked up the phone in her white neighborhood and 
placed a call to her new friend, Joyce Mkuwane. Just to say hello.

COCA PRICE COLLAPSE OFFERS OPPORTUNITY IN DRUG WAR

ETERAMAZAMA, Bolivia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coca prices have collapsed in Peru and Bolivia, giving the United States an 
unprecedented opportunity to strike the traffic in cocaine at its source by 
helping farmers say no. 
</P>
<P>
A crackdown on drug lords in Colombia and tougher enforcement in Peru and 
Bolivia have reduced demand for coca leaves, the source of cocaine, and prices 
have come down as a result. Now, thousands of farmers are looking for alternate 
crops and for help to make the switch. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a window of opportunity, there is no question about it," one U.S. 
diplomat in Bolivia said. 
</P>
<P>
But unless the farmers get the aid they need -- to raise substitute crops, 
process them and get them to market -- the window could slam shut. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in Peru, sources say, the United States and other cocaine-consuming 
countries appear to be letting the opportunity slip by. Under the policy 
adopted by Washington, development projects in the coca-growing zones have been 
virtually shelved because of security problems. U.S. policy emphasizes police 
and military action against the traffickers and leftist guerrillas operating in 
the coca zones. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Bolivia, U.S. aid is supporting crop substitution in the Chapare 
Valley, the country's principal coca area. But farmers have little faith in it, 
saying the move does not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin Valderrama has torn out some of his coca bushes and is planting 
pineapples, coconut palms and macadamia trees. But Valderrama, who heads the 
Eteramazama Civic Committee, said that aid to farmers is slow in coming -- and 
there is no market in sight for new products. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to produce something that has no market, we are back where we 
started," Valderrama said. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Peru and Colombia produce the bulk of the world's coca, most of which 
is refined into cocaine and smuggled into the United States and Europe by 
Colombian traffickers. According to U.S. estimates, Peru grew 296,000 acres of 
coca in 1989, Bolivia raised 133,000 acres, and Colombia had 99,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, in a move that had an almost immediate impact on the economics of 
cocaine, Colombian authorities declared war on the trafficking networks and 
timed it to coincide with a stepped-up drive against growers and shippers in 
Peru and Bolivia. Officials say this action has sharply reduced the demand for 
cocaine paste, a semi-refined product in the cocaine process. And as demand has 
fallen, these officials add, so too have prices. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the price of coca leaf in Bolivia was the equivalent of about 85 
cents a pound. By April, it had plunged to about 12 cents. It costs the farmers 
about 30 cents a pound to plant, nurture and pick the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ruined," Fortunato Arnez, 45, a stout man with a friendly smile, 
lamented in an interview. "Everyone trusted only in coca. They shouldn't have 
done that." 
</P>
<P>
Arnez, sitting with friends at a red Formica table in an open-air 
restaurant-bar in Eteramazama, said he is surviving thanks to his home-grown 
oranges, bananas and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people are starving," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, in the village of Chipiriri, a government agricultural extension center 
provides training for farmers who want to raise animals or grow crops other 
than coca. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we had one person in a week or 15 days, but now three or four a day 
come looking for information and technical assistance," said Franklin Lastra, 
the director. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, two farmers waited to talk to him about signing up for a course on 
raising pigs. One of the men, Julian Guevara, 26, said they had walked 9 miles, 
sleeping by the roadside. Guevara said he has 2 acres of coca leaves ready to 
be picked, but that he was not harvesting much because it is not worth 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"For almost six months coca has been down, and we are low on funds," he said. 
"That is why we want to raise pigs." 
</P>
<P>
But his companion, 32-year-old German Jimenez, a sharecropper who destroyed 
more than 5 acres of coca two years ago, said he has trouble making a living 
with other crops, such as watermelons. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices are low," he said. "There is no market to go to, and the roads are bad. 
If we don't get help, we are going to plant coca again." 
</P>
<P>
Many Chapare coca farmers are shifting to other crops but keeping some coca 
too. Hilario Claros, 29, said he hopes 1 1/2 acres of coca will help tide him 
over while he waits for his new macadamia nut trees and coconut palms to 
mature. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it isn't profitable, coca is our only cash crop," Claros said. "We 
can't give it up." 
</P>
<P>
Still, depressed coca prices have helped persuade record numbers of Bolivian 
farmers to eradicate coca bushes. So far this year, 8,400 acres of coca are 
reported to have been pulled up, compared to 6,200 acres in all of 1989 and 
3,500 acres in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the Chapare Valley's coca acreage will drop 10%, one 
pleased U.S. official estimated, adding, "That's not too bad." 
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian government pays farmers about $810 an acre for cutting back on 
coca, which is grown legally in parts of the country. At least part of this 
compensation can come from U.S. aid money, but the rush to eradicate has 
strained the national budget. 
</P>
<P>
"It's far more than this government contemplated having to spend," said one 
American official, adding that the U.S. Embassy in La Paz is seeking more funds 
from Washington to support the program. 
</P>
<P>
Peru, on the other hand, has no important development or substitution programs 
in the Upper Huallaga Valley, the heart of its coca region. While Bolivia is at 
peace and economically stable, Peru has been ravaged by hyper-inflation and a 
war against leftist guerrillas from Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path). The 
conflict has been even more difficult since the guerrillas linked up with the 
peasants who grow coca. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, peasants in the valley were paid 90 cents to $1.35 a pound for 
their coca leaf. Now, according to Iban de Rementeria, who until recently 
headed a United Nations development program in the region, the price is about 
13 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Any price below 45 cents a pound means selling at a loss, he said, so the 
moment is ideal to rush in with alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been insisting on this for six months," Rementeria said, "but the 
United States doesn't want to do anything until the Peruvian government 
develops a policy." 
</P>
<P>
He said promoting development in the valley would undermine the Sendero 
Luminoso guerrillas, whose image already has been marred by their inability to 
check the fall in coca prices. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels lost considerable influence last September when U.S. and Peruvian 
officials abandoned the policy of forced eradication, which the guerrillas had 
used to rally peasant support. Now, the government eradicates only nurseries of 
coca seedlings, hoping to limit new growth. 
</P>
<P>
By law, Bolivia is committed to eradicating 12,350 acres of coca this year 
through a voluntary program, and the goal must be met to avoid reductions in 
U.S. aid. However, American officials would like to see the goal surpassed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a stampede going and we've got to take advantage, or excuses aren't 
going to hold," said Donald Ferrarone, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration's mission in Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Agency for International Development has been trying for 
more than five years, through a crop substitution program, to wean Bolivian 
farmers from coca. Joe Lopez, an agronomist from New Mexico, helps run the 
program under a contract with Experience Inc., a Minneapolis-based development 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, 45, has helped the Bolivian government's Regional Program for 
Alternative Development import seeds and plants: black pepper, passion fruit, 
oil palms, coconut palms, starfruit, macadamia nuts, pineapples, papayas, 
plantain, ginger, and other spices and crops. 
</P>
<P>
The program's 25 technicians and 17 extension agents are training more than 100 
"promoters" -- farmers who operate demonstration farms and help others learn 
how to cultivate the substitute crops, available at community nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
When coca was king in the Chapare Valley, Lopez recalled, few farmers were 
interested in the substitution program. But five years of struggle have made it 
possible to provide the services now in demand. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had waited until last year, we wouldn't have been prepared for this sort 
of thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are problems. Farmers working with the program produced 40 
tons of ginger in March, but little of it has been sold, according to Jose 
Decker, the Bolivian executive director of the Program for Alternative 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I am trying to stop ginger production because I don't know where I will 
sell it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Decker worries that the loss of income from coca will create social and 
political problems. Before the price collapse, he said, coca brought $500 
million a year into Bolivia, the poorest country in South America. He estimates 
that $300 million a year is needed in foreign aid to develop a "substitute 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
This year the United States is sending $31 million in drug-related aid to 
Bolivia, and the amount is scheduled to triple in fiscal 1991, which begins 
Oct. 1. In Peru, U.S. aid for the drug program will rise from $3 million to $63 
million -- but none of the new money is destined for the coca-growing zones. 
Instead, it will go to programs designed to shore up the national economy and 
replace the $800 million to $1.2 billion a year that coca has brought in. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the program in Peru, the United States has offered $35.9 million in 
military aid to help the army deal with the Sendero Luminoso. Most of the funds 
will go for equipment and training of combat troops by U.S. Special Forces. 
</P>
<P>
But according to official sources, lame-duck President Alan Garcia is not 
likely to sign a military aid agreement unless it is accompanied by a 
substantial economic development program. Alberto Fujimori, the front-runner to 
succeed Garcia, also has talked about the importance of reviving the coca 
area's economy to reduce its dependence on the crop. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the coca farmers' cooperative is begging for support for crop 
substitution programs, promising to give up coca once realistic alternatives 
are offered. 
</P>
<P>
"While they give war, war and more war, we are offering development," said 
Justo Silva, manager of the Upper Huallaga Agrarian Cooperative, which has 42 
town committees in the valley. "There has never been a better moment than now 
to attack the problem of coca from the perspective of development." 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. Embassy official acknowledged: "We do have an opportunity, and we're 
not going to take it. We've become so bureaucratically hidebound and inept that 
we're not going to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he blamed the Peruvian government for failing to draft a 
coherent development plan that the United States can support. 
</P>
<P>
"The police are huddled down in Santa Lucia," the valley's anti-drug base, he 
said, and the valley is "effectively in the hands of Sendero Luminoso and other 
traffickers." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Juan Zarate, commander of the Peruvian anti-drug police, told The Times 
that he and other officials have devised a pilot program for the valley that is 
ready to begin as soon as the money is made available. 
</P>
<P>
He said the plan, which would cost about $20 million, would provide farmers 
with seeds and seedlings, technical advice, small processing plants, better 
roads to markets and financial credits. 
</P>
<P>
"The money we might have spent to pull out coca plant by plant we are going to 
invest in these lands, fostering development," he said. "At the end of one 
year, lifestyles will start to change, and the people will abandon coca -- the 
coca will die by itself."

ROMANIANS GO TO POLLS, WARILY TEST DEMOCRACY 
</P>

BUCHAREST, Romania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Romanians braved icy stares and unspoken threats to cast their ballots Sunday 
in elections expected to be swept by the governing National Salvation Front 
after the most troubled campaign in the spree of elections this spring among 
Eastern Europe's self-styled democracies. 
</P>
<P>
Bucharest Radio said that outright acts of violence were rare, although several 
complaints filtered into the capital alleging that ballots in some rural 
regions near Iasi and Cluj had been marked before being given to voters. 
</P>
<P>
In one incident in Bucharest, reporters observing two election workers charged 
with bringing the ballot box to house-bound invalids saw them stamping the 
forms for the National Salvation Front. 
</P>
<P>
International observers said they were aware of "grave irregularities" but 
declined to make any public statements until today. 
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was strong for the first multi-party ballot in half a century 
here, with more than 75% of the nation's eligible voters having shown up before 
8 p.m. Polling hours were extended until midnight from the originally planned 
11 p.m. closure after hundreds called election officials to say they hadn't 
been able to vote earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The front and its presidential candidate, Ion Iliescu, were widely seen as the 
favorites in the election, the results of which will not be known before 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A West German polling firm that proved extremely accurate in fore casting the 
outcome of the March 18 vote in East Germany conducted exit polls at 252 voting 
places in Romania on Sunday. On the basis of more than 16,000 interviews, the 
Bonn-based INFAS firm predicted a whopping 83% for Iliescu and 66% of the 
Parliament seats for the front. 
</P>
<P>
But polls are of dubious credibility in Romania, where people are still 
inclined to say what they feel they should, rather than what they think. 
Samplings of Romanian media and research institutes have forecast at least 60% 
of the presidential vote for Iliescu, whose main challengers are returned 
emigres Radu Campeanu of the Liberal Party and Ion Ratiu of the National 
Peasants Party. 
</P>
<P>
The front, which took power after dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled in 
December, had valuable state resources at its disposal for the campaign, such 
as air transport, the state motor pool and printing presses. The front was 
repeatedly accused of having unfair advantages over its opponents and of 
prompting ruffians in the countryside to attack or intimidate rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the capital, under the scrutiny of hundreds of foreign journalists and 
election monitors, the atmosphere at the polls was one of hope shadowed by 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
In the schoolyard surrounding the German Lyceum in central Bucharest, Natalie 
Bonciu looked around nervously and dropped her voice to a whisper to say that 
the campaign had been dominated by the front. 
</P>
<P>
"The souls of the people are not cured yet. After such a period of terror, 
everyone is still fearful," said the 60-year-old economist, like many of her 
countrymen decked out in her best clothes for the electoral occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still afraid to speak our minds," interjected her 76-year-old cousin 
Maria. 
</P>
<P>
Both women said they had voted with their conscience but were worried that too 
many others had been persuaded by front campaign propaganda that no other 
political force is qualified to govern. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolae Matase, an 80-year-old retired lawyer who moves slowly with the aid of 
a battered wooden cane, hobbled out of the same polling place, declaring to 
those still waiting to cast their ballots: "I voted for the Liberals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid. They can't harm me," the pensioner stated defiantly, referring 
to the front. 
</P>
<P>
He said the campaign had been hijacked by the governing party and warned that 
tensions in Romania are likely to escalate after the vote is counted and the 
Communists' former monopoly on power is simply transferred to the front. 
</P>
<P>
"I fear a civil war is brewing," Matase predicted ominously. "It is hard to 
inspire ordinary Romanians to action, but once you get them going there is no 
stopping them." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people opposed to Iliescu and the front have been staging a 
nonstop rally in thecapital's University Square since April 22, denouncing the 
interim governing force as a neo-Communist Party that seeks to ensure its 
continued grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, which has blocked traffic and turned the lawn of the nearby 
National Theater into an open-air toilet, slimmed down to a few hundred people 
during daylight hours Sunday, when some of those who had been swelling the 
protest's ranks went off to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few miles southeast in the working-class suburb of Bragadiru, the mood 
of the voters was both more festive and less diverse. The towns and villages 
outside of Romania's major cities are believed to be solid beds of support for 
the front. 
</P>
<P>
Adults smoked and gossiped on the scruffy lawn and sidewalks in front of the 
Bragadiru House of Culture, waiting for the three-hour line at the polling 
place to dwindle and watching over the children brought along as if to a 
community picnic. An accordion player pressed out folk music under a solitary 
chestnut tree, and wafts of acrid-sweet air drifted over the crowd from a 
nearby distillery. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone had a fair chance to present his ideas. All the parties were on 
television and radio," said Emilia Chitac, a transport worker and mother of 
three. She declined to disclose who she would vote for, pointing out that the 
ballot is secret, but made clear that she is firmly behind the front. 
</P>
<P>
Ion Nicolae, an oil industry mechanic who travels around the country 
extensively, said he thought the campaign had been fair and that those 
protesting in central Bucharest were upset because their candidates were going 
to lose. 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, he looked to other men who had edged within earshot, exchanging 
nods and glances to ensure each other that they were all on the right side. 
</P>
<P>
"I voted for Iliescu," said Elena Tincea, looking nervously to her husband for 
permission to speak. Asked why she supports the front, she paused uncertainly, 
then credited the governing power with the "small changes" Romanians have 
enjoyed since the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the allure of the front has been its ability to put food in the shops 
and restore electricity to homes and offices that, under Ceausescu's Draconian 
economics, were limited to as little as two hours of heating and lights each 
day last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu voted quietly and without comment to the few press photographers who 
managed to reachhis polling place before he showed up at 6 a.m., when polls 
opened nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The official counting process is expected to take days, with results of the 
presidential race expected no sooner than late Tuesday and the distribution of 
119 Senate seats and 387 seats in the Assembly of Deputies not to be known 
until Wednesday.

FEINSTEIN, VAN DE KAMP FOCUS ON CRIME, BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
DEBATE: SHE ASSAILS HIM ON THE DEATH PENALTY. HE QUESTIONS HER FISCAL 
MANAGEMENT ABILITIES.

Scrambling to harness momentum for their down-to-the-wire campaigns, the 
Democratic candidates for governor zeroed in on their opponent's perceived 
vulnerabilities during Sunday evening's hourlong debate -- Dianne Feinstein 
persistently questioning John K. Van de Kamp's dedication to the death penalty 
and Van de Kamp challenging her fitness to be the state's fiscal manager. 
</P>
<P>
In the second of two hard-fought debates, probably their last before the June 5 
primary, the Democrats reinforced the messages they have sought to drive home 
during the long months of the campaign -- Van de Kamp the lawyerly, even stodgy 
public servant with a specific agenda; Feinstein, the personification of 
progressive change in her quest to become the state's first woman governor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in this election you have a choice between a lawyer and someone who 
wants to be a leader," Feinstein told questioners at KCBS-TV studios in Los 
Angeles and viewers throughout the state. "I want to represent women. I want to 
open the door. I want to see that minorities take their place in this society 
in a meaningful way." 
</P>
<P>
But Van de Kamp tried to underscore his contention that Feinstein is heavy on 
style and light on substance. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is you can't govern California with generalities. You can't rely on 
image and 30-second commercials," he said. "What major proposal is Dianne 
fighting for? . . . Commissions are no substitute for commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Touting the three initiatives that he has pressed to get on the November 
ballot, Van de Kamp labeled Feinstein as "pretty weak" in comparison. But 
Feinstein tartly compared her executive experience as San Francisco's mayor to 
Van de Kamp's tenure as attorney general. "You know, John, you demean your 
opponent and puff yourself up," she said. "The fact is, you've never really put 
together a budget, you've never really grappled with a shortfall. I have -- 
nine years in a row. You've never had to put together an AIDS program. . . . 
Yet you're so willing to sit back and criticize me." 
</P>
<P>
As did last week's debate in San Francisco, the Los Angeles debate focused 
largely on crime and budgets, the emotional and pocketbook concerns of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp was repeatedly called to task on the death penalty, which he 
personally opposes but has vowed to carry out. Criticized in recent months for 
maintaining a high profile as convicted murderer Robert Alton Harris neared the 
gas chamber, the attorney general said he opposed the televising of executions 
because they should not be "a public circus event." He also said he opposes 
changing California law so that juveniles could be sent to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
But Feinstein took issue with the distinction Van de Kamp has tried to draw 
regarding his public and private views. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is one of those issues you've got to be for what you are for. . . 
. I know you've called the death penalty both barbaric and a blot," Feinstein 
said. "I also know that if you had your way, the Hillside Strangler today would 
be on the street." 
</P>
<P>
While Los Angeles County district attorney in 1981, Van de Kamp decided against 
filing murder charges against Angelo Buono, one of two men convicted in the 
notorious series of hillside killings. The case was turned over to the attorney 
general's office, which won the murder convictions. 
</P>
<P>
During the debate Van de Kamp refused to say how he would handle the governor's 
clemency privilege, despite suggestions by Feinstein that he would feel morally 
compelled to commute death sentences. And he declined to say how he would react 
if, during his tenure as governor, the question of the death penalty were to 
appear on a state ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But Van de Kamp took the offensive on the issue of the state budget, announcing 
that he would release after the debate a comprehensive list of budget cuts and 
tax increases that would balance the state's budget, which is currently running 
at a $3.6 billion deficit. He challenged Feinstein to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for $1.3 billion in budget cuts -- the biggest reductions from a 
5% cut in administrative costs -- and $2.3 billion in tax increases. Feinstein 
declined to comment on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's debate, Van de Kamp struck at Feinstein -- as he did at the first 
debate -- for her willingness to negotiate the cost-of-living adjustments for 
the blind, disabled and elderly to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Mrs. Feinstein would put cost-of-living adjustments on the table for 
the needy, blind and disabled. . . . I will not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the touchy subject of abortion -- which was raised repeatedly last Sunday 
and during the week because of Feinstein's characterization of sex-selection 
abortions as a "misuse" of abortion rights -- it was Van de Kamp who was on the 
hot seat Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he would counsel his daughter if she were a pregnant teen-ager, Van 
de Kamp underscored his personal opposition to abortion, which runs counter to 
his political support of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I'd have a heart-to-heart with her and talk about the future of that 
potential life," he said. "I'd counsel her to carry the child and let her know 
that she was going to have a grandmother and a grandfather who really cared 
about her and make sure she grew up with a real future." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp acknowledged that he would feel "less comfortable" in offering the 
same advice to a stranger, and he said he believes minors have the right to 
decide for themselves whether to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
He did not address, despite being asked, why his office has defended in court 
the state law requiring parental consent for minors seeking abortions. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of malathion spraying to eradicate the Medfly, both candidates 
agreed they would halt -- and not resume -- the aerial spraying of the 
pesticide in urban areas. Feinstein said she would rely on a ground war, using 
the young people from the Conservation Corps and "the National Guard, if 
necessary" to strip trees and spray locally. 
</P>
<P>
"You would do it by ground with the knowledge and permission of the property 
owner rather than through this massive invasion of spraying like 'Apocalypse 
Now,' which I think is very bothersome to people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp attacked one of Feinstein's recently proposed ideas -- to inspect 
first-class mail for fruit that might carry the pest -- calling it a "crazy" 
invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
A discussion of the state's continuing wrestling match with the cost and 
availability of automobile insurance drew the first brusque retort, after Van 
de Kamp said Feinstein had allied herself with elements of the insurance 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"John, why don't you let me tell people what I believe rather than you telling 
people what I believe?" Feinstein said sharply. "I think it would be far more 
accurate." 
</P>
<P>
Both said they favored rate rollbacks for California drivers. 
</P>
<P>
On a smattering of other issues, there was occasional agreement. Both said they 
opposed construction of a Peripheral Canal that would bring water from Northern 
California to the arid south. Both used a tragedy from the past to press for 
strict controls on weapons -- Van de Kamp the Stockton schoolyard massacre and 
Feinstein the assassination of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone, whose death 
elevated her to the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to know where the guns are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Right off the bat, Van de Kamp continued using the debate format to put his 
opponent on the spot, frequently using his rebuttal period to ask questions 
that, because of the format, she could not answer. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp also seemed more able to work within the confines of the format in 
answering questions, timing his responses to fit nicely within the strictures. 
Feinstein, in contrast, regularly ran over her time limit and had to be quieted 
by the moderator, who said her warning light was not working properly. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein and Van de Kamp stood six feet apart at the same podiums before which 
they had debated in San Francisco -- the props were trucked down for Sunday's 
rematch. She wore a navy blue suit and white blouse, he a navy blue suit and 
red tie. 
</P>
<P>
The debate was preceded and followed on KCBS-TV by commercials touting the man 
the two Democrats are fighting for the right to face in November -- U.S. Sen. 
Pete Wilson. The Republican has no substantial opposition for his party's 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
By the wishes of the candidate, there was no audience in the studio except for 
the moderator, KCBS anchorman Jim Lampley, and the questioners -- Los Angeles 
Daily News reporter Rick Orlov, San Diego Union reporter Gerry Braun, KCBS 
reporter Terry Anzur and Frank del Olmo, deputy editor of the Los Angeles 
Times' editorial pages.

<P>
DIPLOMACY: FUTURE OF GERMANY EMERGES AS THE TOP UNRESOLVED ISSUE FOR THE 
UPCOMING SUMMIT.

<P>
Declaring himself "somewhat encouraged" by progress toward a new nuclear arms 
treaty with the Soviet Union, President Bush cautioned Sunday that "other 
problems" in U.S.-Soviet relations remain. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had differences with the Soviets for a long, long time on a wide array 
of subjects," Bush said, citing particularly the future of Germany. He made his 
remarks to reporters on Air Force One shortly before taking off from Houston en 
route here. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's comments, his most extensive since Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
completed four days of negotiations with Soviet leaders in Moscow, underlined 
the degree to which German unification and its implications for the balance of 
power in Europe is emerging as the major unresolved issue for the Bush-Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev summit that begins May 30. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in the arms control area, there's clearly been some progress" and 
"we'll have a good summit," Bush said. But on other parts of the summit agenda, 
particularly Germany, "we're just plugging away." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody thought it would be easy," Bush added. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who spoke with Bush by telephone Sunday morning, resolved most major 
issues blocking progress on a new nuclear weapons treaty and an agreement 
drastically reducing chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker was unable to break a deadlock over Germany and a resulting stall in 
talks on reducing non-nuclear weapons and armies in Europe. Those unresolved 
issues will be major topics for the two presidents when they meet. 
</P>
<P>
Talks on reducing non-nuclear forces -- the so-called CFE, or conventional 
forces in Europe, negotiations -- had been moving quickly earlier in the year. 
The talks are aimed at reducing Soviet and American forces in Europe to a level 
of 195,000 for the Soviets and 225,000 for the United States. The Soviets 
currently have several times that many troops in Eastern Europe, most of them 
in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Since the East German elections in April, movement in the talks has slowed. The 
elections made clear that a united Germany will essentially be ruled by the 
current leadership of West Germany, eliminating the Soviets' most powerful 
European ally, East Germany, and grafting it onto the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
That prospect has deeply disturbed many Soviet leaders, U.S. analysts say. 
German forces have invaded Russian territory twice this century in wars that 
cost millions of lives, and fears of a possible future German threat remain 
among Soviet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze declared that the 
talks aimed at reducing U.S. and Soviet armies in Europe cannot be completed 
until some new way is found to guarantee Soviet security. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his aides have been anxious to see the talks wrapped up this year to 
"lock in" the Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Europe before any unforeseen event 
might cause a change in current Soviet policies. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he still believes a treaty on conventional forces can be completed 
before the end of the year, Bush replied, "Oh sure, sure." But he declined to 
say what steps he thought were needed to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll leave the negotiating to the negotiators," he said. "But we've got to 
get that done." 
</P>
<P>
Finishing the CFE treaty "is very important, not just to us but to all of 
Europe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was also guarded in response to questions about Lithuania, refusing to say 
whether Baker had urged Lithuanian leaders he met in Moscow to suspend their 
republic's declaration of independence from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to discuss what he talks about in private," Bush said. "If you 
negotiate all these things in public, you don't make any progress." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Administration believes Lithuania should suspend the declaration, 
which the Lithuanian leadership so far has balked at doing, Bush again declined 
to answer. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see talks going, and we want to see self-determination of the 
people of Lithuania determined. We want to have them get the freedom that a lot 
of other people have. So there's talks going on on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With Gorbachev due to arrive in Washington in 10 days for three days of summit 
talks with Bush, the White House has been anxious to avoid any sudden flare-up 
over the three Baltic republics. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia each have voted 
to secede from the Soviet Union and have been locked in a tense confrontation 
with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Bush traveled to Portland to speak at the dedication of a memorial to slain 
police officers where he delivered a by-now-standard call for tougher 
anti-crime legislation.

China's first province to approve a mandatory sterilization law for the 
mentally retarded has performed 5,500 operations in the 14 months since the law 
took effect. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the northwestern province of Gansu said their goal is to sterilize 
most of Gansu's 260,000 mentally retarded by the end of next year, the People's 
Daily said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Arid, remote Gansu, one of China's poorest regions, has several large 
concentrations of mentally and physically handicapped people, due in part to 
inbreeding in isolated villages.

Thirty-four pleasure boats carrying veterans of the Bay of Pigs invasion and 
other Cuban exiles sailed close to Cuba on Sunday in a floating anti-Castro 
protest commemorating the anniversary of the island's independence. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban patrol boats were waiting, but there were no confrontations, a Coast 
Guard spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Boats ranging in size from 16-footers to oceangoing cruisers sailed from Key 
West across the Straits of Florida toward the Cuban coast 90 miles away. The 
boats, following a Coast Guard recommendation, stayed at least 20 miles from 
shore. Participants held a religious ceremony in memory of Cubans who have lost 
their lives opposing Fidel Castro's government or trying to leave the island. 
</P>
<P>
"At least the people in Cuba will know we have not forgotten," said Alexis 
Rodriguez, a coordinator of the protest.

INSIDE TALK /WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLOBAL REACH? The Drug Enforcement Administration is about to begin a major 
personnel shake-up designed to mollify critics who see its top brass as too 
short on practical experience and too prone to John Wayne-style tactics. The 
shuffle is timed to come just before the DEA steps up its overseas activities 
as part of the Bush Administration's rapidly widening war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The changes, to take effect early next month, will bring a number of DEA 
veterans with extensive field experience into top management positions at 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major changes, Stephen H. Greene, former head of DEA's international 
programs, will become chief of operations, the No. 3 slot in the agency, 
overseeing the aggressive intelligence-gathering missions that the 
Administration has ordered. Another key change will bring Ronald J. Caffrey, 
special agent-in-charge in Atlanta, to headquarters as deputy operations chief. 
</P>
<P>
The shifts were engineered by Terrence M. Burke, a charismatic former CIA agent 
whose fast-track to power at DEA vaulted him from the No. 6 spot a year ago to 
his current post as acting administrator -- pending the arrival of U.S. Judge 
Robert C. Bonner of Los Angeles, who will be the agency's new chief. Burke is 
expected to wield power behind-the-scenes in drug-war planning sessions. 
</P>
<P>
TOO SCARCE? Barbara Bush earned bouquets of roses earlier this month for her 
stellar diplomatic performance at the inauguration of Costa Rican President 
Rafael Calderon, but if White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu's performance 
there receives anything, it's likely to be the thorns. 
</P>
<P>
An American serving on the U.S. delegation says Sununu passed up a dinner 
attended by several visiting Latin presidents the night before the ceremony, 
spending the time instead to look up Costa Rican relatives. The next day, while 
the First Lady drew enthusiastic cheers for marching to the inaugural with 
other foreign delegations and taking time to speak to excited onlookers, Sununu 
reportedly left early and failed to show up at a reception given later that 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
"Shame on him!" Bush was said to have remarked later when told of Sununu's 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Said the U.S. delegation member: "About all the work the taxpayers got out of 
the chief of staff was a 15-minute private conversation he had with President 
(Alfredo) Cristiani of El Salvador on the night he arrived." 
</P>
<P>
REPORTS BUZZ again that former Texas businessman -- and close friend of 
President Bush -- Robert A. Mosbacher is about to resign his post as commerce 
secretary, possibly to return to private life. 
</P>
<P>
Although spokesmen for the agency deny it officially, some aides say Mosbacher 
is disillusioned because the Cabinet post has not proved as important as he 
thought it would be. Others trace the secretary's purported inclination to quit 
to his wife's dissatisfaction with the Washington social scene. 
</P>
<P>
President of her own cosmetics business, the striking Georgette Mosbacher took 
the capital by storm early in her husband's tenure, but stumbled after her 
untimely arrival at a Washington luncheon took the limelight away from Marilyn 
Quayle -- making for cool relations between the two ever since. Georgette 
Mosbacher also has run into criticism over charges that she has overstepped the 
bounds of propriety in representing her business in dealings with agencies. In 
recent weeks, she has visited Washington only rarely.

THORNBURGH DENIES SHIELDING AIDE; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE DEPT.: THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS HE DIDN'T TRY TO HIDE THE OFFICIAL'S 
FAILURE OF A LIE DETECTOR TEST.

<TEXT>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh on Sunday denied that he had tried to hide the fact 
that his chief personal aide had flunked a lie detector test during a sensitive 
department investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," Thornburgh said when asked about the allegation of Deputy 
Atty. Gen. Donald B. Ayer, the department's No. 2 official, who has turned in 
his resignation, effective on Friday. The charge was reported by The Times on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ayer is sadly misinformed about the facts," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no evidence that tied any person on my staff to the unauthorized 
disclosure." Thornburgh was referring to a leak of information during an 
investigation of alleged financial irregularities in the office of House 
Majority Whip William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," Thornburgh was asked about 
his former executive assistant, Robert S. (Robin) Ross Jr., who failed a lie 
detector test in the leak inquiry. Asked whether the failure was not 
"evidence," Thornburgh responded: "No, it isn't evidence of wrongdoing -- not 
in our courts of law." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a statement issued Sunday, Thornburgh said he found it "unfortunate 
that Mr. Ayer has chosen to conduct himself in this manner with respect to his 
former colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
After he resigned, Ayer contended that he had been blocked from performing the 
deputy's duties by Ross. According to Ayer, Ross acted as the department's 
chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
The statement released by the department did not deal directly with Ayer's 
allegation that Thornburgh had tried to keep the leak investigation away from 
the department's internal watchdog unit and, failing that, refused to follow 
the unit's recommendation for further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the statement noted that Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr's review 
of the investigation concluded that there had been no reason for Thornburgh to 
remove himself from the case -- as Ayer had unsuccessfully sought to persuade 
him to do. 
</P>
<P>
The statement also noted that Thornburgh was acting within his discretion in 
deciding not to discipline anyone over the leak. The statement said that Starr 
also had considered the concerns of the department's watchdog unit, which had 
called for further investigation and possible discipline.

DOWNPOUR SWAMPS ARKANSAS TOWN; DAM IN TEXAS IS SINKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Up to 13 inches of rainfall in Arkansas washed out bridges, swept away cars and 
forced hundreds of people to flee to higher ground Sunday, while an 
overburdened dam in north-central Texas was sinking and feared to be near 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The downpour dumped more than 12 inches of rain in Hot Springs, Ark., and left 
some roads under water 7 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
In the downtown area, automobiles floated down streets and crashed into 
storefronts, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 homes in and around Hot Springs, a central Arkansas resort town, were 
evacuated early Sunday, but most residents had returned by the afternoon, Ray 
Briggler of the state Office of Emergency Services said. 
</P>
<P>
Garland County Sheriff's Sgt. Tom Garner described the businesses in downtown 
Hot Springs as "full of water." He said no injuries were known and no one had 
been reported missing. A sheriff's dispatcher said that most county roads were 
not passable. 
</P>
<P>
"There was very deep water inside the city, up to 7 feet," Garner said. Fire 
Marshal Richard West said that more than 100 people were stranded by rising 
water and had to be rescued. 
</P>
<P>
The rain caused a rockslide that closed Arkansas 88 in Polk County. 
</P>
<P>
Thunderstorms battered much of Texas on Sunday. Strong winds and heavy rains 
knocked down trees and power lines. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lost Creek Reservoir Dam on the Trinity River tributary system 
was feared near collapse after a section of the dam about half a mile wide sank 
at least 20 feet.

COCAINE-RELATED DEATHS DECLINE FOR FIRST TIME IN A DECADE, FEDERAL FIGURES 
REVEAL; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: REPORTS FROM MEDICAL EXAMINERS ALSO SHOW A 47% PLUNGE IN THE LAST 
QUARTER OF 1989. THE STATISTICS DO NOT INCLUDE DATA FROM LOS ANGELES.

<TEXT>
<P>
The number of cocaine-related deaths in America declined in 1989 for the first 
time in at least a decade, falling 26% largely because of a precipitous plunge 
in the final three months of the year, according to medical examiner reports 
from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The decline from 1988, based on preliminary data submitted to the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse, reverses a dizzying upward spiral in which the number 
of cocaine-related deaths more than tripled over the three previous years. 
</P>
<P>
The national statistics show that the number of cocaine-related deaths plunged 
by an extraordinary 47% during the final three months of 1989 compared to the 
previous quarter. The drop exceeded a previously reported 22% decline in 
cocaine-related medical emergencies reported by hospitals in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the findings add credence to arguments that cocaine use 
throughout the United States may have peaked -- even among addicts whose 
habitual drug use makes them most vulnerable to death or injury. 
</P>
<P>
Some hospital officials, however, suggested instead that the same number of 
users could be consuming less potent forms of the drug. Evidence of a decline 
in cocaine purity has so far been inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
The new figures on cocaine deaths, collected by the federal government as part 
of its Drug Abuse Warning Network, do not include data from Los Angeles, where 
medical examiners were late in submitting their reports. The findings, made 
available to The Times, are expected to be made public next week. 
</P>
<P>
The reports, from 24 cities, list the number of times that cocaine or other 
drugs are mentioned by medical examiners as the principal or contributing cause 
of death, including overdoses, accidents and violence. The provisional numbers 
show 2,649 cocaine-related deaths in 1989, down from 3,561 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
The rate had remained largely steady for the first nine months of 1989, then 
plummeted in the final quarter, dropping from 756 cocaine deaths in the 
July-September period to just 404 such deaths from October to the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
That fourth-quarter plunge mirrored the pattern in cocaine-related emergencies 
reported by hospitals around the country. The change was hailed by Health and 
Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan as an indication that "we are making 
significant headway in our efforts to establish a drug-free America." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Select Committee on 
Narcotics Abuse and Control, has expressed skepticism that drug abuse is 
declining. He charged in an interview last week that many victims of cocaine 
abuse were suffering and dying in the streets and thus were not included in 
hospital and emergency room statistics. 
</P>
<P>
According to the medical examiner reports, the most dramatic fourth-quarter 
decline in cocaine deaths occurred in New York City, which represents about 
one-third of the Drug Abuse Warning Network figures. The annual total dropped 
from 1,309 in 1988 to 969 in 1989 -- a 26% decline -- while the fourth-quarter 
rate plunged 58%. 
</P>
<P>
New York began to submit its reports to the federal government in 1988, and for 
that reason will not be included in this week's warning network analysis of 
longer-term trends. Without New York, the number of cocaine deaths recorded 
dropped 25% last year, from 2,252 to 1,690. The drop for the final three months 
of the year was 40% without New York's figures included. 
</P>
<P>
The longer-term analysis by the warning network, which excludes New York, shows 
that the number of cocaine-related deaths more than tripled between 1985 and 
1988, leaping from 717 to 2,252. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the reversal in cocaine figures, the 1989 data also shows a 
significant annual plunge in all drug-related deaths. 
</P>
<P>
With Los Angeles not yet reporting, the figures show a 28% reduction in the 
number of deaths in which any drug was listed as a contributing factor, with an 
equal drop in heroin-related deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institute on Drug Abuse has noted in the past that its provisional 
figures remain subject to change, and cautioned that data for individual 
cities, particularly for a single quarter, may not be reliable. 
</P>
<P>
But the institute previously has described the medical examiners' report as 
providing an important indicator of broad national trends in drug abuse.

BUSH ACCUSES CONGRESS OF SITTING ON ANTI-CRIME BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PORTLAND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush on Sunday accused Congress of spawning "weak imitations" of his 
proposals to attack crime after allowing them to languish for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We must reject those who soft-pedal the need to be hard on crime," Bush said 
in remarks prepared for a Portland law enforcement audience as the Senate 
prepared to begin debate today on an anti-crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
The President was in the city for the dedication of a memorial to Portland 
police officers slain in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
He accused lawmakers of sitting on key anti-crime bills he first proposed a 
year ago. But he also acknowledged that Congress agreed to his request for more 
federal law enforcement officers, prosecutors and prisons as part of anti-drug 
bills enacted earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he still wants congressional action on his call for expanded use of 
the death penalty, fewer burdens on police in gathering evidence and limits on 
the length of time prisoners have for filing federal appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats have recrafted Bush's proposals and, with the support of law 
enforcement groups, inserted into the package a ban on the sale and manufacture 
of nine types of semiautomatic assault weapons.

UCLA STUDENT IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER SHOOTING AT PACOIMA GAS STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old UCLA student studying to be a pediatrician was in critical 
condition at UCLA Medical Center on Sunday after being shot in the head by two 
young men who police said confronted him at a pay phone in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Ricardo Olivares, who has no gang connections, stopped with several 
friends at the corner of Laurel Canyon and Brand boulevards to buy gas about 
12:45 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
While his friends pumped gas and bought snacks at the convenience store, 
Olivares walked to a nearby phone booth, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two young men, believed to be gang members, confronted him and a fight broke 
out, police said. One of the men pulled out a handgun and fired several shots, 
police said. The attackers fled and have not been found. 
</P>
<P>
Family members and friends waiting outside Olivares' room in the intensive care 
unit Sunday described him as a friendly, hard-working young man who was in the 
wrong place at the wrong time. One friend called the attack "an atrocity." 
</P>
<P>
As a student at San Fernando High School, Olivares served as vice president of 
the student body and once was named student of the month. He was accepted last 
year for admission at UC Berkeley and Stanford, as well as UCLA, according to 
family members. He chose UCLA because it was close to home. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a model person," Olivares' brother Victor said.

2 MEN SHOT TO DEATH IN LYNWOOD OUTSIDE FAST-FOOD SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men in front of a fast-food restaurant in Lynwood were shot to death early 
Sunday, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies identified the victims as Robert Collins, 41, of Compton, and Fenton 
Anderson, 28, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred in front of Fast Food Deli Burgers in the 12600 block of 
Long Beach Boulevard, Deputy Rafael Estrada said. "The employees reported 
hearing shots, but they didn't see anybody, so we don't have (an explanation 
for) why the crime occurred," Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
The men were dead when deputies arrived.

EXCERPTS FROM DEBATE BETWEEN 2 DEMOCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following are excerpts from Sunday's Democratic gubernatorial debate between 
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp: 
</P>
<P>
Malathion spraying 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "There are no circumstances under which I would resume urban 
(aerial) spraying. . . . When you had a reported Medfly, you'd go into an area, 
you'd ground strip, you'd remove the fruit. If the fruit is contaminated, you'd 
spray in that immediate area. . . . "You would do it by ground with the 
knowledge and permission of the property owner rather than through this massive 
invasion of spraying like 'Apocalypse Now,' which I think is very bothersome to 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "I'm against malathion spraying. I think we should stop it and if 
I'm elected it will be stopped. But I was very interested in something Mrs. 
Feinstein said the other day, and it gets to snooping. She suggested we inspect 
first-class mail for Medflies. Tell me that you're against that." 
</P>
<P>
Reducing auto insurance rates 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "My opponent and I disagree with respect as to how to go about 
that. She's in favor of no-fault. She's in favor of giving the insurance 
industry antitrust exemptions which would be expanded. . . . I want to see the 
new insurance commissioner get off to a good start, I want to see rate 
rollbacks, I want to see affordable insurance in California, I want to see the 
insurance companies brought to bear in a decent regulatory structure." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: ". . . I am not wed to no-fault. What I am wed to is a rate 
rollback, what I am wed to is providing insurance for Californians, one-third 
of whom in this basin have no insurance and are driving criminally." 
</P>
<P>
Their family wealth 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "Our family's been lucky, in fact our family in some ways in the 
last number of years has been representative of the American dream. . . . And 
I've stayed in public service all my life, one of the reasons because I have a 
deep dedication to the people of this state. . . . My family has a trust fund 
that's been set up for my mother. I've never drawn a dime out of that trust 
fund." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "My husband, incidentally, is totally self-made, he inherited no 
funds, he made what he had himself and that in a sense is the American dream 
and I'm proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion counseling 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "For my own daughter? I'm sure I'd have a heart-to-heart with her 
and talk about the future of that potential life. . . . I'd counsel her to 
carry the child. . . . If another person who was distant from me came to me . . 
. I feel less comfortable making the kinds of arguments that I would to my own 
child." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "Not too long ago I went to watch an Operation Rescue operation at a 
health clinic. And I watched women absolutely humiliated who couldn't get 
through the line to get into a doctor's office." 
</P>
<P>
State budget 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "The one thing that's clear tonight is Mrs. Feinstein would put 
the cost-of-living adjustments on the table for the needy, blind and the 
disabled. . . . I will not. And I will balance the budget through a series of 
cuts and revenue enhancements, taxes if you will, in some areas that will make 
sure we have a balanced budget." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: " . . . As I said before, I think everything goes on the table. I 
think you protect the poor, the needy, the disabled in the negotiations once 
everything is on the table. . . . We have to look at the traditional ways, 
freezing things like travel, new cars, looking to see what can be eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
Death penalty 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "I don't ever see you being vigorous in terms of carrying out that 
law. . . . I think the thing that I have a problem with is if you don't believe 
in (the death penalty) and the governor has broad clemency powers, why wouldn't 
you just commute every single case?" 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "With respect to the question of clemency, I've said repeatedly 
that the death penalty is a settled issue. . . . The death penalty, I believe, 
is here to stay for maybe upwards of the next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent's weaknesses 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: " . . . Managerial skill, understanding of the state budget 
situation, obviously even tonight we've found that she is still pretty weak, 
she doesn't have a program but she speaks in some generalities and some numbers 
that frankly are pretty far off base. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: " . . . John, you demean your opponent and puff yourself up. The 
fact is you've never really put together a budget, you've never really grappled 
with a shortfall. I have -- nine years in a row. . . . Yet you're so willing to 
sit back and criticize me. You know, John Van de Kamp, the D word is for 
distortion." 
</P>
<P>
Closing lines 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "I think in this election you have a choice between a lawyer and 
someone who wants to be a leader. I want to represent women. I want to open the 
door. I want to see that minorities take their place in this society in a 
meaningful way." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "I'm not the style candidate in this race. In endorsing me, the 
Sacramento Bee called me flagrantly unexciting. But if I'm governor, I pledge 
to you the most exciting period in California history."

<TEXT>
<P>
The driver of a runaway bus packed with European tourists did his best to avoid 
a mountain highway accident in an incident that killed a tourist and injured 46 
others, officials said. "He told me he was in third (gear)," said California 
Highway Patrol Sgt. Ray Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
"After the brakes were failing and he could smell them burning, he came out of 
third to downshift, and he couldn't get into second." The bus continued to pick 
up speed while driver Juan Garcia Jr., 30, wrestled to gain control, scraping 
the mountainside on its way down steep, winding California 168, the sergeant 
said. The bus eventually plunged over a six-foot embankment into a flat area of 
rocks and brush. Marguerite Finat, 60, of Marseilles, France was killed.

ANDREI KIRILENKO; EX-POLITBURO MEMBER, BREZHNEV PROTEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrei Kirilenko, 83, a former Soviet Politburo member who was a protege of the 
discredited Leonid I. Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet news agency Tass said Kirilenko rose through the party ranks with 
Brezhnev, who like him was from the Ukraine. When Brezhnev succeeded Nikita S. 
Khrushchev, Kirilenko's stature also rose, and in 1966 he was named Central 
Committee secretary for internal political questions and party work, taking 
charge of day-to-day party activities. He spent 16 years in the Politburo 
before being pensioned off in 1982, the year of Brezhnev's death, to live in 
relative obscurity. Brezhnev is now routinely criticized as having presided 
over a "period of stagnation." In Moscow on May 12.

A Tustin-based Marine Corps staff sergeant killed Saturday in a helicopter 
crash about 15 miles southeast of the Salton Sea during a routine training 
mission was identified as James R. Andrews, 31, of Los Angeles, a veteran crew 
chief who had received numerous decorations. Andrews was killed when the CH-53D 
Sea Stallion crashed in a remote part of the rugged Imperial County desert, 
Marine Master Sgt. Steve Merrill said. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews, an expert trouble-shooter for the bulky, two-engine troop carrier, was 
not part of the helicopter's five-man crew, but was riding as a passenger, 
Merrill said. Initially, the Marine Corps had reported that the five crew 
members were injured in the crash that destroyed the helicopter. But Merrill 
said that after hospital examination, crew members were found to be shaken, but 
unhurt.

MOTEL OWNERS MAD, MAY SUE OVER SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Spurned by the City Council, owners of the Ventura Travelodge are determined to 
get the last word, in large block letters. 
</P>
<P>
The council's refusal to allow Patti and Jerry Hempenius to put up a new sign 
atop their Travelodge at 929 E. Thompson Ave. has caused the Hempeniuses to 
raise a protest -- about 10 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
"But For City Council We'd Have A New Blue Sign," says a sign about halfway up 
a pole in front of the motel. 
</P>
<P>
The Hempeniuses had hoped to replace the Travelodge sign atop the pole with a 
new sign to conform to Travelodge International's new logo. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council rejected the request, saying the sign should be lower. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that it has to come to this. You'd think the city would work 
with you," said Hempenius, who called the council's action "hard-nosed." 
</P>
<P>
The Hempeniuses say if they can't change the sign, they'll be forced to sell 
their business. The Hempeniuses now plan to sue the city, Patti Hempenius said. 
</P>
<P>
They labeled the council's decision unfair, saying the Vagabond Motel two 
blocks down the street was allowed to change its pole sign logo last year to 
keep in step with a new international motif. 
</P>
<P>
City Planner Ann Chaney said the Vagabond was allowed to keep its current sign 
because it is within 250 feet of the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the motel's design, the Vagabond had few other places to put its 
pole sign, Chaney said. The owners also agreed to lower and reduce the size of 
their original sign, she said. KEN McALPINE

A man was beaten with a baseball bat Sunday and another man was shot in the 
thigh during a fight in Santa Paula, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Brothers Armando Castro, 22, and Mario (Dino) Castro, 23, both of Santa Paula, 
were arrested in connection with the shooting of Daniel Ramirez and the beating 
of Martin Esquivel, said Santa Paula Police Sgt. Gary Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began early Sunday with an argument between two groups of people 
in adjacent yards in the 100 block of Sheppard Road, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez and Esquivel were treated and released Sunday from Santa Paula Memorial 
Hospital, a spokeswoman said. PEGGY Y. LEE

$25,000 SOUGHT FOR OUTREACH CAMPAIGN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Health Care Agency will ask the County Board of Supervisors 
on Tuesday for $25,000 to fund a Latino migrant alcohol and drug abuse outreach 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The county Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs has proposed an "information 
and education blitz" about drug and alcohol abuse for the migrant, 
Spanish-speaking population, said Stephen Kaplan, administrator of the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the department hopes to come up with an effective plan for 
fighting alcohol and drug abuse in the Latino community. "This isn't a 
treatment program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The department would contract the project out to El Concilio del Condado de 
Ventura, "an advocacy group for the Hispanic community, which has served as 
kind of an umbrella for other Latino human services agencies," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed drive follows a series of countywide public forums in which 
residents testified about the need for various drug and alcohol programs in the 
county, Kaplan said. He said language and cultural barriers were consistently 
cited as problems with present programs. 
</P>
<P>
The effort would be concentrated over the summer, with posters and pamphlets 
distributed in Latino communities and interviews being conducted with workers 
at health and law enforcement agencies. KIM KASH

STREET SMART: SOME FIND 55 PROJECT ISN'T WORTH THE WAIT

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one of this city's founding fathers and a councilman for 16 years, Robert M. 
Wilson is intimately familiar with "the ditch." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson watched with pleasure in the mid-1970s as lumbering bulldozers began 
slicing the deep chasm in the earth that would be necessary to allow the Costa 
Mesa Freeway to reach the sea. 
</P>
<P>
He grimaced when state money dried up and the earth movers fled, leaving the 
ditch to the weeds and the field mice. Wilson was there as frustrated residents 
took to derisively calling it "Costa Mesa's Panama Canal," or joking that it 
should be filled with water and stocked with fish. 
</P>
<P>
But now Wilson, who retired from the council in 1976, is smiling. Work has 
begun anew on the long-awaited extension of California 55 south into the heart 
of Costa Mesa. "I think it's great," Wilson said. "We need it badly. It's just 
20 years late." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, however, is happy. 
</P>
<P>
All the construction work has ushered in monumental traffic jams along the 
existing roads perched on the freeway's embankments. The long lines of 
grumbling motorists promise to only get longer later this year as the roads, 
Newport Boulevard north and south, are temporarily reduced to one lane in each 
direction to make room for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the merchants at the freeway's edges are also irked by the work. The 
construction has scared off customers, they contend, and the completed freeway 
may act only to further divert business away from their doors. 
</P>
<P>
Even when completed, the freeway extension falls more than a mile short of the 
original goal envisioned by planners more than three decades ago -- to link the 
San Diego Freeway with Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current construction project, the freeway will terminate at 19th 
Street, dumping traffic back onto Newport Boulevard in the heart of Costa 
Mesa's business district. These days, the money and political willpower to 
continue the freeway south to the coast are in short supply, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll see it in my lifetime," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
What he will see is a $38-million, two-mile stretch of pavement topped by seven 
bridges and featuring four lanes in each direction. Construction began nearly a 
year ago, and already three of the bridges on the northern end of the project 
are completed and two others are under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Massive storm drains, some of them eight feet in diameter, have been laid along 
several stretches, and a mountain of dirt is being removed on the southern end 
of the project. 
</P>
<P>
At the northern end, a mountain of recycled concrete and asphalt sits baking in 
the sun. There is already a base along the road bed onto which the concrete 
roadbed will be poured in the months to come. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the bridges has conspired to tie up traffic on numerous occasions in 
recent months. One day last week, a fleet of concrete trucks was lined up, 
blocking a lane of traffic at the Del Mar Avenue crossing. Traffic was backed 
up for a half mile up the street, as motorists tried to shoot across the 
intersection when the signal light flickered green. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Chappelle, an engineer shepherding the project for the state Department of 
Transportation, didn't like what he was seeing, but said there was no way 
around it. Snarled traffic and headaches for motorists come with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
"You definitely have a gridlock situation here," Chappelle said, gazing toward 
the line of cars. "People in Southern California don't have a lot of time to 
waste sitting in traffic at a construction project. But they should know that 
none of this is being done for the contractor's convenience. It has to be done 
this way." 
</P>
<P>
With completion of the northern half of the project early next year, the 
traffic situation around the Orange County Fairgrounds and along Newport 
Boulevard south to Fairview Road should improve dramatically, Chappelle said. 
It's not the same story, however, further to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Along the southern stretch, the company building the project, E.L. Yeager 
Construction Co., will, in September or October, begin shaving back the sides 
of the ditch in order to erect a lengthy, 30-foot-tall concrete retaining wall. 
</P>
<P>
The effort, which will take at least six months to complete, will entail taking 
away two of the three existing lanes on southbound Newport Boulevard. After the 
wall is built, the section behind will be back-filled with dirt and then the 
two lanes of roadbed robbed from Newport Boulevard will be repoured. The same 
thing will be done to northbound Newport Boulevard, probably beginning in the 
fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the result of such work will be monumental traffic jams along 
Newport Boulevard, the key route leading to and from the beaches, restaurants 
and night spots of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to have a major impact on traffic," Chappelle said. "There's not a 
lot of alternative routes, but most people will get used to it and find their 
way around the tie-ups. The worst will be the weekends. It's going to be a 
mess. No doubt about that." 
</P>
<P>
Several merchants along the route, especially those who depend on drive-by 
business, are none too pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Daniels, night manager at Minute King Liquor-Deli on northbound Newport 
Boulevard, said the congestion has already cut into business. Many people, he 
said, seem too worried about dealing with the traffic to pull off and buy a bag 
of chips or six-pack of soda. Even when the freeway is completed, things may 
only be worse, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"The store has been very slow," Daniels said. "I think it's only going to 
continue and probably get worse. The end result, I think, will be things going 
down big time. I think we're going to lose just about everything, profit wise." 
</P>
<P>
Just up the street at Rancho Market, store manager Libby Pike said the 
congestion has actually seemed to help business there, as "people who have to 
wait in traffic come in." But she said the owners worry about what will happen 
when the freeway opens. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Heinz, executive director of the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce, said the 
construction work "has in general had an effect on businesses on both sides of 
the freeway" but suggested that the "overall effect" of the freeway will be 
positive for the community. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Mayor Peter F. Buffa still hopes that the freeway can be connected 
with Coast Highway in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is we're very glad to see it happening," Buffa said. "But it 
doesn't mean a great deal until it goes somewhere, and the logical place is the 
Pacific Coast Highway." 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for any further work, however, are dim. 
</P>
<P>
The project is not included on the state's long-range budget for transportation 
projects. It wasn't even included among the wish list of projects to be 
financed under Proposition M, the half-cent sales tax increase for Orange 
County highway and transit projects that failed at the polls last year. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a route below 19th Street," Buffa said, "but the bottom line to that 
story is that there is no funding. It's just not going to happen in the 
foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ratzlaff, deputy district director for planning at Caltrans in Orange 
County, said there is a possibility that the sort of traffic jams that 
historically have formed where the Costa Mesa Freeway funnels into Newport 
Boulevard may simply be moved further south when the current project is 
completed.

LOCAL ELECTIONS DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S RACE;

D.A. CAPIZZI'S 3 OPPONENTS STICK TOGETHER

<TEXT>
<P>
When James G. Enright, Thomas Avdeef and Edgar A. Freeman make joint campaign 
appearances in their race for district attorney, they're so friendly that the 
audience can hardly tell they are competing for votes. Actually, they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the three hopes his other two colleagues can garner enough votes in the 
June 5 election to force a runoff with the fourth candidate -- their boss, 
newly appointed Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
The candidate who gets more than 50% of the vote will be elected to a four-year 
term, beginning in January. But if none receives more than 50%, then the top 
two vote-getters will face each other in a runoff in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
It irritates Enright, Avdeef and Freeman to see the media touting Capizzi as 
the favorite. During their campaign speeches, they clearly make Capizzi their 
target. Capizzi calls their tactics "tag-team politics." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, appointed to the post by the County Board of Supervisors in January 
when longtime Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks took a judicial seat, has made a few 
appearances with the other candidates. He is mostly relying on his incumbency, 
his campaign coffers and a legion of impressive endorsements to carry his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident I'm going to win," Capizzi said early in the race. "I'm proud of 
the record of this office. And you can bet the other candidates will proudly 
list themselves as prosecutors in this office when their names are placed on 
the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef, who is Capizzi's chief critic among the challengers, said it is Capizzi 
who ought to be the one hoping to make it into a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm out talking to voters every day. They don't even know who Capizzi is," 
said Avdeef, who has taken vacation time to walk precincts and meet voters. 
</P>
<P>
But few political pundits, including most of the supporters for Capizzi's three 
challengers, share Avdeef's view of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm realistic enough to know he (Capizzi) is going to be tough to beat," 
Enright said. "But we've got to stop this notion that just because he has money 
and the politicians behind him that he's a shoo-in. I think if we can force 
this into a runoff, then a lot of support will start coming our way and we can 
make it a hell of a race." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi's strengths in the campaign are formidable. Traditionally in Orange 
County, incumbents in nonpartisan races are rarely defeated unless they are 
targeted by powerful interest groups or opponents have raised considerably more 
money. This hasn't happened in the district attorney's race. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi has been endorsed by all five members of the Board of Supervisors, 
almost every law enforcement organization in the county, and by a host of major 
political figures. He also had Hicks' endorsement until Hicks took the bench -- 
judicial ethics have precluded Hicks from speaking out on the district 
attorney's race. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, among the challengers only Enright has come up with any notable 
endorsements. He is backed by former Dist. Atty. Kenneth Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Most pleasing to Capizzi was the overwhelming endorsement of the more than 200 
deputy prosecutors in the office. He garnered 85% of their vote. The other 
three candidates between them got just 5%, with 10% declining to endorse 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
But as confident as Capizzi appears, some of his supporters privately say that 
a runoff is a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"When the voters get their ballots, they're going to see four prosecutors 
listed with four different titles," one loyal Capizzi follower said. "The 
confusion may be too much for them to sort out." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi is listed on the ballot as "appointed district attorney"; Enright is 
listed as "chief deputy district attorney"; Freeman as "assistant district 
attorney"; and Avdeef as "deputy district attorney." How many voters, for 
example, would know that an assistant ranks higher in the office than a deputy, 
but lower than a chief deputy? 
</P>
<P>
In addition, each of Capizzi's opponents is campaigning hard in the final days 
before the election. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef has posted hundreds of campaign signs and has a network of unpaid 
volunteers. He said he believes that his door-to-door campaigning is effective. 
Freeman has bombarded the county with campaign signs along most major streets 
-- all paid for out of his own pocket because he has not been asking for 
contributions. Enright plans to hit voters with heavy advertising the final 
weeks of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Enright and Freeman have only a few thousand dollars each to spend. Avdeef said 
his campaign war chest will be under $50,000. Capizzi had topped $100,000 by 
January. He is expected to have plenty of money left over should a runoff be 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi is the only one of the four who can afford a countywide mailer, which 
many political consultants believe is the only effective way to reach a broad 
range of voters. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to see whether he (Capizzi) can buy enough name recognition to win 
the campaign," Enright said. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi's three opponents have keyed in on a major theme: that Capizzi is the 
"politicians' candidate." Capizzi will not respond, but his supporters scoff at 
the notion. They point out that Capizzi gathered more signatures than any 
candidate in the county -- 3,300 -- to have his name placed on the ballot, 
which they see as widespread support for his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi has chosen not to discuss his three opponents publicly. Privately, 
however, he is extremely irritated at Avdeef's tactics, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Avdeef hits hard during his talks that Hicks and Capizzi chose not 
to investigate Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, whose financial difficulties could 
affect more than 20,000 investors. Capizzi insists that is not true, that 
district attorney investigators are, in fact, cooperating with a federal probe 
of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef's campaign literature is another source of irritation. Though Capizzi 
wwill not discuss it, his supporters are angry that Avdeef's signs read: "The 
people's district attorney." His brochures state: "Tom Avdeef" followed by 
"Orange County district attorney." They claim that Avdeef has skillfully tried 
to get voters to think he is the current district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef smiles at his critics' comments. "They must be worried about me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one oddity about the district attorney's race, it's Freeman's 
campaign. Freeman, highly popular within the office, apologizes to his audience 
during public appearances for having to talk about himself. And he winds up 
touting Enright's candidacy more than his own. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman and Enright are not only longtime close friends but also longtime foes 
of Capizzi. Freeman wanted to support Enright, but when it appeared that 
Enright would not enter the race, Freeman jumped in. Enright, however, decided 
at the last minute to run, but by then it was too late for Freeman to withdraw 
because he had made a commitment to his supporters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In speaking engagements, it is obvious Freeman would be pleased to be the No. 2 
man at Enright's side. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the leadership of Jim Enright, we have become the finest district 
attorney's office in the state," Freeman said.

All three Capizzi challengers emphasize to voters that they are not 
politicians, in contrast with Capizzi. Enright recently told an audience that 
he is more interested in what goes on in the courtroom than in what goes on in 
political circles, but then added, "That may have been my undoing."

FREE PINE TREES STILL AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The great tree giveaway continues. 
</P>
<P>
Though more than half of the 465 public schools in the county have taken 
advantage of free, five-foot-tall pine trees offered by the Tree Society of 
Orange County, about 200 Mondell Pines are still available. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Pacific Mutual Foundation gave a $15,000 grant to the Tree Society to 
fund the giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
The program was designed to coincide with last month's Earth Day celebrations, 
Foundation President Robert Haskell said. Public schools were notified with a 
letter and tree planting kit and provided with a certificate good for a single 
pine tree. 
</P>
<P>
The Tree Society recommended that the Mondell Pine be selected because it is 
particularly drought resistant, needs little maintenance and absorbs carbon 
dioxide at a relatively high rate, said Thomas Larsen, the president of the 
Tree Society, adding that many of the schools that have picked up the free 
trees have used the planting ceremonies as an opportunity to discuss the 
environmental benefits of trees. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers and principals have used it as a real teaching aid," Larsen said. 
"The Tree Society wants it to be ongoing, and we wanted the kids to move away 
from Earth Day with all this in mind." LAURA MICHAELIS

3 YOUTHS KILLED IN CAR CRASH IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police have identified the three youths who were killed and two others who were 
injured after a speeding late-model sports car flipped over and crashed. 
</P>
<P>
Marco D. Martinez, 17, his brother David D. Martinez, 16, and Abel Aguilar Jr., 
18, of San Clemente were killed Saturday when the blue four-door Jaguar sedan 
they were riding in flipped over on a dirt shoulder in the hills about five 
miles east of Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
Two others, Arthur A. Felix, 17, of San Juan Capistrano, and Thomas Sheehan, 
18, of San Clemente, were in satisfactory condition at Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the dead were ejected from the Jaguar. The third was found inside the 
car, San Clemente police said. 
</P>
<P>
Felix, who police believe was driving the car, suffered a concussion and cannot 
remember the 12:18 p.m. crash, according to officials at Mission Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Police said security guards patrolling a grading site in the area told them 
that they saw the Jaguar traveling at high speed along a straight stretch of 
road, when it suddenly lost control and flipped over on a dirt shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that all five youths gathered each Saturday morning for a pickup 
basketball game and may have known each other only by their first names, except 
the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
No evidence of alcohol or drug use was found at the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
Police still wouldn't say who the owner of the Jaguar is.

TEACHERS RATIFY NEW PACT; BITTERNESS TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Settling more than a year of strife-ridden negotiations, unionized teachers in 
the Capistrano Unified School District have ratified a new contract but vowed 
to increase pressure on the district for better terms next year. 
</P>
<P>
The new one-year contract, ratified by 63% of 908 members of the Capistrano 
Unified Educators Assn. who voted last week, will give teachers a retroactive 
pay increase of 7% for the first four months of the current school year and an 
additional 0.5% for the remainder of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
Union president Ric Stephenson said that although the contract was approved, 
bitterness remains with most teachers, who have demonstrated several times in 
past months. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say that it was an overwhelming endorsement," Stephenson said of 
the ratification vote. He said the votes against ratification " . . . 
represented the highest disapproved vote in our history and does demonstrate a 
significant degree of disaffection." 
</P>
<P>
Stephenson said a majority of union members remained dissatisfied with the pay 
increase, a discipline clause and health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
With less than two months before the new contract expires, Stephenson said a 
union contract committee will meet on Monday to discuss strategy for the next 
round of talks. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the length of time it took to reach an agreement, Stephenson said: "We 
will not engage in the same process again next year. It was way too drawn out 
and too draining on the emotional and physical resources of the teachers." 
</P>
<P>
The school board is scheduled to vote on the ratified contract at its June 4 
meeting, and retroactive checks should be ready for mailing by June 29, 
Stephenson said. JAMES M. GOMEZ

DISTRICT PREPARES FOR YEAR-ROUND CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With final plans for the Anaheim City School District's new year-around 
schedule just about in place, administrators and educators are taking steps to 
make sure that the students will keep up their end of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Parent-teacher meetings have come and gone, letters in English and Spanish have 
been mailed to every parent affected, and huge banners are draped in the 
entrance to a number of schools in the district. 
</P>
<P>
But the final test of the plan's success won't come until July 3, when the 
first classes begin. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Schuck, who has coordinated the program for the 21-campus district, 
said that she is worried but that once the year-round schedule begins, the 
system should run itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major change, and that's difficult," Schuck said. "It's not only a 
school district changing, but it's a community changing." 
</P>
<P>
Schuck cited the growing need for child care as the main concern facing the 
parents and the community. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the district's schools will begin yearlong schedules this summer -- 
Thomas Edison, Benjamin Franklin, Melbourne A. Gauer, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham 
Lincoln and Palm Lane. Three more are scheduled to begin sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
The six schools were chosen primarily because they are the most impacted. The 
new "12 weeks on, four weeks off" schedule will allow the district to enroll up 
to 33% more students. 
</P>
<P>
Schuck added that those six schools also have the highest number of 
limited-English-speaking students, and the continuous schedule will help those 
students retain what they are learning. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and teachers are a little shaken by the upcoming change, which leaves 
only one week between the end of this school year and the beginning of next, 
but they tend to agree that it will be a move for the better. 
</P>
<P>
"It might pose a small problem this first year, but once they're in the groove, 
I don't think it'll be a problem," said Jackie Lampher, president of the 
Anaheim Elementary Education Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Lampher said that the teachers are generally prepared for the change and that, 
like the students, they could have chosen a new school if they were 
uncomfortable with the new schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Garcia, treasurer of the Parent Teachers Assn. at Thomas Jefferson 
School, said that because the school consists of primarily Latino students, the 
PTA held extra meetings for the Spanish-speaking parents. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just kind of like a shock at first, but we've gotten used to it," 
Garcia said. LISA MASCARO

MILITARY: INVESTIGATORS CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR A CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT, WHICH 
OCCURRED ON A ROUTINE TRAINING FLIGHT.

A Tustin-based Marine Corps staff sergeant killed in a helicopter crash about 
15 miles southeast of the Salton Sea during a routine training mission was 
identified Sunday as a veteran crew chief who had received numerous 
decorations. 
</P>
<P>
Staff Sgt. James R. Andrews, 31, of Los Angeles was killed Saturday when the 
CH-53D Sea Stallion he was riding in crashed in a remote part of the rugged 
Imperial County desert, said Master Sgt. Steve Merrill, a spokesman for the 
Tustin base. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews, an expert trouble-shooter for the two-engine troop carrier, was not 
part of the helicopter's five-man crew, but was riding as a passenger, Merrill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the Marine Corps had reported that the five crew members were 
injured in the crash that destroyed the helicopter. But Merrill said that after 
examination at the El Centro Naval Air Station, crew members were found to be 
shaken, but unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
The uninjured crew members were flown four hours later to the Tustin facility, 
where they were interviewed by crash investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Officials identified the crewmen as: Capt. C.E. O'Connor, the pilot; 1st Lt. 
M.A. Lowe, the co-pilot; Staff Sgt. D.G. Arriola, the crew chief, and Lance 
Cpls. D.C. Cobor and R.M. Waggy. 
</P>
<P>
"They are already home and with their loved ones," Merrill said. 
</P>
<P>
Marine crash investigators were still unable Sunday to determine the exact 
cause of the crash. Merrill said the crash site near Superstition Mountain, a 
craggy peak of bare rock between the Salton Sea and El Centro, has been 
cordoned off while investigators gathered evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing the exact circumstances is all part of the investigation, including 
why one person died and why five others weren't even hurt," Merrill said. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill said Marine Corps officials were making funeral arrangements with 
Andrews' wife, Nyla. A memorial service for the decorated 14-year-veteran was 
to be scheduled for later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews, who joined the Marine Corps in December, 1976, earned 10 medals, 
including four Sea Service Deployment Ribbons, a Navy Unit Citation, a 
Humanitarian Service Award and a Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, which is 
awarded to Marines who are involved in military action, according to his 
service record. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill did not know if Andrews' medals were awarded for combat duty. 
</P>
<P>
"He has seen more than the average Marine," Merrill said. "There are only so 
many (Marines) that are involved in units that get those types of awards." 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter was en route to its base in Tustin when it experienced 
mechanical problems and finally crashed about 2 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The chopper, attached to the Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 363, Marine 
Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, was left at the scene while 
investigators pored over the debris for clues. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a definite crash, not just a hard landing," Merrill said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash was the 19th involving a Sea Stallion helicopter since 1980. More 
than 80 servicemen have been killed in CH-53D accidents since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In Westmorland, a tiny settlement near the crash site, 73-year-old Chuck Havens 
stared out the window of his dusty filling station and pointed toward 
Superstition Mountain, explaining how the sky is often dotted with the 
high-flying helicopters that do maneuvers in the unpopulated desert of Imperial 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"They go in that direction, over there," Havens said, squinting into the 
afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
He and other longtime Westmorland residents were not surprised to learn about 
the crash. They remembered another military helicopter crash that occurred in 
the area about a year ago.

YOUNG TURKS WILL LEAD THE CHARGE IN DECADES AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT NELSON, Robert Nelson is chairman of Nelson Ralston Robb 
Communications and a former Orange County supervisor's aide. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the beginning there were lobbyists. They were about the only source of 
technical information available to California Assembly members before Jesse M. 
Unruh became Speaker in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Under Unruh's leadership, the Legislature added professional consulting staff, 
providing an independent source of expert information. From this staff pool 
grew a new generation of legislative professionals, many of whom were elected 
to office and became leaders in their own right. Among them are Lt. Gov. Leo T. 
McCarthy, former Controller Kenneth Cory, Rep. George Miller, state Sen. Barry 
Keene and Assemblymen Richard E. Floyd, Patrick Johnston and Richard Katz. 
</P>
<P>
A similar evolution in leadership is under way in Orange County. A new crop of 
young leaders is emerging, and they will run things differently in the 1990s 
and the early new century. At the core of this group are several former aides 
to elected officials, especially to county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s and early 1980s the Board of Supervisors greatly expanded the 
size and professionalism of its staff, giving each supervisor a team of 
assistants to help evaluate and control local programs. 
</P>
<P>
Today, many of these former aides have moved on to positions of increasing 
importance. Among the ranks of these "Young Turks" are John Erskine and Tom 
Daly, members of the Huntington Beach and Anaheim city councils; Stanley T. 
Oftelie, executive director of the County Transportation Commission; Thomas A. 
Fuentes, county Republican chairman; Ernie Schneider, county administrative 
officer, and Bill Hodge, principal financial adviser to Orange County's three 
newest cities. 
</P>
<P>
Most often mentioned as a leader by his peers is Daniel H. Young, now mayor of 
Santa Ana. Young began his local career as an aid to former congressman Jerry 
M. Patterson, himself once mayor of that city. Young has distinguished himself 
in the League of Cities, serving as chairman of a "super committee" exploring 
the future of transportation in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, Fuentes, and Oftelie tend to operate in their own orbits of 
influence and power. But a tight bond of friendship and shared experience 
exists between Young, Miller, Erskine, Daly and Hodge. 
</P>
<P>
All except Young simultaneously worked for the Board of Supervisors. Earlier, 
Young, Miller and Erskine studied together at Cal State Fullerton. All three 
were active in local Democratic politics until Erskine and Young bolted in the 
mid-1980s, leading a minor exodus of others to the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
They were all active in local politics at a time when scandals over campaign 
financing and bribery shook the county. Watching as heads rolled, they learned 
that disgrace -- or worse -- was the harvest of breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
The friendship among the Young Turks is relevant. They pick up the telephone 
and call each other to discuss ideas and concerns. They advise each other and 
add to each other's networks of contacts. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many in local government, they seem more interested in substance than 
appearance. If there is competition among them, it is to see who can accomplish 
the most. 
</P>
<P>
Raised on countywide and national issues, they share a common vision of the 
future. Their concerns extend beyond the boundaries of their own cities. All of 
them are active in some aspect of countywide transportation issues. Young and 
Daly, for example, are exploring the concept of a privately financed monorail 
to connect Anaheim and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, growth has outstripped its ability to meet the transportation, 
education and social service needs of its citizens. In the coming era of 
scarcity and conflict between competing interests, the Young Turks hold the 
promise for compromise, cooperation and accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
This new breed of local leaders may be the nucleus for a larger cadre of 
government officials and business people who can lead Orange County in the 
challenging decades ahead.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
A BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The debate over the future of two pedestrian bridges along Yale Avenue has 
turned Irvine upside down for months and now will be voted on in the June 5 
election in Measures B and C. Perhaps one good reason for this is that the 
arguments have approached the heart of what a planned community is all about. 
</P>
<P>
Planned communities provide the opportunity to avoid mistakes that older places 
endured because of haphazard growth. The irony in the Yale overpasses situation 
is that even the best-laid designs of planned communities may not come to 
fruition right away. When that happens, and a community takes stock of the 
original scheme, there's bound to be some difference of opinion over whether to 
implement the basic game plan or continue with what you have. The right 
question to ask is, if it ain't broke, does it need fixing? 
</P>
<P>
That's the picture along Yale Avenue. As Irvine developed, overpasses at a 
railroad crossing and at the San Diego Freeway never were upgraded for general 
vehicular traffic. Today, they are used only by pedestrians, bicycles and 
emergency vehicles, and Yale Avenue serves residential traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of a plan to allow the construction of two-lane vehicular bridges 
argue that the circulation system of Irvine always had called for cars to go 
through. Opponents say Irvine's residential village concept is well-served now. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is so fundamental that both are seeking amendments in the 
general plan of the city to get their way: one to establish that vehicular 
bridges can be built when the City Council decides to build them; the other, to 
ensure that the overpasses remain limited to their current use. 
</P>
<P>
So who's right? The people who want the bridges to stay as they are. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in Irvine is very old, but these are the oldest neighborhoods, the ones 
for which such a dramatic change in traffic patterns is bound to raise safety 
questions. Thousands of children travel daily to many schools in this area. 
When a bridge opened over I-5 at Yale Avenue, there was an increase in 
accidents. People walk and ride bicycles to parks and bike paths in the area. 
The dynamics of the way Irvine has evolved would be dangerously altered. 
</P>
<P>
It would be one thing if Yale Avenue were needed to take the burden off other 
main arteries. That might make it worth the considerable cost the city would 
incur to actually change the bridges. But pro-vehicular bridge forces haven't 
made a very convincing case of that need. So there's no compelling reason to 
change now. Vote No on Measure B; vote Yes on Measure C.

Background: Capizzi joined the district attorney's office in 1965 and became an 
assistant district attorney in 1971, in charge of special operations. In 1986, 
he was appointed chief assistant to Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks, generally 
considered the No. 2 position in the office. Hicks then supported Capizzi as 
his successor. 
</P>
<P>
Issues: Capizzi says he is running on the record he created as the chief 
administrator in the office under Hicks. "I'm proud of this office. We have a 
reputation as the best in the state, and I'm proud of what I have contributed 
to that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
James G. Enright 
</P>
<P>
Home: Orange 
</P>
<P>
Age: 63 
</P>
<P>
Occupation: Chief deputy district attorney. Enright was chief deputy under 
Hicks for more than 20 years. He was a prosecutor for 10 years before that. He 
has specialized in homicide cases, leaving most of the administrative duties in 
the office to others. Enright throughout his career has insisted on remaining 
in the courtroom, despite his position as a supervisor, and now does at least 
one trial a year himself. 
</P>
<P>
Issues: Enright claims that while Capizzi may be Hicks' handpicked successor, 
the office's high reputation in the state has been because of his own 
leadership in homicide and major felony cases. He criticizes Capizzi as "the 
politicians' candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Edgar A. Freeman 
</P>
<P>
Home: Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
Age: 63 
</P>
<P>
Occupation: Assistant district attorney. Freeman has held that job for more 
than 20 years. Before that he spent four years as a deputy public defender. 
</P>
<P>
Issues: Freeman has specialized in drug cases and during the campaign has cited 
awards he has won for his drug prosecutions. Freeman also notes in his speeches 
that he has handled more than 250 felony trials himself, even though his 
primary duties in the office have been as a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Avdeef 
</P>
<P>
Home: Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
Age: 49 
</P>
<P>
Occupation: Deputy district attorney. He was a police officer and a district 
attorney investigator for almost 20 years but eventually went to night school 
to get his law degree. He has been a prosecutor for nearly 11 years. His most 
noted case was prosecution of Charles Rothenberg, who was convicted and 
sentenced to 13 years for setting fire to his son, David, in a Buena Park motel 
room, leaving David with permanent major injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Issues: Avdeef has been the most critical of Capizzi's leadership. He claims 
that low morale in the office is responsible for a high turnover rate in the 
office and that Capizzi has clouded his career by cozying up to too many 
politicians. "There should be no sacred cows," Avdeef said. "You never know 
what you will end up being faced with investigating a politician who has done 
you a favor."

HINDS' VICTORIES HAND SADDLEBACK TEAM TENNIS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Hinds won the singles championship and teamed with Stan Sanders to win the 
doubles title, leading Saddleback College to the state community college men's 
team tennis championship Sunday at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback finished with eight points. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara and West Valley tied for second with five points. Saddleback, 
which won the dual-match team competition Friday and finished 24-0, has won 
either the dual match or team title three years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback Coach Bill Otta said the Gauchos were likely the best team in his 12 
years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the top community college tennis teams in history," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds defeated Santa Barbara's John Fox, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, in the singles final 
after defeating John Swaino of Cypress, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-5, in a semifinal 
match. Swaino had won both the Orange Empire Conference and Southern California 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
In doubles, Hinds and Sanders beat Jimmy Yamanka and Monty Basnyat of West 
Valley, 6-2, 6-0, in the finals after defeating Long Beach's Anthony Cortez and 
John Imel, 6-4, 6-2, in the semis.

HEAVY SUBJECT TREATED LIGHTLY IN 'THE RAMP' 
</P>

<P>
Shem Bitterman is a young man to watch, if only to make sure that he works just 
a little harder at creating his realities on stage and digs a little deeper 
than he is digging right now. 
</P>
<P>
Bitterman's "The Ramp," which opened Saturday at South Coast Repertory, treads 
on slippery ground. Skates might even be the better verb to use. The 
co-runner-up (with Octavio Solis, who wrote the previously reviewed "Man of the 
Flesh") in SCR's second annual new play Calfest has taken on a tough subject. 
He examines the profound and complex matter of individual conscience and 
responsibility in a society hell-bent on -- how shall one put it? -- keeping 
its genocides discreet. 
</P>
<P>
The very contradiction in those terms lies at the heart of "The Ramp." It 
introduces us to Heinrich (James R. Winker), a withdrawn, middle-aged German 
doctor, who is assigned to a "hospital" in Poland during World War II. Heinrich 
-- perhaps for good reason -- is more in love with nature, which he ardently 
seeks out, than with people, whom he seems to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
One day Heinrich meets Lotte (Pamela Gien) at the edge of a field. Lotte has a 
small farm and a 5-year-old son and shows Heinrich more affection than he's had 
from anyone, except perhaps his mother. He is, in many ways (if we are to 
correctly interpret the letters he writes home to Ma), mother-fixated. This may 
partly account for the dream-world in which he resides and may be the reason he 
can't always handle Lotte's advances. It is definitely the reason his jaded and 
cynical colleague Fredrich (Norbert Weisser) is so impatient with Heinrich's 
naivete. 
</P>
<P>
We are, as you might have begun to suspect, in Auschwitz -- though the dreaded 
word is spoken only once, and all we really hear of it is in the clacking of 
the trains relentlessly rolling in, one after another. And another. And 
another. (Michael Silversher's sound design sends shivers through the room.) 
</P>
<P>
Heinrich falls hopelessly in love with Lotte, until the angry Fredrich opens 
his eyes -- pries them open -- to the young woman's identity and her possible 
motives. But you can't start to "see," as Heinrich finally does, without 
acknowledging the entire field of vision. For the first time, Heinrich must 
admit to himself what it is that he is doing in this tragic Polish outpost. The 
knowledge proves to be more than he can handle. 
</P>
<P>
Bitterman has tackled his subject obliquely -- always the wiser course. But the 
three-character play, in its effort to be indirect and haunting, remains a 
90-minute exercise on one note. Many of its exchanges sound more earnestly 
designed for effect than passionately felt and honestly engendered. 
</P>
<P>
This applies only to the writing, for the actors, if anything, bend over 
backward to make sure we "feel" this play. Under Steven D. Albrezzi's 
direction, they deliver the right interpretations, but they are allowed to 
whisper their lines more often than speak them, frequently remaining nearly 
inaudible, even in the relatively modest confines of SCR's Second Stage. A 
little of that can go a very long way. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, fundamentally, it's not the mechanics or the trappings of the production 
that are disturbing. Eloquently lit by Tom Ruzika, Cliff Faulkner's bare stage 
and swimming hole, presided over by a denuded tree and with the suggestion of a 
forest in the distance, serve optimally. It is the skimming over the issues. 
Whether Bitterman chose to tread a light fantastic with lines that often sound 
too calculated or too pat, or whether it is the attempt to deal with such an 
awesome mega-subject in a calculatedly mini-way is difficult to assess from 
just one sitting. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that there is something if not shallow then simplistic, almost 
dismissive, in this treatment. It's a subject that requires depth and richness 
and ramification. Romulus Linney's "2," seen at the Humana Festival in March, 
dealt with an even more daunting and dangerous allied subject: Hermann Goering, 
trying to defend himself and the actions of the Reich at his Nuremberg trial. 
It managed to find wholly unexpected resonances for the character and create 
exceptionally gripping theater. But other examples aside, Bitterman is on the 
right track. What he needs now is to find the right compass. 
</P>
<P>
 Shem Bitterman's "The Ramp" runs through June 3 at South Coast Repertory, 655 
Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Performances on Tuesdays through Saturdays at 
8:30 p.m., on Sundays at 8 p.m., with matinees Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. 
Tickets: $20-$27. Information: (714) 957-4033.

RAPPER DEF JEF WAS FUN, FUNKY, BUT AFTER THAT IT WAS DOWNHILL

<P>
The rap show Friday night at the Celebrity Theatre started at the pinnacle and 
wound up in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
The long, delay-filled evening of steadily diminishing returns ended with 
teen-aged headliners Wrecks-N-Effect grinding to a wretchedly amateurish 
embarrassment of a finish. Another New York rap crew, Redhead Kingpin &amp; the 
F.B.I., turned in a mediocre middle set. But Def Jef, a more experienced rapper 
based in Los Angeles, made it all worthwhile with a near-perfect opening set 
that was fun, funky, and politically focused -- a textbook example of all 
that's good in rap music. 
</P>
<P>
For 35 deftly paced minutes, Def Jef (real name: Jeffrey Fortson), disc jockey 
Erick Vaan and a trio of wonderful dancers called the Soul Brothers offered a 
cornucopia of rhyme, rhythm and eye-popping motion. Throughout his show, Def 
Jef expertly interwove his key themes: rap as a call to party, rap as a 
foundation for friendship and rap as a vehicle for expressing black pride and 
black protest. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of rap acts offer impressive dance acrobatics. But Jef and his crew used 
a dance sequence to make a point about black heritage and aspirations. As the 
three Soul Brothers showed off their moves in dance solos, they departed from 
the usual herky-jerky, robotic pattern of contemporary hip-hop dance and 
reached back into their cultural tradition. The routines featured loose-limbed 
moves derived from Africa and funky but urbane steps that recalled 
Vaudeville-era tap-dancing. To drive home the point, the dance sequence ended 
with a ceremonial passage in which the dancers moved with interlocked arms 
while the soundtrack carried segments of a Black Muslim speech and a Bob Marley 
song extolling the racial heritage of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Def Jef conveyed the same message in his concluding rap, "Black to the Future." 
While taking a controversial stand on what tactics are acceptable for effecting 
change ("Through violence or nonviolence, I don't care -- as long as we get 
there"), the song's tone, like Jef's attitude, was clearly positive. 
</P>
<P>
Jef's motto for rap -- "It's a black thing, but everybody's invited" -- 
exemplified his call for racial pride while skirting exclusionary racial 
chauvinism. 
</P>
<P>
In his headband, short dreadlocks, and semi-military garb, the bearded, 
chunkily built Def Jef looked as if he might have been a member of Che 
Guevarra's revolutionary band. But Jef's delivery, though pointed, was never 
strident, and the show never became annoyingly preachy. The rapper was no stiff 
polemicist but an exceptionally confident and charming entertainer with a 
self-deprecating sense of humor and a capacity for enjoying himself immensely. 
Funky numbers such as "Droppin' Rhymes on Drums" reached dance-party nirvana; 
the show reached the right balance between the jukebox and the soapbox. 
</P>
<P>
Def Jef was a natural performer. Like a rap Sinatra, he was able to use deft 
hand motions and effective body English to underscore his lyrics. He also was a 
capable dancer and a supple, clear-voiced rhymer. 
</P>
<P>
Far from bogging the show down, some of the fast-moving set's nicest moments 
came when Jef and the tall, lanky Vaan engaged in easy, back-and-forth banter 
about what song they would perform next. This Mutt and Jeff pair's ribbing 
revealed a warm mutual affection -- and when they switched places for a while, 
Def Jef proved himself a flash record scratcher as well as a sharp rapper. This 
crew made a well-planned performance seem like casual, happy play. It was a 
pleasure hanging out with them. 
</P>
<P>
The only blemish on Def Jef's set was a passing comment that contained 
gratuitous homophobia and insensitivity about AIDS -- a common but unforgivable 
blind spot among rappers that undermines the genre with its hypocrisy and 
prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
Redhead Kingpin (real name: David Guppy) came off as an energetic but 
lightweight rap dandy. Mugging and strutting through his 22-minute set, he 
seemed like a smug frat boy who shows off a lot but knows very little. The most 
memorable thing this New Jersey rapper with the red Eraserhead hairstyle did 
was drop his trousers and dance in his shorts, drawing squeals from his female 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
His entourage included a dancer, introduced as Guppy's younger brother, who 
spent the entire show with an infant's rubber pacifier in his mouth. That was 
fitting in a way, since most of Redhead Kingpin's raps were puerile boasts and 
sexual fantasies. One more mature number, the Spike Lee-inspired social 
commentary "Do the Right Thing," was punchy enough, but Guppy's poor 
enunciation robbed it of bite. On the other raps, it didn't really matter that 
the words were hard to make out. 
</P>
<P>
Wrecks-N-Effect, a trio that often collaborates with Redhead Kingpin on record, 
shared his fixation with sexy songs and bump-and-grind moves. But while Kingpin 
at least kept his show moving, Wrecks-N-Effect's half-hour set was a fumbling 
affair with long gaps in which the members resembled aimless adolescents 
hanging out on a playground with no idea what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
The trio came close to committing child abuse when it lifted a boy toddler out 
of the audience, apparently with the aim of prodding him to make advances to a 
girl of about 8 who had also come on stage. Wrecks-N-Effect let this 
frightened, bewildered tot stand alone on stage sucking a finger for what 
seemed an eternity, apparently in hopes he would make some sort of cute whoopee 
with the little girl. It was the brainless prank of rank amateurs, teen-agers 
without the slightest instinct for performance. 
</P>
<P>
Wrecks-N-Effect also showed a complete lack of integrity toward the art of 
rapping. Throughout the show, the trio worked with an aural net: While they 
mouthed the words to their raps, a prerecorded backing track of the vocal parts 
boomed with far greater volume than the real-time rapping. 
</P>
<P>
It's in the nature of rap music to use canned rhythm tracks and instrumental 
bits. But the point of live rapping is to dominate a stage with a real voice 
and a real personality. While Def Jef employed some electronic vocal 
embellishments during his set, there was no question that his performance was 
real. As for the fakers in Wrecks-N-Effect, they might as well have stayed home 
and mailed in a tape. That way, they would have been spared the scattered 
booing that greeted the end of their pathetic show.

MAKING SOME SENSE OUT OF THE UNIVERSE WITH ALFRED JENSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"My father is strong and good because he paints solar energy," Alfred Jensen's 
son once wrote in a school essay. Solar energy wasn't the half of it. A 
perpetual student of obscure systems of knowledge, Jensen researched ancient 
numerological systems, color theory and physics in order to make sense of the 
world. His art was a painstakingly constructed allegory of a harmonious 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen filled large canvases with patterns of small, tactile squares of color 
squeezed right from the tube. Frequently, row upon row of neatly aligned 
numerals and terse, mysterious remarks in flowing script slice through the 
pillows of paint. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of a show of Jensen's work from the '50s, '60s and '70s at 
Linda Cathcart Gallery, "Seeking to Unravel the Shape of an Enzyme," extends 15 
feet in length. Its rows of mathematical formulas are piled on top of each 
other to create a dense embroidery of impenetrable evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jensen, who died in 1981, shares the nutty obsessiveness of some folk 
artists, he was well aware of the art of his time -- he showed with some of the 
Abstract Expressionists -- and studied briefly with theoretical painter Hans 
Hofmann. In 1957, after several years of painting under the influence of 
Goethe's theory of color, Jensen developed his characteristic checkerboard 
patterning and began adding handwritten notes. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the works became larger, more complex and less rough-and-ready. 
But the uneven, "handmade" quality persisted, giving the dense and dazzling 
paintings a jazzy life force that is as hard to resist as the underlying 
structure of rarefied ideas is to puzzle out. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Cathcart Gallery, 924 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica, through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Space Oddities: Tim Hawkinson's peculiar little objects are bursting with 
high-concept ideas that sometimes seem too glib for their own good. But among 
the 18 pieces at Ace Gallery are a few that retain an ineffable oddity, a 
cockeyed viewpoint about the imperfections and pitfalls of perception. 
</P>
<P>
"Untitled (White Flexing Painting)" is one of these. It's a Lycra-covered 
square with an unseen electric motor that enables it to keep making tiny 
"stretching" movements, as if it felt too uncomfortable to hang on the wall 
under the scrutiny of viewers. The image amusingly suggests the unfixed, 
shifting array of meanings an art object possesses in an era of cultural 
relativism. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery also is showing a vast array of recent work by Dennis Oppenheim and 
large-scale paintings by David Amico -- food for another column. 
</P>
<P>
 Ace Gallery, 5514 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, to June 30.

Out of Law: Cable News Network anchorwoman Catherine Crier told a gathering of 
lawyers in Grand Rapids, Mich., that courtroom competition and unnecessary 
lawsuits drove her from her post as a Texas district judge. Crier, 35, told 
members of the Grand Rapids Bar Assn. last week she accepted CNN's offer in 
October, 1988, in part because she was frustrated by unnecessary litigation, 
including the case of a woman who sued her obstetrician because she suffered 
pain during childbirth.

Another Merger: Let's forget East and West Berlin for a minute and give North 
and South Yemen equal time. Thousands in those states of the United Arab 
Emirates danced the weekend away to celebrate the imminent merger of North and 
South Yemen, with people from both sides embracing and shouting "Long Live 
Yemen" as loudspeakers blared the national anthem of the new country. "The 
celebrations will continue until unification is proclaimed later this month," 
North Yemeni ambassador Mohammed Hatem al-Khawi told reporters in Abu Dhabi.

Auctioning Dad's Advice: A New York auction house is selling a 1967 letter 
Ronald Reagan wrote to daughter Patti, counseling her on smoking's dangers and 
the benefits of telling the truth. The handwritten, four-page letter, signed 
"Love, Dad," is expected to bring between $40,000 and $45,000 when sold next 
month. The letter responds to a note Patti, then 14, wrote from boarding school 
to tell her father she had admitted to smoking cigarettes and was being 
punished. He warned her against "compromising the truth no matter how trivial" 
and put a sexist twist on smoking. "Unfortunately, women are more susceptible 
to habits than men and find them much harder to break or change," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Back in Bonn: On the day the two Germanys signed a treaty to allow 
market forces to rule in East Germany, East Berliners got a chance to make -- 
and lose -- money in the country's first casino. Doors opened Friday evening at 
the modest gaming room with three roulette and two blackjack tables, where the 
minimum stake is $3. But as long as men wear jackets and ties and women do not 
wear jeans, they can play the slot machines for just 60 cents a shot. Croupiers 
are West German, but East Germans are being trained and will take over in July.

<P>
Nevertheless, the first-of-its kind workshop challenging German and American 
graphic- and industrial-designers to tackle an environmental agenda was 
pronounced a success by its dozen participants. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked together intensely for a day and I think this was a unique event," 
said Michael Erlhoff of Frankfurt, director of the German Design Council, in 
introducing the workshop's public forum Thursday night at the Pacific Design 
Center. "We started an international discussion and a coordination of our work. 
We have set a pattern for the future." 
</P>
<P>
The workshop was one event in a schedule of lectures, receptions, forums and 
panel discussions planned around last week's opening of "Designed in Germany -- 
Los Angeles 1990." The exhibition of German products, everything from 
electronic telephones to automobiles, runs through June 23 at the Pacific 
Design Center. 
</P>
<P>
Although the emphasis of the exhibition is on the present, the environmental 
workshop took a futuristic approach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an experiment -- to see if we can produce some global solutions," 
explained Philine Bracht, industrial designer and UCLA faculty member who 
coordinated the event for a cluster of American and German professional design 
groups. "We are taking Los Angeles as a city of the future where things occur 
10 years ahead of time and this includes environmental problems." 
</P>
<P>
It had been the sponsors' original concept that the German-American graphic and 
industrial professionals could produce something tangible. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule called them to take an early-morning bus tour of Los Angeles, 
looping Downtown and back from the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood, 
sort of an environmental sight-seeing tour during which they would target 
specific problems. The group then was to spend the day huddling on a solution 
or two, and unveil its results on paper at the evening forum. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to identify a problem that can be solved with design, like a bus 
shelter or a recycling campaign," Bracht had explained, several weeks ago. 
"It's a big undertaking." 
</P>
<P>
Too big, it turned out. As the the workshop schedule took shape, it became 
evident that one day of intercultural brainstorming -- no matter how intense -- 
would not produce a quick fix for Los Angeles-magnitude problems, such as the 
20,000 tons of waste dumped daily into landfills or the 300 miles of polluted, 
congested freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
So the revised plan called for the design delegation to take notes, sketches 
and photographs of the city's visual and physical pollution as a bus (a 
propane-fueled UCLA shuttle) traveled the Hollywood Freeway at a morning-drive 
time crawl. The tour circled through Downtown and returned on the Santa Monica 
Freeway. Those impressions provided the material for the day's discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"You get confused by the global overview," said one participant, during an 
afternoon break. "It is necessary to take smaller steps -- something each of us 
can do on an individual scale and a professional scale." 
</P>
<P>
That became the day's output. "Workshops can't produce design," summarized 
Dieter Rams, chief designer for Germany's Braun Co. who headed the industrial 
design team. "There can be discussions, they can provide ideas, but that's 
all." 
</P>
<P>
And ideas are were offered for the evening forum audience. At the panel 
discussion, the 11 men and one woman offered personal observations about their 
day's work; they sounded much like any environmentally concerned group. 
</P>
<P>
The trip through the traffic and graffiti and trash of Los Angeles, juxtaposed 
with its futuristic skyline, they agreed, had prodded their awareness of the 
environment's urgency. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost didn't take the bus trip, I've driven Downtown so many times," said 
graphic designer Henk Elenga,"but when you're on a bus instead of driving, and 
looking at the city through the eyes of your guests, you see it in a different 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Suggested Thomas Bley, president of Zebra Design in New York: "Our own 
profession is responsible for a certain amount of pollution. We saw what the 
entertainment industry did when they got together and wrote a song ("We Are the 
World") that actually fed the poor." The design industry, he said, could 
sponsor some event such as a world design conference. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of collective action developed as the discussion continued. "We have 
economic clout," said design consultant David Goodman, president of Catalyst 
who led the graphic design team. "We specify millions of dollars in supplies 
from vendors and manufacturers. That's the base of our power." 
</P>
<P>
Along with ideas for university design competitions and corporate "green" logos 
for acceptable environmental behavior, the day's jam session produced a 
grab-bag of other design ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Some were futuristic: Multiple-function service stations providing recycling 
centers and recharging outlets for electric vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Some were whimsical: Edible packaging (perhaps soybean) instead of Styrofoam 
for fast-food hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
Some were practical: Delivering milk to households in returnable glass bottles, 
rather than disposable plastic or paper containers. 
</P>
<P>
Some were educational: A dictionary summarizing the environmental effects of 
materials that designers use or recommend to clients; this reference work could 
offer alternatives for the more toxic materials. "We don't know enough about 
chemistry or the composition of plastics," said one panelist. "We should 
address the dangers of the dioxin content in bleached papers. We should insist 
on an oxygenated bleaching process for milk cartons. We need to stand firm in 
relationship to food packaging." 
</P>
<P>
And they acknowledged the reality of working for clients whose priorities were 
market competition, not environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Even that reality has a new look, said Bruce Severance, a student at the Art 
Center College of Design. He cited a poll in last November's Fortune magazine 
that reported that more than 70% of American consumers say they would pay more 
for environmentally superior products. 
</P>
<P>
"That's almost unbelievable. We're talking about a whole new niche for 
environmental alternatives to existing products. I think this is a turning 
point in history. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Participants expressed the hope that the experimental workshop itself would 
itself prove a turning point. 
</P>
<P>
"We just came together for one day and we had to overcome not knowing each 
other," said Regina Henze, a design consultant in Frankfurt. "Consciousness 
about the environment is just developing among the design world, and we agreed 
to concentrate on how to inspire our own colleagues. We think we can make an 
impact on environmental problems."

PNEUMONIA: A DEADLY PRESENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Puppeteer Jim Henson's sudden death of pneumonia last week is a reminder that 
this usually benign disease, which strikes about 3 million Americans each year, 
can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, pneumonia is well understood by doctors and is easily treated with a 
variety of antibiotics, said Dr. Bisher Akil, an expert in infectious diseases 
and pulmonary medicine at the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"You get simple outpatient treatment with antibiotics and you get over it," 
Akil said. "In healthy people, it's not a problem unless you ignore it and let 
it escalate." 
</P>
<P>
But pneumonia is fatal for an estimated 70,000 Americans each year, ranking as 
the sixth leading cause of death, according to the American Lung Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the deaths occur among the elderly, infants and people with illnesses 
such as cancer or diabetes -- all of whom have weak immune systems and may be 
unable to fight off infection. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, death can occur if treatment begins too late, as was apparently 
the case with Henson, or because the particular strain of pneumonia is 
difficult to identify, as in the case of actress Elizabeth Taylor's brush with 
death from pneumonia last month, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Pneumonia is an infection of lung tissue and is classified according to its 
cause and its location in the lung, Akil said. The disease is most commonly 
caused by bacteria, such as the streptococcus bacteria that killed Henson. It 
is also caused by viral infections, such as influenza. In rarer instances, 
pneumonia is caused by fungi, parasites, chemical agents or allergic reactions 
to foreign particles that lodge in the lung. 
</P>
<P>
Streptococcus, a bacterium found in the mouth, is the leading cause of 
pneumonia and is fatal in about 5% of cases, usually in people with weakened 
immune systems, experts said. Henson apparently died from a strain called group 
A streptococcus, which officials at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta 
said is increasing in frequency for reasons that are unclear. Group A 
streptococcus is fatal in 20% to 30% of cases, the CDC reports. 
</P>
<P>
But the 53-year-old creator of the Muppets apparently did not seek treatment in 
time to arrest his rapidly spreading infection, said Dr. David M. Gelmont, 
director of intensive care at New York Hospital, where Henson died early 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gelmont, Henson was examined by a physician in North Carolina on 
May 12 after developing flu-like symptoms, but pneumonia was not diagnosed. 
Henson reportedly returned to New York on Monday and died less than 24 hours 
after being admitted to New York Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
When he entered the emergency room at 4:58 a.m. Tuesday, Henson was dying of 
massive infection and acute respiratory distress, officials said. He received 
large doses of antibiotics and was placed on a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians estimated that the "overwhelming" infection had been progressing for 
at least three days and said antibiotics were ineffective at that point. 
</P>
<P>
"The pneumonia was not detected by the doctor in North Carolina, but by no 
means did someone blow the diagnosis," Gelmont said. "He did not have the 
textbook symptoms of pneumonia. He did not have a fever or sputum. He did have 
a mild cough." 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of pneumonia can vary according to its type. Four major symptoms 
common to streptococcus are fever, chest pain, cough and shortness of breath, 
Akil said. Bacterial pneumonia is usually accompanied by a discharge of sputum, 
sometimes blood-tinged, from the lungs; viral pneumonia often produces a dry 
cough. Pneumonia commonly triggers a particular kind of chill, a severe 
trembling of the body called a rigor, said Dr. Ellie Goldstein, chief of 
infectious disease at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica, 
where Taylor is recovering. 
</P>
<P>
"From the autopsy and from a physical examination, it is apparent that Mr. 
Henson was a healthy man," Gelmont said. "He was so healthy he didn't have a 
regular physician. The problem was he continued to feel worse over the weekend. 
By Sunday, I think he should have seen a doctor. Certainly by Monday when he 
was short of breath. But I'm sure he thought he could shake it off." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Henson was admitted to the hospital, the infection in his lungs had 
already migrated throughout his body and had begun to cause failure of his 
kidneys, heart and blood-clotting ability. Pneumonia can be impossible to 
arrest after abscesses form in the lungs and then spread through the 
bloodstream to different organs in the body, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite all of the antibiotics and modern techniques we possess, patients do 
die in hospitals because of (rapidly spreading) pneumonia when they are not 
admitted until after the illness has reached the critical stage," said Dr. 
David B. Skinner, president of New York Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Before the advent of antibiotics, pneumonia was called "the captain of the men 
of death," because it commonly caused death among the elderly, Goldstein said. 
Even before antibiotics came into use, however, healthy young people usually 
managed to fight off the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Antibiotics don't actually kill the bacteria causing pneumonia: They allow the 
body to mount its own natural defenses, said Goldstein. Thus, the seriousness 
of the illness varies according to the strength of an individual's defenses. 
</P>
<P>
If the agent causing the pneumonia can be identified, the particular antibiotic 
that will be most effective is prescribed, Akil said. If a cause is not 
immediately apparent, doctors must try various drugs and perform laboratory 
tests of lung sputum or lung tissue. 
</P>
<P>
With viral pneumonia, which may not produce sputum from the lungs that can be 
used to identify the virus, doctors sometimes remove a piece of lung tissue to 
test to make a diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with viral pneumonia is that our ability to identify the virus is 
not good," Akil said. "Most of the time the diagnosis is one of exclusion. But 
what happened with Elizabeth Taylor is that they had to go with open-lung 
biopsy because they couldn't find a reason. They had to take a big piece of 
lung tissue and look at it." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 58, was near death with viral pneumonia when doctors performed a lung 
biopsy to identify which antibiotics would best assist her. (Antiviral drugs 
have been developed that are effective in treating some viral pneumonias.) 
</P>
<P>
Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital April 10 with a sinus infection. 
The infection progressed to pneumonia, and the actress was transferred to St. 
John's April 16. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's pneumonia most likely developed from a virus in her bloodstream. But 
people can get pneumonia from different kinds of exposures, Akil said. 
</P>
<P>
"One is when you swallow saliva and normal bacteria and it doesn't go to the 
stomach, it goes to the lung," he said. "We do that all time. As long as our 
immune system is intact, it takes care of the bacteria we accidently inhale 
into our lungs. Once the immune system is weakened, whamo, you get pneumonia." 
</P>
<P>
The disease can also enter the bloodstream -- from a cut, for example -- and 
can travel to the lung. Or the offending agent can be inhaled, as was the case 
with Legionnaire's disease, which is caused by Legionella bacteria and spread 
through the air, usually from a contaminated air-conditioning system or water 
system. Legionella bacteria were recognized as a cause of pneumonia after 29 
people died after an American Legion Convention in Philadelphia in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Pneumonia can also develop as a complication of another illness, such as the 
influenza A or B, smallpox, measles or AIDS. According to Goldstein, 60% of 
adults with measles also get pneumonia. Pneumonia can spread quickly in 
hospitals because of the high incidence of infection and the number of people 
with compromised immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
A vaccine for pneumococcal pneumonia -- which encompasses many strains of 
bacteria -- was developed in 1977. The vaccine is recommended for the elderly 
and people with immune-system problems, such as AIDS patients. Healthy people 
do not need the vaccine and, despite tragic exceptions like Henson's death, 
should be able to recognize pneumonia and receive quick and adequate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, pneumonia does not go unnoticed," Akil said.

DAVID LYNCH'S 'WILD AT HEART' WOWS CANNES; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: THE DIRECTOR INTENDS TO CUT HIS VIOLENT, PROFANE AND EROTIC MOVIE TO GET 
AN R RATING. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
David Lynch's "Wild at Heart," his first feature film since the controversial 
"Blue Velvet," was met with wild enthusiasm at its world premiere at the Cannes 
Film Festival Saturday, but it's a version of the film that may be seen only by 
a handful of Americans at home. 
</P>
<P>
That handful is made up of members of the Motion Picture Assn. of America's 
Sherman Oaks-based ratings board, a group that Lynch is certain will demand 
changes in the film to get an R rating. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the version that will be shown in Europe, but we're going to have a 
few problems in the U.S. for sure," Lynch said, during a post-screening press 
conference. "I don't know why it is, but (the ratings board) has been getting 
very conservative lately. . . . There will be some changes we have to make." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch and the film's producers acknowledged at the press conference that he is 
contractually obligated to work his film into shape for an R rating. The 
question is how much cutting and editing that will require. 
</P>
<P>
"Wild at Heart" is a rural nightmare about a pair of young lovers who hit the 
road to escape the girl's domineering and dotty mother, and end up being 
pursued by professional -- and very weird -- assassins. The film is as violent 
as "Blue Velvet" and vastly more erotic, meaning that it may provoke the 
industry censors to slap it with an X rating on two counts -- for sex and 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
Make that three counts; the movie is also chockablock with profanity. 
</P>
<P>
The leavening factor of "Wild at Heart" is that it is also Lynch's funniest 
film. Those few people who can pat themselves on the back for "getting" Lynch's 
offbeat sense of humor in the cult films "Eraserhead" and "Blue Velvet" have 
been joined by millions of TV viewers who have rallied around Lynch's series 
"Twin Peaks." And if "Wild at Heart" survives the ratings process without 
serious damage, his growing army of fans have a treat coming. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Dern, who plays a hipper version of the small-town optimist that she 
played in "Blue Velvet," isolates the theme of "Wild at Heart" when she tells 
her parolee boyfriend Sailor (Nicolas Cage) that "The world is wild at heart 
and weird on top." In David Lynch's world, of course, it is pretty weird all 
the way through. 
</P>
<P>
But the same tone of absurdity that made "Blue Velvet" a jolt and "Twin Peaks" 
a joy are turned up to full volume in "Wild at Heart," which is scheduled for 
release in the United States by the Samuel Goldwyn Co. Lynch calls the film a 
"violent comedy," and he's got it right. The audience at its maiden screening 
here (or was it just the Americans?) were howling. 
</P>
<P>
Cage, one of the most daring actors of his generation, has created a character 
here as interestingly offbeat as his other parolee in "Raising Arizona" and the 
faux vampire in last year's "Vampire's Kiss." Cage plays a good-hearted but 
short-tempered petty thief who wears a snakeskin jacket, talks and sings like 
Elvis Presley, and wears his heart on his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
The story was adapted by Lynch from an unpublished novel by Barry Gifford. The 
novel follows Sailor's cross-country flight, but it was Lynch who turned the 
whole thing into a comically dark version of "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
We're not making assumptions; the film is laced with references to "The Wizard 
of Oz," the yellow brick road, and it even includes ghostly appearances by the 
good and bad witches from that tale. 
</P>
<P>
As with "Blue Velvet," Lynch used music from the 1950s to evoke a mood that 
seems to separate good and evil and bury evil just beneath the surface. The 
films lure you into a false sense of well-being, then ambush you with 
unpredictable -- sometimes unspeakable -- acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Does the ratings board take into consideration the context and tone of films 
before affixing them with the dreaded X? Lately, as Lynch said, it's been hard 
to tell. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch made it clear Saturday that he will not get caught up in a fight with the 
ratings board. "This is not going to be a breakthrough movie," he said, when 
asked if he thought a debate over his film might prompt changes that critics 
and others have been calling for in the ratings system. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the MPAA has resisted adding an adult-only rating between the R 
(children under 17 not admitted without a parent or guardian) and the X, which 
has become associated with pornography. (MPAA President Jack Valenti debates 
the ratings with TV film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel on CBS tonight at 
10. See Morning Report, Page 2.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're upset about (having to cut scenes to get an R rating)," he said. "But 
there's not a whole lot we can do about it."

JOFFREY'S 'ROMEO': A VALIANT SKETCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pity the poor dancers. Day after day, they subject their beautiful, fragile 
bodies to strains worthy of a Kirk Gibson. But they hardly command Gibsonesque 
salaries, and their careers are painfully short. 
</P>
<P>
Pity especially the dancers of the Joffrey Ballet. They are universally 
celebrated for their youth, their high spirits, their virtuosity and their 
versatility. Still, even in the best of times, they are overworked and 
underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively small ensemble performs a vast, eclectic, demanding repertory, 
often changing styles along with costumes three and four times a night. The 
stage hands and the orchestra players tend to earn more than the protagonists 
on the stage. For some time this season, the dancers couldn't even collect 
their modest per diem allowances. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the normal rigors of the road, the Joffrey roster must contend 
these days with administrative chaos. The business is in disarray. No one can 
be quite sure who is running the company, with what, and how. To put it gently, 
the future is clouded. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, as Confucius no doubt said, the show goes on. 
</P>
<P>
It went on Friday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion with a brave and 
splashy performance of John Cranko's "Romeo and Juliet," not seen here since 
1987. This sprawling ballet -- with its realistic narrative, emotional sweep 
and heroic scale -- has always stretched the Joffrey resources. Under present 
conditions, it demands more than the beleaguered dancers should be able to 
give. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. They give anyway. 
</P>
<P>
They dance as if lives were at stake. They throw themselves at the challenge at 
foot with reckless abandon. One has to admire their dedication and their 
dauntless vitality. 
</P>
<P>
If pressed, one also has to admit that their "Romeo" -- at least as performed 
on the first night of the local run -- seemed more a sketch than a realization. 
Cranko's feverish outlines, created for the Stuttgart Ballet in 1962, sometimes 
got smudged. Shakespeare's eternal poetry sometimes turned prosaic. 
</P>
<P>
The duties of the star-cross'd lovers were entrusted to a pair of 
conscientious, amiable kids from California. Both danced well yet conveyed 
little. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Martin (of San Jose) introduced a dark, handsome, long-legged Romeo 
with a blank face, a fine line and a generalized sense of duty. Jodie Gates (of 
Sacramento) introduced a fleet and robust Juliet who occasionally confused 
mugging with acting. 
</P>
<P>
With this Capulet and Montague, one longed in vain for a sense of mutual 
magnetism. One searched in vain for the expressive nuances that add pathos to 
competence. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Stierle flew with impish glee through the sassy pyrotechnics of 
Mercutio, but resembled a cute little boy sent in to do a man's job. Carl Corry 
exuded all-purpose good-guy bravado as Benvolio, while Tyler Walters simulated 
all-purpose macho malevolence as Tybalt. The most stylish contribution came 
from Charlene Gehm, whose towering dignity nearly ennobled the wrenching 
hysteria of Lady Capulet. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the masses proved more compelling than the individuals. The crowd 
scenes bustled. The sword fights bristled. The courtly dances looked as suave 
as one has a right to expect when the participants are all so infernally 
youthful. 
</P>
<P>
Jurgen Rose's lavish decors wear well. At least one observer continues to be 
confounded, however, by the 14th-Century elevator that transports Juliet from 
bridge to basement to bier in the final scene. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Lewis and the locally recruited orchestra found much gusto, and not so 
much dramatic tension, in Prokofiev's miraculous score. In that respect, the 
musicians complemented the dancers.

CENTRAL CAST CHANGES IN JOFFREY BALLET'S 'ROMEO' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For versatility in casting, what company can compare with the hard-working 
Joffrey Ballet? One night, you're Tybalt; the next, Romeo. Today, Benvolio; 
tomorrow, Mercutio. Rosalind in the afternoon; Juliet at night. 
</P>
<P>
In mix-and-match casting in two performances of John Cranko's "Romeo and 
Juliet" Saturday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, a number of dancers showed 
this versatility by alternating in various roles -- all but Deborah Dawn (as 
Juliet) dancing them for the first time in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Mossbrucker (a substitute Paris on Friday) ventured a boyish, idealistic, 
ethereal Romeo on Saturday afternoon. His virtues: lightness of carriage, clear 
technique and strong partnering. But his character did not appear to mature 
through the experience. 
</P>
<P>
Tina LeBlanc, his Juliet, introduced explosive vivacity and commitment and 
danced with speed, ease and amplitude of movement and yielding backbends. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Walters (Tybalt in the afternoon) provided the sketchy outlines of a 
poetic and ardent Romeo on Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
His Juliet, Deborah Dawn (Rosalind in the afternoon), created a detailed, 
intelligent and refined characterization and danced with both lyricism and 
abandon. 
</P>
<P>
In other evening performances: Peter Narbutas (Lord Montague at the matinee) 
introduced an extra edge of nasty menace and magnetism as Tybalt. Carl Corry 
(Benvolio in the afternoon) played down antic impishness and stressed stalwart 
loyalty as Mercutio. Glen Harris made a florid, slightly manic Benvolio. Julie 
Janus, as Lady Capulet, settled for a nonstop grimace in expressing grief over 
the slain Tybalt's body. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Martin (Friday's Romeo) ventured a noble and considerate Paris at both 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Lewis conducted at the matinee; John Minor offered slightly slower tempos 
and decidedly slacker tension in the evening. CHRIS PASLES

KCET'S 14 EMMYS LEADS LOS ANGELES AREA AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
KCET Channel 28, with strong support from a dance program, stepped ahead of the 
competition at the 42nd annual Los Angeles Area Emmy Awards presented Saturday 
by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
The public television station captured 14 Emmys to lead the field. It was 
boosted by "ISO Dance Theatre," which won five statuettes, including honors for 
best performers and entertainment programming. 
</P>
<P>
Other multiple winners at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium show for KCET were the 
series "Take Five: Arts and Culture" with three awards and "By the Year 2000" 
with two. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS Channel 2 and KABC Channel 7 earned 10 Emmys apiece, while KNBC took the 
prize for best regularly scheduled daily news program among its eight trophies. 
</P>
<P>
The KCBS news department accounted for six Emmys with wins in the categories of 
spot news ("San Bernardino Pipeline Explosion"), news writers and investigative 
reporting ("Gang God-fathers"), mini-documentaries ("Children Are Dying"), live 
coverage of an unscheduled news event ("Wind Storms"), and camera crew -- hard 
news breaking story ("Emergency Rooms"). 
</P>
<P>
KABC newscasts picked up five Emmys as the station tied KCBS for live coverage 
of an unscheduled news event ("Earthquake Remote -- Santa Cruz") and also won 
for instructional series ("Drugbusters"), commentary by Bill Press, film/tape 
editors of hard news programs ("Puppy Mills") and film/tape editors of news 
features ("Thrill Rides"). 
</P>
<P>
Two of four Emmys bestowed on KABC's "Eye on L.A." were for information segment 
("Guns") and special class -- program area. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the best daily newscast award, KNBC's news department won for feature 
reporting ("Mono Lake"), mini-documentaries ("Red Dawn") -- in a tie with KCBS 
-- and camera crew -- news feature ("Town 4 cSale"). "Fred Roggin's Sports Bowl 
'89" was named best sports special and his "Sunday Night Sports" segment titled 
"Morganna" was an unlikely victor in the category of sports reporting. 
</P>
<P>
On accepting his Emmy for the lighthearted feature about Morganna Roberts, the 
buxom blond notorious for kissing professional athletes, straight-faced 
producer Jeff Hoffman said, "Listen closely -- you'll be able to hear the sound 
of hell freezing over." 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the evening's winners were KTLA with five awards, KCAL with four, 
KTTV with two and KLCS and Continental Cable with one each. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Meyers, the versatile KCAL broadcaster whose 56-year career began with 
radio station KFAC in 1944, received the prestigious Governors Award.

SCHOOLS IN SIMI ARE FACING BIG SHORTFALL; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: THE DISTRICT BLAMES THE STATE AND A RAISE FOR TEACHERS. THE UNION CITES 
OFFICIALS' SALARIES AND GADGETRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There is no disputing that the Simi Valley Unified School District is facing a 
major financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But there is disagreement about how the largest school district in the county 
ended up with a projected shortfall of $8 million for next year -- more than 
10% of its entire $69.9-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say limited state funds, combined with an 8% salary increase 
for teachers for the next school year, are largely responsible. Proposed cuts 
in state funding account for at least $934,014 of the projected deficit, and 
the teachers' salary increase accounts for about $3 million of it. 
</P>
<P>
School employees and union representatives, while acknowledging the effect of 
the state budget difficulties, blame poor planning, large salaries paid to 
administrators and unnecessary spending by officials for some of the district's 
problems. For example, they cite the recent purchase of a satellite dish for 
the district's headquarters and a cellular phone for the superintendent's car. 
</P>
<P>
"If they thought they were going to be in a bind . . . they did nothing to 
prepare for it," said Ronald Myren, president of the Simi Valley Educators 
Assn., which represents the district's 750 teachers. "If I ran a household the 
way they run this district, I would be bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
To balance the district's budget, the Board of Education has decided to lay off 
32 temporary teachers and 28 clerical and service employees, including five of 
its 10 nurses, beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The board has also approved plans to reassign dozens of administrators to 
lower-level positions with reduced salaries, and has implemented reductions in 
purchases of instructional materials and a freeze on hiring and travel 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Jacobs, associate superintendent of instructional and educational 
services, who has worked for the district for 18 years, said he cannot recall a 
more bleak financial outlook. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst," Jacobs said. "These are survival times." 
</P>
<P>
Although other school districts in Ventura County are also facing budget 
problems, none are as severe as Simi Valley's, school administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley district officials calculate that the governor's proposed state 
budget for education will provide school districts with about $51 less per 
student than current funding levels. Gov. George Deukmejian announced last week 
that the state is expecting a $3.6-billion shortfall in its budget next year. 
</P>
<P>
The district has about 18,314 students and would receive about $934,014 less 
than it did last year under the proposed state budget for education. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say a steady decline in student enrollment and an increase 
in the dropout rate has added to their funding problems. For example, the 
district's current student enrollment is more than 6,000 fewer than the 
all-time high of 24,378 in 1974. The dropout rate has increased by 34% during 
the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say the 8% salary increase for teachers due next year under 
the terms of a three-year contract is also a contributing factor to the massive 
deficit. Labor costs make up about 85% of the district's budget. 
</P>
<P>
The 8% salary increase for teachers next year will cost the district about $3 
million, said Hal Vick, a representative of the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to offset some of the deficit, district officials in February 
asked the teachers union to sacrifice more than half of the salary increase. 
The union refused, saying it had bargained in good faith and that it was the 
district's responsibility to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Myren said that district officials simply failed to plan ahead in order to 
avoid major cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said that since January the district has spent $3,600 for a 
communications satellite dish for its headquarters, $79,000 for four new 
maintenance trucks. Despite repeated inquiries, district officials would not 
disclose how much was spent for a cellular phone for the superintendent's 
district-issued car. 
</P>
<P>
Myren said that while the purchases may be legitimate, district officials 
picked the wrong time to make them. 
</P>
<P>
But district officials maintain that the items purchased were necessary and, in 
some cases, will pay for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Jacobs said that the satellite dish is used to receive educational 
programs from different parts of the country. These programs, which can be seen 
on a television monitor at the district's headquarters, provide a wide range of 
instructional information for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said the big advantage to having the dish is that teachers can get 
information usually obtained at conferences. As a result, it cuts down on 
teacher travel expenses. "It's proven itself to be a valuable tool," Jacobs 
said of the satellite dish. "If we didn't have it, we would be out of the 
mainstream for education." 
</P>
<P>
As for the new trucks, Jacobs said that they were necessary because many of the 
district's maintenance vehicles are more than 10 years old, with some having as 
many as 200,000 miles on them. 
</P>
<P>
The superintendent's cellular phone, he said, is simply a tool to provide a 
more efficient means of communication between the administrator and district 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Lew Roth also defended the purchases, citing the same reasons for 
them as Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the teachers or the union leaders saying that we could have spent 
the money better or differently, that's their standard line," Roth said. "I 
think we have been prudent with the taxpayers' money." 
</P>
<P>
But Myren said that the district's expenses this year are not the only cause of 
concern to teachers and other employees. He said that while district officials 
keep citing the teachers' 8% raise as one of the reasons for the deficit, they 
fail to acknowledge the large salaries paid to administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Supt. John W. Duncan, who has served as the district's chief 
administrator for more than 15 years, is among the 10 highest-paid 
superintendents in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, according to 1989-90 
records. Duncan's base salary is $96,517, about $400 less than the 
superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley's two associate superintendents are the highest paid in Ventura 
County at $78,918, about $2,000 more than the assistant superintendents of the 
Hueneme Elementary School District, who make $76,735. All are base salaries and 
do not include benefits, travel expenses and other perks, such as 
district-issued cars. 
</P>
<P>
The Hueneme district has about 7,000 students, compared to Simi Valley's 
18,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in terms of teachers' salaries, the district ranked ninth 
when measured against 10 districts of comparable size and socio-economic 
profile in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the cellar as far as the pay scale," Myren said. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan, who was attending a conference in Santa Barbara, could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his own pay, Assistant Supt. Jacobs said: "It's hard to make salary 
comparisons because it depends on what you do and what you accomplish. I manage 
a very large district with very few people." 
</P>
<P>
Roth agreed, saying that because the Simi Valley Unified School District, with 
an enrollment of 18,000 students, is the largest school district in the county, 
the responsibilities for administrators are greater. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't apologize for it," Roth said of the large salaries. "The individuals 
are well worth their pay." 
</P>
<P>
One thing administrators and employees can agree on is that they are both 
facing a hard road ahead, one pitted with more uncertainties and challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Agnes M. Zagar, head librarian at Simi Valley High School, is one of those who 
will be directly affected by the job reassignments that will be made in the 
fall. Zagar will be taking the place of one of the temporary teachers who will 
be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in September, Zagar will work only three hours a day in the library 
and will spend the rest of her time teaching two classes, most likely in 
history and geography. 
</P>
<P>
Zagar is a little apprehensive about the change because, she said, she has not 
taught in a while. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be difficult," Zagar said, "to go back into the classroom after 
22 years." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley school officials will join representatives from districts in 
Ventura, Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo counties in a press conference Tuesday 
in Thousand Oaks to discuss the proposed state budget for education and its 
effect on their schools. The districts are planning to send a letter to the 
governor and state legislators asking that no more cuts in the education budget 
be made.

WINNING LANDMARK JOB BIAS SUIT LEAVES A MIXED LEGACY; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: ONE WOMAN CREDITS THE CASE FOR BEING MADE A PRINCIPAL, THE OTHER 
BLAMES IT FOR IMPENDING DEMOTION FROM ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Irena Szewiola and Pat Joyce were an unlikely pair of heroines. Joyce, a former 
gym teacher, and Szewiola, a former typing and shorthand teacher, were the sort 
of 1950s career women who had been taught that to get along you had to go 
along. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1980, Szewiola and Joyce decided to stop going along. The two women -- 
who for years could not advance beyond assistant principal -- filed a landmark 
lawsuit seeking to force the Los Angeles Unified School District to promote 
more women. It was an action that gambled their own careers on behalf of 20,000 
colleagues. The class-action lawsuit charged the district with discrimination 
against women seeking to advance from the classroom into the ranks of 
management. 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, the women look back at the battle from different vantage 
points. Joyce is a successful principal at Columbus Junior High School in 
Canoga Park. She credits the suit for her job. But Szewiola (pronounced 
Chevy-ola), now an assistant principal at Francis Polytechnic High School in 
Sun Valley, is about to be demoted and believes her role in the suit is 
responsible for her downfall. 
</P>
<P>
Like the women themselves, the agreement that settled the lawsuit in June, 
1980, has met with mixed success. There has been a huge increase in the number 
of female principals and administrators in the nation's second largest school 
district. But men still command the highest posts. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of elementary school principals who are women went from 35% in 
the fall of 1980 to about 65% now. The percentage of female principals at 
junior high schools went from 16% to 42% and at high schools from 8% to 37% 
during the same 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1980 there were no women working as principals at the district's 
39 adult schools and occupational centers. Now there are 11. School board 
member Roberta Weintraub, when she asked at the time why there were none, said 
she was told by district officials that women could not run the schools, which 
offer classes at night, because "they had to be home to cook dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, who is credited with pushing a recalcitrant board to settle the 
lawsuit, said the changes since then, though significant, have yet to meet her 
ultimate goal: appointment of a female superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite changes in the lower management ranks, district Supt. Leonard Britton 
and his top three deputies are men, as are most of the third tier of school 
district bosses, known as associate superintendents. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the settlement, called a consent decree, say the yearly promotional 
goals set by the district were not needed, that growing numbers of women would 
have been promoted to top positions anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Hunt, one of several lawyers who worked in behalf of the women, said 
statistics at the time showed clearly that although a majority of classroom 
teachers were women, most of their bosses were men. 
</P>
<P>
"When we put the facts together we determined that the people doing the 
promoting were primarily all male," said Hunt, who had experience with similar 
discrimination cases. "Not surprisingly, if you are a white male, unless your 
consciousness has been raised, there is a tendency to pick people who are 
similar to you." 
</P>
<P>
Richard K. Mason, one of the attorneys who worked on the case for the school 
district, said his side had statistics of its own. The district could show that 
it had not engaged in discrimination because women were being promoted in 
roughly the same proportion as they applied for the jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But admittedly in the early 1970s the application rate of women for many jobs 
was low," said Mason, who still works for the district. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Grey, who worked with Hunt on the case and now works in the Los Angeles 
city attorney's office, said the reason was women were discouraged from 
applying because they believed the effort was worthless. Many at the district 
believed that "women were happier as teachers," therefore very few applied for 
administrative jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although both sides believed they would win in trial, they agreed it would be 
costly and time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
After several months of negotiations, the two sides agreed on a settlement in 
which the district promised to promote women at the same rates that they 
applied for jobs such as assistant principal and higher. The district also 
agreed to annual goals of having at least 40% of those applicants be women, 
targets that have been met every year since then. 
</P>
<P>
"The time was ripe," said Mason, speaking of the district's settlement 
agreement, which was eventually approved by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the school board indicated that it would extend the terms of the 
consent decree after its expiration in June. Board members Jackie Goldberg and 
Rita Walters asked this month that its provisions be extended to women working 
for the district in jobs other than teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Walters -- the only other current board member who was also on the board at the 
time the consent decree was signed -- said the agreement was significant. 
</P>
<P>
"But for the most part it would have probably happened anyway because of events 
external to the district," Walters said. "There was a strong push for women's 
rights that, as far as I am concerned, was long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, who was and remains a political adversary of Walters on the board, 
came to the same conclusion following a meeting with district women who let 
loose with years of accumulated complaints. Weintraub found parallels in her 
own life at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was expected to be home and God forbid I didn't have dinner on the table," 
said Weintraub, a conservative who less than a year earlier had been elected to 
the board based on her opposition to mandatory busing. "The whole issue hit 
home for me and became overwhelming. No one was going to hold me down any 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
Szewiola and Joyce attended the meeting with Weintraub. The following month 
they sought legal help to prepare their lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce had been an assistant principal for 18 years, placing several times near 
the top of the promotion list. But in every instance, a man got the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know why I was being passed over," said Joyce, 63. "It seemed they 
used all kinds of excuses." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after settlement of the lawsuit, Joyce finally made principal. She 
credits the agreement for her promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Szewiola's career is not headed for such a storybook ending. She was 
transferred eight times before the lawsuit and has been moved five times since 
the settlement. District officials say privately she is being demoted because 
she cannot get along with people. 
</P>
<P>
Szewiola, an administrator for 22 years, denies the charge and says the action 
is in retaliation for her outspoken participation in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"You can kill somebody with rumor and that is what they've done to me," said 
Szewiola, 62. 
</P>
<P>
The school district, through its attorney Mason, denies the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Although Szewiola said she has not given up fighting to retain her position, 
her chances are slim. She said she cannot afford to retire and therefore faces 
the prospect of teaching a subject that no longer resembles anything like the 
business courses she taught during the 1950s and 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"In 22 years shorthand has been replaced by word processing and I am not 
trained in word processing," Szewiola said. "But I must go back to the 
classroom because I have to work." 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Cheng, who for several years was director of the district's sex equity 
commission, said she believes Szewiola is being punished partly because of her 
strong personality and tendency to lock horns with superiors, attributes that 
district officials use to label her a troublemaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether they like her or not, she has done something heroic for all women in 
the district," said Cheng, who no longer works for the district. "The sad part 
is that nobody comes up to her and says, 'I appreciate you putting your name on 
that suit and making it better for the rest of us.' "

<P>
The Supreme Court refused today to let an anti-abortion group block the 
entrances to abortion clinics in New York. It was the second high court setback 
in two weeks for Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
The justices' action was praised by abortion-rights advocates and denounced by 
Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry. The court left intact an order in which 
a federal judge permanently banned the group's members from interfering with 
women entering New York-area abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue members are under similar injunctions in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous victory," said Bill Baird, who runs two Long Island clinics 
where demonstrations have occurred repeatedly. "I'd like to see the courts go 
further and assign federal marshals to escort women in, just as they escorted 
blacks into buildings in the 1960s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, in a statement released from Operation Rescue's office in Binghamton, 
N.Y., said, "No court can prohibit us from rescuing babies. These judges have 
joined the heritage of Nazi judges who sanctioned the murders of the innocent." 
</P>
<P>
The justices took today's action -- not a formal ruling but a denial of 
Operation Rescue's appeal -- without comment and without any recorded 
dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, the court voted 5-4 to leave intact a similar ban on Operation 
Rescue blockades at abortion clinics in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
But today's action was a bigger setback for Operation Rescue. The court's order 
in the Atlanta case was preliminary in nature. The dispute had reached the 
justices as a request for emergency help before Georgia courts had finished 
studying the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The four justices who voted to allow demonstrations in Atlanta said free-speech 
restrictions should not have been imposed before the state courts had a chance 
to rule definitively. 
</P>
<P>
The high court today rejected a formal appeal by Operation Rescue after lower 
courts ruled definitively against the group in the New York case. 
</P>
<P>
The National Organization for Women and other abortion-rights advocates sued 
Operation Rescue and Terry in a New York state court in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a humdinger . . . couldn't be better," said NOW President Molly Yard. 
"They were breaking the law," she said, adding that her organization is ready 
to seek court injunctions anywhere Operation Rescue members try to bar access 
to clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, seeking an end to the group's blockades, alleged violations of 
several state laws and one federal law, the Ku Klux Klan Act. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue's lawyers had the case transferred to federal court, where 
U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in early 1989 permanently enjoined the 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals last Sept. 20 upheld Ward's injunction 
and became the nation's first federal appeals court to rule that Operation 
Rescue's tactics violate women's civil rights and are not a type of protected 
free speech. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said the Operation Rescue demonstrators had violated the Ku 
Klux Klan Act's ban on conspiracies that violate the rights of a "class of 
persons."

BUCKEY JUDGE SAYS HE REFUSED TO TALK ON PHONE WITH REINER 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The judge in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial said today that Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner tried to contact him last week, apparently to discuss reports 
of plea-bargain discussions in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg said he refused to speak with Reiner on 
the telephone, saying it would be improper for him to do so because he was 
presiding over the retrial of former McMartin teacher Ray Buckey on eight 
molestation counts. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally cannot conceive of any reason why Mr. Reiner would want to 
communicate with me," Weisberg, appearing angry, told lawyers in the case as 
the retrial resumed after a one-week recess. 
</P>
<P>
Weisberg said that, while in New York last Tuesday to attend the graduation of 
his stepson from Columbia University, one of Reiner's investigators telephoned 
him and said that "Ira Reiner wanted to talk to me the next morning and wanted 
to know if I would make myself available." 
</P>
<P>
The investigator said Reiner apparently wanted to talk with Weisberg about an 
article in the Daily Journal, a Los Angeles legal newspaper, that reported that 
prosecutors had discussed a possible plea bargain with Buckey's attorney, Danny 
Davis. The judge said he refused the next day to speak with Reiner.

A young Latino man reportedly wearing a clown suit was shot and killed by a San 
Diego police officer after the man assaulted two highway patrolmen with a 
bricklayer's tool and threatened commuters on a busy freeway this morning, 
police said. The unidentified victim, believed to be in his late 20s, was 
killed when San Diego Police Officer Thomas K. O'Connell fired about eight 
shots from his semiautomatic weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The man was pronounced dead at the scene, on the southbound lanes of Interstate 
5 near La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Robinson, a San Diego police spokesman, said the incident began shortly 
before 8 a.m. when officers spotted the man walking on the freeway's shoulder. 
The victim charged at two California Highway Patrol officers who responded to 
the call, swinging a trowel and striking both of them during a struggle in the 
middle of the freeway, Robinson said. The extent of their injuries was unknown.

GIRL, 10, SMELLED SMOKE, MAY HAVE SAVED LIVES OF 5 IN FAMILY

A 10-year-old girl who awoke today to the smell of smoke in her Panorama City 
home helped alert and evacuate her family and was being credited by the Los 
Angeles Fire Department with possibly saving their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Raquel Guerrero said her spot on the top bed of a set of bunk beds may have 
allowed her to smell smoke before anyone else in the house in the 14100 block 
of Terra Bella Street. 
</P>
<P>
She jumped down after waking about 1 a.m. and woke her 15-year-old brother, 
Romie, who was on the bottom bunk. 
</P>
<P>
The two children then went through the smoke-filled house and woke their 
elderly grandparents and an uncle. Everyone escaped without injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to get everybody out as fast as we could," Raquel said after the 
fire was out. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Robert Teachenor said the fire started in the bedroom of the 
girl's mother, Rosina Robinson, when a votive candle left unattended burned 
down. Robinson was at work at the time of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
After firefighters arrived, they searched the house and saved five family pets 
-- a dog and four kittens, Teachenor said. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the house was estimated at about $50,000.

Calling Dr. Johnson, Dr. Johnson, Dr. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Triplets Philip, Perry and Paul Johnson together received degrees Sunday from 
the University of Kansas Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks our dad would be a doctor, but he's not, he's a building 
contractor," Philip said. "But he had high hopes for all of us, and he taught 
us our work ethic." Their brother, David, is in his second year at the same 
medical school. 
</P>
<P>
Despite sharing looks, medical interests and nearly identical academic records, 
the 25-year-olds say friends and family can tell them apart. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually just do our own thing. In a classroom we don't sit together, and we 
don't make a spectacle of ourselves," Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
But Perry admitted that the three sometimes have identity problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The most typical thing is that someone will say 'hi' to you in a hallway, for 
instance, and you just say 'hi' back to them because you don't know if you 
really know that person or if they know one of your brothers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers attended the University of Kansas as undergraduates and medical 
students, but now plan separate paths. Philip plans a career in radiology, 
Perry as a surgeon and Paul is focusing on internal medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The Walt Disney Co. had hoped to film them graduating from medical school and 
shouting "We're going to Disneyland!" they said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was scuttled when the school refused to change its graduation ceremony 
to accommodate the camera crew, and the Johnsons seemed a little relieved. 
</P>
<P>
"We all feel a little bad about the hype we've received," Philip said. "We 
really haven't accomplished anything our classmates haven't."

<P>
Security forces fired today on a crowd of 100,000 Muslims carrying the body of 
a slain Kashmir religious leader, and at least 30 people were killed and 200 
injured, witnesses and doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
State government officials in Srinagar could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses and doctors in Srinagar said 30 bodies and at least 200 people with 
bullet wounds were brought to Soura Hospital. Many of the injured said 40 more 
bodies still lay on the streets in the Srinagar neighborhood where the firing 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The city was under curfew, and further details were not available immediately. 
</P>
<P>
For five months soldiers and other security forces have been deployed in 
Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, in a bid to control a violent campaign by 
Islamic militants who want the predominantly Muslim state to secede from mostly 
Hindu India. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has renewed tensions between India and predominantly Muslim 
Pakistan, and a high-level U.S. delegation began talks in New Delhi today in an 
attempt to ease the friction. 
</P>
<P>
Troops cordoned off the area around the shooting scene in the Hawal 
neighborhood. Hawal and nearby areas had been placed under curfew earlier in 
the day after the assassination of Maulvi Mohammed Farooq, Kashmir's top 
Islamic religious leader. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of mourners defied the curfew and carried Farooq's coffin 
from the Soura Hospital to his office in Rajouri Kadal, a distance of six 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Central Reserve Police Force fired on the procession when it had 
traveled five miles, the witnesses said. There was no warning before the 
firing, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The coffin was hit by bullets and Farooq's body fell out, the witnesses said. 
Some of the mourners put the body, with fresh bullet wounds, back into the 
coffin and ran with it into the narrow alleys. They reached his office safely, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people converged on Rajouri Kadal to see the body. Farooq's aides 
said the funeral date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
Farooq, 45, was shot in his office by three unidentified men after the trio 
took him from his residence to "talk," said Farooq's chief aide, Mohammed 
Maqbool. 
</P>
<P>
A militant Islamic group leading the secessionist movement accused Indian 
forces of killing Farooq. Amanullah Khan, leader of the Jammu-Kashmir 
Liberation Front, said the Indian army plotted Farooq's death with the help of 
the Hindu fundamentalist organization Shiv Sena. 
</P>
<P>
Farooq suffered 15 bullet wounds to the head, chest, stomach and legs and died 
later in Soura Hospital, a doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
Farooq's private secretary, Mohammed Yaqub, said the clergyman, before dying, 
accused Hindu fundamentalists of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Farooq had denounced the Indian military deployment and crackdown in Kashmir, 
but his importance in the troubled valley had been eclipsed by Muslims fighting 
for an independent nation. 
</P>
<P>
After the Indian government began cracking down on the separatist movement Jan. 
20, Farooq joined the call for independence. Before that, however, he had urged 
a political settlement of the problem.

A science teacher was preparing to blow up the school when the assistant 
principal discovered him, so he shot the administrator to death, according to a 
published report today. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Givens is charged with fatally shooting Assistant Principal Ron Wallace 
and then setting fire to the school, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Givens was being held without bond today at the county jail. 
</P>
<P>
The Nashville Banner, quoting unidentified investigators, reported that Givens 
was planning to set off an explosion at Hickman County High School when Wallace 
walked in on him Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Givens was turning on propane gas spigots in the school science 
department where candles were burning, investigators told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Wayne Qualls said several student complaints had been lodged against 
Givens, 50, and the teacher may have feared he was about to lose his tenured 
job.

Billboards showing Mikhail S. Gorbachev touting a Minnesota-made vodka will be 
changed during the Soviet president's visit to the Twin Cities next month, a 
liquor wholesaler said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Civically, we feel it's our part to welcome him respectfully," said Mitchell 
Johnson, president of Johnson Brothers Wholesale Liquor Co. of St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson Brothers had earlier approved the billboard campaign for Minnesota-made 
Karkov vodka. The billboards show a likeness of Gorbachev holding a bottle of 
Karkov under the caption "The Party's Over," a reference to the Communist 
Party's problems. 
</P>
<P>
The 38 billboards dot the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and were planned to be up 
until mid-June. Gorbachev is scheduled to visit the Twin Cities for six hours 
on June 3 after attending summit talks with President Bush in Washington.

The Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that the federal government has 
exclusive legal power over federally licensed hydroelectric power plants and 
that individual states cannot impose environmental regulations on the projects. 
</P>
<P>
Writing for the court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor rejected the pleas of 
California, 43 other states and environmentalists seeking to give state 
agencies the authority to regulate water flow to power plants. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved a hydroelectric project on Rock Creek, a tributary of the 
American River near Placerville. The owner, Rock Creek Limited Partnership, 
planned to generate electric power and sell it to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the project in 1983, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
required that the plant maintain minimum water flow rates to protect the 
creek's fish population. 
</P>
<P>
The state water resources agency then sought to further limit the flow of water 
for the project in an effort to assure the survival of trout and other types of 
fish in the creek. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, normally a strong advocate of states' rights, ruled in this case that 
the federal government was given exclusive authority by Congress in regulating 
hydroelectric power plants. 
</P>
<P>
"Allowing California to impose significantly higher minimum stream flow 
requirements would disturb and conflict with the balance embodied in the 
federal agency's determination," she said in the 14-page opinion that was a 
victory for the nation's utilities. 
</P>
<P>
The decision keeps sole power over the plants with the federal government, 
which has had broad authority over developing and licensing hydroelectric 
projects since 1935. 
</P>
<P>
Electric utilities had warned that the financial health of numerous plants 
could be threatened if states suddenly were allowed to limit the flow of water 
to them.

Scranton's oldest newspaper, the Scrantonian Tribune, was purchased by its

</P>
<P>
Employees arriving for work at the newspaper were told that today's edition 
would be the last.

<P>
In the Tribune newsroom, someone scrawled "30" -- the symbol traditionally used 
by reporters at the end of a story -- on a locker.

<P>
MediaOne Inc., which bought the Scrantonian Publishing Co. from the Goodman 
family of Scranton in 1987, announced the newspaper's demise in a brief 
release. 
</P>
<P>
"The deteriorating economic conditions affecting the Northeast no longer made 
it economically viable to publish a second newspaper in the Scranton market," 
MediaOne said. 
</P>
<P>
The Scranton Times, which published an afternoon newspaper for many years, 
launched a morning edition, the Morning Times, in 1988 to compete directly with 
the Tribune.

A bomb exploded in a bank night deposit box early today, the second bank in the 
area to be damaged in an overnight blast this month, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A Riverside County sheriff's deputy on patrol heard the explosion at the 
Provident Federal Savings Bank, on state Route 111 and Bob Hope Drive, about 
2:30 a.m., Sgt. Keith Stinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The blast caused damage to two walls and scattered money from the deposit box 
outside the bank. There was no indication that anyone got inside the building 
after the explosion, Stinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank was closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Stinson said agents were looking into similarities between the Provident bank 
blast and one May 8 at a Bank of America branch in Palm Springs, several miles 
to the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
That bomb blew off the night deposit box door, littering the bank parking lot 
with cash and causing about $100,000 in damage.

GM TO LINK U.S. DEALERS TO SATELLITE SYSTEM BY '92;

General Motors Corp. today announced plans to link its 9,700 U.S. dealers to a 
satellite system by late 1992 that will replace public telephone lines and form 
the cornerstone of a futuristic "Buck Rogers" communications network. 
</P>
<P>
Called Pulsat, the new system will be the world's largest private satellite 
network and connect virtually all operations of the giant auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
GM will pay for the installation of a Hughes satellite at each dealership, 
which is expected to be compatible with most computer screens at dealers, said 
Duncan Brodie, director of dealer systems and communications for GM. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the system is not expected to increase dealers' current 
communications expenses. GM will also pay for a comprehensive training program 
for both dealers and GM employees, Brodie said. 
</P>
<P>
GM declined to say how much the system or training will cost it, although 
Brodie acknowledged that a key part of Pulsat is to realize future savings by 
reducing its use of land lines. 
</P>
<P>
While Pulsat will initially provide rapid exchange of information on purchasing 
costs, warranty, service and recall data, it could also eventually provide 
dealers with electronic shop manuals, electronic vehicle invoicing and the next 
generation of vehicle diagnostics. 
</P>
<P>
"The Buck Rogers concept is becoming reality," said Brodie. 
</P>
<P>
Pulsat was also viewed as one of the first practical applications of GM's 
multibillion-dollar purchases of Electronic Data Systems Corp. and Hughes 
Aircraft Co. in 1984 and 1985, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most specific effort at this point in time, and it is the first 
time we have combined the specific talents of both EDS and Hughes," said 
Brodie, noting the concept of a massive satellite network began about 15 months 
ago and included dealers to design the system. 
</P>
<P>
Brodie conceded that Pulsat may in some cases allow dealers to reduce their 
staff, noting that dealerships in general "are under tremendous financial 
burdens." 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corp. is now linking its 5,300 dealers via Hughes-built satellites 
under a program to be fully operational this fall. 
</P>
<P>
EDS will provide the development and implementation of the system, while GM 
Hughes' Hughes Network System will provide the satellite technology and a 
six-foot diameter dish.

'BIRD' LANDS $16 MILLION AT BOX OFFICE

The summer movie-going season got a rousing kickoff with the startling weekend 
performance of Universal Pictures' "Bird on a Wire." Despite largely negative 
reviews, the Mel Gibson-Goldie Hawn romantic comedy earned about $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
Orion Pictures' comedy, "Cadillac Man" -- starring Robin Williams as a 
fast-talking car salesman -- also overcame a slew of critical thumbs-downs to 
snare the No. 2 spot, with ticket sales of about $6.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The performance of "Bird on a Wire" and "Cadillac Man" -- the inaugural entries 
in the summer movie sweepstakes -- would seem to bode well for the season's 
movie onslaught, which continues with the Memorial Day release of Universal 
Pictures' "Back to the Future III." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Touchstone Pictures' "Pretty Woman" continues to show great legs. 
With ticket sales of about $6.3 million, the romantic comedy starring Richard 
Gere and Julia Roberts garnered third place. 
</P>
<P>
It has now grossed over $107 million. 
</P>
<P>
With receipts of about $2.9 million, New Line Cinema's "Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles" was ranked fourth. It has now earned over $113 million. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth place went to Paramount Pictures' horror anthology, "Tales From the 
Darkside, the Movie," which earned about $2 million.

'91 GRAMMYS: AND THE WINNER IS NEW YORK; 
</P>
<P>
RECORDING: LOS ANGELES WAS THE LOSER IN THE TWO-WAY BATTLE FOR THE PRESTIGIOUS 
AWARD SHOW.

<P>
New York City is the winner of the 1991 Grammys, leaving Los Angeles as the 
loser. 
</P>
<P>
The National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences announced today that the 
music industry's most prestigious awards will be handed out in New York's Radio 
City Music Hall in late February. All but four of the Grammys' 32 awards shows 
have been in Los Angeles, including the two most recent, held at the Shrine 
Auditorium in Los Angeles. New York hosted the Grammys in 1988, 1981, 1974 and 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a New York press conference featuring appearances 
by academy President Michael Greene and New York Mayor David N. Dinkins, who 
touted the decision as "a vote of confidence in our city and for our city's 
future" and promised "the biggest and best celebration in the history of the 
Grammys." 
</P>
<P>
This is a triumph for New York, which has lobbied heavily for the Grammys to 
alternate between the two cities, if not move permanently to the Big Apple. For 
Los Angeles, which has campaigned just as concertedly to be the sole host, it 
represents a significant blow. 
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously disappointed by the decision," said Bill Chandler, 
spokesperson for Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who is on a trade mission in 
Korea and Japan. "But it is clear that Los Angeles, home of the Oscar ceremony 
and a number of other awards proceedings, is the true entertainment capital of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
Chandler also expressed confidence that the Grammys would return to Los Angeles 
soon, noting that the academy is based here and continues to work with the city 
on various educational and industry development projects. 
</P>
<P>
Shell Ausman, chairman of Mayor Bradley's Grammy host committee, said he wasn't 
surprised by the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all suspicious that NARAS might have to succumb to the pressure of its 
New York members," he said, citing tourism dollars as the biggest loss. "The 
Grammys attracts a lot of people for that week." 
</P>
<P>
Ausman predicted that New York's harsher winter weather will continue to give 
Los Angeles an advantage in the competition between the cities for the awards 
show.

The creator of the syndicated comic strip "Calvin and Hobbes" is resisting the 
riches that would come his way from marketing his characters. William Watterson 
II, speaking at Sunday's commencement at his alma mater, Kenyon College, says 
he doesn't want to commercialize them, despite the wishes of Universal Press 
Syndicate to turn them into "TV hucksters." 
</P>
<P>
"We've been fighting for over three years now," said Watterson, a 1980 graduate 
of Kenyon. 
</P>
<P>
Watterson would stand to make a mint if his Calvin, the sage 6-year-old, and 
his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, were turned into toys, but he says artistic 
principle comes before commercialization. "Sooner or later, we are all asked to 
compromise ourselves and the things we care about," he told the graduates. 
"There are no good ways to sell yourself out."

Bill Cosby told University of Notre Dame graduates to be grateful to their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"How did you come to live so long?" the 52-year-old comedian asked on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Because they let you live," he answered to applause and laughter from the 
2,400 students, parents and faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
Cosby, who has a doctorate in education, received an honorary doctor of laws 
degree from the university. 
</P>
<P>
"With all of my heart and soul, I want all of you to understand that what you 
call the world out there is rough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rough not only in terms of your job but in terms of your personal 
relationships. You'll have many, many friends, but if your relationship with 
your mate is 100% of your heart, you'll never need a friend."

The legendary Cadillac Ranch outside Amarillo has been refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 Cadillacs -- planted in the ground radiator first along Interstate 10 as 
an artistic statement -- were painted flat gray in January as part of a 
commercial for Lincoln Town Cars. 
</P>
<P>
But the ranch's caretaker, Stanley Marsh 3 (he prefers "3" to "III"), didn't 
like the new color. "The cars are supposed to be cheery and they looked dull, 
like it was an undercoat," Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
So he had them painted bright pink. "It had nothing to do with any of those 
rock 'n' roll songs about pink Cadillacs," Marsh told Texas Monthly magazine. 
"I did it for my wife on Valentine's Day." Marsh says he preferred the battered 
and bashed condition the cars were in before they were cleaned up for the 
commercial. "All that graffiti and vandalism gave them a real patina, like 
those Chinese vases that increase in value with each crack," he said. "It shows 
people love their monuments."

<P>
World-renowned basketball rules authority Edward S. Steitz, who brought the 
three-point shot to the international and college game, has died at age 69. 
</P>
<P>
Steitz, director of athletics-emeritus at Springfield College, died this 
morning at his home in East Longmeadow, according to college spokesman Ken 
Cerino. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was not immediately revealed. Steitz was hospitalized 
earlier in the year for two weeks after a severe angina attack. 
</P>
<P>
He had taught at Springfield College since 1948 and was director of athletics 
for 33 years, retiring last July. 
</P>
<P>
As editor for the NCAA rules committee since 1968 and assistant editor before 
then, Steitz was responsible for most of basketball's major changes in the last 
25 years, including the time clock, the elimination of the center jump and the 
return of the dunk. Steitz said in a March interview that the 3-point shot was 
the most important rules change since the elimination of the center jump 53 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's accomplished everything the Rules Committee wanted," said Steitz "The 
dunk is no longer basketball's home run, the 3-point shot is." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, he was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor.

Texas sports agent Lance Luchnick, who represented Alabama linebacker Keith 
McCants, pleaded guilty today to a reduced charge of violating Alabama's sports 
agent registration law and was fined $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mobile County Circuit Judge Braxton Kittrell suspended a six-month jail 
sentence for the San Antonio lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Luchnick pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of trying to violate the 
registration law. 
</P>
<P>
In a plea-bargain agreement, Luchnick avoided a felony charge for his 
representation of McCants during NFL negotiations after the Mobile native gave 
up his senior season at the University of Alabama so he could turn pro. McCants 
signed with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
In Alabama, failure of a sports agent to register with the state is punishable 
by a $5,000 fine and up to 10 years in prison. The law was passed by the state 
Legislature in hopes of protecting student-athletes from unscrupulous agents. 
</P>
<P>
Luchnick said before the NFL draft that he had not registered with the Alabama 
Athlete Agents Regulatory Commission. Pearl Maxwell, a commission spokeswoman, 
said Luchnick sent in an application but it was rejected.

MELVIN DURSLAG: LET THE NBA FINALS GROW UP AND MOVE TO A PLACE OF ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Melvin Durslag 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the NBA is doing all right without our counseling, you can imagine the 
towering heights it would scale soliciting the erudition made available here. 
</P>
<P>
All the NBA has to do is make an appointment, and it will be advised to forget 
this home-and-home madness in the final round of its playoffs and anchor the 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
It would follow the path of the NCAA Final Four and the Super Bowl, not to 
mention the Grey Cup and the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
And do you see the Rose Bowl float? 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl each New Year's matches the champion of the Big Ten against that 
of the Pacific-10. At season's start, we don't know who those champions are 
going to be, but we know where they are going to play. 
</P>
<P>
Anchoring a major event, whose location is posted long in advance, gives it 
stability. Teams and their fans can point for it. Hotel arrangements can be 
made calmly. Players are spared travel fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
And, most important, a neutral site assures a truer test of skills, especially 
in basketball in which home court is rated an edge so colossal. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," you claim, "in the present NBA setup, teams trade home courts, meaning a 
standoff." 
</P>
<P>
And the answer is, an edge in any athletic contest, regardless of which team 
gets it, divests that contest of its character. 
</P>
<P>
If home crowds can tilt outcomes, as they seem to do in basketball, you have 
reduced the final to some kind of sideshow. 
</P>
<P>
So what the NBA wants to do is give folks home-and-home playoffs in the first 
three rounds of the tournament, then anchor the big casino in a neutral spot. 
</P>
<P>
Cities would bid for it, precisely as they bid for the Super Bowl and the NCAA, 
and guaranteed sellouts to each performance would be a condition of the 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
In this concept, the NBA would have a superior final and a promotional jewel on 
its hands, and, thoughtfully, it would ask itself why it didn't consult this 
man earlier. 
</P>
<P>
If it was noted here recently that Lesley Visser of CBS showed up for an NBA 
telecast wearing pearls, a fashion anachronism for an exudative game such as 
basketball, what can we say about Cotton Fitzsimmons, coach of Phoenix? 
</P>
<P>
Cotton was seen at a Laker game attired in a double-breasted suit, from whose 
lapel pocket protruded a smart black handkerchief. 
</P>
<P>
Fashionwise, he obviously was determined not to play second violin to Pat 
Riley, coach of the Lakers, who selected for the occasion a dark blue suit 
bearing the unmistakable stamp of custom tailoring. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's Chuck Daly, too, is seen on the court sartorially splendid, leading 
one to ask whether basketball coaches are aware of their environment? 
</P>
<P>
Folks, we are talking glorified gymnasiums, inhabited by players shod in 
sneakers and by fans dressed for a day at the dock. 
</P>
<P>
Among coaches, what has happened to the old philosophers in a sweat shirt? 
</P>
<P>
In baseball, a manager wears the get-up of his players, leading to the 
suggestion here that basketball coaches appear courtside in underwear. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of their departure from the current tournament, the Lakers sit 
in shock, unable to believe they were removed from the proceedings so early. 
</P>
<P>
They have explored a number of causes, not among them the hard realization that 
teams -- even giants -- sooner or later flame out. 
</P>
<P>
If they don't, why are the Yankees on their hindquarters today? Why are the 
Cowboys, the Raiders, the Celtics and the Canadiens? 
</P>
<P>
No one has a lock on winning, leading you to suspect the Lakers either aren't 
thinking well, or they are over-dramatizing their demise, grandstanding for 
their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers enjoyed an uncommonly long run. There were fawning fans and parades 
down Broadway. There were sellout crowds, at the steepest ticket prices in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Now they pick up the fragments, and what has happened is neither the surprise, 
nor the human tragedy, they paint. 
</P>
<P>
The case of David Robinson, center for San Antonio voted NBA Rookie of the 
Year, would seem to pose a problem for the United States Naval Academy in 
connection with future recruiting of basketball centers. 
</P>
<P>
It generally is accepted in the sport, college and pro, that the so-called "big 
man" is a necessary adjunct of a team's success. 
</P>
<P>
It appears to be a fact, too, that a big man -- say, 7 feet -- can be excused 
prematurely from post-Academy duty because of his height. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the usual Annapolis graduate is asked to serve the Navy a minimum of 
five years, Robinson was permitted to leave after two because he had risen to 7 
feet 1. 
</P>
<P>
He was shorter, it is claimed, when the academy recruited him as an 
undergraduate player. 
</P>
<P>
So how does the academy now proceed? If men are trained basically as naval 
officers, not as basketball players, must sights now be set on centers who rise 
maybe 6 feet 6? 
</P>
<P>
That means, by today's standards, the academy must go without the "big man." 
</P>
<P>
Or does the Navy Department change specifications on its submarines, 
accommodating 7-foot officers, and on destroyers, minesweepers, aircraft 
carriers and the like? 
</P>
<P>
National security is a small risk in the context of running a basketball team 
without the big guy at center.

FALCONS WORRIED SANDERS MAY STAY WITH BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

If Deion Sanders becomes the New York Yankees' starting left fielder and fails 
to report when the Falcons open training camp July 26, he would be required to 
pay back a significant portion of the $2.01-million signing bonus he received 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Falcons aren't making an issue of it yet, but they are worried 
"Prime Time" may decide Yankee Stadium is a more glamorous stage on which to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in competition for Deion's services," Jim Hay, Falcons vice president 
for finance, said. "The indication we get is that he will play football when 
it's time. But those things change. 
</P>
<P>
"He said one thing when he was sent to Columbus (Ohio). It might change if he's 
playing for the Yankees and hitting .340. Yankee Stadium is an intriguing 
thing. He may look at baseball salaries, and if he projects himself as a 
big-time player, he might play baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Yankees Manager Bucky Dent has said Sanders could be called up within the week 
from Columbus, where he was hitting .357 through last Thursday's games. The 
Dave Winfield trade was made, in part, to clear a spot in the lineup for "Neon 
Deion." 
</P>
<P>
Yankees Executive Vice President George Bradley, who negotiated Sanders' 
baseball contract earlier this year, said the deal reflects a strong commitment 
to baseball by Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me put it this way; it's a weighted contract," Bradley said. "It's heavily 
weighted toward the end of the year. He's got too much to lose by leaving. If 
he's not in the major leagues (on July 26), he has a right to leave, but I'm 
not certain he would do it even then. There are not only financial reasons for 
him to stay but also a lot of long-term stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' four-year package with the Falcons is worth $4.41 million. If he 
remains with the Yankees, it's likely Sanders would have to refund a prorated 
portion of the signing bonus -- $500,000 for each year in which he fails to 
play a full season -- but Hay declined to specify how much Sanders would owe. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons are hoping to avoid a situation similar to that of Bo Jackson, who 
plays a full baseball season with the Royals and then takes his place in the 
Raiders' backfield in late October.

BETTING THE SYSTEMS: 20% IS MAGIC NUMBER FOR 'DOC'S' DAY AT RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Doc" has been a pediatrician for the past 23 years, and, instead of 
looking forward to a day of golf on Wednesdays as other medical men seem to do, 
he, instead, loves to go to one of the local race tracks. Although everyone 
knows him as "Doc," he doesn't look like one. He is of average height, greatly 
overweight with a large paunch, and so nervous that he smokes cigarette after 
cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, The Doc is good at taking care of babies and actually makes house 
calls in a day and age when no other doctors will. Also, he is on call 24 hours 
a day. His patients like to believe that they can get him by phone within 30 
minutes, even if he is on vacation in the Soviet Union or China or anywhere 
else on the other side of the world. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he is so good that the mothers and fathers of the babies he takes care 
of recently gave him a $200-a-plate dinner. With the money they bought him a 
new car. 
</P>
<P>
The Doc's handicapping ability is about on a par with his huge stomach -- not 
very good! And he realizes it! Thus, he reasons, he would be better off to use 
the handicapper selections from the local newspaper, which is the Los Angeles 
Times. He has a choice of three -- Bob Mieszerski, Curtis Crayon and Pat Ray -- 
and tries to pick the one who holds the hottest hand on Wednesdays, when he 
visits the track. 
</P>
<P>
What he likes to do is start the day off with $200. It's a limit he feels 
comfortable with. Then he will use 20% of the $200 for his first wager and 
continue to bet 20% as long as his money holds up. If he wins, the percentage 
stays the same but the bets get higher. And if he loses, the wagers decrease. 
Also, when wagering, he disregards the odd cents up to a dollar that he gets 
back in payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
If he should lose all nine races, The Doc reasons that he will be left with $29 
at the end of the day, which should be enough for a good glass of French wine, 
particularly a 4- or 5-year-old white Burgundy, which he prefers, and a steak 
dinner. Overall, when he has a winning day, the profit generally makes up for 
the losing ones and on average The Doc is satisfied with how he ends up after a 
season of Wednesday bets. 
</P>
<P>
Last April 4 at Santa Anita, he followed Ray and admittedly had one of his best 
days. Here's how it went: 
</P>
<P>
In the first race, The Doc bet $40 and lost when Ray's selection of Just Never 
Mind ran third. He also lost $32 in the second when Baldski's Pidna finished 
behind the leader and lost $25 in the third when Chip's De Mere ran second, 
cutting his bankroll down to $103. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth race turned the losing streak around for the day. Mittens And Mink, 
in a 6-furlong sprint for 3-year-old fillies, started out ninth from the No. 1 
post position. Entering the stretch, the horse was running second. However, 
once on the straightaway, the horse made a big move and pulled away easily to 
win by 6 1/2 lengths. For a $20 bet, The Doc received $66 on a $6.60 mutuel. 
With his $46 profit, The Doc now had $149. 
</P>
<P>
The next race called for a wager of $29, which he placed on Devine Force. 
Running against other 3-year-olds, also in a 6-furlong dash, Devine Force broke 
from the No. 8 post position, settled into third at the start and bided its 
time until the stretch where it took over second by three lengths. The horse 
then made a move and hit the finish line one-half length in front, paying 
$5.40. Getting back $78.30, The Doc added $49.30 to his bankroll and was almost 
even with a total of $198.30. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Ray's top pick, Bold Guzzler, put him into the big bucks 
category. The nag was fifth at the quarter-pole, then moved up to fourth at the 
half-mile, and ran third into the stretch. Bold Guzzler then overtook the 
leader to win by a head and paid a long-shot price of $18.60. For the $39 that 
The Doc bet, he got back $362.70 and won $323.70 on the race. Suddenly he went 
from a slight loss to a huge $322 profit. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh race called for him to wager $104, which was 20% of his total $522. 
Ray's pick turned out to be the odds-on favorite, Somethingdifferent, which 
paid $3.20 in winning a mile race by one length on the turf. His return was 
$166.40 and profit was $62.40. Now he was winning $384.40. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth race, the system called for him to wager $116 on Olympic 
Prospect, which was running 6 1/2 furlongs against three other horses. As a 
result, there was no show betting on the race. When Olympic Prospect raced to a 
four-length lead by quarter-pole, the race was over. Olympic Prospect increased 
its lead to 10 lengths entering the stretch and then coasted to a seven-length 
victory. The horse paid $3, returning $174 to The Doc, and a $58 profit on the 
race. After counting his money, The Doc found that he had a total $642.40 and 
was a $442.40 winner. 
</P>
<P>
With one race left, there was no way he could be a loser. He wagered $128 on 
the last race of the day and quietly watched as Crystal Pirate broke from the 
No. 5 post position in a 1 1/16-mile race for fillies and mares 4-year-olds and 
up. Crystal Pirate moved up to fourth at the half-mile mark and closed to 
second entering the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Once straightened out, the nag went after the leader, Top Quality, and won by 
three-quarters of a length. For his $128, The Doc received $499.20 on a $7.80 
mutuel and won $371.20 on the race. 
</P>
<P>
For the day, he ended up with $1,013.60 and a whopping profit of $813.60. 
</P>
<P>
The Doc, of course, equates his betting system with taking care of babies. 
"Once you find the right formula," he tells his cronies, "then it's easy to end 
up a winner!"

BOOKS: IN "NOTES OF A HANGING JUDGE," ESSAYIST STANLEY CROUCH LAMBASTES BLACK 
INTELLECTUALS FOR SEPARATIST ATTITUDES THAT HE SAYS BETRAY THE CIVIL RIGHTS 
MOVEMENT.

OK, "here I go with the written part," the main theme, says essayist and jazz 
critic Stanley Crouch. "Then I'm going to step out," lay out some variations 
and riffs. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd is with him, smiling, nodding, although most conferences on race 
relations -- especially sessions sponsored by the neo-conservative National 
Forum Foundation in Washington -- seldom get this swinging a keynote speaker. 
</P>
<P>
The jovial, gruff-voiced Crouch begins a metaphoric howl into what he has 
defined as an abyss of intellectual and moral cowardice. 
</P>
<P>
His targets: contemporary African-American intellectuals, who he characterizes 
as selfish opportunists, suffering from critical bankruptcy in the face of 
fashion and ideology. 
</P>
<P>
If one finds wisdom in his words -- and this crowd does -- they are acid-dipped 
pearls taken from his new book "Notes of a Hanging Judge." One need only 
imagine the power of Duke Ellington's all-star road band pulling out all the 
stops at 1 a.m. to an audience of the jazz cognoscenti to sense Crouch's 
relentless rhetorical swings in person and in print. 
</P>
<P>
Bop! Toni Morrison, he says, is "a literary conjure woman." 
</P>
<P>
Sh-wee-doo! Black cultural separatists, he calls, "mirror-licking 
nationalists." 
</P>
<P>
Doo-wee-ahhhh!: Nation of Islam minister Louis Farrakhan? "Consistently 
incoherent." 
</P>
<P>
Sh-wee-ah-bop-bop!: Spike Lee? A "miniaturist in more than size," dwee-ah, 
whose "Do the Right Thing," for all its wit, is the sort of rancid fairy tale 
one expects of the racist, whether or not Lee actually is one." Sh-bop, bam! 
</P>
<P>
And rap group Public Enemy and those of their ilk who have engaged in the 
baiting of Jewish people, Sh-wee-ah Boom! "Afro-fascists." 
</P>
<P>
More? 
</P>
<P>
Crouch says the civil rights movement was a noble cause "gone loco," once black 
power advocates and black cultural nationalists held sway. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-Mecca Malcolm X, while part of Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam, was 
the "chief heckler of the civil rights movement," he says. 
</P>
<P>
With its science-fiction theories of race and xenophobia, the Nation of Islam 
ushered in an era of separatist thinking that undermined the inclusive, 
trans-racial vision of America represented by the civil rights movement, 
asserts Crouch. 
</P>
<P>
In the essay, "Civil Rights Blues," in his book, Crouch observes that, "Black 
nationalists seemed to get their manner from films showing off the decadent 
pageantry of popular potboilers set in Rome or Pompeii, depicting bush despots 
surrounded by the humble and gruff, the servants and the palace guard. 
Nationalists loved drums and dancing, and martial arts displays, all of which 
revealed their being caught in the party scenes of the celluloid fantasies they 
seemed to abhor." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, what made the Southern civil rights movement so revolutionary, he 
says "was a set of variations on epic themes of the labor movement and Gandhi 
with the inflections and syncopations of black Bible Belt oratory." 
</P>
<P>
"Notes of a Hanging Judge" -- an Oxford University Press collection of Crouch's 
essays and reviews written primarily for the Village Voice between 1979 and 
1989 -- is linked in tone and substance to the work of conservative, black 
journalist George A. Schuyler during the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Likening the two, Time magazine wrote that Crouch is a "scold posing as a voice 
of intellectual integrity." Too often, Time continued, he allows his valuable 
insights into the "self-victimization that has come to dominate the black, 
women's and homosexual liberation movements to degenerate into viperish 
personal attacks." 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Schuyler, Crouch -- who is 45, was born in Los Angeles, is a 
graduate of "no college," a one-time actor and director with the Watts 
Repertory Theatre and former speech writer and college instructor -- says he is 
no conservative: "I'm neither in the right wing, nor the left wing. I'm in the 
free wing." 
</P>
<P>
A giant of American literature and one of Crouch's mentors, Ralph Ellison, says 
that "behind his dissenter's rhetoric and hangman's mask, Stanley Crouch is 
actually a benign and eloquent provocateur, and whether one agrees with his 
conclusions or not he provokes us to a conscious re-evaluation of any 
unthinking assumptions we might hold regarding American society. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In short, says Charles Johnson, another admirer, a novelist and literary 
critic, Crouch says everything "we think about and talk about among ourselves," 
but fear to say in public. "He is unerringly accurate and uncompromising in his 
assessment of what he feels are intellectual and artistic errors in the work of 
his contemporaries." 
</P>
<P>
After his improvised keynote speech for the National Forum Foundation's "Second 
Thoughts About Race in America" conference, Crouch joins the conferees for a 
hotel dining room lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Over filet of sole, the hyperactive Crouch plays with his knife and checks his 
reflection on its stainless steel surface. 
</P>
<P>
Why, he is asked, is his book only descriptive and implicit when addressing 
institutionalized racism in America -- the pervasive denial of discrimination 
among whites that fuels so much negative black behavior -- but brutally 
explicit and prescriptive when dealing with the black community's ills? 
</P>
<P>
Later, far from the luncheon clatter, he gives a response in a telephone call 
from the Ragdale Foundation, a writer's retreat outside Chicago where he is 
completing his next book, a biography of jazz artist Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
The faults of white America have been discussed by blacks ad infinitum, he 
says: "Sentimentality is one of the things that most oppressed groups have to 
battle with. We have to battle with our own group sentimentality about our 
condition as much as we have to battle with any external stereotypes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The concept of "self-help" is not foreign to African-Americans, he continues. 
If black people begin to "engage their own fates," as they have done in the 
past and move from what has become a form of mass "mental illness" within the 
group (namely, blaming white people for everything), whites would be more 
supportive of issues high on the black agenda. 
</P>
<P>
But the black agenda must be viewed as inseparable from the American agenda, he 
maintains. 
</P>
<P>
"The Negro," writes Crouch -- who uses that term, black and African-American 
interchangeably, he says, depending on the rhythm of a phrase -- is at the 
"moral" center of American life "because the history of the African-American 
has been consistently interwoven with the issues that determine the fight to 
realize the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Black nationalists, he reasserts, "who confused identity with pretentious name 
changing, costumes, and rituals that turned ethnicity into a hysterically 
nostalgic social club," separated the black agenda from the nation's. 
</P>
<P>
Further, they help to set the stage for all the other counterculture movements 
that have Balkanized American society. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining that literary critics have failed to note the thematic organization 
and development in his book -- he compares it to Wagner's "Der Ring des 
Nibelungen" -- Crouch, intellectually and stylistically eclectic, lays out the 
important elements of each chapter. 
</P>
<P>
But he sounds neither like a jazz artist nor operatic devotee. Instead, in his 
"I know I'm bad" voice, he reminds one of a Contour singing the 1962 rhythm and 
blues classic "Do You Love Me." 
</P>
<P>
His version goes: 
</P>
<P>
 Do you love me? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you love me? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you love me? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you love me? 
</P>
<P>
 See how I can write, write, write 
</P>
<P>
 Watch me work, hey! 
</P>
<P>
 In the introduction, "I want to get past the complaint level and deal with 
engagement. And engagement is inspired by recognition of previous successful 
engagement." He notes the monumental changes that have taken place in this 
century: the civil rights movement and the women's movement. 
</P>
<P>
"The feminist movement is one of the most important things that has taken place 
in human history," he says. "Women have redefined themselves on a scale that 
has no precedent in the history of the world. That doesn't mean that women are 
in the catbird seat. But it damn sure means women aren't in the position they 
were when I was a little boy." 
</P>
<P>
His essay on the Rev. Jesse Jackson "sets up the grand overture," states 
Crouch. Among other things, the chapter deals with the positive way "a lot of 
white people respond to black people and the way the press is constantly 
running behind the caboose with cliches and missing all these monumental 
changes" in white attitudes and behavior toward African-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The chapter also addresses the "complex, tragic elements of American politics. 
On the one hand, there are people who might be personally screwed up but who 
can do remarkable things" -- Jackson among them, with all his personal and 
public faults. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't," Crouch says, "separate Jackson from an ex-Klansman like Hugo Black 
who went on the Supreme Court and became one of the most liberal judges in the 
history of the court. Or Lyndon Johnson who was a segregationist and got 
monumental civil rights legislation through. Or Sherman who helped win the 
Civil War but thought the Indians should be exterminated and wasn't that 
thrilled about black people either. Lincoln, who was a manic depressive and 
Grant who was an alcoholic and Jefferson who had slaves and so on." 
</P>
<P>
Our job, he says, "is to look at these things with maturity and say what is the 
upshot of this? The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are two of 
the most remarkable documents in the history of humankind. The proposition that 
we have to engage, as women . . . and others did in the wake of our struggle, 
is expanding American democracy so that those documents extend into every 
household." 
</P>
<P>
Leaping to his essay "Aunt Jemima Don't Like Uncle Ben," Crouch claims that 
"whites within the media who felt betrayed or affronted by the anti-white, 
anti-Semitic and violent tendencies of black nationalists during the '60s are 
promoting a gaggle of black female writers who pay lip service," to feminism 
while promoting new stereotypes of black men and women. 
</P>
<P>
For this offense, he shakes his hangman's noose in the direction of Alice 
Walker, Ntozake Shange and Michele Wallace, author of "Black Macho &amp; the 
Myth of the Superwoman." 
</P>
<P>
"To say it flat," Crouch pronounces, "there were a number of white women in 
relationships with black men who got messed over by these black guys during the 
civil rights movement and after. They couldn't write books about how bad these 
guys had messed over them" without being labeled racists. "A number of these 
women ended up in the publishing world . . . and they championed people like 
Alice Walker." 
</P>
<P>
When they weren't reading this type of literature, says Crouch, white women 
took their daughters to see Shange's "for colored girls who have considered 
suicide when the rainbow is enuf." They considered that bit of entertainment a 
cautionary tale: "Well there, stay away from them. That's one of them telling 
you what their men are like." 
</P>
<P>
In the type of attack "The Nation" characterized as "bilious sneering," the 
hanging judge also demands that James Baldwin walk the plank posthumously. 
</P>
<P>
Considered the "intellectual component of the civil rights movement," Baldwin, 
Crouch asserts, sanctified the oppressed and elevated victimization in 
African-American literature. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin, he says, was a seminal influence on the cultural nationalists who 
"transformed white America into Big Daddy and the Negro movement into an 
obnoxious, pouting adolescent demanding the car keys." 
</P>
<P>
Such an attitude, Crouch says, has dominated African-American letters since 
Baldwin published "The Fire Next Time" in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
In "Aunt Medea," Crouch calls the book "Beloved" by Toni Morrison, "a blackface 
holocaust novel," written to "enter American slavery into the big-time martyr 
contest." Morrison "unlike Alice Walker, has real talent," he allows. But " 
'Beloved' reads largely like a melodrama lashed to the structural conceits of 
the miniseries." 
</P>
<P>
If women writers, black or otherwise, want to be taken seriously, he asserts, 
they must write something of universal excellence; then race and gender become 
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Shange is sitting at home in Philadelphia, groaning into her phone after 
hearing about Crouch's comments. She's been reading his work for years in the 
Voice, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all," she replies, "slavery created victims. In the literature of 
Baldwin, Gayle Jones, Toni and Alice and I, what we have been determined to do 
is find strength in what our actualities were." 
</P>
<P>
If, she says, "a woman has been raped, she can not proceed with her life with 
strength," if she can't acknowledge that she has been "defiled." But she can, 
eventually "proceed with the strength garnered from knowing that she has 
survived that." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch's so-called "heroism of the victim is a total misinterpretation. What we 
have done, if I can put myself in the company of these fine writers he's 
mentioned, is face and exactingly explore the nature and capacities that 
certain experiences have allowed us and then conjure the possibilities before 
us without any definitive horizons." 
</P>
<P>
But just when he's ticked one bunch off, Crouch, the free-winger, has got a 
piece of his mind for someone else. 
</P>
<P>
In his same critique of Wallace in "Aunt Jemimah Don't Like Uncle Ben," Crouch 
says no reviewer has "dealt with the proposition I raise of how white people 
could be so manipulated by their guilt feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace quotes Lillian Hellman's "Pentimento" in "Black Macho." From his 
writers' retreat, Crouch says, "it's the quote from Hellman about how, from 
childhood, black women had been telling her what do. And that she feared and 
loved them at the same time. I said then, and I'll tell it on Telstar: I really 
believe there is a large contingent of white women who want mammies?" 
</P>
<P>
What was that? 
</P>
<P>
"M-a-double m-i-e-s. Mammies. And if the mammies are named Alice Walker, 
Ntozake Shange, Gayle Jones, Toni Morrison, that's what they're going to get. 
They want black women to tell them what they want to do." 
</P>
<P>
After a discussion on blacks and beauty, he observes that one of the saddest 
things that happened on college campuses occurred when black students began to 
segregate themselves. Instead of cultivating the genuine admiration that some 
whites had for blacks, he says, African-Americans "relinquished enormous 
influence on the direction of American society, because a lot of those white 
girls wanted to be friends with black girls. A lot of those white guys wanted 
to be friends with black guys. 
</P>
<P>
"In 'Aunt Jemima Don't Like Uncle Ben,' I say that some people dealt with that 
on an opportunistic level. Rather than expand human understanding, they played 
on white females' intimidation by black women and elevated the image of black 
brute, then tried to take the steering wheel of feminism," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch returns to the theme of the powerful black women toward the end of his 
book in "Aunt Medea," the essay about Toni Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
Novelist Mary Gordon tells about a dream she had of Morrison. "That dream says 
it all," tells Crouch. "She dreams she's in this ramshackle mansion with all 
these rats and roaches and turns to Toni and says: 'What are you going to do?' 
And Toni says 'No problem,' and flicks her wrist and immediately the house is 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
"Hoodoo to you, too," Crouch says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
As a social commentator, the reviews of Crouch's book usually deal with 
super-literary concerns. Perhaps, when his biography of Parker is published in 
1991 or his first novel "First Snow in Kokomo," hits print as scheduled a year 
later, he will have to live up to the literary standards he has imposed on 
others. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, "Notes of A Hanging Judge" has its own golden prose. In the often 
elegant final essay "Body and Soul," he writes: 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, Rome has the feeling of rot and revelation one experiences 
when in the private domain of a handsome old woman, where sweat, sex, cologne, 
rouge, yellowed notes and papers, bottled remedies with indecipherable labels, 
crumbling flowers, photographs that seem to have been taken in a brownish gray 
mist, clothes stained with experience but never worn any more, and the smells 
of countless meals have formed a heavy collective presence in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Its ruins are like the sagging and corded throatline of a beauty once too 
sensuous to be believed and now too soulful to be perfectly understood. 
</P>

<P>
As political tensions ease somewhat between Moscow and Washington, the business 
world hopes to benefit from this warming of relations through increased trade. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of the benefits to come came last summer, when the U.S. Commerce 
Department lifted export restrictions on a broad range of desktop personal 
computers and cleared the way for their export to the Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 But computer companies say this move, which cleared the way for technology 
developed in the mid-1980s, is not enough. Clones of many other high-level 
computers and computer peripherals are widely available from manufacturers in 
the Far East and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, President Bush unveiled a plan for a sweeping overhaul of 
Western restrictions on high-technology exports to Eastern Europe. This 
proposal will be up for discussion when the 17-nation Coordinating Committee on 
Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) meets next month in Paris. Cocom 
administers export controls for the United States and its Western allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush's plan is the result of suggestions gathered from government agencies and 
the high-tech industry. Working behind the scenes is a group of 10 technical 
advisory committees that cover the entire spectrum of technology, including 
semiconductors, biotechnology, computers and telecommunications equipment. Each 
committee is composed of various government agencies and industry 
representatives who advise the Commerce Department on export-control policies. 
</P>
<P>
 William B. Filbert, president of International Diversified Technologies Inc. 
in Anaheim, sits on one of these panels, called the Computer Peripherals 
Technical Advisory Committee. Filbert, an engineer by training, was appointed 
to the committee by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with Times staff writer Cristina Lee, Filbert talked 
about the nation's export-control policies and how computer companies, both 
large and small, can have a say in influencing those policies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the Computer Peripherals Technical Advisory Committee, and what are 
its responsibilities? 
</P>
<P>
A. This committee is one of 10 that have been in existence for many years. They 
have been established to advise the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Export 
Administration on how control should be established on various technical items. 
It consists of eight members from the computer peripherals industry and nine 
from the U.S. government representing the departments of Commerce, State and 
Defense. 
</P>
<P>
In this committee, there are two of us from California. I'm the only 
representative from Southern California, and there is someone from the Bay Area 
who works with Ampex Corp. in Redwood City. Ampex makes video recorders and 
related equipment. 
</P>
<P>
We're supposed to meet every other month at the Bureau of Export Administration 
in Washington. But we've been meeting once a month during the past four to six 
months because of all the changes taking place in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
We meet in both open and closed meetings. In the open meetings, there is the 
opportunity for any company to present arguments to the committee about why a 
particular commodity or group of commodities should be decontrolled. 
</P>
<P>
This is not commonly known to the industry -- that there is this vehicle with 
which to present your arguments to the committee and the U.S. government 
simultaneously. The Federal Register announces committee meetings at least 
three weeks ahead of their scheduled time. So this is an excellent opportunity 
for members of the industry to present a description and the function of their 
products and the problems they're having in exporting them. 
</P>
<P>
There are many computer peripheral companies in Orange County. We have 
Distributed Logic Corp., Emulex Corp., Western Digital Corp., AST Research 
Inc., MAI Basic Four Inc. and Alpha Microsystems Inc. There are a number of 
companies here that specialize in graphic workstations, which fall under the 
computer peripheral area. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What does the committee do with the arguments companies present during these 
open meetings? 
</P>
<P>
A. It is within the prerogative of the technical advisory committee to 
formulate a position concerning those particular commodities. With assistance 
from the various government agencies, we create a position that would represent 
the U.S. government's position in Cocom. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, that procedure for approval can take a considerable amount of time. 
It depends on the item and how critical it is. It could be a minimum of three 
months and a maximum of forever. But a typical period might be in the order of 
three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is this committee widely used by industry as a vehicle to loosen high-tech 
export restrictions? 
</P>
<P>
A. The larger companies take advantage of these open presentations. For 
example, 3M made a presentation to us about two months ago. And they made a 
presentation based upon the magnetic recording tapes they make. They came up 
with a very strong argument that this tape is available through other sources 
and, therefore, should be decontrolled. It made sense to do so. The technical 
advisory committee took that under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
I contacted a number of companies in Orange County that I felt could use the 
CPTAC to express their concerns and the problems they've had in exporting. I 
have yet to have one come and actually take advantage of the service. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons, I think, are a combination of several factors. It's either 
everyone does not realize that there is such a group, or they're too busy to 
take the time to fight these kinds of problems. And there's the natural 
reluctance on the part of many of us, whether we are in the engineering field 
or just private citizens, to say that it's not worth the time to fight city 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
I was one of those kinds of people for many years, but I've since found that 
there is some value if you can find the right approach, that there is a value 
in challenging the government concerning some of the restrictions they put on 
our exports. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How does a high-tech company wishing to export its products know if its 
products fall within the limits of export control? 
</P>
<P>
A. First of all, each company in the electronics business should go through a 
classification of their products to find out whether it's controlled or 
decontrolled. You can do that by going to the regulations and looking through 
the commodity-control list. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, that can be a problem if the technical people within a 
company are not familiar with the regulations, and, in turn, the people with 
the regulations background don't have the technical experience. That's the 
first hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
If it's determined that a particular commodity is decontrolled, then they don't 
have a problem and that commodity can be exported under a general license to 
anywhere in the world except the embargoed countries. Currently, there are five 
countries on that list: Libya, Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
If they find that the commodity is controlled, then they should ask at what 
level is it controlled and if other general licenses are available for that 
export of controlled commodity. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the different levels under which export licenses are granted? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are several levels under the individually validated license. There are 
applications for exports for which you are likely to get approval. This means 
you will, in all probability, get approval. 
</P>
<P>
There are situations where you'll be given favorable consideration, which means 
you may or may not get approval. 
</P>
<P>
And there are those applications such as supercomputers for which you know you 
won't get approval, so why bother? 
</P>
<P>
So you need to know which slot your products fall in. That way, your sales and 
marketing force knows where to target (its efforts). 
</P>
<P>
These various categories are not only determined by technical performance 
parameters but also by geographic areas. This is an area that many companies 
overlook. They don't look at the fact that they should make a decision as to 
what I'd call the proper "slotting" of the products. And, therefore, they may 
lose marketing possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
It is important for companies that are dealing with controlled commodities to 
keep current with these changes. That way, when something becomes decontrolled 
or fits in the general license categories, they can immediately alert their 
sales force and go in and attack those markets. You can be sure that our 
overseas competitors, primarily the Japanese and the West Germans, are doing 
that. They are very aggressive in these overseas markets, and it's important 
for U.S. exporters to be equally as aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How can companies keep current with export-control changes? 
</P>
<P>
A. Companies can find changes in export-control regulations in the Federal 
Register. This is the official government document that is published daily, 
except on federal holidays. It announces all of the various changes that take 
place within the U.S. government, not just at the Bureau of Export 
Administration. And it's the government's position that when any change is 
published in the Federal Register, then the public has been informed. The 
government's position is: If you don't know about it, that's your problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q. From your observations, are the technology companies in Orange County 
well-informed of developments in export licensing? 
</P>
<P>
A. I'd say many are not. It could be for a number of reasons, such as they're 
too busy or they don't appreciate the need for this. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, one of the problems that Orange County companies and other firms 
throughout the nation face is that we're just not sensitive to the 
opportunities and the need to export overseas. Many marketing and sales people 
just aren't tuned in to the international events that are taking place and 
don't recognize or appreciate the potential opportunities that are presently 
there or may exist in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Not many companies send representatives to attend international business 
meetings around the area. I feel that Orange County and the nation truly are in 
the midst of an international trade revolution. During the last 30 to 40 years, 
so many things have changed as the result of the electronics revolution. The 
advent of transistor radios, fax machines and personal computers has changed 
the world. With changes in the Eastern bloc, as well in the European Economic 
Community and in Hong Kong with China's takeover in 1997, I believe there is 
another major revolution about to take place in international trade. In the 
United States, I believe, we are not sensitive to that. 
</P>
<P>
If I walk in the streets of other countries in the world, they talk about 
what's going on in the world. When you walk the streets in the United States or 
in Orange County, nobody talks about what's going on in the rest of the world. 
We're not sensitive to it. And that's reflected among the business people of 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
I think there are some companies that are on top of changes that are taking 
place in the licensing regulations as well as politically throughout the world. 
But they're in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the different technical advisory committees at the Bureau of Export 
Administration? 
</P>
<P>
A. The 10 different committees cover the computer peripherals, components and 
related test equipment; semiconductors, transportation and related equipment; 
telecommunications equipment; computer systems; electronic instrumentation; 
automated manufacturing equipment; and biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should high-tech companies expect any changes in export controls in 1990? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think that over the remainder of the year, you'll see small changes taking 
place that will give relief to various segments of the technology base here in 
Orange County. However, I would think that any significant changes will occur 
toward the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Companies should start immediately reading the Federal Register. For example, 
there was a significant change that was announced in February in which many 
integrated circuits were placed under a general license (allowing them) to be 
exported without prior government approval to most countries in the Free World. 
That was a significant change for the integrated circuits industry. 
</P>
<P>
I expect to see some changes of a similar magnitude occur in the computer and 
computer peripheral areas between now and the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from decontrol, one of the major problems in dealing with the Eastern 
European nations is currency exchange. (Eastern European nations) have a 
limited amount of hard currency. Companies in the United States, in general, 
and Orange County, in particular, don't have the experience and expertise to 
deal with nations on a barter basis. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more sophisticated Japanese trading organizations and West German 
trading organizations know how to do that. They have the mechanisms in place, 
or they'll set them up in order to do trading. They will take the time and 
trouble to do that. 
</P>
<P>
Our export controls are going to be influenced not in the next six months but 
in the next two years by changes in the European Economic Community and by what 
position it takes in high-technology exports. Cocom, which fundamentally 
controls high-tech exports to Eastern Europe, is obviously going to change as a 
result of the European Economic Community's unification and West Germany's 
plans to bring East Germany into its economy. That represents fundamental 
political problems and, no doubt, changes in the NATO countries. And that is 
going to effect Cocom.
