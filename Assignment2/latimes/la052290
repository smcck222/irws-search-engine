RASPBERRY ON U.S. RACISM AND CHANGING PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Raspberry's column in which he quotes the opportunistic 
bootlicker Julius Lester as saying "anyone who defines himself as a victim has 
found a way to keep himself in a perpetual state of self-pity and anger. And 
that . . . is black America today." 
</P>
<P>
Only another bootlicker such as Raspberry would quote Lester. And only 
Raspberry would not question his credentials as a '60s revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
I recently had a personal experience with racism '90s-style. Yes, the incident 
left me angry. Self-pity, no! I am a construction worker, and the racist 
incident was caused by a major contractor doing work for the city of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In brief, Raspberry and Lester are not dealing with the reality of racism in 
the '90s. The column by Walter Farrell ("A Revolt by the Underclass?" 
Commentary, May 11) represents more closely my attitude, and the attitudes of 
my friends. To quote the brother James Baldwin, "No more water, the fire next 
time!"

WE HAVE OUR OWN TENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The national news is full of racial strife in New York City: One white teen was 
acquitted and another found guilty in the murder of a black youth attacked by a 
mob of whites. Some blacks in Brooklyn are targeting Korean-owned stores for 
boycott. 
</P>
<P>
How easy it would be for Southern Californians to feel smug that we don't live 
in the middle of such a mess. And how foolish. 
</P>
<P>
In South-Central Los Angeles, there are tensions between Korean merchants and 
black community residents. Several commendable organizations have formed to 
promote better cultural understanding and smash racial myths that are at the 
root of ethnic tensions. The myths are many, but unfortunately the local 
statistics on hate crimes are real. Reports of race-related crimes rose 
dramatically last year. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics don't reveal the unreported incidents, the everyday resentments that 
keep people apart. In Los Angeles and Orange counties, the changing makeup of 
the community is threatening a sort of fragile truce between blacks and 
Latinos, between whites and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians must not delude themselves into thinking a 
Bensonhurst-type incident could not possibly happen here. Churches, synagogues, 
mosques and temples must exert their moral authority to persuade the faithful 
that when people are seen and known as individuals, facile group stereotyping 
diminishes. And the media, so crucial in shaping public perception, must 
remember its role: A local television station properly dropped its routine 
description of "militant black Muslims" after an alert viewer complained. An 
engaged and involved citizenry, full of determination rather than denial, can 
make good the lessons of Bensonhurst.

UCLA'S DECISION TO RELOCATE LABORATORY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's proposal to relocate its laboratory elementary school, as described in 
three recent Times articles (Metro, May 12, Real Estate, May 13, Commentary, 
16), is not driven by plans to build a new Anderson Graduate School of 
Management facility on campus. I have stated the case many times to parents and 
community leaders, but the misrepresentation is constantly repeated. 
</P>
<P>
The move would, instead, enhance the school's research value to the community, 
state and nation. As the national spotlight increasingly focuses on our 
schools, UCLA has an unusual opportunity to contribute to a solution to the 
crisis in American public education. We operate the last remaining laboratory 
school in California. Through the Corinne A. Seeds University Elementary School 
(UES), UCLA is specially positioned to conduct research on innovative teaching 
techniques and other topics that can improve elementary education. 
</P>
<P>
UES, isolated on the UCLA campus, is removed from the dynamics of a typical 
neighborhood public school. Thus, the educational research that has been 
conducted at UES has not focused on the students most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
We believe that the school could better fulfill its research mission and 
provide important insights into public education if it were relocated to an 
urban school environment. That is why we are negotiating with the Santa 
Monica-Malibu Unified School District to relocate the school to the Ocean Park 
section of Santa Monica, where it would be operated by UCLA under a long-term 
contract with the district. 
</P>
<P>
Although the current student population is ethnically diverse, the 450 students 
come from all over Los Angeles. The proposed move to Ocean Park, an ethnically 
and economically diverse neighborhood, would provide Seeds a student population 
that is both heterogeneous and a more natural source for a useful research 
base. 
</P>
<P>
In that setting, researchers could examine the impact of the local neighborhood 
on the school and the school's effect on the community. They could also study 
the role of direct parental involvement in their children's education at the 
school site. Research could be expanded to include other schools in the 
district and students at higher grade levels. The educational achievement of 
UES students who remained in that district could be charted as they progressed 
through middle school and high school. 
</P>
<P>
For these and other reasons, the relocation of UES to an urban neighborhood 
holds great promise for the development and dissemination of new approaches to 
public education in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
If the autonomy of the experimental school cannot be assured in contract 
negotiations, UES will remain at UCLA. Working drawings for our new management 
school provide for the facility to be built adjacent to UES, requiring a 
reconfiguration of a small portion of the elementary school but leaving it in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
I have stated that future land-use considerations might eventually force a new 
administration to close or relocate UES. But the more important consideration 
-- and the one that fuels our current proposal -- is how best to contribute to 
the search for solutions to our national educational crisis.

CHIPPING AWAY AT WEAPONS; 
</P>
<P>
EVEN 30% WOULD BE A WELCOME CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the United States and the Soviet Union began paring down the size of their 
long-range nuclear arsenals, the goal was a 50% cut in warheads. At next week's 
Washington summit, Presidents Bush and Gorbachev probably will settle for cuts 
of 30%. Even that would be a dramatic and welcome turnabout in the superpower 
approach to arms control treaties, made possible by the fact that arms control 
no longer is the only enlightened aspect of East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
For perspective, consider the first treaty to clamp limits on superpower 
nuclear weapons in 1972, SALT I. Four years later, the Soviet Union's supply of 
land-based warheads had soared from 1,500 to 4,000, all perfectly legal under 
the best arrangement that military leaders on both sides would stand for. 
</P>
<P>
A side agreement to SALT II placed a two-year moratorium on mobile missiles. 
Washington chose two years because it would take that long to get ready to 
deploy its own mobile missile. 
</P>
<P>
The latest agreement, START, close enough to completion to allow Presidents 
Bush and Gorbachev to go ahead with their May 31 summit meeting, is altogether 
different. It will call for actual cuts in the most deadly weapons mankind has 
ever devised, missiles that can streak thousands of miles to their targets in 
half an hour. The biggest of these missiles will, in fact, be cut by 50% under 
the current draft. Special rules for counting cruise missiles on bombers, 
seagoing cruise missiles and other warhead launchers will mean a smaller 
overall reduction -- between 30% and 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev expect to agree to a first round of cuts and direct their 
negotiators to begin a second phase of the arms treaty. That could mean a 
nuclear weapons cut over the next few decades to perhaps as few as 500 in both 
the United States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had hoped to have something to sign that would lead to major reductions in 
ground and tactical air forces in central Europe, but Moscow is balking. With 
the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and a reunified Germany close at hand, the 
Soviet Union seems unable to calculate what forces it wants to keep. So far, 
there is no reason to suspect that this involves more than a delay. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the START draft's sharp break with the pattern of past treaties, it has 
one thing in common with them. Critics are lining up to snipe at it because it 
goes too far or does not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Arms control still is less a marathon than a series of wind sprints, the idea 
being to cut as much as possible now and then move on to the next field of 
weapons to make more cuts. Because Gorbachev's future seems permanently 
uncertain, that pattern makes more sense than ever. It is very unlikely that a 
new face in the Kremlin could find the wherewithal to revive tensions. A formal 
treaty that would have to be torn up in full view of the world would make him 
less likely even to try.

PRIVATE LIVES, PUBLIC PLACES;

<P>
A PARK THAT PRESERVES GENTLE DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BLANDFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every morning, a rickety camper turns off La Cienega Boulevard into Baldwin 
Hills and putters up to a lake set into a hillside covered in eucalyptus, 
sycamores, pine trees and white alder. Across the hill, nodding oil pumps keep 
up their ghostly rhythm and a Chevron plant smolders and snorts. But here, in 
Kenneth Hahn Park, there is only the sound of robins, starlings and blackbirds 
calling, of ducks splashing into the water, of a stream rushing headlong over 
rocks into the lake. And Henry Crosby, a large, gnarled and solid man, is going 
fishing as usual. 
</P>
<P>
The park is full of flowers these days: pyracanthus bushes aflame, fields of 
clover and daisies, banks of orange and purple. Fat and glossy birds bathe in 
the stream, catfish hide in the dark reeds. In the distance, men grapple 
clumsily with garden hoes and hedge trimmers; newcomers, on referral from the 
courts, doing time here instead of in jail, drawn in by the calm clock of the 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
It is a park for men who came from somewhere else -- from dark, crowded rooms 
in city streets below, but also from other worlds where the soil was all that 
nourished a man. John Lindsay, the superintendent, learned in Mississippi how 
to grow corn, cotton, sweet potatoes, peanuts and melon. Worrying over trees in 
need of iron, sod to lay, bushes to plant, Bermuda grass to feed; this is how 
he keeps faith with the father who sent him to college in hard times. 
</P>
<P>
His helpers sign in, painfully and slowly; writing does not always come easily. 
But in the early morning, the restrooms are scrubbed and sparkling, not a speck 
lingers around the garbage cans. This place of still beauty created from scrub 
and waste is a gift to be carefully tended. Police circle like stealthy lions 
watching over a pride. This is a park of gentle days. 
</P>
<P>
Its heart is the lake. Men on upturned 44-pound detergent pails, men on old 
deck chairs, perched on rocks, standing easily, watching poles and the ripples 
of wind on the water. Men gone fishing. A community of men under kind and 
weathered hats; familiar as they are with the tiny signs of fish, they read in 
each other the smallest signals of friendship. They listen to the wind, laugh 
aloud -- huge hoops of laughter -- as one of their number lands a plastic bag, 
and chuck beneath the chin the small grandchildren and daughters of their 
cousins' cousins. Some sit close, chomping, chewing, chatting, poking for worms 
in battered old fishing boxes. Watercolors from the old South; pictures from 
long ago. 
</P>
<P>
And, as the sun warms the hillside, Henry Crosby dozes in his sagging chair, 
knowing that, should a stranger approach, his geese will hiss, warn and 
threaten the unexpected outsider. Henry's geese come waddling off the lake as 
soon as they see his camper turn into the parking lot. They are the companions 
of his day, never more than yards away. When the catfish skulk, he stands in 
the clear air, stroking the great, soft breasts of his geese who crane their 
long necks in delight. Someone stole one of Henry's geese a while back. The 
other goose pined, and Henry thought his heart would break. The lake's 
fishermen worried with him. One night, weeks later, the goose was put back: joy 
abounded. 
</P>
<P>
Three times a month -- not nearly often enough, grumble the regulars -- trucks 
rumble in from the fishery to feed 320 pounds of catfish into the lake. Next 
morning, there is hardly place for a man to stand. How does word get around? 
"I'll tell you, you tell me, I'll tell him," says Henry. The camaraderie of the 
lake. 
</P>
<P>
Most fish for their dinner. "I don't like fish much. I don't eat them much," 
says Henry. "I just like to catch them. I just like to be watching the pole and 
pulling on something." He is here before 8, leaves when he gets hungry. He 
fishes in the heat and fishes in the rain. At 77, he cannot remember a time 
when he didn't fish. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in South Carolina, son of a cement man. He went to work as a boy 
and ran away at 9. "It was about 30 years before I let them know where I was. 
I'm pretty sure they worried. They needn't of." Fishing and cement: They have 
been his life. In his pocket, this gruff and warm man carries a card marking 40 
years membership in the plasterers' and cement masons' union. He is retired 
now, his hearing shot. Now he knows only the peaceful life of the lake, the 
fierce fight of the catfish. "I've caught a 12-pounder and seen some bigger 
than that." Bigger than that -- the cry of fishing men, watching water, as men 
have since time immemorial. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where you find the nice people," says Henry. "Down at the water. 
People who fish are friendly, and if you don't fish -- why, you miss a whole 
lot of relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
There are many ways to tell the story of this city; this is one of the nicer 
ways.

PRIVATIZATION'S FONDEST DREAM: A MORTGAGE; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET ECONOMY: THERE'S A WINDFALL FOR EVERYBODY IN SELLING PUBLIC HOUSING TO 
CITIZENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARJUN MAKHIJANI and I. D. ROBBINS, Arjun Makhijani is director of the 
Institute for Energy and Environmental Research of Washington. I.D. Robbins is 
the builder in the Nehemiah affordable housing program, which plans a 
development in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the Soviet Union to deal effectively with its mounting economic problems, 
it must find a way to soak up its huge surplus of rubles. How to do this 
without sending political shock waves throughout the country poses a major 
problem for the Gorbachev administration. 
</P>
<P>
One way, proposed by Mikhail Gorbachev this week, would be to allow private 
individuals to build, buy and sell their own houses. Another would be for the 
government to sell off portions of its existing housing stock. Apartment houses 
could be sold to cooperatives. Families could buy individual homes. To avoid 
ideological hurdles, long-term leases could be used instead of selling the land 
with the house. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the program, the market value of Soviet housing would have to be set. 
Privately owned residential real estate in the United States is worth $7 
trillion, according to the National Assn. of Realtors. If the market value of 
Soviet housing were even $1 trillion ($9,000 per unit in rubles), selling it 
off would: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Absorb a high proportion of rubles held by people who now, because of the 
growing shortage of consumer goods, can buy little or nothing with them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Help reduce the budget deficit by cutting government subsidies for housing 
and heating. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Improve the strength of the ruble relative to foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Help supply funds for essential but unmet investments -- consumer-goods 
factories, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Provide a source of capital for much-needed new housing. A share of the 
central government's receipts could be assigned to local governments, thereby 
leap-frogging the bureaucracy and reassuring local officials who may not trust 
those running the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Encourage local initiative and, by providing a basis for constructive 
dialogue on economic issues, possibly defuse some of the political hostility 
toward the central government. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics may point to the U.S. government's generally unsuccessful attempts to 
sell its public housing to tenants. The Soviet-American situations, however, 
are not analogous. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. public housing is used by low-income families. What extra money they have 
is spent on consumer goods, not saved. When given an opportunity to buy a home 
at a very low price, some have saved enough for a down payment. More than 40% 
of the buyers of Nehemiah Plan homes in East Brooklyn, N.Y., were former 
public-housing tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a program to sell off Soviet housing would face a number of challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reluctance to buy. It may be necessary to sell the most desirable buildings 
first, and at low prices. Appraisal and pricing techniques, installment plans, 
competitive loan rates, incentives to make repairs and improvements may help 
offset the security of heavily subsidized rents. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speculation. This can be reduced by adopting such measures as mandatory 
resale at a price as close to the original as possible (inflation plus value of 
improvements); liens to prevent unit transfers at prices that exceed the 
legally permitted rate of appreciation, and restrictions on the number of units 
a family could own. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The need for taxation. Partly to balance housing values and to pay for 
public services, some form of tax on the value of the house would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The need for additional housing. To care for families who don't own housing 
and to replace deteriorating housing still occupied, a major new building 
program must parallel the sale of old housing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The need to upgrade housing standards. With allowances for cultural 
differences, the Soviet housing industry must be modernized. That means tougher 
building codes, better and more energy-efficient design and manufacturing and a 
proper system of depots or stores for materials and equipment. Some revenue 
from property sales should be used to finance building-material factories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elimination of special privilege. Size, quality and location are the proper 
criteria for pricing sale and rental property. Opportunities for preferential 
treatment must be minimized. 
</P>
<P>
If these challenges are met sufficiently to encourage Soviets to buy housing, 
adoption of the American tract-builder concept -- selling a house for later 
delivery -- should make it possible for the Soviet economy to absorb savings 
and employ workers released from defense industries. 
</P>
<P>
The desire to own a house in the Soviet Union is strong. The Soviet government 
has the means to satisfy this desire while absorbing its surplus of rubles.

Question: My brother-in-law smokes even though his children (my niece and 
nephew) have asthma. 
</P>
<P>
He says that once a child has asthma, it doesn't make any difference if anyone 
in the house smokes. I told him he's a jerk, and I'd like your opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I don't know whether your brother-in-law is a jerk, but I can tell you 
that passive cigarette smoke has an adverse effect on asthmatic symptoms. There 
are many reasons for people not to smoke. Having a child or children with 
asthma should be at the top of the list.

ASTRONOMER'S VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE;

ASTRONOMER BY CHANCE BY BERNARD LOVELL BASIC BOOKS $24.95, 381 PAGES

<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a decade now, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has sponsored the 
publication of first-person books (I hesitate to call them autobiographies) by 
major scientists, who have written about their lives, their work, the practice 
of science, the nature of knowledge and what they've learned along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of them have been very good books, distinguished by their warmth, 
eloquence and richness of tone. Freeman Dyson's "Disturbing the Universe," the 
first in the series, set a high standard of personal and scientific insight. 
Lewis Thomas' "The Youngest Science," Francois Jacob's "The Statue Within" and 
Francis Crick's "What Mad Pursuit" have been among the best first-person books 
by scientists in recent years. (Jacob's book was particularly unusual in that 
the author, a French Nobel Prize laureate in medicine, did not discuss his 
scientific work until nearly three-quarters of the way through. Nonetheless -- 
or as a result? -- the book was riveting.) 
</P>
<P>
"Astronomer by Chance," Bernard Lovell's story of his life as a physicist, 
radiophysicist and astronomer, is the 15th book in the Sloan series, and it is 
as good as the rest. Lovell, the founder of Jodrell Bank, Britain's center of 
radioastronomy, speaks in the now-familiar voice of a successful scientist. He 
writes with awe about the scientific enterprise and about the ability to know 
the universe by reason. But that's not all he has to say on that subject. 
</P>
<P>
The Sloan books have varied in approach and style, but they have all looked at 
the world through the eyes of the Enlightenment. They tend to be reverential 
about science and the scientific method. Reason is the way to knowledge. 
Liberal discourse between well-intentioned people acting in good faith leads to 
the truth -- or at least gets you closer to it. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, this remains the central belief of our age, and there is much 
evidence to support it. Lovell writes from within this tradition. It infuses 
his reasonable prose. But he also writes with another voice: 
</P>
<P>
"The arrogant belief prevalent in my youth in the ultimate power of science to 
explain the universe and all that lies within has passed with the experience 
that the search for solutions uncovers ever deeper mysteries. Today the world 
of the scientist is less hostile to the view that science does not have the 
sole prerogative of acquiring ultimate knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the book, in the chapter titled, "My Life and Thought," 
Lovell tells us of his interest in "the interfacing regions of theology, 
philosophy, and science." He acknowledges that readers may be surprised to hear 
him say it, given the general tone and view of the book so far, but, he says, 
"science has never claimed the whole of my existence." 
</P>
<P>
A discussion of theology ensues, with references to the writings of Karl Barth, 
Paul Tillich and Alfred North Whitehead. "Perhaps as I age I shall agree more 
and more with Paul Tillich that God is Being itself," Lovell writes. He goes on 
for a few paragraphs to explain this. Readers interested in the details may 
turn to Pages 353 and following for a full discussion of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm misleading you. Most of the book doesn't have anything to do with 
theology. Most of it has to do with the development of radioastronomy, whose 
findings have opened conundrums that are at the heart of modern astrophysics 
and cosmology. As in many areas of science, our ability to gather data about 
the structure of the universe outstrips our ability to put it together in a 
coherent account. 
</P>
<P>
Lovell, who was born in 1913, was an undergraduate physics student at the 
University of Bristol when the revolution in physics got going. He saw 
certainty give way to uncertainty. In his first two years at Bristol, he went 
to lectures in classical physics. In his last two years, he went to lectures in 
quantum mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
"The superb clarity and beauty of these lectures remain a vivid memory," Lovell 
recalls. "The determinate and certain world of common experience disappeared 
before our eyes as the probability functions of the wave equations became the 
new world of science that we were to inherit." 
</P>
<P>
He spent World War II helping to develop radar, and then wound up with 
equipment that he deposited at Jodrell Bank, a tract of land provided by a 
botanist colleague at the University of Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
Lovell's eye for detail and memory for vignettes add texture to his measured 
and considered prose. There is much to learn here. 
</P>

Agent Who Made the Pilgrimage to Mecca, Discovered the Kama Sutra, and Brought 
the Arabian Nights to the West" by Edward Rice.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council Monday agreed to have Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a 
nationwide accounting firm with offices in San Diego, conduct an economic 
impact study of the $1 billion in new development fees the council is 
considering in order to pay for new public facilities that will be needed 
during the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Coalition for San Diego, a newly formed group that includes the Chamber of 
Commerce and other business groups, has agreed to fund the $75,000 study. 
</P>
<P>
The accounting firm was chosen from a number of companies submitting proposals 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which is to be completed by early July, is designed to determine 
what economic impact the proposed fees would have on San Diego. Developers 
maintain the proposed fees will kill development in San Diego by increasing the 
cost of housing and commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
In late April, the City Council agreed to wait 90 days before once again 
considering the $1 billion in "citywide impact fees" that would generate money 
to build a new central library, some major roads and an improved trolley 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Although Monday's council vote to have Coopers &amp; Lybrand complete the study 
was unanimous, Councilman Bob Filner questioned whether the accounting firm 
would return with an unbiased report. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be an assumption that fees will have a negative impact on the 
economy," Filner said.

THREE SENTENCED IN BRIBERY OF NAVY EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three companies and three people were fined Monday for giving illegal 
gratuities to workers at the Navy Public Works Center so they would steer 
business to the firms. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob Lubarsky, 52, owner of Las Palmas Distributors of Escondido, which did 
repair and maintenance work on Navy refrigeration and air-conditioning 
equipment, and his company were both fined $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Federal District Judge J. Lawrence Irving ordered Lubarsky to perform 120 hours 
of community service works under terms of his three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Levine, 32, who formerly worked for Polytech Industries of Los Angeles, 
received a 60-day sentence in a halfway house, and he will be required to 
perform 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Levine was the only defendant to receive any time in custody, and Irving said 
he could surrender later. Polytech Industries received a $9,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
John Johnson, 44, and Jeyco Products, both of San Diego, were fined $5,000. 
Irving ordered Johnson to perform 60 hours of community service work under 
conditions imposed on his two-year probation. 
</P>
<P>
The firms and the individuals all pleaded guilty to giving unlawful gratuities. 
</P>
<P>
Lubarsky said to the judge: "I'm truly sorry this happened. It's wrong. I've 
never done this before. It turned my whole life in a negative way." 
</P>
<P>
Lubarsky and his Escondido company were indicted Oct. 24 by a federal grand 
jury, which accused him and the firm of conspiring to defraud the government 
and with bribery of Navy officials. Johnson and Jeyco Products were indicted 
Sept. 19, and Levine and Polytech Industries were charged Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
They are believed to have offered television sets, trips to Hawaii, microwave 
ovens and videocassette recorders to the Navy Public Works Center employees to 
induce them to recommend their companies for work, said Assistant U.S. Atty. 
George Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
Lubarsky, Levine and Johnson could have received a maximum two-year prison 
sentence on the illegal gratuities count. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy said the Navy employees who received the bribes were also prosecuted in 
federal court, on misdemeanor counts of receiving unlawful gratuities.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: IMPERIAL BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Sacramento, an Assembly committee Monday gave unanimous approval to a bill 
that would allow the financially strapped City of Imperial Beach to give 403 
acres of its beachfront to the San Diego Unified Port District. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Wadie A. Deddeh (D-Bonita), would allow the 
transfer to relieve Imperial Beach of an estimated $1.2 million in costs each 
year to maintain the beaches and pay off bonds worth $2.7 million to 
reconstruct a fishing pier that was nearly destroyed by storms in the early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The city needs to deed its beachfront to the port or else go broke by January, 
1992, according to a state auditor general's report issued in March. 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh's Senate bill to allow the transfer passed by an 11-0 vote Monday in the 
Assembly's Natural Resources Committee, which forwarded the measure to the 
Assembly Ways and Means Committee for another review. 
</P>
<P>
If the non-controversial bill passes the Assembly as expected, it will go back 
to the Senate for concurrence in technical amendments and then be sent to Gov. 
George Deukmejian to be signed into law.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 937 POUNDS OF COCAINE SEIZED IN RAID; 2 
HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police have seized 937 pounds of cocaine worth $142 million in a bust in which 
two suspects were arrested, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure followed months of surveillance and culminated Saturday in the 
parking lot of a Rosemead restaurant, where the drugs were found in a vehicle, 
Lt. Frank Pagueros said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Benito de la Cruz, 37, and Daniel Chacon, 35, both Mexican 
nationals who were being held on $5-million bail. Narcotics detectives said the 
operation was not yet complete and declined to release further details. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure was the largest in the area since February, when FBI agents 
recovered 4,716 pounds in Fullerton.

RESCUE MISSION LAUNCHES DRIVE TO BUILD 2 SHELTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Rescue Mission kicked off a $5.75-million fund-raising campaign 
Monday to build two homeless shelters, primarily to serve the growing number of 
women and children living on the city's streets. 
</P>
<P>
A center for women and children will be built near the existing rescue mission 
at 1150 J St., and a transitional facility for men, women and families will be 
opened in a separate neighborhood, said David Shepersky, president of the 
mission's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The mission has been soliciting donations informally for the project since 
March 15 and had raised a little more than $1 million as of Monday afternoon, 
said Al Busse, the campaign's director. 
</P>
<P>
The fund drive, which is scheduled to run through Dec. 31, includes $3 million 
for a Family Center for Women and Children, $2 million for a Transitional 
Living Center and $750,000 for the facilities' operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
Groundbreaking for the family center is tentatively set for August, with 
construction expected to take a year. No construction dates have been set for 
the transitional center. 
</P>
<P>
Shepersky said an estimated 30% of San Diego's 7,000 homeless people are women 
and children, many of them victims of divorce, poverty and physical abuse. 
Citywide, about 200 beds are available to homeless women and children. 
</P>
<P>
"They have nowhere to go, so they live on the streets," Shepersky said. 
"Something has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
The 30,000-square-foot family center will have 60 to 70 beds in semi-private 
rooms, indoor and outdoor recreation facilities, classrooms, a chapel, an 
infant-care area and other services. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter will provide many of the services now offered at the 250-bed rescue 
mission, including medical care, transportation, clothing, spiritual guidance, 
parenting classes and referral aid to social agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The women and children will also be able to participate in the mission's 
current rehabilitation program, which provides education, job training and 
other services to 140 men. 
</P>
<P>
The transitional center, at 25,000 square feet, will serve 50 to 60 homeless 
people who have been through the rehabilitation program and are ready to be 
"mainstreamed back into society," Busse said. 
</P>
<P>
Mission officials declined to say where the center might be built, but said 
they expect no significant neighborhood opposition to opening a homeless center 
in a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, these will be men, women and children who will be ready to be 
mainstreamed, not the homeless men who come in only for a meal and a bed," 
Busse said. "We'll work with any neighbors who have concerns." 
</P>
<P>
The locations of the two shelter sites will be announced after negotiations 
with property owners are completed in a few days, Busse said. 
</P>
<P>
The public has responded generously to initial solicitations for the projects, 
mission officials said, and they foresee no problems in reaching the $5.75 
million goal by year's end, or in raising donations for future operating 
expenses, Busse said. 
</P>
<P>
"The homeless men have always been there, but the women and children are more 
visible, and I think the public sees them and wants to help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Major contributions to the campaign to date include $250,000 from the Weingart 
Foundation and $200,000 from the David Claude Ryan Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first major capital campaign for the rescue mission, which, since 
opening in 1955, has relied on donations for operating costs, Shepersky said. 
</P>
<P>
The mission serves about 900 meals daily and provides shelter to about 8,000 
men a month.

OFFICIALS SCRAP PLAN FOR SUN VALLEY DAY WORKER CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles officials have scuttled plans to locate a hiring center for day 
laborers at the Sun Valley Recreation Center in response to community 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Molina, a management analyst with the city's Community Development 
Department, said the new location for the hiring center will probably be a 
vacant Department of Water and Power lot on the north side of Sherman Way 
between Radford and Hinds avenues in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Molina said the development department hopes to get approval for the site by 
May 31 and to open it by June 15. The location of the Sun Valley center was 
announced in late April and was to have opened in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed hiring center would serve 150 to 200 laborers, mostly from Mexico 
and Central America, who now wait for jobs on Lankershim Boulevard between 
Strathern and Saticoy streets. 
</P>
<P>
The center would be operated by two supervisors and would provide the men with 
portable toilets. While they wait for work, they could drink coffee, eat 
Mexican sweet bread and take classes in English, all for free. The operation 
would cost the city about $3,500 a month and would be in addition to the hiring 
center the city opened in Harbor City in October. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Kallen, president of the Sun Valley Chamber of Commerce, said that after 
the development department announced plans to open the hiring center at the 
park, her organization wrote letters to members of the City Council opposing 
the location. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber also planned to hold a community protest meeting at the park but 
canceled it when the development department announced it was changing its 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was an inappropriate place for the facility," said Kallen, 
referring to the park at 8133 Vineland Ave., a block away from San Fernando 
Road and Strathern Street. 
</P>
<P>
"They were talking about putting it at the back side of the park, which is a 
rather inconspicuous area where day laborers would get no exposure and the 
people who wanted to hire them would have difficulty locating the facility," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Another problem was that the site would bring traffic and trucks and 
commercial vehicles into a residential and recreational area," she said. "We 
are not opposed to a day workers center. The problem was this particular 
location." 
</P>
<P>
Sun Valley resident Jon Eshbach said he had other worries. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that if they bring all these people to the park, if they are 
not picked up and don't have a job by 10 a.m. or 11 a.m., that puts them on the 
streets here in downtown Sun Valley and negatively impacts businesses," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's the same syndrome as anywhere else," Eshbach said. "Nobody wants 
them in their back yard." 
</P>
<P>
"The Chamber of Commerce and civic groups have just been able to get that park 
cleaned up in the last year or so," said another resident who requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had drug problems there. We finally got it so it's a good place for 
families to go. I think those people who don't get jobs and hang around there" 
could "cause a few problems," said the resident, who said he did not want his 
views to appear to insult Latinos, who make up most of the workers. 
</P>
<P>
Molina said a park that was accessible to both workers and employers and did 
not generate community opposition would make an ideal site for a hiring center. 
But, he agreed that the Recreation Center was not a perfect location. 
</P>
<P>
He said employers would have had to go out of their way to pick up the workers 
and that the men, many of whom arrive at 6 a.m., would have had no bus 
transportation to get to the park. He also said he understood residents who 
said they opposed the center because the park is used by children and is 
located near liquor stores, which could lead to other problems and complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"There was going to be some opposition and we said, 'Let's look at 
alternatives,' " said Molina, explaining his department's change of plans.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TWA ENDING SERVICE AT BURBANK AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trans World Airlines announced Monday that it will halt service at Burbank 
Airport on June 30, canceling its two daily flights to St. Louis and its 
unusual flights between Burbank and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In its announcement, the airline gave no reason for the cancellation, but a 
spokesman for the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority said that traffic 
on the flights had dropped to 85,000 passengers last year from 114,000 in 1988. 
Service began in November, 1985, and, through a quirk in scheduling, also 
provided round-trip daily air service between Burbank and Long Beach.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SENATE DELAYS HOPE LAND SWAP HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Senate hearing at which Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) had vowed to seek to 
block the exchange of federal land in Cheeseboro Canyon for property owned by 
entertainer Bob Hope was postponed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston had announced that he would ask the interior subcommittee of the 
Senate Appropriations Committee to prohibit the use of federal funds for the 
controversial land swap. 
</P>
<P>
Federal money is needed for an environmental review of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for the National Park Service to give developers 59 acres in 
Cheeseboro Canyon that they need for an access road in exchange for about 1,100 
acres of the nearby Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura County. The developers, who 
hold an option on the property owned by Hope, are seeking to build a golf 
course and 750 houses on the remaining 1,208 acres of the Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hope's sale to parks agencies of another 4,600 acres in the Santa 
Monica and Santa Susana mountains for $20 million -- reportedly less than he 
could get from developers -- is contingent on approval of the swap. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has maintained that "instead of permitting the land exchange . . . the 
Park Service should be seeking to acquire" the Jordan Ranch property to protect 
it from development.

ON CAMPUS: CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE; 
</P>
<P>
REPAVING DELAYED TO LESSEN TRAFFIC FOR GRADUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A road contractor has agreed to suspend a Lassen Street repaving project to 
avoid snarling traffic headed for this Friday's commencement exercises at Cal 
State Northridge's North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN commencement planner Heidi Levy said contractors agreed Monday to delay 
the repaving of the north side of Lassen Street from Reseda Boulevard to 
Lindley Avenue in order to avoid traffic delays for the 10 a.m. ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Lassen Street is a key access road to parking for the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We had talked to the city last week, but they said it wasn't their policy to 
ask contractors to postpone their work," Levy said. "When we talked to the 
contractors, they understood our problems and agreed to postpone further 
repairs until after May 25." 
</P>
<P>
"It is an enormous relief and we are very grateful for their understanding," 
Levy said, referring to the Sully Miller Contracting Co. 
</P>
<P>
Street repaving began about two weeks ago and is scheduled to be completed by 
June or July. 
</P>
<P>
She said she expects 5,000 students and 15,000 guests to attend this year's 
graduation ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's ceremonies were held at the Hollywood Bowl and a number of CSUN 
graduates and their families and CSUN President James W. Cleary arrived late 
because of heavy traffic on the Hollywood and Ventura freeways. 
</P>
<P>
A campus Commencement Committee recommended that university administrators hold 
this year's ceremony on campus in the hopes of avoiding the traffic delays 
experienced last year.

A GUIDE TO ISSUES FACING CANDIDATES IN DISTRICT 22 RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overview 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic primary in Congressional District 22 features two political 
newcomers vying for attention in a predominantly Republican district that for 
the past 18 years has been represented by the low-key incumbent, Rep. Carlos J. 
Moorhead (R-Glendale). David Bayer, director of adult education in Burbank, has 
gathered more money and endorsements in the race than his opponent, teacher 
Thomas G. Vournas. Bayer has emphasized his abortion-rights stance and his 
support for a national health program, while Vournas has stressed programs to 
aid poor children and workers and to strengthen the nation's infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
Contenders 
</P>
<P>
David Bayer, 46, was a Peace Corps volunteer and professor in Peru before 
becoming a teacher. He is endorsed by the California Democratic Party. Raised 
in New York, he received a BA degree from Bowdoin College, a master's degree in 
science from Cornell University and a doctorate from the University of San 
Francisco. He and his wife, Rosa, a special education teacher, live in Burbank 
and have a grown son who serves in the U.S. Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas G. Vournas, 66, of Altadena received his bachelor's degree from USC in 
comparative literature and accounting and did graduate work at Columbia 
University and the Sorbonne. He served as a U.S. Navy officer in World War II 
and taught public school for 40 years. He and his wife, Grethe, have three 
grown children, two in theatrical professions and one entering medical school. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead, Libertarian William H. Wilson and Jan B. 
Tucker, representing the Peace and Freedom Party, are unopposed in their 
primaries. Their names will appear on the general election ballot in November. 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaire 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates in contested primary races and 
were returned this month. Answers have been edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe that there will be a "peace dividend" as a result of reduced 
tension with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact nations? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, would you generally be most inclined to use the dividend to: a) spend 
more on domestic needs, b) reduce the deficit, c) cut taxes? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: Yes. Spend more on domestic needs. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: Yes. Infrastructure and education, if it is not eaten up by the 
savings &amp; loan bailout. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present system of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of dealers and users will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: No. More money, smaller classes, better trained teachers to educate 
people so they can change their communities, to control them and to build 
meaningful lives not tied to the profit motive. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: No. Inner city must be totally restored economically, educationally 
and aesthetically. Head Start programs work -- kids stay off drugs, do better 
and finish school, and go on to higher education. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you consider the possibility of decriminalizing drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: No. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: Yes, if drugs are closely controlled and addicts are closely monitored 
in treatment centers. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Under the Gramm-Rudman law, the federal government is supposed to cut the 
budget deficit to zero by 1993. Is that a realistic goal? 
</P>
<P>
Briefly explain your answer. 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: No. Small budget deficits in and of themselves are not dangerous. When 
they become unmanageable relative to anticipated revenues, no money is 
available to rebuild the infrastructure, educational systems, mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: No. The Administration has just realized the deficit is $60 billion 
more than what they figured. Not unless bigger cuts are made in the defense 
budget and a progressive and fair increase in income tax is levied. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Rising property values in the Santa Monica Mountains have made it more 
difficult for state and federal parks agencies to buy land for public use. Land 
prices have escalated in part because local officials have allowed developers 
to build more houses than provided for under zoning laws. To keep property 
prices more affordable to parks agencies, should governments in Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties refuse such so-called "up-zoning"? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: Yes. The price of land has increased and the profits of owners have 
risen when they haven't added any value to the land. Such profits cannot be 
tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: Yes. Certain seashores, canyons and mountain land belongs to all of 
the American people. This land must remain wild and pristine. Resorts, gated 
communities and golf courses are used by the rich. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support President Bush's call for a capital gains tax cut to 
stimulate economic growth? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: No. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: No, but no parole or pardons for murderers. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support President Bush's policy of seeking to maintain good relations 
with China's current regime despite its violent suppression of the 
pro-democracy movement last year? 
</P>
<P>
If no, what specific measures should the United States take against China? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: Yes. Pro-democracy movement was only possible because we have had good 
relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support removing China's most-favored-nation trading status because 
of the regime's repressive policies? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: No. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole's proposal to shift foreign 
aid from traditional allies, including Israel, to newly emergent democracies in 
Eastern Europe and drug-fighting nations in Latin America? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: No. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor opening up additional parts of the California coastline to oil 
exploration under any circumstances other than a national emergency? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: No. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Congress has passed legislation that would expand tax credits for low-income 
parents with children in day care and create school-based day-care programs for 
"latchkey" children of middle-income families. President Bush has threatened to 
veto the legislation, which will cost $27 billion, unless its cost is 
dramatically reduced. Do you support the President? 
</P>
<P>
If no, briefly explain your answer. 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: No. We must invest in children at an early age when they are being 
formed. Over the long run, we will save money with less dropouts, less crime, 
less drug abuse, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: No. The need is great. Our children need to be protected and kept off 
the streets in programs where they can learn and study, play and be creative. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you support a national gasoline tax increase if the proceeds were 
dedicated to improving transportation? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you support a national gasoline tax increase to reduce the deficit? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support limiting the amount of money a candidate for national office 
can spend on the campaign? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you support at least partial taxpayer-financed campaign funding as 
part of a reform package that limited spending? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support limiting the number of terms that U.S. senators and 
representatives can serve? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, what should the limit be? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: Yes. Senators, one six-year term. Representatives, one six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor more control over the availability of handguns to the general 
public? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, what specific controls? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: Yes. Review purchaser's criminal record, require purchaser to state 
reason for purchase, require two-week training period. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: Yes. There must be a good reason to buy them, a long waiting period 
and re-licensing every year with an adequate fee. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the current program to build a "Star Wars" anti-missile 
system? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, do you think the program is adequately funded? 
</P>
<P>
Bayer: No. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas: No.

GOODEN KEEPS DODGERS IN TOW; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: INJURED MET PITCHER GOES FIVE INNINGS IN 12-3 VICTORY, IMPROVING HIS 
LIFETIME RECORD AGAINST L.A. TO 11-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Was it the players' meeting called by Howard Johnson before the game to discuss 
his team's uninspired play? 
</P>
<P>
Did the Mets gain inspiration from seeing Dwight Gooden take his turn with a 
painful foot injury? 
</P>
<P>
Or did the Mets finally meet their match when they came to Dodger Stadium 
Monday night? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the answer, the Mets, who limped into town with a 1-5 record on their 
West Coast swing, unloaded on the Dodgers, 12-3, sending many in the crowd of 
39,876 home early. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets got 14 hits -- including three home runs -- and took a 9-0 lead with 
an eight-run third ining highlighted by Kevin McReynolds' grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
"That was our club. That's what we're capable of," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden, now 11-1 lifetime against the Dodgers, started despite an injury to the 
middle toe on his left foot -- possibly a hairline fracture -- suffered in a 
clubhouse mishap in San Diego Saturday. Gooden's toe was injured when teammate 
Mackey Sasser opened a folding chair and inadvertently put a leg of it on 
Gooden's foot. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, Gooden said, "If I don't step forward, and say I can't pitch, 
no one else will. . . . That's why I told them I'll warm up and see what 
happens. I know there's gonna be a little bit of pain. I can accept that. Just 
so I don't interfere with my mechanics." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored in the third but stranded two runners. They got another run 
in the fifth without a hit, using two walks, a balk and Eddie Murray's 
sacrifice fly. The inning ended on Hubie Brooks' fly ball to the center-field 
track. 
</P>
<P>
With the comfortable lead, Gooden (3-3) nursed his uncomfortable foot through 
five innings, walking four and striking out three. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight I didn't have great stuff, but the team scored 10 runs (for him)," 
Gooden said. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start I was favoring (the foot). The second inning, I put pressure on 
it. It didn't feel that good. With the lead we had I figured five innings would 
be good." 
</P>
<P>
Slumping Darryl Strawberry gave Gooden a quick 1-0 lead, opening the second 
inning against flu-stricken starter Mike Morgan with a home run that reached 
the second tier of seats in the right-field pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-run burst came the next inning, when New York sent 11 men to the 
plate. After McReynolds' fifth career grand slam, Daryl Boston hit a two-run 
homer two batters later, chasing Morgan (5-3). 
</P>
<P>
The Mets added another run in the fourth and two more in the seventh on Tom 
O'Malley's pinch-double. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Musselman and Wally Whitehurst closed for the Mets, with Whitehurst 
getting his second save. The Dodgers' only run against them was an eighth 
inning homer by Jose Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson, who had two hits: "Some of these teams are going to pay, because 
we're going to start playing well." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Kirk Gibson is thought to be nearly ready for a minor league 
rehabilitation stint, possibly while the Dodgers are on a trip that starts 
Wednesday. . . . Tonight's scheduled Dodger starter, John Wetteland, stayed 
home Monday night because of flu. . . . Kal Daniels went into Monday's game 
with a .344 average in night games. Daniels has accounted for all seven of his 
home runs and 20 of his 23 runs batted in under the lights. . . . After sitting 
out Sunday, Juan Samuel started at second base. He had been hitless in his last 
18 at-bats and was carrying a .190 average. However, Samuel -- who played for 
the Mets last year -- is a lifetime .280 hitter against them and got two hits. 
. . . Dodger pinch-hitters came out of the weekend batting 12 for 58, a .207 
average, with nine RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Former Dodger Mike Marshall was booed when he made his first Dodger Stadium 
appearance with the Mets Monday. . . . After the players-only meeting called by 
infielder the Mets' Howard Johnson before Monday night's game, he said: "What 
was said won't hurt." Pitcher Ron Darling said: "I don't think there was any 
air to be cleared." Reserve Tim Teufel, speaking for the bench players: "It's 
been a dead bench. We're having a tough road trip -- there hasn't been much 
reason to be excited. It's hard to sit on the bench for 10 days when you're 
losing. Some starters don't understand that. We told them, 'Give us a reason to 
get excited, we'll be behind you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Met Manager Dave Johnson said: "Certainly we're a better team than we've 
shown," The slow start again -- the Mets were batting .229 going into the game 
-- has Johnson on the hot seat in New York. His reaction: "I've set a longevity 
record here, but no matter what I've done I always seem to have one foot on the 
floor and another on a banana peel."

<P>
BRUINS SHADOW EDMONTON'S MESSIER, WHO IS AMONG THE MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EDMONTON, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was to have been his coronation, the spotlight he needed to be dubbed the 
new Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
If Gretzky was the Great One in Edmonton, then surely Mark Messier was the Next 
One. 
</P>
<P>
In this, his 11th season with the Oilers, Messier had 45 goals in the regular 
season and career highs in assists, 84, and total points, 129. 
</P>
<P>
With two goals and two assists, he led his team to victory in the crucial 
fourth game of the conference finals against the Chicago Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
He is considered the favorite to win the Hart Memorial Trophy, given to the 
NHL's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the numbers and the accolades, Messier seemed to have finally 
assumed the leadership role left vacant by Gretzky's departure to the Kings two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
If the Oilers were truly heading back to the top, Messier was the point man. 
</P>
<P>
All that remained were the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton is right there, leading the Boston Bruins, 2-1, in the best-of-seven 
series with Game 4 tonight at the Northlands Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
But where is Messier? 
</P>
<P>
The question began as a murmur but has become a roar, seemingly asked by an 
entire city. 
</P>
<P>
What started as a curiosity has turned into a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Messier came into the finals with a 10-game point streak. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 1, the triple-overtime victory over Boston, he had one assist but also 
blew a chance to win the game by missing a wide-open shot in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
Although Edmonton scored seven goals in Game 2, Messier was held pointless. And 
he was pointless again Sunday when the Oilers lost, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Is he just in a slump, or is it more serious? 
</P>
<P>
According to one rumor, Messier has a cracked rib. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about that Monday, he said only, "I have no comment," then added "I feel 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
Boston Coach Mike Milbury seemed to lend credence to the rumor when talking 
about his use of Bob Carpenter to shadow Messier. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Messier) is not 100%, it's probably not fair to put somebody on him," 
Milbury said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
What makes you think he's not 100%? Milbury was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I just heard it," the coach answered enigmatically. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the problem, the Oilers know their chances of winning the Stanley Cup 
may hinge on finding a solution. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I have to play better," Messier said. "No question about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to have to . . . find a way to break through the checking they 
are giving me. That's to be expected this time of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Most of what has occurred in this series, though, has been unexpected. The 
Bruins were supposed to be a tight-checking, defensive-minded team, using the 
smaller Boston Garden rink to their advantage, against the wide-open, 
free-skating Oilers, who would excel on the larger Edmonton ice. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened? The Oilers won both games in Boston, their offense breaking 
open Game 2. And the Bruins won a defensive struggle in Game 3 in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to figure. But no more so than Messier's disappearing act. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I had more open ice in Boston," he said. "(Sunday) night, they played 
more man-to-man. Their idea, I guess, is to deny me the puck." 
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Carpenter's shadowing has thrown him. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had a shadow before," Messier said. "I guess there were more important 
people than me to shadow in the past." 
</P>
<P>
But now, having stepped out of the Great One's shadow, Messier must find a way 
to deal with a shadow of his own.

BLUE JAYS GIVE A'S WAKEUP CALL, CANSECO ANSWERS IN OAKLAND'S 4-1 WIN 
</P>

<P>
The Toronto Blue Jays would have been wiser to let the world champions sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Todd Stottlemyre awakened them Monday at Toronto with the second pitch 
of the game, a high inside pitch to Oakland's Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Players from both benches and bullpens at the SkyDome, where a capacity crowd 
of 49,471 was watching, poured onto the field. No punches were thrown. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco delivered the punch, a three-run home run in the sixth inning, 
that gave the Athletics a 4-1 victory. The A's, playing poorly, had dropped six 
of their previous eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco's home run was all Bob Welch (5-2) needed. He gave up five hits and 
struck out eight in 7 2/3 innings. Rick Honeycutt got the last out in the 
eighth and Dennis Eckersley struck out two of the three batters in the ninth to 
pick up his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays bring out the best in Canseco. His .331 average against them is 
his best against any team. 
</P>
<P>
When he missed the first 89 games last season because of a broken wrist, his 
first game back was at Toronto. In his fourth at-bat he homered. In the fourth 
game of the championship series he hit a 480-foot blast into the upper deck to 
help win it. 
</P>
<P>
The home run off Stottlemyre, Canseco's 14th, came in his 37th game, giving him 
three fewer than he hit in 65 games last season. He also has 41 runs batted in. 
Last year he had 57. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good pitch," Canseco told the Associated Press. "It was a curve down. 
I went down and got it and flipped it out." 
</P>
<P>
When Canseco came up in the eighth, Stottlemyre threw a pitch inside and high. 
The slugger just stared at the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind if pitchers come inside on me," Canseco said. "They could hit me 
in the thigh three times and it wouldn't bother me. I just object when they 
throw at my head." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 6, New York 5 -- The Yankees brought up speedy outfielder Deion 
Sanders, who doubles as a pro football star, and stuck him in the leadoff spot 
in this game at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders tripled and scored a run, but the Yankees lost when Carlton Fisk hit a 
three-run home run in the seventh inning to bring the White Sox from behind. 
</P>
<P>
It was Fisk's 317th homer as a catcher, 10 behind Johnny Bench. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Pasqua and Robin Ventura also homered for the White Sox, who outhit the 
Yankees, 11-6. In the last two games the Yankees have been outhit, 28-8. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Texas 2 -- Wade Boggs capped a three-run seventh at Boston with a 
two-run single to give Mike Boddicker (6-3) his fifth victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up only one hit after Julio Franco hit a two-run homer in the 
first, it appeared Boddicker's streak would end. But Dwight Evans led off the 
seventh with a double and the rally was on. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 11, Kansas City 6 -- The Tigers sizzle while the Royals fizzle. Lou 
Whitaker and Lloyd Moseby homered in an eight-run second inning at Detroit that 
carried the Tigers to their seventh victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers are 18-22, the stumbling Royals are 13-23 and 11 1/2 games behind 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 7, Baltimore 3 -- Kent Hrbek and Dan Gladden hit home runs at 
Baltimore and the hot Twins romped to their 14th victory in their 18 games in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Guthrie (1-0) replaced David West with two out in the fifth and held the 
Orioles without a run on three hits in 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 9, Milwaukee 4 -- The Mariners, baffled for six innings at Milwaukee by 
Teddy Higuera, hammered Brewer relief ace Dan Plesac in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners had run-scoring doubles from Darnell Coles, Harold Reynolds, 
Jeffrey Leonard and Ken Griffey in an eight-run rally. DAN HAFNER

K mart Corp.: The Troy, Mich.-based retailer said first-quarter profit rose to 
$100.1 million, a 6.4% increase over the same period in 1989, while sales rose 
16.1% to $7.04 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Sales on a comparable store basis -- those stores open at least one year -- 
were up 6.2%. However, interest expense rose 70.2% due to larger short-term 
borrowings, and gross margin dipped from 27.9% to 26% reflecting lower shelf 
prices. The company said profit improvements resulted from increased sales, 
cost controls and favorable weather conditions for sales of seasonal 
merchandise.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CITADEL HOLDING CORP. ISSUES $60 MILLION IN NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citadel Holding Corp. said it issued $60 million in notes that enabled it to 
comply with federal thrift capital requirements nearly three years ahead of 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Citadel, the Glendale parent of Fidelity Federal Bank, said it issued the 
subordinated notes on May 15. They are payable in five equal installments 
beginning in 1996 and bear an interest rate of 11.68%. Because the notes are 
unsecured, regulators count the $60 million as capital, which is generally an 
S&amp;L's assets minus its debts. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the bond issue, Citadel said it had so-called tangible capital 
-- a strict measure of capital -- equal to 4.12% of assets. On Jan. 1, 1993, 
the requirement will be 3%.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: AMERICAN ECOLOGY FACES $12-MILLION CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Ecology Corp. said U.S. environmental officials issued a draft plan 
for controlling ground contamination at a closed American Ecology 
chemical-waste facility in Sheffield, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency estimated that its plan, including 
maintenance of the site for 30 years, would cost American Ecology about $12 
million in current dollars after adjusting for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But American Ecology, a waste-disposal concern based in Agoura Hills, warned 
that the cost could increase depending on how the final plan differs from the 
draft proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-acre Sheffield site, which was operated by the company's US Ecology 
unit, was closed in the early 1980s after nearby ground water was contaminated. 
The EPA proposal, among other things, calls for American Ecology to construct a 
"cap" of clay, soil, plastic and other materials that would keep rain and 
nearby ground water from also becoming contaminated, said Karl J. Eimer, 
American Ecology's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA's draft is subject to public review and comment, and the agency's final 
decision is not expected for several months, Eimer said.

EARNINGS: STORAGE EQUITIES POSTS JUMP IN QUARTERLY PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Storage Equities Inc., a Glendale-based real estate investment trust that 
invests mainly in storage facilities, said its first-quarter profit jumped 75% 
from a year earlier despite a 9% drop in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter that ended March 31, Storage Equity's net income rose to $3.63 
million from $2.07 million, and its revenue fell to $6.52 million from $7.20 
million. The latest profit included a $1.15-million gain on the sale of real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
Storage Equities, which is managed by an affiliate of Public Storage Inc., 
attributed the higher earnings to increased rental income and lower operating 
costs at the properties in its investment portfolio.

EARNINGS: OLSON INDUSTRIES POSTS FIRST-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olson Industries Inc., continuing a financial rebound, reported a first-quarter 
profit of $595,658 compared with a year-earlier loss of $663,025. 
</P>
<P>
Olson's only operating unit is Dolco Packaging, a maker of plastic packaging 
products now reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. In 
the past two quarters, the Sherman Oaks-based company has reported profits 
after suffering heavy losses earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The profit in the latest quarter, which ended March 31, came despite a slight 
drop in sales, to $18.9 million from $19.1 million. Olson attributed the 
earnings to a 16% decline in its average price for resin, the key raw material 
used in its packaging products.

EARNINGS: FORTUNE PETROLEUM LOSES $27,000 IN 1ST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fortune Petroleum Corp., a small energy concern in Agoura Hills, said it lost 
$27,000 in the first quarter compared with a $47,000 loss a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune said the latest loss came despite a 12% increase in revenue, which rose 
to $252,000 in the quarter that ended March 31 from $221,000 a year earlier. 
The revenue increase reflected higher prices received for the company's oil.

REPORT FINDS ANTI-BIAS PLANS FAIL TO AID STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite more than a dozen years of court-ordered attempts to alleviate the harm 
of racial segregation, the Los Angeles Unified School District has failed to 
improve achievement and opportunities for many of its students -- especially 
blacks and Latinos, a district report said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters who must take long school bus rides to other communities because of 
overcrowding in their neighborhood schools have suffered the most -- sometimes 
scoring only half as high on achievement tests as their classmates who live 
close to campus. 
</P>
<P>
"Many students are still shackled by the harms of racial isolation -- low 
academic achievement and limited post-secondary opportunities. Black and 
Hispanic students are especially afflicted by these harms," the district's 
annual integration report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district annually scrutinizes its various programs aimed at 
mitigating the effects of racial segregation, Monday's special Board of 
Education hearing marked the first time it has aired the findings in public. 
</P>
<P>
Board members, preparing to make decisions on next year's integration budget, 
took no action on the report, but they discussed it for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Jackie Goldberg -- who has pushed for public hearings on the 
integration report since her election seven years ago -- said she was "dismayed 
but not surprised" by the findings. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made some progress in some important areas," Goldberg said, "but one 
of the major important harms of segregation is low achievement. And we have not 
done nearly enough to close the gap between kids from middle-income families 
and those from low-income families. And in Los Angeles, there is a lot of 
correlation between race and income level." 
</P>
<P>
The report studied students in 229 schools participating in various 
desegregation programs in grades four. five, seven, eight, 10, 11 and 12 last 
school year. It looked at a variety of factors -- including standardized test 
scores, parental involvement, ethnic background, whether students attended 
schools with minority enrollments of 70% or more, whether they were bused, 
their post-graduation plans, the attitudes of their teachers and 
administrators, and the students' self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
The study also compared how various groups did in different school settings and 
found that students in the district's popular "magnet" program of specialized 
schools fared the best. That is not surprising because the poorest students 
rarely apply for the magnet programs. 
</P>
<P>
The district buses nearly 25,000 students daily from crowded neighborhood 
schools -- many in low-income areas with big influxes of recent immigrants -- 
to less congested campuses, often in suburban, middle-class communities. Those 
students often fare poorly, the report showed. 
</P>
<P>
For example, fourth-grade reading scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic 
Skills showed that the bused students earned a mean percentile score of 28, 
while students who lived near the school scored 58. In math, the bused students 
scored 32; the neighborhood youngsters, 66. 
</P>
<P>
The report also found that bused students had many disadvantages, ranging from 
late arrival of records from their home area schools to not enough bilingual 
teachers at their new schools. 
</P>
<P>
Reading vocabulary scores for all grades taking the same test varied markedly 
by ethnic group. Thirty-eight percent of American Indians scored in the "very 
low" range, as did 28% of Asians, 48% of blacks, and 55% of Latinos. Only 17% 
of whites scored in the lowest range. The test-takers included students with 
limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
The report also found that black students at lower-achieving schools had the 
lowest expectations for their own achievement. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bright spots in the report were positive findings in schools with 
parent participation projects and in low-income schools that offered 
language-arts-oriented preschool programs to 4-year-olds. Those students went 
on to do significantly better in elementary school than their counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The district spent $354 million on desegregation programs this year, with the 
bulk of the funds paying for bus transportation and reducing class sizes, all 
part of the integration plan worked out with the courts over several years. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said the report and Monday's hearing were aimed at helping the 
financially troubled district figure out the best return on its desegregation 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"For those things that are not working, we must make changes," she said. "It is 
not enough any longer to just wring our hands and say we are dismayed. We have 
to try some new things. There is no guarantee the new things will work, but we 
have got to try."

CONVICTED OF SPYING, HE TRIES TO REPAIR SHATTERED LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He scrounges for a living, making it on $97 a month worth of food stamps and 
some welfare cash for other living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
His beat-up 15-year-old Toyota, bought at a bargain basement price of $300, 
needed mechanical work that cost more than the car. 
</P>
<P>
He lives in a frayed, one-bedroom apartment in West Hollywood, where he pays 
$306 a month rent. 
</P>
<P>
His new job, driving a passenger van for a hotel, pays $5.50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Former friends and acquaintances turn on their heels when they see him on the 
street or in local markets. A garage mechanic recently yelled "Spy!" to his 
face upon recognizing him. 
</P>
<P>
Isolated and bitter, Nikolai Ogorodnikov, 58, a diminutive Russian from Kiev, 
acknowledged before a federal judge five years ago that he participated in a 
spy plot against the United States. He served five years of an eight-year 
sentence in a federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he persists, he was never a Russian spy. 
</P>
<P>
Released last February, Ogorodnikov is attempting to pick up the pieces of his 
shattered life and has resettled in Los Angeles' Westside Russian community -- 
in the very same apartment where he was arrested by FBI agents on the evening 
of Oct. 2, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a pain inside me every single day," he said with a thick Russian 
accent during a recent interview. "I (am) tortured inside. Every minute (it's) 
coming back to (me). Every time you are in touch with people, you have to 
explain you are not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Ogorodnikov, along with his wife, Svetlana, pleaded guilty in June, 1985, to 
conspiracy to commit espionage in connection with the sensational spy case of 
former FBI Agent Richard W. Miller. Svetlana, 40, is still in a federal prison 
in Northern California, serving an 18-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 52, was accused of passing documents to Svetlana, 40, in exchange for 
sex and a promised $65,000 in gold and cash. 
</P>
<P>
Their guilty pleas, Nikolai said, came only after he became concerned that his 
wife could receive a life sentence if found guilty by a jury. He made clear 
that he still felt warmly toward her and does not believe she was manipulated 
by the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
Ogorodnikov's predicament, though, generates little sympathy from residents of 
Los Angeles' sizable Russian immigrant community. They believe that he is 
reaping his just reward. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with his predicament, who requested anonymity, said 
Ogorodnikov's conviction "was a black mark against him in the community." 
</P>
<P>
"I know how the people felt," said a source close to the investigation. "That 
Russian community around Fairfax is very tight. There isn't the rally or 
support when the charge is espionage." 
</P>
<P>
Lilia Sokolov, assistant publisher of the community's largest Russian-language 
weekly, Almanac Panorama, believes that the locals are justified in ostracizing 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I thinks he deserves it and so do many people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The community consensus when he was sentenced, she said, was that "America gave 
you shelter, took you in. So what are you giving America? That's how you're 
repaying it? I don't think he can expect anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Before Ogorodnikov could savor freedom, he found himself facing an immigration 
judge who ordered him deported. The order was then blocked by U.S. District 
Judge Robert M. Takasugi in Los Angeles, who will preside over Miller's third 
espionage trial, scheduled for August. Ogorodnikov has been subpoenaed by 
Miller's lawyers as a possible witness at that trial. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's first espionage trial ended in a hung jury in 1985. The following 
year, however, he was found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Miller had acknowledged having an affair with Svetlana. He 
claimed he was not a spy but was trying to revive his crumbling FBI career by 
attempting to penetrate the Soviet Union's KGB. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's conviction, however, was overturned by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeal in April, 1989, and he was released from a federal prison on $337,000 
bail last October. 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Ogorodnikov, an elf-like man, stands about 5-feet, 4-inches tall. He 
has wispy white hair, flashing blue eyes and a volatile personality. He simply 
cannot sit still when discussing the Miller case and the spy accusations. 
</P>
<P>
Waving his arms and pacing the floor, he laughs and, sometimes, cries. He is 
not an educated person, and he does not appear to understand very well American 
society and its values. 
</P>
<P>
He made clear that he has enjoyed living in America -- "I really like this 
country," he said -- but that the tug of Mother Russia is strong. He wants to 
go home. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to die in Kiev," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to feel sorry for him. Undoubtedly, he has led a difficult life. In 
fact, as he tells it, he's lucky to have lived beyond his youth. 
</P>
<P>
An only child, Ogorodnikov was barely a teen-ager when he volunteered to become 
a Soviet army helper in the closing days of World War II. Captured by a German 
unit -- "I remember it like it was yesterday" -- he said that, along with other 
imprisoned Russian soldiers, he was forced to face a terrifying brace of 
machine guns in the prison yard. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, he didn't panic. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe (at age 13) you never believe you can die," he said. "You not accept 
this." For whatever reason, the Nazi commander decided against executing 
prisoners that day. 
</P>
<P>
"If he knew I was from a Jewish family, I would never survive," Ogorodnikov 
reflected. 
</P>
<P>
He said he escaped and was sheltered by a German family for the duration of the 
war, after which he found his way back to Kiev, which had been devastated by 
the war and the Nazi occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Ogorodnikov said he later fell in with "bad friends." One day, he was caught 
stealing government property. He was sentenced to three years in a Siberian 
gulag, from which he was released in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
During the rest of that decade and the next, Ogorodnikov said, he scratched out 
a living driving cabs and buses in Kiev. He also married, had a daughter and 
was divorced. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, he said, he met Svetlana, and they married about eight years later. 
The marriage produced a son, Matvei, now 18, who is about to enter a university 
in Kiev where he plans to study languages. 
</P>
<P>
The year Matvei was born, 1972, the family emigrated to Los Angeles, where 
Ogorodnikov had an uncle. 
</P>
<P>
Again, it was a difficult life, complicated by the fact that Nikolai and 
Svetlana had little education, meager financial resources and didn't speak 
English. Nikolai put bread on the table by working in local factories. An 
attempt to import and show Russian films in Los Angeles was a flop. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's obscurity suddenly ended in October, 1984, when they were arrested 
along with Miller and accused of conspiring with the FBI agent to pass secret 
government documents to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls being devastated when, after his arrest, his son visited him at the 
federal prison facility at Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened?" the 12-year-old boy asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to cry," Ogorodnikov said, recalling the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than face the prospect of foster care for his son, he made arrangements 
for a distant nephew from New York to help Matvei return to Kiev and live with 
Ogorodnikov's mother, who died last year. 
</P>
<P>
Just before his release from prison last February, Ogorodnikov said he was 
confronted by four FBI agents. He said the agents proposed a deal: If he rolled 
over on Miller, the FBI would put in a good word for him to prevent his 
deportation. 
</P>
<P>
Ogorodnikov said he suddenly rose and shouted: "I can't testify! I never knew 
Miller!" 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman in Los Angeles declined to comment on the account. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Ogorodnikov had another dilemma. Because he had been ordered 
deported, the government had not returned his immigration "green card" so that 
he could show potential employers he had been a legal resident. But last week, 
he said, immigration officials gave him a temporary work permit so he could 
continue to drive a van for the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult," he reiterated. "But I am surviving."

GIRL, 10, SAVES FAMILY IN BURNING HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE: THE CHILD AWOKE TO THE SMELL OF SMOKE IN HER PANORAMA CITY HOME. SHE 
ALERTED HER SLEEPING GRANDPARENTS, UNCLE AND BROTHER. THERE WERE NO INJURIES.

<P>
A 10-year-old girl alerted her sleeping family to a fire in their Panorama City 
home Monday and helped evacuate them, winning praise from firefighters for 
possibly saving their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Raquel Guerrero and fire officials said that because she slept in the top bed 
of a bunk bed, she may have smelled smoke before anyone else in the house in 
the 14100 block of Terra Bella Street. 
</P>
<P>
"They were lucky," Los Angeles Fire Department Battalion Chief Robert Teachenor 
said. "The little girl woke up and smelled smoke and got them all out in time." 
</P>
<P>
Raquel told fire officials that she jumped down from her bed after waking about 
1 a.m. and awoke her 15-year-old brother, Romie, who was in the bottom bunk. 
</P>
<P>
The children said their room was filling with smoke coming from the hallway. 
Romie jumped through a window while Raquel ran through the hall and out the 
front door. 
</P>
<P>
But both then ran back into the smoke-filled house yelling and waking their 
grandparents and an uncle. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to get everybody out as fast as we could," Raquel recalled. 
"There was smoke everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Raquel said she saw fire in her mother's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The three adults and two children escaped without injury. But the family 
members spent several terrifying minutes not knowing if the children's mother, 
Rosina Robinson, was trapped in the burning bedroom or had left for her night 
job at a towing company. 
</P>
<P>
The children's uncle, Alex Ramirez, crawled part way into the burning room but 
did not see Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
After firefighters arrived, they searched the home and rescued five family pets 
-- a dog and four kittens -- but determined that Robinson was not there. 
</P>
<P>
"She had gone to work, but we didn't know," Raquel said. "I was scared until 
they were sure." 
</P>
<P>
Teachenor said a religious candle left burning in the bedroom apparently 
sparked the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said deaths often result when carbon monoxide from fires reaches 
sleeping victims and anesthetizes them before the smell of smoke can wake them. 
</P>
<P>
Because smoke rises and initially will fill the top half of a room, Raquel's 
position on the top bunk may have allowed her to smell the smoke before she 
succumbed to carbon monoxide, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow she got a whiff of the smoke early enough to sound the alarm," 
Teachenor said. 
</P>
<P>
The battalion chief said the house was equipped with smoke alarms but they did 
not sound, apparently because the batteries had run down. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was mostly confined to two bedrooms and a hallway but smoke damage 
occurred throughout, Teachenor said. The loss was estimated at about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, members of the family were left to pick through the burned 
and wet debris that firefighters cleared out of the house. Family members said 
they would rely on relatives and the Red Cross to provide them with temporary 
shelter.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / SHERIFF; 
</P>
<P>
AT LAST, DRAMA IN THE PICKING OF COUNTY'S TOP COP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After decades of predictable results and uneventful campaigns, this year's race 
for Los Angeles County sheriff has all the drama and bickering of a good 
daytime soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
The main protagonist, Sheriff Sherman Block, 65, finds his department mired 
this election year in the worst scandal in recent decades, with 10 members of a 
top anti-narcotics unit indicted as the department investigates allegations 
that they pocketed seized drug money. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the chief rival, a political novice named Roland C. Biscailuz. A 
detective in the department's Lennox station, the 44-year-old Biscailuz is the 
cousin of the late Sheriff Eugene Biscailuz, considered by many to be the 
grandfather of the modern Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Biscailuz says Block's mismanagement of the department has ruined 
its once sterling reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Biscailuz's low-budget campaign received a boost recently from the elderly 
"sheriff emeritus" Peter J. Pitchess, who ran the department from 1958 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchess, 78, is playing a small but important supporting role in this year's 
sheriff's race. When Pitchess was sheriff, Block was his right-hand man. Now 
Pitchess has called on his former protege to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Uncharacteristically flustered by the criticism, Block called Biscailuz's 
statements "basically garbage" and said of Pitchess: "In his old age, he's more 
to be pitied." 
</P>
<P>
Even his opponent and detractors concede that Block very likely will win 
reelection to his third four-year term in the June 5 balloting. But Biscailuz 
and Pitchess have interjected a contentious note into what is usually one of 
the county's most routine elections. 
</P>
<P>
At the root of this enmity are the controversies that have made this one of the 
most difficult years the Sheriff's Department has endured in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the indictment of the deputies, the 7,500-member department has also 
come under fire for its handling of the January shooting of a member of the 
Nation of Islam in Athens. And in August the Sheriff's Department was 
criticized for its handling of a 911 emergency call that preceded the killing 
of four women at a birthday party in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with such bad news, some public officials might face an uphill fight for 
reelection. But Block's prestige among members of his department and the voters 
apparently has not faded. A recent Los Angeles Times Poll showed that 62% of 
Los Angeles County residents approved of the work of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
For now, as one union official put it, Block seems to be the "sheriff with the 
Teflon badge." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Feliciano, a forensic consultant who ran an unsuccessful campaign for 
sheriff in 1982, said victory for an incumbent sheriff is virtually automatic. 
</P>
<P>
"The sheriff is so powerful (that) it's not an elected position, it's an 
appointed position," Feliciano said. "In the campaign, nobody ever talks about 
the issues. There's no debates. It's a locked-in system." 
</P>
<P>
Feliciano is not running this year because, he said, a recently enacted state 
law limits the post to working law enforcement officers. He came closer than 
anyone to defeating Block, garnering 21% of the vote to Block's 63%. In 1986, 
Block won reelection with 913,303 votes -- his nearest rival, Saul E. Lankster, 
could tally only 70,772 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from a gala fund-raiser last fall, Block has not actively campaigned for 
reelection. He has been endorsed by several state and local officials and by 
the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, which represents about 6,500 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
According to his last campaign statement, Block's reelection committee has 
$351,992 in cash on hand. His list of contributors includes oil companies, 
waste disposal firms, land developers and bankers, all members of the "county 
family" of organizations and individuals whose business is intertwined with 
county government. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, with less than three weeks left before the election, Biscailuz 
said he had raised only $1,400 for his bid to unseat Block. He has made a 
single campaign appearance, setting up a table at Olvera Street on a pleasant 
Sunday afternoon to distribute posters and green pens with his campaign slogan: 
"Leadership and Accountability." 
</P>
<P>
Biscailuz, who has never run for office, investigates auto thefts and 
burglaries at the Lennox station. A 21-year veteran, he says his campaign 
represents a grass-roots movement of sheriff's deputies who are dissatisfied 
with Block. 
</P>
<P>
He is critical of department disciplinary procedures under Block, which he said 
have contributed to low morale among the department's rank and file. Block said 
such criticisms are unfounded and that he has the support of the vast majority 
of his deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Biscailuz acknowledges that he is running chiefly on the strength of the name 
he shares with his late cousin. 
</P>
<P>
The challenger has also drawn some indirect support from Pitchess. While 
Pitchess has not endorsed Biscailuz, the "sheriff emeritus" met recently with 
Biscailuz. "Roland is a fine boy," Pitchess said. 
</P>
<P>
More important for Biscailuz, Pitchess also has made stinging criticisms of 
Block, the man he groomed for sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
All three men -- Block, Biscailuz and Pitchess -- belong to the virtual dynasty 
that has ruled the department since 1934, with incumbents winning reelection to 
the post in 14 consecutive elections.

Eugene Biscailuz supported Pitchess, then his undersheriff, in the 1958 
election. And Pitchess, in turn, named Block undersheriff. Before the 1982 
election, Pitchess stepped down, allowing Block to finish out the term and run 
in the 1982 election as an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Pitchess said he was calling on Block to resign 
because of the recent money-skimming scandal that has led to the suspension of 
26 deputies within the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very disturbed," Pitchess said. "The department is full of a bunch of 
fine law enforcement men and women. For them to suffer like this, the bad image 
that they are getting, it's almost criminal. There is only one person to blame 
for this." 
</P>
<P>
Block points out, however, that Pitchess' bad feelings toward him go back 
several years, almost to the day Block was sworn in as sheriff. The two men 
were involved in a dispute over Pitchess' use of a sheriff's car after Pitchess 
had retired from office. After the dispute, Block says, Pitchess spurned him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an angry old man who has never been able to accept the fact that he's no 
longer the sheriff of Los Angeles County," Block said. 
</P>
<P>
Also running in the election is Joseph G. Senteno, 43, of Inglewood. Senteno, a 
custodian at UCLA, finished third in the 1986 election, drawing 58,004 votes. 
He did not respond to calls from The Times.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 560-ACRE JOSHUA TREE FOREST TO BECOME PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 560-acre forest of Joshua trees west of Lancaster, the legacy of an Antelope 
Valley rancher who collected guns, railway memorabilia and acres of desert 
land, has been acquired by the state and will become part of a nearby public 
park, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The forest is one of the area's largest concentrations of Joshua trees. 
</P>
<P>
In a transaction that was finally completed in recent weeks, land was willed to 
the state by rancher Arthur Ripley, who died two years ago at the age of 88. It 
represents one of the largest single land acquisitions in the Antelope Valley 
in more than 20 years, said Gordon McDaniel of the state Department of Parks 
and Recreation.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOMICIDES IN COUNTY UP 17% OVER LAST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County may see nearly 2,500 homicides this year if the pattern of 
the first four months of the year continues, according to statistics released 
Monday by the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the first four months of 1990 indicate that the homicide rate 
has risen at what Deputy Coroner Ilona Lewis called an "unprecedented" 17.1%, 
compared to the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 772 homicides this year, and if the rate continues, the year's 
total will be 2,449, coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said. That would be 358 
more than last year's total of 2,091.

FOSTER YOUTHS CELEBRATE VICTORY OVER THE ODDS;

It was a graduation from foster care to being in no one's care but their own. 
Not so much a new beginning as it was a middle passage, said one -- an 
affirmation that, as children, they had gone up against the odds, and not only 
survived them, but beaten them. 
</P>
<P>
"You never really leave anything behind," said 18-year-old Stephan, who spent 
his senior year of high school in a group home and is going on to UC San Diego. 
"You pick up the pieces, put them together and make it whole." 
</P>
<P>
Such spirit was celebrated Monday evening at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 
where 101 foster youths, bound for colleges or vocational schools, were 
applauded for their achievements and awarded scholarships to assist them in 
paying for their education and living arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinated and sponsored by the county Department of Children's Services and 
United Friends of the Children organization, the first "Independent Living 
Celebration" had all the pomp and circumstance of a senior prom and 
commencement ceremony with a few twists that would make a Hollywood premiere 
shine. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in tuxedos and formal gowns, the teen-agers walked in front of a group 
of approximately 200 to the strains of singer Whitney Houston's, "One Moment In 
Time." And then the songstress, who had flown in from New York for the event, 
walked down the steps after them and finished the song. 
</P>
<P>
Also there to honor the youths were actors Henry Winkler, Edward James Olmos, 
and rapper M.C. Hammer, who was the emcee. 
</P>
<P>
It meant a lot, the teen-agers agreed, that they were more than a case file in 
some county worker's desk drawer. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us became adults at 14," said William, 18, who entered the foster care 
system at 12 and is planning to attend Cal State Dominguez Hills. "Our whole 
world was flipped over. Shattered. Some kids in our situations might consider 
suicide, but here you have 101 kids who decided we were going to fight to make 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"And now we're graduating. We used to feel nobody cared for us. Then we found 
out they did care. They just didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers, soliciting corporations and individual contributors, raised 
$200,000 to help assist the teen-agers, said Nancy Daly, founder and chair of 
the UFC, a nonprofit volunteer organization dedicated to assisting youths once 
they are "emancipated" from the foster care system at 18. 
</P>
<P>
"These are kids who dream like everybody else," said Daly, who added that many 
foster children wind up homeless once out of the system because of a lack of 
money, support and options. "But they need to have extra help to fulfill those 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the accolades and glamour, some of the youths admitted they had fears 
of going out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, said 18-year-old Richard, "I think what if I'm really scared, 
because I don't know where I'm going to get the money" -- to live, to go to 
school? 
</P>
<P>
That is a question many newly independent foster youths ask themselves, said 
William, president of a foster youth support organization called the "Foster 
Youth Connection." The other two, he said, are "where do I go from here. And 
who can help me?" 
</P>
<P>
Finding the answers may be the worst part of leaving the county system. But 
Virginia, 17, could only think of what would be the best: 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's knowing you don't have to leave (a place) at a certain time," she 
said. On your own "you can leave whenever you want."

DEATH FOR MURDERER WHO STALKED GAY BARS AFFIRMED; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: STATE SUPREME COURT SAYS USE OF HYPNOTIZED WITNESS, THOUGH IMPROPER, 
DID NOT BAR USE OF OTHER EVIDENCE.

<P>
The state Supreme Court affirmed the death penalty Monday of a man convicted in 
the bludgeon-slayings of four men he met in homosexual bars and lured to their 
deaths in West Hollywood and Silver Lake in 1980 and 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The justices unanimously turned down an appeal by Donald Miller, 49, a former 
welder and convicted robber who was also found guilty of attempting to murder 
four other men in similar assaults. 
</P>
<P>
The high court acknowledged that jurors had improperly been allowed to hear 
testimony from a key prosecution witness who identified Miller as a suspect 
after being hypnotized to refresh his memory. 
</P>
<P>
The justices cited a landmark 1982 ruling sharply limiting testimony from 
witnesses who previously had undergone hypnosis -- a process they said then was 
unreliable and lacked sufficient scientific acceptance. But the 1982 decision 
did not bar the use of other evidence uncovered by investigators, they noted. 
</P>
<P>
The court went on to hold that in this case, there was separate, properly 
admitted proof that implicated Miller as the killer -- and thus it was not 
"reasonably probable" the erroneously admitted testimony affected the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
The overall evidence, Justice David N. Eagleson wrote, showed "that the 
defendant kept a pipe in his car for use as a weapon and that on four separate 
occasions he met men in gay bars, invited them to his car for marijuana or sex, 
drove them to nearby side streets and without warning struck them on the head 
with a pipe and killed them." 
</P>
<P>
Miller was convicted and sentenced to death in Los Angeles Superior Court in 
1983 for the murders of Michael Thomas, 32; Robert Sanderson, 26; Danny Harmon, 
23, and Ernesto Ramirez, 28. 
</P>
<P>
A key role was played by a witness, Mario Aguirre, who had seen his friend 
Ramirez leaving a bar with an unidentified black male. After Ramirez had been 
attacked and lay unconscious in a hospital, another acquaintance arranged for 
Aguirre to be hypnotized and help a police artist, working privately, come up 
with a composite drawing of the unidentified man that would be distributed in 
homosexual bars. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators later became aware of Aguirre's role as a witness and they 
persuaded him to join them in a stakeout at the bar where Ramirez had been seen 
with the unidentified man. As they approached the bar, a man crossed the street 
toward them and Aguirre shouted, "That's him!" The man turned and walked away 
quickly, but was chased and caught by police. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the suspect as Miller and found a metal pipe in his car. In 
subsequent investigations, authorities charged Miller with the four murders and 
the attempted murders of four other men, three of whom identified him as their 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
After he was convicted, Miller told jurors at the penalty phase of the trial 
that he was not guilty. Although he did not ask for the death penalty, he told 
jurors that he did not want to be sentenced to the alternative under state law: 
life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
In his appeal to the state Supreme Court, an attorney for Miller argued that 
his client's conviction and sentence should be overturned because of the 
erroneous admission of Aguirre's testimony. The entire case had been tainted by 
Aguirre's improper hypnosis-assisted testimony and the high court should order 
a retrial, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The justices rejected Miller's claim, pointing to the separate, properly 
admitted evidence implicating him in the attacks.

The operator of a Kentucky mine where 10 workers died in an explosion last year 
was cited for 121 alleged violations of federal safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration said 42 violations 
against Pyro Mining Co. involved "reckless disregard" of safety, the highest 
degree of negligence in the agency's penalty system. James Greenlee, executive 
vice president of Costain Coal Inc., which owns Pyro, said the company was 
reviewing the alleged violations. An agency report earlier this month said 10 
specific violations contributed to the Sept. 13 explosion in Wheatcroft, Ky.

University researchers opposed legislation that would outlaw certain animal 
tests for product safety. "Animal zealots have flooded the Legislature, the 
press and the public with an intimidating deluge of mail, propaganda and 
information," Tom Hamm, director of animal research at Stanford University, 
told a Capitol news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) in many instances, there are no adequate alternatives to animal testing 
and research to allay human pain, suffering, disease and injury." AB 2461, a 
measure by Assemblymen Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) and Norm Waters 
(D-Plymouth), would make it a crime to use three tests now used to measure the 
safety and toxicity of a wide range of household products. Hamm, joined by John 
Lamb, a health educator at UC Davis Medical Center, said that of more than 
1,000 Californians polled by the Public Policy Research Group of Dallas, 74% 
would oppose the legislation.

DANGEROUS NITRATE LEVELS FOUND IN DRINKING-WATER WELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drinking water consumed by about 10,000 residents of El Rio and Nyeland Acres 
contains as much as three times the acceptable levels of nitrates, county 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Supervisor Susan K. Lacey described the situation in the areas 
north of Oxnard as a health-threatening emergency. She said she will ask the 
Board of Supervisors today to provide $25,000 to finance a study of how the 
problem can be solved. 
</P>
<P>
Tests conducted last month in wells serving the area showed nitrate levels as 
high as 123 parts per million, according to Robert Gallagher, manager of the 
resources section of the County Environmental Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher said 45 p.p.m. is the maximum acceptable contaminant level set by the 
state Department of Health Services. "I would recommend that anyone living in 
that area should consult their doctor before using the water," Gallagher added. 
</P>
<P>
Excessive nitrates has "definitely been established" as being harmful to 
infants 6 months and younger because it reduces their blood's ability to carry 
oxygen, Gallagher said. He said there is no conclusive evidence of a danger to 
older children or adults, but that some researchers suspect a link between high 
levels of the substance and cancer and birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
"To my knowledge, however, nobody has shown that cancer or birth defects are 
caused by excessive nitrate levels," he said. "There is some suspicion that 
they're loosely related.". 
</P>
<P>
Lacey noted that some studies also indicate that fetuses and children up to 2 
years old may be harmed by nitrite, which is formed in the human body by 
excessive nitrate levels. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey hosted a meeting last week attended by state and county water and health 
officials along with representatives of a newly formed council of mutual water 
companies supplying well water to El Rio and Nyeland Acres. Water from eight of 
the companies' wells is suspected of containing excessive nitrates. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Lacey and Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), whose district 
includes the affected area, met with state water and health officials in 
Sacramento on Monday in an attempt to gain state support for an effort to 
remove the danger. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Collart, an administrative aide to Lacey, said one solution being 
considered is merging the small water companies so they can better afford to 
purify their water. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher said excessive nitrates, compounds of nitric acid, have been found in 
El Rio and Nyeland Acres water since at least the mid-1970s. Possible sources 
of the problem include fertilizer used by farmers, septic tanks and manure from 
a dairy that formerly was located there. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey said the impurities may date back to the 1950s. "They seem to come and 
go, in peaks and valleys," she said. "Whatever the cause, we're mainly 
interested in solving the problem, not blaming anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Gientke, general manager of the United Water Conservation District, whose 
water is not among that reported to have excessive nitrate levels, said his 
district would be willing to provide water to the affected area temporarily 
while a permanent solution is being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
United, which serves parts of Oxnard and Port Hueneme, recently started 
supplying water to Rio del Valle Junior High School in El Rio after school 
officials expressed fear that the health of students might be adversely 
affected by the high nitrate levels, Gientke said.

Charles Flores, 48, pleaded no contest to a charge of threatening great bodily 
injury or death. The plea came as jurors were being chosen Monday for his trial 
in Ventura County Superior Court on charges that he threatened to kill Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes in a Feb. 6 phone call to the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
According to transcripts of the conversation, Flores told Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Ronald C. Janes that he was "laying dead for Holmes" in the Courthouse parking 
lot, armed with a gun. Flores was angry that Holmes refused to file murder 
charges against two men accused of beating his son to death outside a party. He 
further blamed the prosecutor for failing to win severe penalties in their 
trials on lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Charles R. McGrath accepted Flores' plea, telling him he would likely 
serve only six months of the maximum possible three-year sentence and be fined 
only part of the maximum possible $22,700 in fines for the charge. Flores 
remained free on $25,000 bail pending sentencing on July 10. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said he decided not to defend himself at the trial because "I'm not into 
it. . . . This is not important to me. The only thing important to me is my 
son's death." 
</P>
<P>
Flores' son, John, died of brain injuries suffered in a brawl outside a party 
in Newbury Park on Jan. 20, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Flores arrived at the party uninvited and was asked to leave three times, but 
refused, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
A fight broke out, during which another party-goer grabbed Flores by the hair 
and slammed his head against the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Sheriff's Department arrested Larnell Bush and John Yurek in 
Flores' death. Bush was convicted on July 19, 1989, of aggravated assault and 
sentenced to 90 days in jail and five years probation. A jury acquitted John 
Yurek on Aug. 30, 1989, of a manslaughter charge. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes said Monday that he never expected Flores to enter the plea that could 
send him to jail, giving up a chance to air his grievances against the 
prosecutor in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
"You could have knocked me over with a feather," Holmes said. "He has tried to 
make a cause celebre out of this. He has complained to everybody. He complained 
to the State Bar Assn., which exonerated me. He complained to the U.S. 
attorney's office, he complained to the grand jury, he complained to the 
California attorney general's office and to the newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office is still investigating Holmes' handling of John 
Flores' death, said Deputy Atty. Gen. Patrick Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes said Monday that Flores first threatened him in February, 1989, before 
Yurek's trial began. "He threatened to shoot me when I filed manslaughter and 
not murder charges against John Yurek," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes said he did not prosecute Flores for that incident because "When 
somebody is under distress such as having lost a child, a grievous loss such as 
that, you try and cut them some slack." 
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors did press charges against Flores after his phone calls to 
the district attorney's office on Feb. 6, one of which was taped. 
</P>
<P>
"You people screwed us over bad," Flores told Janes in the taped conversation. 
"I'm going to get you out of that office and I don't give a damn how I have to 
do it. I don't care if it's political, I don't care if it's the media, I don't 
care if I have to hire someone to blow that building clear to Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
Flores has filed civil lawsuits against seven people he believes were involved 
in his son's death, including Yurek and Bush.

FARM IRRIGATION MAY BE CURBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise move Monday, state water authorities proposed restricting 
agricultural practices that contribute to nitrate contamination of ground 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The Regional Water Quality Control Board, meeting in Ventura, said heavy 
agricultural irrigation drives nitrates from fertilizers into the ground water 
below. Large concentrations of nitrates can be fatal to infants and have been 
linked to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest offender is agriculture," said Larry Zarian, a member of the Los 
Angeles board. "If we are really worried about water quality, and agriculture 
is the biggest offender, we need to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
The board directed its staff to write a new rule aimed at reducing nitrate 
contamination caused by agriculture. That rule would be incorporated into a 
proposed regulation on septic tanks, which also contribute to nitrate 
contamination by allowing liquid waste to percolate through the soil and into 
ground water below. 
</P>
<P>
The board is expected to vote on the regulation at its August meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal drew an indignant reaction from Ventura County agriculture 
officials, who said they did not receive advance notice that the board intended 
to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't ever talked to anybody who can tell me what our contribution is, if, 
indeed, we have a direct contribution," Rex Laird, executive director of the 
Ventura County Farm Bureau, said of the nitrate contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Laird said any regulation would be unnecessary, because most growers in Ventura 
County already use the minimum water possible. Laird said that if the board 
acts, it would be the first time regulations are imposed on growers' irrigation 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be curious to know how they intend to regulate nitrate contamination 
if they don't know the source of the problem," Laird said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the water board should wait to impose any regulations on nitrate 
contaminators until the end of the year, when the United Water Conservation 
District will have completed a study. That study is designed to show the source 
of ground-water contamination in the El Rio area, where the presence of 
nitrates has prompted county health authorities to close eight drinking-water 
wells. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials suspect that septic tanks and agricultural irrigation practices 
are responsible for the contamination there. Septic tanks are systems that 
catch waste materials from the home that are either poured down the drain or 
flushed down the toilet. Solids are separated into the tank and liquids are 
allowed to drain into the earth, percolating down through the soil into ground 
water. The tanks are supposed to be flushed out periodically. 
</P>
<P>
It was the controversy over septic tanks that brought the water board to 
Ventura for a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The board proposes to limit the number of new septic tanks by prohibiting them 
on any lots smaller than two acres. Lots ranging from two to five acres would 
be required to install sewer pipelines that could be hooked up later to a 
central sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's public hearing and in letters to the water board, Ventura County 
officials protested the proposed rule, saying it would unnecessarily restrict 
septic tanks in areas where no ground-water contamination had been found. 
</P>
<P>
The county also asked for exemptions from the septic tank rule for developers 
who have already been given permission to subdivide their property. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ghirelli, the general manager of the water board, said the board will 
likely accept the county's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
By the next board meeting on June 18, Ghirelli said, the staff will develop 
interim requirements. That way, developers can move forward on building plans 
without waiting until August, when the board is expected to adopt the 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said it is unlikely that he could have a draft regulation on 
agriculture water prepared any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a problem that has been ongoing for 20 years. We are not likely to 
solve it in a month," he said.

<P>
Volunteers are being sought to provide temporary housing, known as "cool 
homes," for children of families undergoing counseling for serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cooling off for both parents and kids," said Brenda Benedict, crisis 
services outreach coordinator for Interface, a nonprofit family services group. 
</P>
<P>
"If tempers are still high or if kids are afraid to go home, we offer them a 
safe place to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Interface now has 10 cool homes and is looking for about 10 more. Interface 
reimburses families for the children's expenses during the four- to five-day 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
Home volunteers are licensed in the same manner as foster families, and undergo 
a lengthy application process. "We . . . go out and look at the arrangement," 
Benedict said. KIM KASH

OFFICE RECYCLING PROGRAM ADOPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Paula City Council adopted a paper recycling program for city offices 
and a new automated garbage collection system on Monday. It also considered a 
citywide recycling plan. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved a program to recycle paper from its city government 
offices. High-quality paper, including that used in copy machines, computer 
printers and fax machines, will be sold to a private hauler for about $25 per 
ton. 
</P>
<P>
The council also directed staff to form a committee to design a recycling 
program for Santa Paula. Under consideration is a multibarrel system, with 
separate containers for yard waste and mixed recyclables, such as glass, metal 
and paper. Other waste destined for landfills would be deposited in a third 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
A state law requires that cities adopt recycling programs by July 1, 1991, and 
reduce their solid waste by 25% by January 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The council also passed a resolution establishing fees for a new automated 
refuse collection program. Under the program, mechanized arms extending from 
garbage trucks will replace sanitation workers. 
</P>
<P>
However, no layoffs will be necessary because most of the positions have been 
eliminated through attrition, said city Public Works Director Norm Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
Automated refuse collection is expected to begin in some Santa Paula 
neighborhoods by the end of the month. About 5,000 new plastic containers, 
which will cost the city $300,000, will be distributed to residents. 
</P>
<P>
Fees will remain the same for most households, Wilkinson said. Homeowners who 
want a second trash barrel will be charged $2 per month. 
</P>
<P>
Two new trucks, costing about $100,000 each, will be operated by the driver. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson said the automated system will save the city money because of reduced 
labor and health costs. JANET BERGAMO

CARCINOGENS SEEPED INTO WELLS FROM FACTORY, U.S. SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
TOXICS: THE REPORT COMES AFTER A FAMILY BLAMED FOUR DEATHS ON A NEARBY SANTA 
CLARITA VALLEY PLANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Neighbors of a Santa Clarita Valley munitions plant may have been exposed to 
cancer-causing chemicals that seeped into the ground water underneath the 
factory, a federal report has concluded, contradicting earlier studies by Los 
Angeles County and state health authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The report on the Space Ordnance Systems facility, west of the Antelope Valley 
Freeway in Sand Canyon, was prepared by the Agency for Toxic Substances and 
Disease Registry, which is affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) last summer requested that the report be 
prepared, after the family of Robert Hercules charged that pollution from SOS 
led to four cancer deaths in the family between 1983 and 1989. Another Sand 
Canyon resident conducted an informal survey of neighbors showing what she 
claimed were unusually high cancer rates in the community. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's report, released last week, did not brand the plant a definite 
threat to public health but said data from well water samples and computer 
analysis indicate that hazardous substances migrated off the SOS site and into 
domestic water supplies. These include benzene and trichloroethylene, both 
known carcinogens, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
There is reasonable evidence showing adverse health effects could result from 
the pollution by SOS, said Joseph L. Hughart, an environmental health 
specialist who prepared the report. 
</P>
<P>
"We do know that some people were exposed to some carcinogens in the ground 
water," Hughart said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The report advised residents living close to the plant in Sand and Gorman 
canyons not to use water from private wells. There are eight private wells in 
the nearby area. 
</P>
<P>
None of the wells in question feed the local public water supply, provided by 
the Santa Clarita Water Co. The company gets water from several sources, 
including other wells in Sand Canyon outside the area the report warned of. An 
early test that indicated pollution of a well supplying the company turned out 
to be a mistake, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
SOS, a division of TransTechnology Corp., had produced flares and explosives in 
Sand Canyon since 1967. In March, 1984, law enforcement officers and health 
officials raided the company's two plants in Sand Canyon and Mint Canyon and 
found more than 1,000 barrels of improperly stored hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
The company illegally disposed of water tainted by solvents, spraying it from 
sprinklers and dumping it in creek beds. SOS paid $300,000 in fines and two 
company executives served brief jail terms. 
</P>
<P>
SOS was sold in March to Universal Propulsion Co. of Phoenix and the plant is 
expected to move to Arizona sometime this year. 
</P>
<P>
A monitoring committee of county and state health officials, Sand Canyon 
residents and SOS officials was created in 1985 to oversee the cleanup of the 
site, which is almost complete. The committee's studies have repeatedly 
indicated that SOS pollution had not entered the local water table. 
</P>
<P>
The report's conclusions were reached using much of the same data that had been 
used by earlier researchers but employing different computer models for 
analysis, Hughart said. He was unavailable for comment on why the results 
differed. 
</P>
<P>
Members of that committee and officials familiar with the company's record in 
Sand Canyon said Monday they were surprised by the federal agency's report. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having a hard time with that," said Burl Alison, a TransTechnology vice 
president, of the report's findings. "It's hard for us to understand, with all 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Manetta, president of the Santa Clarita Water Co., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's surprising to me," he said of the report. As for the report's warning on 
well water, "I guess they want to cover themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was also surprised by the report's reference to a well at the Hercules 
family home. As far as he knew, Manetta said, the family was connected to the 
public water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hercules' widow, Marilyn Hercules, said the reference to the well is 
incorrect and that the house was on the public water system. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she was pleased that the report challenged the claim of county and 
state health officials that the pollution was confined to the SOS plant. 
</P>
<P>
"This report from the ATSDR absolutely shoots it full of holes," she said, 
speaking of the claim. "What it doesn't establish is causation." 
</P>
<P>
The report also analyzed three studies which have been conducted on the 
incidence of disease in Sand Canyon. The report said that for reasons ranging 
from sample size to format, the studies are inconclusive.

CITY REVENUES FALL $712,000 FOR YEAR

<P>
City revenues in Oxnard are down $712,000 this year because the city is 
receiving less money from motor vehicle registration fees, hotel taxes and 
fines to drunk drivers, according to a quarterly budget review. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials said the shortfall is such a small percentage of the 
$59-million city budget that the city will not be forced to make any spending 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the shortfall will be made up by budget savings over the past nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the revenue shortfall, expenditures and revenues are close to their 
expected targets, said Management and Budget Director Bill Mayer. "It's a good 
sign," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget review report, which covers July 1, 1989, to March 1, 1990, will be 
discussed by the City Council today. The city now has $4.2 million in budget 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Next year's budget outlook, which is set for adoption by the end of June, is 
less optimistic. City Manager David Mora has warned that if the voters do not 
adopt a 5% utility users tax on June 5, the city will have to consider $2.7 
million in budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cuts being considered are the elimination of police and firefighter 
positions and the closure of a youth boxing center, a museum, a library and a 
day camp. HUGO MARTIN

VENTURA SEEKS BOOST IN USE OF WELLS TO EASE DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Ventura could make up nearly 75% of its water shortage if the 
Regional Groundwater Management Assn. would relax regulations and allow the 
city to pump more water out of the Santa Paula Basin, city officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Don Villenueve said a study on solutions to the city's acute water 
crisis have determined that the city could obtain up to 4,800 additional 
acre-feet of water each year by completing work on a well under construction in 
Saticoy and by increasing the productivity of the city's well near the Olivas 
golf course on the east end of the city. 
</P>
<P>
One acre-foot of water typically takes care of the yearly water needs of a 
family of four. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city is under instructions by the regional ground-water board to 
reduce usage of ground water by 5%, Villenueve said. "They would have to 
approve our expansion of ground-water usage on an emergency basis," Villenueve 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the city's public information office announced that 
the city had cut back its monthly water use from 21 million gallons a day to 
16.1 million gallons a day between April 12 and May 11, compared to the same 
period last year.

THE DROUGHT CONSERVATION; 
</P>
<P>
LAW-DEFYING PERMIT FACES COUNCIL'S APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council set the stage Monday for a confrontation with its own 
Planning Commission by voting to reconsider a permit for a new bank that was 
granted in defiance of the city's water conservation law. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 to appeal the commission's decision, with Jim Monahan 
dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
The new slow-growth City Council has been at odds with the Planning Commission 
-- whose members were appointed by past Councils and are generally more 
sympathetic toward growth -- since the council imposed a strict moratorium on 
all new water hookups last March. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commission members have complained repeatedly about the council's 
failure to consult them on the water ordinance, and said the blanket moratorium 
on hookups left them without opportunity to influence city planning. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, city officials said this week that they take exception to the 
commission's challenge of the water ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't like the law, approving this project is the wrong way of sending 
the message," said Community Development Director Everett Millais, who wrote a 
memorandum to the City Council urging them to appeal the commission's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't their prerogative to say if a law is good or bad," said Councilman 
John McWherter. "They should stick to planning." 
</P>
<P>
On May 8, the Planning Commission tentatively approved a 13,332-square-foot 
Home Savings bank building to be located at Victoria Avenue and Moon Drive. The 
project involves replacing two existing buildings with a new one. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters argued that the project would cut back water use beyond the 15% 
required in the city's water conservation ordinance by calling for the 
installation of low-flow toilets and low-flow shower heads, as well as 
replacing current landscaping with plants that use less water. 
</P>
<P>
But Millais said the project would result in an increase of plumbing fixtures 
from about six to 16. That would violate the water ordinance, which prohibits 
any increase in plumbing fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are we supposed to deny a project just because it has more plumbing 
fixtures?" asked Commissioner Tim Downey. "It didn't make sense to me, and 
that's why I voted for it." 
</P>
<P>
He said the commission saw in the bank project "an opportunity to work around 
some of the strict guidelines established in the council's water conservation 
ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
Public Works Department spokeswoman Carol Green said the reason the city banned 
increases in plumbing fixtures is to prevent the potential for more water use. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have 10 bathrooms instead of one, obviously you are going to use more 
water," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Richard Francis said he believed the Planning Commission was acting out 
of frustration at being left out of the decision-making process during the 
adoption of the water ordinance, and he hoped that any disagreements could be 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they felt they were left with the dirty work of telling developers 
they can't approve a project for something the council adopted without even 
consulting them. I understand their frustration."

A new fight over water is brewing in the Ojai Valley, where a local water 
company says it cannot comply with a moratorium on water hookups which were 
imposed because of a continuing shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Water Co., which supplies 2,688 customers in the Ojai area, 
said it cannot adopt a moratorium being required by the Casitas Municipal Water 
District, which supplies a third of the company's water from Lake Casitas. The 
Casitas District has announced that it will fine or cut off water to companies 
that do not comply with its one-year moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Donald L. Twomley, Southern California Water Co.'s vice president of water 
resources, said it does not have the authority to adopt the moratorium without 
approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very expensive and time-consuming procedure," Twomley said, noting 
that the company is still legally bound to serve 28 additional customers in 
Ojai who were promised water before the moratorium was imposed on April 11. All 
Casitas customers also are being asked to cut water use back 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Twomley also said Ojai's growth control law "basically accomplishes the 
intended curtailment." Ojai's ordinance allows only 16 new homes in the city 
each year, but that is still more than the moratorium limit of no new hookups. 
</P>
<P>
He said his company's proposal to trade water on a seasonal basis with Casitas 
"would prove far more beneficial to all concerned parties than would a total 
service moratorium." 
</P>
<P>
By sending ground water to Lake Casitas in the winter, Twomley said Southern 
California Water Co. could reduce its summer demands on the lake 50% to 100%. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas officials, however, have been lukewarm to the proposal since it was 
first presented last November, complaining that the ground water it would 
receive from Southern California would not be as high quality as lake water. 
</P>
<P>
Now, City Manager Andy Belknap is asking the City Council to wade into the 
fray. 
</P>
<P>
Still steaming over Southern California's proposed 35.5% rate hike in March, 
Belknap is asking the council to object today to the utility's position that it 
does not need to comply with the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap wants the city to go on record opposing the company, so that any fines 
imposed on Southern California would not be passed on to the rate payers. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap also is questioning the water trade proposal, saying the city should be 
part of any exchanges that might affect Ojai's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai City Council meets at 7:30 p.m. in Ojai City Hall, 401 S. Ventura St., 
Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council previously backed Belknap's objection to the three-year rate 
hike, complaining it penalized the thriftiest customers and provided no 
incentive to others to conserve. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Southern California Water officials offered March 26 to revise the 
entire rate structure. But Belknap said Monday he is still waiting for details 
on the new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The Public Utilities Commission will hold two hearings on the water company's 
eventual rate hike request and Ojai service program on June 25 at 3 p.m. in 
Ojai City Hall.

STATE CALLS FOR NEW PROJECT REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE ORIGINAL STUDY IGNORED THE IMPACT ON A RARE FISH IN THE SANTA 
CLARA RIVER, THE UNARMORED THREE-SPINE STICKLEBACK. 
</P>

<P>
The state attorney general's office, joining the fractious debate over a 
proposed condominium project in Santa Clarita, on Monday severely criticized an 
environmental review of the project and called for it to be redone. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the original study ignores the fate of the unarmored 
three-spine stickleback, the attorney general's letter complained. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental impact report (EIR) on the proposed Santa Catarina 
development "inadequately, inaccurately or altogether fails to address a number 
of significant issues," wrote Deputy Atty. Gen. Nilda M. Mesa in a letter to 
the Santa Clarita City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The strongly worded 10-page letter said the report relied on out-of-date 
studies, failed to support its conclusions with strong data and underestimated 
the potential impact of the proposed 1,452 units on plants and wildlife along a 
nearby stream and the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
"Moreover," the letter said, "the EIR inexplicably concludes that there would 
be no potential for cumulative impacts in any category except that of traffic." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by Mesa on behalf of state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp. Disgruntled homeowners who say the project is too large asked the 
attorney general to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent to the city, which is responsible under state law for 
ensuring that the report meets state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-inch-thick report does not comply with state environmental law because, 
among other things, it failed to address the potential loss of habitat of the 
unarmored three-spine stickleback, a tiny endangered fish found in some 
portions of the Santa Clara River, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by a consultant for G.H. Palmer Associates -- the would-be 
developers -- lifted portions of an already published environmental study on a 
nearby project to prove the Santa Catarina development would not harm the fish, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"An EIR for another project can not demonstrate the effects of this project on 
the stickleback," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Palmer Associates could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The company has proposed to build 1,452 units on the 135-acre site north of 
Soledad Canyon Road and southwest of Ermine Street. In return for city 
approval, developer Dan Palmer has pledged to build millions of dollars in road 
improvements badly needed in a city choked by traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, however, has said it is willing to approve no more than 800 
units. The city and developer are still negotiating the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council recently expressed concerns about the project's impact on the 
river habitat and asked city planners to review the environmental impact 
report. The planners said the report was sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jo Anne Darcy said Monday that Palmer Associates at least will have to 
revise portions of the report. "I don't see any way they can get out of it," 
Darcy said.

Ride the Movies: Universal Studios Florida opened its gates to the public 
Monday for three weeks of "sneak previews" of a Hollywood-style attraction 
expected to draw up to 6 million visitors in its first year. The $600-million 
attraction, which will officially open June 7, is expected to give stiff 
competition to the Disney-MGM Studios theme park, which opened a year ago just 
a few miles down the highway. Top Universal shows are based on King Kong, E.T. 
the Extraterrestrial, Jaws the killer shark and the 1906 San Francisco 
earthquake. GREG BRAXTON

Disney to Move Forward With Henson Deal: Despite the unexpected death of 
Muppets creator Jim Henson, Walt Disney Co. plans to go through with its 
pending purchase of Henson Associates Inc. "I don't see any reason why the sale 
won't go through," Erwin Okun, a Disney spokesman, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be temporarily delayed to allow for an appropriate mourning period." 
Okun did not disclose when the deal is scheduled to be completed. Henson, who 
died at age 53 last Wednesday of bacterial pneumonia, was buried Monday in New 
York. GREG BRAXTON

A POTENT ESCAPE FROM SAIGON IN 'LAST FLIGHT OUT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scramble of Vietnamese civilians to catch the last commercial plane out of 
Saigon as the Viet Cong advanced on the city is suspensefully dramatized 
tonight in "Last Flight Out" (9 p.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39). 
</P>
<P>
One of the images from the end of that war is the crush of frantic people 
scaling U.S. Embassy walls and fighting to get to the Saigon airport before the 
capital fell. 
</P>
<P>
The chaos was re-created in the film "The Killing Fields" (whose co-star Haing 
S. Ngor is seen here). But enough fact-based drama, particularly of unheralded 
Americans who made the last unofficial flight to safety possible, remained to 
be told. "Last Flight Out" tells it well. 
</P>
<P>
The two major characters are played by Richard Crenna and James Earl Jones. 
With the nerve and chicanery born of desperation, they essentially stage-manage 
the exodus of 500 evacuees on a last-ditch takeoff by Pan Am, which was the 
only American airline left in Vietnam. Their characters, and those of several 
South Vietnamese caught in the agony of leaving families, are based on 
real-life people, whose destinies are noted in a concluding credit role. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Halsey Davis' script doesn't grind political bones. What it does is 
equate character with action. Faces on screen only a minute or two don't fade 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Director Larry Elikann seldom overstates the obvious. The emotional ending is a 
given. But what lingers is Saigon's bus-clogged pandemonium, which says it all 
about those without the money, luck or U.S. connections to squeeze onto that 
Pan Am airliner on April 24, 1975 -- six days before the war ended.RAY LOYND

'HAWKING'S UNIVERSE' AN ENGROSSING PBS HOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just what is it about this guy Stephen Hawking? 
</P>
<P>
Who would think an hourlong show about a diminutive theoretical physicist could 
be so engrossing? For that matter, who would think that Hawking's "A Brief 
History of Time," a probe of the nature of reality, could be such an enormous 
best seller, translated into more than 20 languages? 
</P>
<P>
For those who read the book, "Professor Hawking's Universe" (at 10 tonight on 
Channel 28), will be no surprise. For Stephen Hawking, heir to the Lucasian 
Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge University once held by Issac Newton, is one 
compelling dude -- fascinating because of the clarity and precision of his 
mind, fascinating for the scope of his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the fascination initially comes because of the limits of Hawking's own 
physical universe. Hawking, 49, has battled Lou Gehrig's disease for 27 years 
-- the great mind cruelly trapped in a paralyzed body. But the viewer quickly 
forgets Hawking's ailment as he explains his studies, and he shrugs it off: 
"Most of my work is just thinking. My disabilities don't stop me; in a way, 
they just give me more time." 
</P>
<P>
His work? Nothing less than an attempt to explain everything -- by uniting the 
two great, seemingly incompatible theories of physics: quantum mechanics and 
general relativity. "If we could develop a complete theory of the universe," 
says Hawking, "we could in principle predict everything." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's why Hawking is so compelling: His work delves into our nature, 
our reality and, ultimately, our reason for being. 
</P>
<P>
"Universe" does have some problems with pacing and material, but it is a 
rewarding hour, produced by the BBC. Steven Spielberg is helping to make a 
90-minute nonfiction film about "A Brief History of Time" that will be 
broadcast by NBC; let's hope he gives Hawking a more polished forum for his 
ideas. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

THE MIND BEHIND THE AX IN 'KILLING' ON CBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's perfectly clear as the plot unfolds in "Killing in a Small Town," airing 
tonight at 9 on Channels 2 and 8, that Candy Morrison gave her neighbor 41 
whacks with an ax. Candy finally confesses it all. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty elementary stuff, Watson. 
</P>
<P>
But in this true-life murder in Texas 10 years ago, there's a puzzler that 
pulls us into this rather gripping mystery story: Candy had an affair with 
Peggy Blankenship's husband. She admits hacking Peggy. But is she guilty? 
</P>
<P>
The mystery here is mystery of the mind. We don't want to give away too much 
and spoil your enjoyment of a good ax murder, but as her defense counsel (Brian 
Dennehy) and her psychiatrist (Hal Holbrook) wend their way through Candy's 
psyche, they finally reach her most profound fears and unleash twisting, 
wrenching primal screams. As the sweet and raging Candy, a pleasant young wife 
and mother who sings in the church choir, Barbara Hershey delivers a 
multilayered performance of poignancy and pain that begs for a cascade of 
adjectives. 
</P>
<P>
The resolve is a mixed blessing. Candy believes she's a monster; the doctor 
assures her that she's just like the rest of us. Candy returns: "Is that 
supposed to comfort me?"IRV LETOFSKY

20TH-CENTURY SOVIET PROGRAM IN AYS SEASON FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Mehli Mehta had ended the 25th anniversary season of his American Youth 
Symphony on less than an invigorating, powerful and heartfelt note, he would 
have surprised a few of the faithful. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, the 81-year-old conductor didn't do either Sunday at Royce Hall, 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was that likely with a program of 20th-Century Soviets -- big-boned music 
of Prokofiev, Khachaturian and Shostakovich, the kind this orchestra trainer 
regularly gives his young charges with great success. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, he had the estimable solo talents of Armen Guzelimian for the 
piano concerto of the late Aram Khachaturian. 
</P>
<P>
And in an agenda that invited thoughts about the strife of people and nations 
responsible for great art, it was hard not to think of the Armenians' present 
struggle while hearing Guzelimian's soul-wrenching performance. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond his technical command of this full-fisted score, with fleetness and 
clarity principal virtues, the pianist was able to curtail bombast in favor of 
refinement -- without diminishing the full effect. 
</P>
<P>
He mined the Eastern motifs for all their distantly sad ruminations and found a 
percussive urgency free of clangor, a forward compulsion infected with 
emotional heat. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta and the orchestra were one with him. Earlier, they brought a skittering 
buoyancy to Prokofiev's "Classical" Symphony. And after intermission they 
turned to Shostakovich's mighty Fifth Symphony, detailing the epic sorrow and 
bitterness into which we now read the horrors of the Stalinist purges. 
</P>
<P>
Everything -- from an insinuating waltz to the pathos of the Largo to the 
furious, galvanizing energy of the finale -- was there. Mehta doesn't send his 
players or audiences home half-fed. DONNA PERLMUTTER

CRIBBS IS EXPECTED TO BE ASKED TO RESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hal Cribbs, executive secretary of the California Fish and Game Commission, 
said Monday that he will announce today whether he will resign or force the 
commission to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, it appears doubtful that Cribbs, 53, executive secretary since 
1979, will survive on the commission -- as he did when it moved to oust him in 
1987 for "meddling in legislative affairs," according to commissioner Albert 
Taucher of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The five commissioners, who are appointed to staggered six-year terms by the 
governor, have been criticized since the release in January of the Little 
Hoover Commission's report on the operation of the commission and the 
Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
After last Friday's monthly meeting at San Luis Obispo, Commission President 
Bob Bryant of Yuba City and commissioner Everett McCracken of Carmichael 
unofficially asked Cribbs for his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"All they told me was . . . the intent was to improve relationships with the 
Department (of Fish and Game) and the Legislature," Cribbs said. 
</P>
<P>
If he refuses to resign, the commission would have to call a special, public 
meeting to review his performance before firing him. 
</P>
<P>
Taucher was president in 1987 when the commission judged that Cribbs "was 
writing some bills and feeding information to certain legislators that was 
(privileged) information." 
</P>
<P>
However, several sportsmen's organizations came to Cribbs' defense, and the 
commission backed down. Taucher said Cribbs agreed to restrict his activities 
to commission business. 
</P>
<P>
"About a year ago, it became evident that he was still meddling in legislative 
affairs," Taucher said. "And when the Little Hoover Commission came out with 
what they did, and (with) the kinds of things the Legislature has been doing to 
us, it became apparent that Cribbs had to go." 
</P>
<P>
McCracken said pending legislation would sharply reduce the commission's 
influence. When he asked certain legislators about it, he said he was told: 
"You're not the problem. The problem is Mr. Cribbs." 
</P>
<P>
Cribbs said: "Since 1987 . . . everything that I have provided across the 
street (at the State Capitol) or been involved with across the street has been 
with the knowledge of at least Mr. Taucher and the president of the 
commission."

The Chicago Bulls, a one-man team in danger of losing their one man, got a 
little stronger Monday. Michael Jordan said he was 80-85% fit. 
</P>
<P>
Without Jordan, the Bulls, already trailing the best-of-seven Eastern 
Conference finals against Detroit, 1-0, would be 100% done. But his thumbs-up 
appraisal regarding his bruised left hip before practice lends hope for Chicago 
in Game 2 tonight at the Palace of Auburn Hills. 
</P>
<P>
How strong that hope should be remains to be seen. Air Jordan crash-landed with 
1 minute 36 seconds left in the first quarter of Sunday's Game 1, but played 
the rest of the half without an interruption of greatness: 26 points on nine of 
15 from the field, and a hanging double-pump jump shot from the top of 
three-point circle at the buzzer that gave the Bulls a 43-39 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The hip stiffened at halftime, and Jordan wasn't the same afterward. Not 
surprisingly, neither was Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Playing with an obvious limp, Jordan made three of 12 shots in the second half 
and scored only eight points. He had three points in the fourth quarter, and 
the Bulls lost, 86-77. Moreover, Jordan's defensive responsibility, Joe Dumars, 
trouble even for a mobile player, scored 18 of his 27 points in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's 77 points tied the Piston record for fewest allowed in a playoff 
game, done twice before including against the 1988 Bulls. Detroit shot 42.3% 
and still won. 
</P>
<P>
From almost the instant they beat Philadelphia in the second round, the Bulls 
were boasting about how the 1990 team had so much more depth than last year's, 
which lost to the Pistons in this same round. So far, it has been just talk. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, Scottie Pippen, with 16 points, was the only other Bull in 
double figures. The Piston bench outscored its Chicago counterpart, 27-12. The 
Bulls' top three reserves -- Stacey King, Craig Hodges and B.J. Armstrong -- 
made four of 14 shots.

USC, UCLA, Cal State Fullerton, UC Santa Barbara and Loyola Marymount were 
selected Monday as part of the 48-team field that will compete for the NCAA 
Division I baseball championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific 10 Southern Division has four teams -- Stanford, Arizona State, USC 
and UCLA -- in the double-elimination tournament, which begins Thursday and 
Friday at eight regional sites. Stanford and Arizona State each was seeded 
first in its regional. 
</P>
<P>
The regional champions will advance to the College World Series in Omaha, Neb., 
June 1-9. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic Coast Conference also has four in the tournament: North Carolina, 
Clemson, North Carolina State and Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State and Fresno State also were chosen. But Pepperdine (37-23), 
which was second to Loyola in the West Coast Conference, will miss the playoffs 
for the first time since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at the regular-season performance as well as the conference in 
making the decision," said Gene McArtor of the NCAA Baseball Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The eight top-seeded teams and the regional in which they will compete are: 
North Carolina, Northeast; Miami, Fla., Atlantic; Louisiana State, South I; 
Florida State, South II; Arkansas, Midwest; Texas, Central; Stanford, West I; 
and Arizona State, West II. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven-time national champion USC (37-20) meets Southern Mississippi (41-23) in 
the South I regional at Baton Rouge, La. UCLA (39-24) plays South Alabama 
(41-18) in the Midwest regional at Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (52-10) will face Campbell (15-31), champion of the Big South 
Conference, in a first-round game at Palo Alto. Fresno State (37-22) plays 
Southern Illinois (47-12) and San Diego State (46-20) meets Middle Tennessee 
State (42-13), also in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State (49-14) plays host to Pennsylvania (22-15), Loyola meets 
Washington State (46-17) and UCSB (40-20) plays Oklahoma State (49-16) at

PROGRAM BRINGS BASEBALL BACK TO INNER CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Young grew up in South Central Los Angeles at a time when youth baseball 
flourished in the inner city and youngsters such as Bob Watson, Bobby Tolan and 
Willie Crawford traveled from sandlot to sandlot perfecting their skills. 
</P>
<P>
"There were thousands of leagues," said Young, 41. "You'd play on two or three 
teams." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray, Ozzie Smith, Darryl Strawberry and Eric Davis all came through 
that same inner-city pipeline, which began drying up a few years ago as 
inner-city programs fell apart amid economic and organizational problems. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of youths having no place to play baseball saddened Young. 
</P>
<P>
And, fortunately for the old neighborhood, it finally spurred him into action. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in the area, so I feel I have a stake here," said Young, a scout for 
the Texas Rangers who attended Mt. Carmel High at 71st and Hoover streets, and 
went on to play at Chapman College and in the Detroit Tiger organization. Mt. 
Carmel has since closed. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Young and the Professional Baseball Scouts of Southern California 
launched a program that has brought baseball back to South Central Los Angeles. 
Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) provides youths with a free opportunity 
to improve their baseball skills and their futures. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to use baseball as a carrot to expose kids to other avenues that can 
help them in their lives," Young said. "My personal goal is to use all my 
resources in baseball to show these kids that, 'Hey, we can have a great 
baseball program in the city.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by a $50,000 grant from major league baseball and support from the 
Dodgers and Angels, the RBI program kicked off last year with 180 youths 
competing on 12 teams in a league for 13- and 14-year-olds at Harvard and 
Sutton parks. Jeff Shimizu, former Venice High baseball coach now at Santa 
Monica College, designed a class to train coaches and provided the program with 
six student counselors from the college. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Amateur Athletic Foundation provided RBI with $78,000, allowing 
the program to add a 15- and 16-year-old division and expand to Rancho Cienega 
Park. About 600 youths are participating in leagues that compete from May to 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, Murray, Hubie Brooks and Tony Gwynn other major league players have 
spoken to youths in the program, as have former youth league players who have 
established careers outside sports. 
</P>
<P>
"We like the ballplayers to come out and talk to them, but what we really want 
them to see are the people who might have played sports and are now successful 
in the real world," said Young, who lives in Diamond Bar. "As the program 
progressed, we saw this happening. Kids were saying, 'Well, I may not be able 
to hit 40 home runs, but I can go to school and be a doctor, a lawyer, an 
electrician or whatever.' " 
</P>
<P>
Young said he had the idea for RBI 15 years ago when he was scouting the South 
for the Detroit Tigers after finishing his playing career with the club. During 
his travels, Young bounced his ideas for RBI off scouts such as Joe McIlvaine, 
now vice president of the New York Mets, and Larry Doughty, the general manager 
for the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing came of the discussions, Young said, "until all of a sudden, 10 years 
had passed and I'm talking about it with a different group of guys." 
</P>
<P>
Young did a survey of the 1986 draft and found that 81% of the players who 
signed professional contracts were from four-year colleges. He then surveyed 
the rosters of four-year schools from San Diego to Fresno and found that fewer 
than 4% of the players were black and fewer than 3% were Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
Young told Roland Hemond, general manager of the Baltimore Orioles, about his 
findings and his idea for RBI. Hemond suggested contacting then-Commissioner 
Peter Ueberroth, who granted the program its initial funding. 
</P>
<P>
In August, RBI will hold its championship games at Dodger Stadium. After the 
season, 60 youths will be selected for an Academy of Excellence that will 
feature Saturday workouts with scouts and players, and meetings with academic 
counselors and professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception is that to have a good program, you have to go to the suburbs," 
Young said. "But I think we're showing people that it can be done right here if 
you get people who care involved."

The number of Oakland voters who have little or no interest in bringing the 
Raiders back from Los Angeles has increased slightly, to 63%, according to an 
Oakland Tribune-Gallup Poll. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, the total was 59%. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest poll, 46% of the respondents considered it "not at all important" 
to complete a new deal to bring back the Raiders, and 17% said it was "not too 
important," 14% said it was "very important" and 20% said it was "somewhat 
important." Only 3% had no opinion.

TEMPORARY INSANITY FOR WATHAN; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: KANSAS CITY MANAGER KEEPS SAYING HIS TEAM WILL SNAP OUT OF ITS 
DOLDRUMS ANY TIME NOW. HE'S STILL WAITING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
George Brett played right field for the Kansas City Royals Saturday for the 
first time in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a temporary thing," Royals Manager John Wathan explained patiently. It 
gets trying for a bright man having to explain these things so often, even if 
it is to himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not hurt; I'm no longer the second baseman," Frank White said, replaced in 
the box score by "Shmprt" after a long and distinguished career. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a temporary thing," Wathan explained. 
</P>
<P>
And Bo Jackson, who is no Willie Wilson in center field and has more errors (5) 
than home runs (4), played center. Wilson, the center fielder in the best of 
times, did not start -- day game after a night game -- but when Wilson played 
Friday night, he was in left field. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's all a temporary thing. It's too early in the season for a 
manager in such a stable organization to conclude it's too late in the careers 
of very good players. The most difficult decision a manager ever has to make is 
concluding when an outstanding player can't do it anymore. Brett, Wilson and 
White have been the heartbeat keeping the Royals in contention for nearly 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Those -- and the departed and lamented wit Dan Quisenberry -- are the players 
who made the organization decide that it was better to keep what it had than to 
shop the market. They got lifetime contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Then this team broke its own promise and went chest-deep into the free-agent 
market in order to get from last season's 92 wins to 100, or one more than 
Oakland. This is the team that plays in the smallest market in the major 
leagues but has the biggest payroll. It has 10 players being paid at least a 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing Kauffman bought controlling interest back from Avron Fogelman and now has 
put the team on the market. "If anybody has the finances to buy it," Wathan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
They added Mark Davis, last year's National League Cy Young whiz of the 
bullpen, to their own Cy Young winner, Bret Saberhagen. And added Storm Davis 
to Saberhagen and Mark Gubicza in the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Around the Royals, they tell the story of last week's game against the Boston 
Red Sox when Mark Davis relieved with the score 3-3 and the ever-patient 
hometown fans booed. Before the inning was closed, the Red Sox had a two-run 
lead and Davis had thrown his best fastball to first base, handcuffing Brett. 
</P>
<P>
"If he threw like that to the plate, he'd be unhittable," Brett said. 
</P>
<P>
And here they are with the worst record in the big leagues. Now Davis, who blew 
only four of 48 save opportunities last season for the San Diego Padres, 
already has blown four of 13 -- and although the two-run homer he gave up 
Saturday was not the losing blow, that dodges the point. Wathan has slid Davis 
back a half-notch to share the closing role. "It's a temporary thing," Wathan 
said. Of course. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a confidence thing," Wathan said. "He's trying to come over and 
prove he's worth the money. It plays on his mind. He's trying to do more than 
he's capable of, which is what got him that contract." 
</P>
<P>
Wathan admits to losing a little confidence in Davis as well. But that's a 
temporary thing. "He's still going to be in the same spots," the manager said. 
"It's a kind of feeling I have to have." 
</P>
<P>
Even Catfish Hunter, with the best credentials around, felt pressure to justify 
the money he got from the New York Yankees as the first of their free agents. 
Saberhagen said that he felt that after the first of his two Cy Youngs. 
</P>
<P>
Wathan anticipated some of this and wrote them all a letter in January warning 
them not to grab onto all of the hype. "Not like this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Who could believe this? Brett points out that if we'd all been in France 
drinking wine and eating and came home to read Sunday's paper, we'd ask, "Damn, 
what happened to the Royals?" And if the answer was that Mark Davis had pitched 
poorly, the other Davis is 1-4, and Saberhagen and Gubicza were a combined 4-7, 
the honesty of the reply would be questioned. "You'd say, 'Bull!"' Brett said. 
</P>
<P>
But then again, tunnel vision is the most natural thing for a hitter with Hall 
of Fame confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The manager must be all-seeing. "We haven't been swinging the way we're capable 
of; we haven't been pitching the way we're capable of," Wathan said. "If you 
don't do that, you're probably going to lose." The team earned-run average is 
12th out of 14 in the league; offensively, the team is 12th in scoring and last 
in home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Brett, the last major-leaguer to flirt seriously with .400, went into 
Saturday's game batting .229 and has yet to hit his first home run. It's been 
10 years since he hit .390. 
</P>
<P>
He's temporarily in right field because Gerald Perry is hitting a little bit, 
and he plays first base. "I've seen George off to slow starts; it's just a 
matter of time," Wathan said. "He hit .235 for the first half last year and 
over .300 the second half; he hit .285 and had 80 RBI." 
</P>
<P>
Except at some point they all stop. Bad years often begin with a bad six weeks, 
and careers usually end on bad years. "That's certainly not the case with him," 
Wathan said. "He's still got a lot more left. I know George; I know his swing." 
</P>
<P>
The Royals are in transition at just the wrong time. "It's the start (of the 
season)," Wathan said. "It's a long way to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
"The manager's job is to keep the guys pepped up, to fight things through," he 
said. Then he becomes a husband and father, he said. He does not take the 
losses home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the 1977 Royals won 15 in a row, lost one and won the next 10 
-- all in September. "Oakland might not win 100," he said. "Maybe 95 will take 
it. Maybe 92." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he makes the moves he says are temporary. "Who else you going to put 
out there?" Wathan said, meaning right field or second base or anywhere. "You 
go with the guys who got you here. There's only so many moves you can make." 
</P>
<P>
And then he had to be restrained after Terry Cooney called Steve Sax safe with 
the winning run in the 11th inning. One more loss not to take home.

THE USE OF LASIX WILL BE GENERATING MORE THAN A SUMMER SQUALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks before the Preakness, the results of a scientific study of Lasix had 
been made public and touched off controversy throughout the racing industry. 
Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania concluded that the drug doesn't 
prevent horses from bleeding, but that it does make them run faster. So with 
Summer Squall's impressive, Lasix-aided victory Saturday at Pimlico, it seems 
inevitable that he will be a focal point of the raging debate over this 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
And both sides may point to Summer Squall as a vindication of their positions. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall has a serious bleeding problem. He gushed blood from his nostrils 
after a workout in Florida this winter, and ever since that incident he has 
been given Lasix before races and hard workouts. On a few occasions, blood has 
trickled from his nostrils after routine morning gallops when he wasn't treated 
with the diuretic. 
</P>
<P>
When this happened the day before the Preakness, many witnesses were alarmed, 
but trainer Neil Howard assured them: 
</P>
<P>
"The Lasix will hold the bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
And it did. Without the medication, Summer Squall would have been at such risk 
in the Preakness that Howard wouldn't have let him run. With Lasix, he was able 
to finish powerfully and defeat Unbridled (another Lasix user) by 2 1/4 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of Howard and owner Cot Campbell, as well as the vast majority of 
trainers, owners and veterinarians in America, Summer Squall demonstrates why 
it would be senseless to ban the use of Lasix. This extraordinarily talented 
horse suffers from one specific physical problem, and there exists a medication 
that can remedy that problem. 
</P>
<P>
Why deny the horse this help, deny racing the presence of a top attraction, 
deny the owners who put so much money into this game the chance to make a 
profit? 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Summer Squall's record casts plenty of doubts on the University of 
Pennsylvania study. That study said Lasix had "questionable efficacy" for the 
prevention of bleeding. But even if the medication is not foolproof, virtually 
all practicing vets say it is generally effective. What better evidence could 
there be than Summer Squall? On Friday, without Lasix, he couldn't even gallop 
without bleeding; on Saturday, with Lasix, he could win the second-fastest 
Preakness in history with no ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell reaffirmed after the Preakness that Summer Squall would not run in the 
Belmont Stakes, since Lasix is not permitted in New York state. The little colt 
needs a rest, he said. He would return to competition this fall, the main 
objective to be the Breeders' Cup -- at Belmont Park. And that decision seems 
to expose the hollowness of the arguments of the pro-Lasix forces. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell and Howard feel that Summer Squall will be able to run effectively 
without medication if he is given a sufficient period of rest this summer. 
Indeed, rest has been the traditional prescription for horses who bleed in all 
the other countries of the world where medication is not permitted, and in the 
United States before Lasix was legalized in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
If that is the case, why wasn't Summer Squall given a long period of 
recuperation after he bled in Florida? Why aren't run-of-the-mill horses given 
rest instead of injections when they bleed? The answer, of course, is simple. 
Money. Most owners of thoroughbreds lose money anyway, and it is an expensive 
proposition to put a horse on the shelf for months when he will generate a pile 
of expenses but no income. How many of the anti-Lasix moralists, had they been 
members of the 28-man syndicate that owns Summer Squall, would have pleaded 
with Campbell, the syndicate manager: "Forget about the Kentucky Derby. Forget 
about the Preakness. Give this horse a rest." 
</P>
<P>
A more persuasive argument against Lasix -- and the more persuasive part of the 
University of Pennsylvania study -- is that it improves the performance of 
horses, even those who don't suffer from bleeding. Lasix is therefore being 
widely used -- and abused -- by trainers whose horses don't really need it. Did 
six of the nine Preakness starters really need Lasix? Was it for purely 
therapeutic reasons that 57 of the 84 horses who ran on the Pimlico program 
Saturday were treated with Lasix? These percentages exceed the most liberal 
estimates of the number of horses who suffer from pulmonary hemorrhage, and 
contribute to the almost universal belief among racing fans that Lasix is being 
abused. 
</P>
<P>
The Lasix dilemma is a difficult one for the thoroughbred industry because 
there are such strong arguments on each side of it. It is likely to remain a 
divisive issue for a long time, because each side seems immovable in its 
convictions. This is an issue about which nobody is neutral. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, though, it may not be the pros and cons of Lasix but public opinion 
that ultimately settles the argument. The Preakness may turn out to be one of 
the events that hardens that opinion. What did the average member of the 
television audience think of this sport when he heard that Summer Squall would 
skip the climactic event on the Triple Crown because he wouldn't be allowed to 
race with the aid of a drug? 
</P>
<P>
I asked Campbell after the Preakness what he thought the public's perception of 
this issue would be, and whether it might be injurious to the sport's image. He 
said: "I'm all for Lasix. As far as the public struggling with this problem, 
they'll have to struggle with it. I'm just elated about winning the Preakness." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the merits of Lasix, the racing industry cannot afford to take such a 
cavalier attitude toward the public perception that we are drugging horses so 
that they will be able to run.

HOW DO WE STOP 'SNEAKER KILLINGS'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GREENBERG, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Jordan grew up middle-class, in a small town in North Carolina. He grew 
up with parents who loved him, nurtured him. Parents who stayed married. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he became an NBA superstar and began reaping millions of dollars 
annually after signing with Nike, it never dawned on him that inner-city youths 
would rob and murder each other over the shoes he endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
But that's what's happening today in America's inner cities. And it happens not 
just to wearers of Air Jordans, it happens to wearers of many types of 
sneakers, jackets and Major League Baseball caps worn and endorsed by pro stars 
and their teams. 
</P>
<P>
It happens because sneakers are macho status symbols, and the shoe companies 
spend more than $200 million a year on seductive advertising aimed at 
impressionable kids. 
</P>
<P>
It happens because the top-of-the-line shoes are so expensive -- Reebok's 
"Pump" retails for $170, Nike Air Jordans for $115 -- that for some poor, 
desperate, directionless inner-city kids, the only way to get them seems to be 
through drug money or mugging. 
</P>
<P>
It happens because gangs, on whatever whim, often identify themselves by a 
certain brand of sneaker, jacket, cap. Rival gangs will kill you on sight for 
wearing those clothes, even if you're a non-gang member totally unaware of 
their significance. 
</P>
<P>
It happens because we live in a warped society that pays lip service to our 
concern for our fellow man, yet has done little to prevent the establishment of 
a permanent underclass in inner cities and isolated rural pockets, islands of 
misery where kids without love, adult guidance, money or hope are bombarded and 
influenced by the same glitzy TV programs and commercials that feed every 
viewer, regardless of purchasing power, a steady diet of flash and dash, status 
and luxury. Not having the money to buy something doesn't lessen a person's 
appetite for it. It just makes the craving stronger. 
</P>
<P>
But these sneaker killings, for want of a better term, have little to do with 
money, just status. Sneaker advertisers, ignoring the fact that more than 80 
percent of sneakers purchased in this country are not used for sport, claim 
that their commercials have to do with sports, not status. They say they are 
appalled that kids kill each other over their product. 
</P>
<P>
But some people who run sporting goods stores, especially in the inner city, 
say that carrying certain brands attracts gangs. And that some of their best 
customers make their purchases with drug money. And that any shoe company 
spokesperson who claims not to know that drug money is fueling this $5.5 
billion domestic industry (1990 projection for U.S. sales) has his head in the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
How can the proprietor tell what's drug money and what isn't? If a kid comes in 
with a 3-inch wad of bills, buys 30 pairs of sneakers in 10 minutes and pays 
without waiting for change, you can be fairly certain he's not outfitting the 
local Little League. 
</P>
<P>
In its May 14 cover story, "Your Sneakers Or Your Life," Sports Illustrated 
reported that Wally Grigo, who owns three sportswear shops in and around New 
Haven, Conn., put a sign in his window last August that read: "If you deal 
drugs, we don't want your business. Spend your money somewhere else." Grigo 
told SI he figured putting up the sign has cost him $2,000 a week in drug money 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Who's at fault? What can be done to stop the horror of a human life being 
snuffed out for a pair of shoes? Failing that, what small steps can be taken to 
lessen its frequency? This has been a hot topic of conversation among sports 
writers in almost every press room I've visited the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
At first, our discussions centered on the advertising superstar, Jordan. As 
perhaps the most popular sports hero in our nation, a man who takes pride in 
being a role model for youth, a man who makes millions of dollars a year from 
Nike, should he take a moral stand and tell the shoe company he will only 
endorse a much cheaper model of the shoe? Should he make a public service 
announcement telling drug dealers: "Don't buy my shoes"? Should he stop 
endorsing the product? 
</P>
<P>
Jordan is greatly disturbed by the sneaker killings, and by being linked to 
them, however insanely and indirectly, because he represents Nike. And, yes, he 
could do one or all of the above things, and some people -- me included -- 
would lionize him. 
</P>
<P>
But why should a black athlete like Jordan be held to a higher standard than a 
white athlete? That's racist. You can make a case that John McEnroe's spoiled 
brat behavior on the tennis court was a bad example for a generation of young 
players. But Jordan is a shining example. Neither he nor any athlete-endorser 
has anything to do with kids killing each other over sneakers, jackets or caps. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, sometimes, there is no rhyme or reason to what shoes or sporting 
equipment are "hot." SI interviewed one manager of a Chicago Foot Locker Store 
whose hottest shoe was a $39 brand that he said had been around for 20 years. 
Who can predict fashion fads?

DUMPED BY U.S. TEAM GABARRA TURNS FOCUS TO MISL CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The call was more of a relief than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gabarra, a forward on the Sockers, suspected his days with the United 
States national team were numbered when Coach Bob Gansler didn't renew his 
contract this past December. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to be optimistic, but it was difficult. A lot of times, he'd stay up 
at night thinking about how many hours he had practiced since joining the team 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It's every soccer player's dream to play for the World Cup. How could a guy who 
was on the field for seven of the nine qualifying games be cut? All this work 
so a young kid could come in and take his place at the last minute? 
</P>
<P>
And then it finally happened. Gansler phoned Gabarra last week and told him he 
was dropping him from the team. The wondering was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been bummed out from mid December until last week," said Gabarra, a 
member of the 1988 U.S. Olympic team. "Finally, I thought 'I don't have to keep 
my hopes up any more.' 
</P>
<P>
"You think of all the nasty things you want to say. When you come right down to 
it, you figure it's better not to say anything. What are you going to say? It's 
his decision to make." 
</P>
<P>
It made Gabarra glad he decided to sign during preseason with the Sockers, who 
are tied, 2-2, with the Dallas Sidekicks entering Game 5 of the Western 
Division finals at 7:35 tonight in the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be out of work if I hadn't signed with San Diego," Gabarra said. "I'm 
grateful for that." 
</P>
<P>
The explanation for Gabarra's dismissal is fairly simple. Gansler said he did 
what was best for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt that we gave him ample opportunity to crack that starting lineup 
last year," he said. "I don't think it makes good sense to have veteran players 
on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
Gabarra is 30, and his replacements are in their early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel badly for Jim because he's an exceptional young guy," Gansler said. 
"But in this game, he's not that young." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman is found of saying that he can't play someone on the 
basis of his clipping file. Yesterday's goals don't win today's games. And 
telling a player it's time to move on is part of coaching. The hard part. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly not something that I relish," Gansler said. "If it were a 
matter of keeping my favorite players, Jim would certainly be part of the team. 
But only 22 can be happy. That's the limit." 
</P>
<P>
So now Gabarra plans to channel his efforts into helping the Sockers win a 
Major Indoor Soccer League championship, which he said would soothe the sting 
of having to watch the World Cup on television. Though far from a high-profile 
player, Gabarra finds ways to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
A better compliment he couldn't receive than the one offered by team captain 
Brian Quinn, who says: "Jimmy's kind of similar to myself. He's a jack of all 
trades. We fill a void, helping the defense and the offense. It's important to 
have players like him. Wherever he's asked to play, he does a commendable job." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, he has filled in as a defender, helping compensate for injuries to 
Cacho, Kevin Crow and Don Cogsville. But undoubtedly, his true strength is his 
shot, which he unloaded unmercifully on the Sidekicks during the Sockers' 4-2 
victory Sunday. His 25-footer in the first quarter traveled between his right 
foot and the upper left corner of the goal in about the time it takes to say: 
"Wow." 
</P>
<P>
"I just made up my mind I was going to hit it hard and on target," Gabarra 
said. "I looked up and it was already in. It's a nice feeling. I haven't been 
getting too many shots off." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Gabarra's statistics are modest. He had 10 goals and eight assists 
in 42 regular season games and two goals and two assists in eight playoff 
games. But he does the kind of things that are noticed more by his teammates 
than fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, in this league, a player can do a lot of things but get very 
little recognition," midfielder Waad Hirmez said. "I think he fits in that 
category." 
</P>
<P>
Gabarra is realistic about what is within his capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have skills like Branko (Segota) or Quinny," he says, "but I work 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers have no new injuries. Defender Kevin Crow will play with an 
abdominal strain. Midfielder Waad Hirmez, who is still experiencing soreness in 
his left hamstring and didn't scrimmage in practice Monday, is also expected to 
play. . . . Hirmez became the Sockers' all-time playoff game-winning goal 
scorer with eight on Sunday when he connected on a 25-footer in the third 
quarter. That put him ahead of Branko Segota, Jean Willrich and Brian Quinn . . 
. Sunday's attendance of 6,422 was the third smallest in Socker playoff 
history. The two previous lowest were Games 1 and 2 of the Western Division 
semifinals against St. Louis . . . Victor Nogueira (1-2, 2.96 goals-against 
average) will start if Coach Ron Newman sticks with his rotation. Joe Papaleo 
(1-1, 2.06 GAA) is likely to start for Dallas.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: AZTECS OPEN AGAINST MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having won the Western Athletic Conference championship Saturday in Hawaii, the 
San Diego State baseball team learned Monday it will open NCAA tournament play 
at 9 a.m. Thursday against Middle Tennessee State (42-13) in the West I 
Regional at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (46-20), winners of 13 consecutive games, are seeded third. 
</P>
<P>
Middle Tennessee State, champion of the Ohio Valley Conference, is seeded 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy to see us seeded third," SDSU baseball coach Jim Dietz said. 
"We'll be the home team over (three) teams no matter what happens. Only two 
schools will be home over us, and that's an advantage in a six-team 
double-elimination tournament. That says a lot for this team." 
</P>
<P>
Dietz and his assistants will be scrambling to put together a scouting report 
on Middle Tennessee State. 
</P>
<P>
"I just know they're from Tennessee, and I know they went 14-0 in their 
conference," he said. "I imagine they'll be a very good team." 
</P>
<P>
Other first-round games in the West I Regional Thursday: second-seeded Southern 
Illinois (47-12) vs. fifth-seeded Fresno State (37-22) and top-seeded Stanford 
(52-10) vs. sixth-seeded Campbell (15-31). 
</P>
<P>
If the Aztecs win Thursday, they will play the Stanford-Campbell loser at 12:30 
p.m. Friday. If the Aztecs lose Thursday, they will play the Southern 
Illinois-Fresno State loser at 9 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Point Loma Nazarene College's Shannon Anderson advanced to the third round of 
the NAIA women's championships with a 7-5, 6-4 victory over Kelly Nawroth of 
Baker College (Kan.). Kim Wright and Dion Shillito of PLNC won their first 
round matches but lost in the second round.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: PASTA PARTY AND TRIP TO NCAA FOR UCSD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LUNDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pasta party at Shannon Quigley's apartment broke up around 8:30 Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Quigley and guests are UC San Diego track and field athletes. They were 
scheduled to leave for the NCAA Division III national meet in Naperville, Ill., 
early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Quigley is the veteran of the group -- having been to the nationals the past 
two years. She won the shot put and the discus last year, and has a good shot 
to do so again this year. 
</P>
<P>
But for most of the other athletes, this will be their first national meet. Two 
years ago, Quigley was the only Triton in the nationals. Last year, she was 
accompanied by three others. 
</P>
<P>
This year, UCSD is sending an all-time high 13 athletes (10 women, 3 men). 
</P>
<P>
The party at Quigley's was a traditional, team-bonding thing. But it was also a 
chance for Quigley to share her national meet experiences and her thoughts 
about what the others could expect. 
</P>
<P>
After all, right up there with competitive throwing, sharing words is what 
Quigley does best. 
</P>
<P>
She's a self-described free spirit, who's known to wear tie-dyed T-shirts and 
drive a 1968 Volkswagen van with bumper stickers about peace and love making do 
as a paint job. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a '90s hippie," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The van's as old as her and has 205,000 miles on it. The odometer just clicked 
over for the second time, and now reads 5,000. "It's sort of like having a new 
car," she joked. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually right now it's broken down. But my brother has a van that I use. It 
doesn't have a roof, though. It's a giraffe carrier." 
</P>
<P>
Quigley is a literature writing major. She wants to be a writer, but not a 
sportswriter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too dense," she said. "I'm much more descriptive." 
</P>
<P>
What does all this have to do with track and field? Well, nothing and 
everything according to Quigley. 
</P>
<P>
She believes that because of the individuality of the sport, the individual 
must come out in a person for them to perform at an optimum level. 
</P>
<P>
She is living proof. 
</P>
<P>
Add Quigley: Shortly after a feature story on Quigley ran in The Times around 
this time last year, she got a rather unusual fan letter. 
</P>
<P>
It was from a local inmate who had read the story and took a liking to Quigley. 
He said he didn't have much to read in prison, and would she mind writing him 
back? 
</P>
<P>
"He sounded like a really nice, lonely guy," Quigley said. "I think he was in 
for embezzlement. I wrote him back a couple of times." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Quigley: UCSD has two other shot putters who figure to push Quigley in 
the national meet -- Shelly Squibb and Rachel Beerman. 
</P>
<P>
Beerman's brother is also on the team, and he is often referred to as Beerboy. 
When their parents come to town, they are Beermom and Beerdad. 
</P>
<P>
California Community College champions: Grossmont College won the women's 
tennis state title for the second time with a 5-1 victory over Chabot over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In track and field, Steve Kellogg of Mesa College won the hammer throw at the 
state meet Saturday at Santa Barbara. His throw of 184-feet-6 was 15-10 farther 
than the next best. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Chase of Grossmont won the pole vault at 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Crawford of Southwestern was second in both the shot put and discus, and 
Lafrania West of Grossmont was second and fifth in the triple jump and high 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
No small feat: In a recent 3-1 victory over the University of San Diego, San 
Diego State's Rick Navarro pitched a three-hitter. Lou Skertich, who pitched 
seven innings, and Tom Cheek allowed seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro is 5-feet-9. Both Skertich and Cheek are 5-8. Who says pitchers have to 
be tall to make it in college ball? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say the little guys did a big job tonight," Cheek said. 
</P>
<P>
As they have all season. Navarro is 9-3 with a 2.64 earned run average. 
Skertich (6-7) led USD with a 3.84 ERA, and Cheek led the West Coast Conference 
with seven saves and a 2.53 ERA in conference games.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No. 1 Grossmont, which received the top seed in the 2-A division for the San 
Diego Section baseball playoffs, will be host to La Jolla today. La Jolla 
(13-12, 5-7) finished third in the City Western League. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont (25-2, 8-0) is led by Todd Cady, who broke the San Diego Section 
record for runs batted in in a season two weeks ago. Cady, Grossmont's catcher, 
has a .441 average, 57 RBIs and eight home runs. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 USDHS (24-4) will play Clairemont (16-12) at USDHS. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A division, top-seeded Poway (19-6-1) will play Southwest (13-13) at 
Poway. No. 2 Helix (18-8-1) will be host to Mira Mesa (18-7). 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista (21-5), which received the top-seed in the 3-A division 
softball tournament, will be host to Granite Hills (13-9) in the 3-A 
quarterfinals of the Section playoffs today. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A, top-seeded Madison (25-3) will play Carlsbad (12-11) at Madison. 
</P>
<P>
Julian's Travis Denmark, the county's leading hitter was intentionally walked 
three times against Mountain Empire last Wednesday. In the third inning, he hit 
a two-run homer to give Julian a 4-3 lead. Julian (16-5, 9-2), winner of the 
Coastal League championship, won the game, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Denmark, who has hit 13 home runs, stuck out nine, giving him 130 strikeouts 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
With a bye this week, Patrick Henry baseball Coach Bob Imlay was free to travel 
to Chino for the qualifying tournament of the California Amateur Golf 
Tournament, which will be held this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Imlay had a two-day total of 142 to finish tied for fourth, which easily 
qualified him.

Vista Coach Butch Smith must be resigned to having already played his team's 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
"Our game against Mt. Carmel was our CIF championship," Smith said. "We thought 
if we won that, we would automatically get a berth into the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Although Vista won, 6-3, the Panthers did not receive a playoff bid. 
</P>
<P>
Vista finished fifth in the Palomar League with a 6-7-1 record, 12-16-1 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a tough league," Smith said. "Look at Torrey Pines." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines finished 12-16, 3-11, but won the Lions 2-A Tournament in the 
middle of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista Coach Steve Hargrave is breathing a sigh of relief. One of 
his better hitters, Chris Gorr, was hit on the top of the hand by Poway pitcher 
Danny Miller last week. Miller's pitches had been clocked in the mid-80s during 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays showed that Gorr suffered just a bruise. 
</P>
<P>
"That's good news. It would have been tough going into the playoffs without our 
No. 5 hitter who's hitting around .400," Hargrave said. "I thought it was 
broke. I heard that sound."

ROMANIA VOTE CALLED VALID DESPITE FLAWS 
</P>

BUCHAREST, Romania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Salvation Front unfairly dominated Romania's election campaign, 
and its supporters stuffed ballot boxes, stumped at the polls and intimidated 
voters, but the results of Sunday's vote should nevertheless be accepted as 
valid, foreign observers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The front and its presidential candidate, Ion Iliescu, are expected to post a 
resounding victory once the protracted ballot-counting is concluded, which 
election officials now say may be as late as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders cried foul a day after Romania's first multi-party election 
since 1937, deeming the front-dominated campaign to be a mockery of the 
democratic process. But representatives of U.S. and European observers who 
fanned out across Romania to watch Sunday's vote appeared to excuse most of the 
suspect incidents as isolated and likely to be irrelevant to the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"Romanians have taken a very giant step toward democracy," said New Mexico's 
Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers, who headed a six-person team observing the vote on 
behalf of the White House. "In our view it was a proper election." 
</P>
<P>
He said that numerous irregularities were reported to the presidential 
delegation but that the delegation failed to spot any "obvious, systematic 
fraud." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the Romanian 
election appeared to be "free, peaceful and enthusiastic" despite a campaign 
that he described as "flawed." 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important beginning for Romania," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reading an official Bush Administration assessment, Boucher said: "Election-day 
activities were peaceful. Voter turnout on election day was heavy. . . . We 
note that problems with voting and other election-day irregularities appear to 
have been minimal, although opposition political party leaders have complained 
of breaches of election law procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the election campaign was flawed, as we and others have noted," he 
said, citing "lack of access to the media and intimidation of opposition 
candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said no decisions have been made yet about whether the United States 
will extend economic aid to the new Romanian regime. 
</P>
<P>
A 60-member international observer force put together by the U.S. National 
Democratic Institute and its Republican counterpart was more critical of the 
Romanian vote but likewise said that the final outcome "deserves our respect." 
</P>
<P>
"Any judgment on the Romanian elections, the first multi-party electoral 
contests in nearly half a century, must take into account the national trauma 
inflicted on the people of Romania by decades of brutal Communist 
dictatorships," Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The group's report accused the interim government, which is controlled by the 
front, of failing to "promptly and vigorously condemn incidents of 
intimidation, including attacks on opposition candidates and party activists." 
</P>
<P>
Ballot box-stuffing was reported from several precincts, and the observers 
presented one ballot that they obtained from a voter that had been stamped in 
advance in favor of the front. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a politician, and I know a greased election when I see it," said Los 
Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who visited 40 polling places in and 
around Timisoara, the city where the bloody revolt against dictator Nicolae 
Ceausescu began last December. 
</P>
<P>
Thugs identified by local residents as former members of the Securitate were 
seen hanging around some rural polling places, said Austria's Andreas Kohl, who 
led a European Parliament delegation to observe the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers attributed voting violations such as campaigning outside the 
polling place or election committee workers entering the booth with elderly or 
infirm voters to ignorance of the democratic process and Romania's new election 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Voters had 88 parties to contend with, and in many districts there were three- 
or four-hour waits to cast ballots. Turnout was estimated at about 90% of 
Romania's eligible voters, a figure Central Election Bureau officials have yet 
to settle on. The election-monitoring board said two weeks ago that 17.8 
million Romanians were of voting age but dropped that estimate to 15.7 million 
over the weekend, then boosted it to 16.8 million Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite installation of a nationwide computer system to assist in compiling the 
vote count, only a sliver of the vote had been tabulated a full day after the 
polls closed. 
</P>
<P>
An exit poll conducted by the West German INFAS firm, the only national 
forecast available Monday, gave 83% of the presidential vote to Iliescu and 
two-thirds of the 506 parliamentary seats to the front. 
</P>
<P>
The sparse returns trickling into Bucharest from the provinces tended to 
support the exit poll's predictions. With about 15% of the presidential ballot 
counted, Iliescu had 89% of the vote, according to the Central Election Bureau. 
However, the vote is expected to vary widely among precincts, and opinion 
surveys are unreliable in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Front candidates maintained a low profile, with Iliescu declining to comment on 
the West German forecast even to the state news agency, Rompress. 
</P>
<P>
His opponents were quick to denounce the ballot and its projected outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"The elections should be declared null and void, a violation of democracy," 
said an outraged Ion Ratiu, the millionaire emigre who returned earlier this 
year to mount a presidential campaign under the banner of the newly 
reconstituted National Peasants Party. 
</P>
<P>
He later played a videotape for journalists that showed campaign workers 
assisting some rural voters inside the voting booth, a violation of the 
election law, and a shipment of ballot boxes in the hands of front supporters 
that were intercepted by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Ratiu said he will challenge the election outcome in court if the final figures 
tally with the INFAS projection, which reported only 6% support for the 
73-year-old candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"I find the results exaggerated, monstrously so," the Liberal Party's 
presidential candidate, Radu Campeanu, said of the poll that gave him 11% 
support. "They remind me of the returns in Ceausescu's time." 
</P>
<P>
The front took power after Ceausescu was toppled Dec. 22 and executed Dec. 25. 
The image of Iliescu waving to crowds of revolutionaries from the corner 
balconies of the charred and bullet-riddled buildings facing the revolution's 
central battleground was likely a major boon for his campaign. Ratiu and 
Campeanu were both still living abroad when Ceausescu was overthrown.

CALIFORNIA'S GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES AGREE THAT SCHOOLS NEED HELP. EDUCATION 
OFFICIALS SAY THAT'S PROGRESS -- EVEN IF NO ONE HAS SET OUT ANY DETAILED PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Shortly after formally declaring himself a candidate for governor, Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp, dressed in his green sweater, jeans and white sneakers, 
was standing at Lover's Point in Monterey and touting his support for "Big 
Green," the environmental initiative on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Then somebody asked what he believed was the state's most pressing issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always said that education would be my first priority as governor. 
California's schools are not as good as they should be, and we must do 
everything we can to change that," Van de Kamp replied. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, his rival for the Democratic nomination in the June 5 primary, former 
San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, had told the California Assn. of School 
Administrators that she planned to use the governor's office as a "bully 
pulpit" for education. She said education would be "a visible and active 
priority of my administration." 
</P>
<P>
And Sen. Pete Wilson, the expected Republican nominee, had devoted the first 
major policy statement of his campaign to a call for state-paid prenatal care, 
universal preschool and the linking of local social services with the public 
schools to ease the problems that hinder many students' achievement. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three major candidates has come up so far with a detailed, 
comprehensive approach to fixing the state's struggling system of public 
schools. Nor has any of them added much to their initial offerings. Yet just 
their interest in the subject, along with the handful of proposals they've 
offered, has raised hopes among education advocates who say the state's schools 
have suffered from a quarter-century of gubernatorial disinterest. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't yet displayed for us a comprehensive plan that shows they know 
how big (the education problem) is, but at least they know it's there. And 
we're delighted that each of them is groping," said James W. Guthrie, a UC 
Berkeley education professor and a co-director of Policy Analysis for 
California Education, a nonpartisan, privately funded educational research 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a major funding increase during his first term, Gov. George Deukmejian 
has "abandoned the field, absolved himself of setting education policy," said 
Guthrie, in a common criticism that has been disputed by the Deukmejian 
Administration. Guthrie said he expects to see improved leadership in education 
no matter who is elected in November's general election. 
</P>
<P>
Would-be rescuers of the state's school system have formidable dragons to tame: 
explosive growth in the school-age population; escalating diversity among 
students, including more minorities with a limited command of English and more 
poor children, and limits on taxing and spending. 
</P>
<P>
Yet pressure to improve student achievement continues to mount, and ideas for 
fixing the system abound. Among those gathering steam are proposals to expand 
early childhood education by offering preschool programs to all 4-year-olds (a 
favorite of Feinstein's); improving teacher recruitment and retention 
(including a proposal by Van de Kamp), and devising ways to help children 
overcome the poverty, medical or family problems that pose barriers to 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
Other ideas likely to be part of the debate to revamp education include 
allowing parents to choose which public schools their children will attend, and 
reorganizing schools to allow greater independence and to give more say to 
teachers and parents. The search will continue for ways to further curb the 
state's 20.4% dropout rate and to improve teaching, especially in the areas of 
science, math and technology. And there will be a push to improve results for a 
wider range of students, including those entering the work force after high 
school graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these ideas are already being tried in several of California's schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Richmond Unified School District in the Bay Area, for example, is 
converting all its schools into specialty campuses and allowing parents to 
decide which one to send their children to. But without district-paid 
transportation, many of the community's parents find they must as a practical 
matter settle for the school closest to home. 
</P>
<P>
State-paid anti-dropout programs, which include a special counselor to work 
with faltering students, are under way at about 200 schools around the state. 
</P>
<P>
Six districts, including Alhambra City and High School District, are using 
$500,000 annual state grants and working with research and business partners to 
devise ways to better use technology in the classroom and prepare students to 
work in an increasingly sophisticated environment. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra's Emery Park Elementary School, wanting to give its pupils every 
chance to use computers, installed them in the hallways as well as in 
classrooms. And a school in the Northern California community of Cupertino has 
abolished its traditional science lab in favor of a high-tech array of textbook 
supplements -- videodisc player, computer, video camera -- that encourage 
students to learn together in small groups. 
</P>
<P>
The quest for improvements in California's schools has been led primarily by 
state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig and a handful of legislators, 
notably Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), 
Assemblywoman Teresa P. Hughes (D-Los Angeles) and, more recently, Sen. Becky 
Morgan (R-Los Altos). 
</P>
<P>
Honig, though not without critics, is widely credited with pushing education 
needs and issues higher up on the state's agenda, bringing an improved, tougher 
curriculum to the schools and helping raise students' standardized test scores. 
And his "summit" of 300 educators, legislators and business and community 
leaders in December resulted in a detailed consensus for further reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Although the schools have improved measureably since better financing and a 
series of curriculum changes began in 1983, they still aren't nearly good 
enough -- and further improvement will be hard to come by, concluded a recent 
PACE report, "Conditions of Education in California." 
</P>
<P>
The report estimated the state will need to spend an additional $20 billion in 
this decade just to maintain current service levels. It will need at least 
another $1 billion per year over the next 10 years to build enough classrooms 
to accommodate the new students, and must hire 46,000 new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Department of Education, California's class sizes already 
are the highest in the nation. And in the amount of per-pupil spending, it now 
ranks 31st, well below other big industrial states. 
</P>
<P>
Michael W. Kirst, a Stanford University education professor and another 
co-director of PACE, said the main challenge is figuring how to "finance, 
accommodate and adjust to the growth and rapid diversifying of the pupils and 
at the same time improve the quality of the system. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a major job to provide space and teachers for all the students . . . 
just keeping the system at status quo is a big undertaking in and of itself. 
How to build quality on top of that is a difficult challenge." 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Finance, citing a booming birthrate and the biggest 
wave of immigration to this state since 1964, recently predicted enrollment 
increases in kindergarten through 12th grade of at least 184,000 a year over 
the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
That will push total enrollment, now about 4.6 million, well past the 5 million 
mark by mid-decade and require up to $13.7 billion for new schools and other 
facilities, the state Department of Education estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Even if voters approve June and November school bond ballot measures totaling 
$1.6 billion, there won't be nearly enough money to build all the needed 
classrooms. "There is just no way under the current (financing) system that we 
can meet the needs," said Duwayne Brooks, the education department's director 
of school facilities planning. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage is almost sure to accelerate the switch to year-round operation of 
schools, despite many parents' resistance to abandoning the traditional long 
summer vacation. By staggering the vacation periods of its students so that a 
portion of the student body is always "off track," a school can make room for 
more pupils. 
</P>
<P>
Both Honig and Deukmejian have advocated year-round operation as a way to 
maximize use of classroom space. And Charles Ballinger, executive director of 
the National Assn. for Year-Round Education, said he expects "most schools in 
California to be year-round . . . by the end of the decade." 
</P>
<P>
Even some of those districts that aren't short on classroom space will make the 
change for other reasons -- to reduce the loss of learning that occurs over a 
long vacation period or to align themselves with neighboring districts' 
schedules, Ballinger predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Already comprising more than 52% of the state's kindergarten through 12th-grade 
enrollment, minority students in California will continue to outstrip Anglos, 
the education department projects. Because many of these new students will be 
recent immigrants -- especially from Latin American and Asian countries -- 
larger numbers of students will come to school with limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, there will be nearly 1 million such students in what is 
already the nation's most ethnically diverse state, a department task force 
reported earlier this month. Their numbers will exacerbate an already acute 
shortage of bilingual teachers. The state has little more than half the 20,000 
it needs to help the current 750,000 such students (16% of all pupils) gain 
fluency in English, the task force found. 
</P>
<P>
Other challenges include the continuing "professionalization" of teachers, in 
essence giving them more decision-making authority and providing ways to 
enhance their skills throughout their careers. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling Los Angeles Unified School District has already embarked on an 
ambitious, teacher-driven remaking of its schools. Seventy of its campuses, 
ranging from Jordan High in Watts to Marquez Elementary in Pacific Palisades, 
are redesigning curriculum, adding new programs or reorganizing teaching 
assignments or even the school day to better reach their own students. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Kirst said one of the greatest needs is to ready both new and 
continuing faculty members to teach the state's new, well-regarded curriculum, 
especially in math and science. 
</P>
<P>
Take science, for instance. "Here we have this excellent new framework," Kirst 
said, "and we have teachers who are eager to teach it but just don't know how 
to. Most will get just one or two days of in-service training. I had one 
teacher tell me, 'All they did was tantalize me.' 
</P>
<P>
"We need to go back to summer-long (teaching training) programs like we did in 
the late '50s and '60s, after Sputnik went up." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Hart, a former teacher, has shepherded much of the major schools 
legislation in his role as chairman of the Senate Education Committee. While 
encouraged by some signs of progress, including rising test scores, Hart said 
the system still "is not working . . . for the vast majority of children." 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in a kind of reform mode for a number of years now," said Hart, 
citing the infusion of money and tougher standards that came in 1983 and again 
in 1988, when voters, through Proposition 98, agreed to give schools a bigger 
slice of the state tax pie in exchange for better accountability. 
</P>
<P>
"Those reforms did some very good things, especially for the middle-class, 
college-bound kids. That is all to the good," Hart said, "but our problem is 
that for those kids who are not part of that, we're not succeeding. All of this 
money and all of these reforms have not made much of a dent for many of our 
kids, largely minority students in urban areas." 
</P>
<P>
That phenomenon can only aggravate a trend social scientists have been warning 
about -- that California is increasingly becoming a two-tiered society peopled 
with smaller numbers of affluent, well-educated homeowners and growing legions 
of unskilled poor who are barely squeaking by. 
</P>
<P>
Besides handling student growth and diversity and finding ways to effectively 
teach the new curriculum, educators and others will be looking for ways to 
reorganize schools to make them more effective for a greater proportion of 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Hart is pushing for legislation that would enable selected schools to 
dramatically revise their educational programs in hopes of becoming models for 
others. Included would be ways to begin Head Start-like programs for 
preschoolers, improve technological education, expand teacher and parent 
participation and authority in making decisions about their schools, and 
formulate a wider range of post-high school alternatives for 11th- and 
12th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
The California Business Roundtable, which helped design the legislation out of 
a growing concern that the schools are not producing an able, competitive work 
force, is pushing hard for the bill, which enjoys widespread support. But its 
price tag -- $7.5 million in the first year and $50 million a year for five 
years after that -- has proved to be a formidable hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
Hart acknowledges the bill will be a hard sell this year, given the state's 
flat economy and the keen competition for tight tax dollars. Yet, he argues, it 
must be done. 
</P>
<P>
"We invest $22 billion a year in education in California. Spending $50 million 
a year to try to set up a way of changing a system that isn't working seems to 
be such a minuscule investment in reform that we're crazy not to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The state's complicated system of financing its public schools hampers further 
efforts at change. Like cities and counties, boards of education are limited by 
the local tax constraints imposed by the Proposition 13 in 1978 and by the 
so-called Gann Initiative of 1979, which set spending limits on state and local 
governments. A lengthy and complicated suit over local school finances, Serrano 
vs. Priest, ultimately resulted in the state collecting school tax dollars and 
redistributing them to equalize spending among richer and poorer districts. 
</P>
<P>
The California Lottery, pushed by supporters as a way to funnel more money to 
the schools, has barely made a dent -- it generates only about 3% of total 
revenues. And because the amount, 34% of all lottery proceeds, fluctuates 
widely from year to year, school districts and colleges are warned not to count 
on it and to spend it only for "extras" instead of such fixed costs as 
salaries. Since voters approved the Lottery in 1984, its annual, per-student 
payoff to schools has ranged from $89 to $178.64, according to EdSource, a 
Menlo Park-based organization that provides information on the state's school 
finance system. 
</P>
<P>
Other recent infusions of funds have come without significant changes in the 
finance system and have been closely related to the health of the state's 
economy. Proposition 108 on the June ballot would maintain Proposition 98's 
guarantee of a minimum set portion of the state's budget for schools and 
community colleges. And Proposition 111 would ease the state government's 
spending limit -- but it would not do away with it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Schools chief Honig believes the ticket to further improvement lies mainly in 
expanding on the reforms begun in the '80s, along with well-chosen 
"investments" of tax dollars in proven programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our game plan is pretty much in place," Honig said. "Of all the areas of 
government, K-12 education has put more thought and worked harder on getting 
agreement as to where we are going in the next 10 years. We have agreement on 
the fundamentals -- building on the gains we're making in test scores, getting 
kids to take tougher courses, the new frameworks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've proven this stuff works. . . . The future is to build on what 
we've done." 
</P>
<P>
But there are many who feel that is simply not enough. 
</P>
<P>
PACE, for example, recently proposed a 10-point "Marshall Plan" for schools 
that includes many of the reform proposals currently being touted as well as a 
call for the return of local funding authority. It also called for a task force 
of legislators, business representatives, educators and others to find 
comprehensive solutions and to build broad-based, highly visible support for 
improving the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We need money, a plan, stability, but most of all we need leadership," said UC 
Berkeley's Guthrie. And he and others look to the governor's office for that. 
</P>
<P>
"We've not had people working on bits and pieces (of the schools' problems), 
but we've had no overarching leadership at this point . . . and that has to 
come from a governor," said Stanford's Kirst. 
</P>
<P>
"In other states with a significant reform movement, it has been led by the 
governor," agreed state Sen. Hart. "The irony is that during the Deukmejian 
years there has been a significant increase in funding (for schools), but there 
has not been any kind of hands-on involvement in trying to see that those 
dollars are maximized, no bringing together (by the governor) of key leaders to 
try to fashion some agenda for California." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Hart is quick to point out that the two previous governors did not show 
much interest in the schools, either. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the government-bashing tenure of then-Gov Ronald Reagan began in the 
late 1960s, California has lacked a chief executive who made the state's system 
of public education a top priority for his administration. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many educators and even some politicians complain that no one has 
provided the strong, consistent leadership needed during a time of enormous 
growth, rapidly changing students and vast changes in the means of paying for 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts have been too fragmented," Hart said. "Remaking the system so that 
it is workable is an enormous challenge. It needs something quite different 
from a new program here, or a little more money there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CANDIDATES' PLANS FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the education programs proposed so far by the three major candidates 
for governor: 
</P>
<P>
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D) 
</P>
<P>
Proposal: California Jumpstart 
</P>
<P>
Building on the success of Head Start and the state's own preschool program for 
disadvantaged youngsters, Jumpstart would make early childhood education 
available to any 4-year-old "who needs and wants it." Advocates of such 
programs say they can lower delinquency rates and improve a youngster's chances 
to succeed in school and grow up to be a productive member of society. 
</P>
<P>
Cost: Between $600 million and $900 million a year, including the federal and 
state money currently going to Head Start and existing state preschool 
programs. Feinstein proposes using California Lottery funds, which fluctuate 
and cannot be counted on to provide a constant amount of money. Unless voters 
agreed to an increase in the percentage of lottery proceeds funneled to 
education purposes, the preschool program would cut deeply into money now 
funneled to schools and colleges throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
JOHN K. VAN DE KAMP (D) 
</P>
<P>
Proposal: California Teacher Corps 
</P>
<P>
Designed to help meet the demand for more and better teachers, the Teacher 
Corps program would provide full fellowships for the last two years of college 
and for a year of teacher-certification graduate work for those who promise to 
teach in the state's public schools for a minimum of two to five years. The 
program would accommodate 4,000 new students per year for five years; 
recipients of the $7,000 to $8,000 annual fellowships would have to be in the 
top half of their classes in a California college or university. Those who quit 
early would be required to pay back the fellowship, plus interest. A companion 
"work study" program would offer part-time jobs in the schools to encourage 
younger students interested in teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Cost: About $80 million a year. Van de Kamp proposes dropping the state's 
longtime sales tax exemption for candy. To do so would require permission from 
the Legislature, which has been reluctant to add taxes. 
</P>
<P>
PETE WILSON (R) 
</P>
<P>
Proposal: Early, comprehensive intervention 
</P>
<P>
Calling for help with all types of problems that can affect a child's school 
performance, Wilson proposes providing government-paid prenatal care; 
integrating local social services with the area school system and its health 
program to help combat poverty, medical problems and family troubles; creating 
a cabinet-level advisory post on child development and services; encouraging 
community leaders to become mentors for troubled students, and expanding 
preschool programs. 
</P>
<P>
Cost: Wilson has not yet put a price tag on his proposals (other than to 
estimate that the prenatal care would cost $1,200 per mother), nor has he 
offered many specifics on how to pay for them. He recently said he favored 
paying for prenatal care by using funds generated by the voter-approved tobacco 
tax. Because some of the proposals would involve policy changes rather than new 
programs, costs would be relatively small, his aides have said, adding that 
intervention programs could end up saving tax dollars down the road. Part of 
the funds for additional programs could come from money already earmarked for 
education programs or from cutting the state budget in other, as yet 
unspecified, areas, he has said.

THE DEBATES DONE, DEMOCRATS GET BACK TO THROWING PUNCHES

<P>
If you missed their one-hour live televised debate -- and almost everyone did 
-- Democratic candidates for governor John K. Van de Kamp and Dianne Feinstein 
served up a surly, daylong rerun Monday and intensified their quarreling over 
his leadership on crime and her's on management. 
</P>
<P>
The KCBS debate Sunday between 4:30 and 5:30 p.m. was the choice of seven of 
100 Los Angeles-area households where the TV was turned on -- a better showing 
than reruns of the "A-Team" and "Hart to Hart," but far behind the John Candy 
movie "Summer Rental." 
</P>
<P>
Overnight ratings in the Los Angeles-Orange County market showed 158,000 
households tuned in for politics, while nearly 2 million watched something 
else, according to the station. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the two Democratic candidates seemed satisfied, and probably relieved, 
with the tone and outcome of their second and last debate before the June 5 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
Both emerged standing on their feet, with no horrible mistakes to try to 
explain away in these last two weeks of the campaign, and ready to plunge back 
into the more familiar and controlled pace of daily speech-making, press 
conferences and television advertising. And the questions lingering from the 
debate served as the handy, if slightly worn, framework. 
</P>
<P>
For Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco, that meant keeping her 
attention on crime, judgment and Van de Kamp, the two-term attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, she tried to fan the flames of doubt over the most explosive 
case ever to confront Van de Kamp -- the 1981 sex murders of 10 young women in 
a case known as the Hillside Strangler. Van de Kamp, then district attorney of 
Los Angeles, said he doubted the strength of evidence against one of the 
killers, Angelo Buono, and decided to pursue sex crime charges rather than seek 
a murder conviction. A judge thought otherwise and refused to dismiss the 
murder charges. The office of then-Atty. Gen. George Deukmejian took over the 
case and obtained a murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has called his decision a "mistake" and has said, "It's one I wish 
I could get back." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not enough eight years after the fact to grudgingly confess a mistake and 
to declare the issue is over," Feinstein concluded. "This issue transcends the 
attorney general's effort at political damage control and speaks to his whole 
record . . . (to his) character and judgment as an individual." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, she ridiculed Van de Kamp for refusing to take oil company 
contributions as a matter of honor while he has taken money from Buono's 
defense attorney, Santa Monica lawyer Gerald Chaleff. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would John Van de Kamp accept fund-raising help of more than $10,000 from 
the Hillside Strangler's lawyer in this very campaign?" she asked at a midday 
press conference held on the sidewalk in front of the attorney general's 
Wilshire Boulevard office. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Van de Kamp campaign, Chaleff has donated $130 to Van de Kamp 
directly in the last six years, and co-hosted two fund-raisers at which an 
additional $14,275 was raised. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Van de Kamp said Feinstein was using the case to divert attention 
from her refusal to spell out just how she would balance a state budget that 
now is projected to be $3.6 billion in the red. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a complete duck," he said. "She will not deal with the budget crisis . 
. . so she goes on this diversionary attack." 
</P>
<P>
At appearances in Santa Monica and San Francisco, Van de Kamp pressed Feinstein 
on the matter of the budget deficit, saying he had gone out of his way to be as 
specific "as any candidate for governor in recent history" with a list of tax 
hikes, including an income tax boost on the wealthy, along with cuts in some 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Governors are elected to deal with budgets, to cut budgets where it's required 
-- not to cut ribbons," he said. "It's no secret the state budget is a mess. 
The only secret is what Dianne Feinstein would do about it." 
</P>
<P>
"Pie in the sky," Feinstein responded. She noted that Van de Kamp would need 
bipartisan cooperation from the Legislature just to get his plan enacted -- 
unlikely considering Republican opposition to tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
"In summary, this isn't a serious statement," she said. "I don't believe you 
can do it this way. You have to sit down with both sides of the aisle and 
negotiate."

CAMARENA CASE DEAL DENIED BY OFFICIAL 
</P>

<P>
Mexico's attorney general Monday categorically denied allegations by U.S. 
attorneys that he approved an "under the table" agreement to hand over a 
Guadalajara doctor to American officials for trial in the 1985 murder of drug 
agent Enrique Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Atty. Gen. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said it is 
"absolutely false" that he authorized a swap of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain 
for a Mexican fugitive in the United States, as federal prosecutors have 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie set a hearing for Friday on 
a defense contention that charges against the doctor should be dismissed 
because of "outrageous (U.S.) government conduct." 
</P>
<P>
The judge directed prosecutors to produce at the hearing anyone who knows 
anything about the doctor's arrest. Rafeedie said he wants to know how high up 
knowledge of the Alvarez case went in the government. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. William Fahey said he assumes that knowledge of the 
operation went to "fairly high levels" within the Drug Enforcement 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in Los Angeles filed a legal brief and affidavits in U.S. District 
Court last Friday alleging that representatives of the Mexican Federal Judicial 
Police, which answers to the attorney general, asked that "the arrangement be 
'under the table' between governments" so as not to "upset" Mexican citizens. 
</P>
<P>
According to the brief, the doctor had previously been detained in Mexico, but 
the deal fell through when DEA officials refused to pay a $50,000 advance to 
federal police who promised to bring him to the United States. Informants later 
advised the DEA that the doctor "had paid a bribe" to Mexican police to be 
released, the brief states. 
</P>
<P>
It adds that after the deal fell apart, Los Angeles-based DEA operative Antonio 
Garate Bustamante arranged the April 2 abduction of Alvarez through contacts in 
Mexico. Garate, a former Mexican policeman who has admitted working for drug 
traffickers at one point, was promised "a $50,000 reward" plus expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Garate has said that the original swap plan was arranged by Federal Judicial 
Police Cmdr. Pablo Alleman and Jorge Castillo del Rey, a former commander of 
the same agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The supposed authorization (by Alvarez del Castillo) is absolutely false," the 
attorney general said. "Mr. Castillo del Rey was retired from the Federal 
Judicial Police July 1, 1989, and never had any contact with the attorney 
general of the republic." 
</P>
<P>
Castillo del Rey has been arrested in connection with the doctor's kidnaping. 
Officials deny Alleman was involved in any negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena was kidnaped outside the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara in February, 
1985, tortured and killed. 
</P>
<P>
The DEA had sought Alvarez, a gynecologist, for his alleged role in reviving 
Camarena during torture sessions and questioning about his knowledge of 
official corruption and involvement in drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"In December, 1989, Garate was contacted telephonically by (MFJP) Commandante 
Jorge Castillo del Rey, who sought to meet with Garate and representatives of 
the DEA in Los Angeles," the legal brief states. 
</P>
<P>
At the Dec. 13 meeting, the account continues, "Castillo del Rey advised that 
he was present in the United States with the full knowledge and authority of 
the attorney general of Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials were willing to give up Alvarez in order to get their hands 
on a Mexican fugitive, a banker believed hiding in California "because he was 
alleged to have stolen approximately $500 million from various politicians in 
Mexico," the brief states. 
</P>
<P>
The DEA reportedly agreed to find the fugitive and deport him as an illegal 
alien. 
</P>
<P>
Garate continued negotiations by phone with Javier Orosco-Orosco, the chief of 
the MFJP fugitive detail in Mexico City. But he demanded "$50,000 in advance 
for an airplane and other expenses to transport Alvarez-Machain to the United 
States," according to the prosecution account. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez's lawyer, Robert K. Steinberg, said he has subpoenaed U.S. Atty. Gen. 
Richard Thornburgh and DEA Director Terrence Burke to testify about his 
client's arrest. But, he indicated that he and the prosecutor probably will 
agree to introduce written declarations by the two high-ranking officials at 
Friday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Four other Camarena defendants are on trial in Los Angeles federal court.

Marie Mercer, 79, who is confined to her bed with diabetes, found it "a very 
hard thing to believe," but one recent Saturday a small army of volunteers 
marched in and slapped a bright new coat of paint on every room in her aging 
two-story house. Free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
The event was part of "Christmas in April," a volunteer effort launched here 
seven years ago to meet a need that budget-starved government programs cannot 
or do not fill. Every spring, hundreds of citizens -- lawyers, blue-collar 
union workers, government officials, rich dowagers and school teachers -- give 
up one day to paint, plaster and hammer nails to renovate and repair homes 
owned by elderly or handicapped persons with low incomes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is willing to help his neighbor. You just need somebody to get it 
organized," said Thomas A. Kennelly, a former Watergate defense attorney and 
federal prosecutor who helped get the movement going here in 1983. "The thing 
is contagious." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the idea reflects the spirit of volunteerism which President Bush -- 
with his "thousand points of light" -- has commended as an alternative to 
government action on serious social problems. 
</P>
<P>
Yet if Christmas in April suggests the potential strength of volunteers, it 
also underscores their limits. 
</P>
<P>
Clones of the Washington program -- itself inspired by a Midland, Tex., plan -- 
have sprung up in 42 other cities and enlisted some 90,000 workers to renovate 
an estimated 6,000 houses in just the past few years. But that accomplishment 
represents less than 1% of the need: There are 9 million elderly, low-income 
homeowners in America, the vast majority of them women. Over one-third live 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
As Kennelly is quick to say: "This effort was never designed to replace federal 
housing programs for the poor or the elderly." Federal housing aid for the poor 
was cut back drastically under President Ronald Reagan, however, and it remains 
a victim of tightening budgets. 
</P>
<P>
The urban equivalent of an old-fashioned barn-raising, the idea seems to work 
for four basic reasons: it produces a valuable result, it calls for a limited 
commitment of time, it brings together people from diverse backgrounds who find 
they like the experience and it answers an apparently widespread yearning among 
relatively well-off Americans to do something concrete about the problems of 
the less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Christmas in April renovated 103 homes this spring; among the 
volunteers, 21 law firms each took on a house. "The almost universal reaction 
among our people is what a good time they have had!" Kennelly said. "You may be 
working alongside a bank teller or a federal judge. It's one day only. There 
are no committee meetings, and you can immediately see what you've 
accomplished." Since each event occupies only one day -- 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. is 
standard -- workers try not to bite off more than they can chew. At Marie 
Mercer's home, for example, an advance team determined several weeks ago that 
12 volunteers should be able to paint the interior of her six-room house in no 
more than eight hours. But they found they had time to paint the porch, too. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers with station wagons shuttled supplies to each project. Most supplies 
were donated by construction companies or by the AFL-CIO Building Trades 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy for this work because our home is getting old and I'm 
disabled," Mercer said. "My husband Charles is 84. He used to do a lot of the 
work, but he's been sick in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Armbrister, a Washington journalist who helped start the program here, 
said neighborhood churches or local agencies suggest homeowners each year who 
are most in need. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the few major activities in the capital that is nonpartisan and 
nonpolitical," Armbrister said. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack 
Kemp, convinced the idea can help prevent homelessness, showed up at a work 
site last year to wield a paint brush. 
</P>
<P>
Others who have lent their talents to Christmas in April include civil rights 
leader Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and Reps. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) and Guy 
Vander Jagt (R-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
Former President Jimmy Carter has been active in a similar program, called 
Habitat for Humanity, which uses volunteers to build houses from scratch for 
sale, interest-free, to low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
Kennelly said volunteers in San Francisco and Palo Alto have started their own 
"Christmas" programs. A project is being promoted in Los Angeles for next year 
by a group including Lori Speese of Neighborhood Housing Services and Kirk 
Hallahan, a vice president of Coast Savings &amp; Loan Assn.

Gunmen shot to death a senator closely allied to presidential front-runner 
Cesar Gaviria in the cocaine center of Medellin on Monday, part of a wave of 
violence sweeping Colombia before Sunday's national election.

<P>
In a separate incident, a bodyguard defused a bomb with its fuse already lit at 
a Bogota school where two of President Virgilio Barco Vargas' granddaughters 
are pupils, a radio report said. 
</P>
<P>
In Medellin, local radio reported that Sen. Federico Estrada Velez, 63, of the 
ruling Liberal Party, and his driver were slain by two gunmen at a traffic 
light. Estrada, a senator for Antioquia province, whose capital is Medellin, 
was a close ally of Gaviria, the Liberal Party candidate who is favored in 
public opinion polls to win the election. 
</P>
<P>
The government blames drug traffickers for the rash of violence before the 
presidential balloting that will decide the future of Barco's tough anti-drug 
policy. Three presidential aspirants have been assassinated in nine months. 
</P>
<P>
RCN radio said that a bodyguard of Barco's daughter, Carolina, defused 170 
pounds of dynamite found in garbage bags at a northern Bogota school where two 
of Barco's granddaughters attend classes. Carolina Barco and her daughters 
Adriana and Alejandra were in the school building at the time.

SHAMIR REBUKED BY U.S. OVER DEATHS OF 7 PALESTINIANS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: HIS REJECTION OF PEACE PLAN CONTRIBUTED TO THE 'POTENTIAL FOR 
SENSELESS VIOLENCE,' WASHINGTON SAYS.

<P>
The Bush Administration, in a stinging rebuke to Israel's embattled caretaker 
government, said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir must share the blame for the 
massacre of seven Arab workers and the rioting that followed because his rebuff 
of a U.S.-backed peace initiative contributed to the "potential . . . for 
senseless violence." 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher accepted Israel's explanation that 
the killings at a highway crossroads near the Israeli town of Rishon le Zion 
were the work of a mentally unbalanced man. But he said that does not relieve 
the Israeli government of responsibility for the murders and the violence that 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of the peace process, the potential for this kind of senseless 
violence and spiraling responses afterwards goes up," Boucher said, reading 
from a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Boucher criticized the Israeli army for inflicting an excessive number of 
casualties in its effort to put down the violence that followed word of the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have this kind of very horrible, very tragic sort of incident, and 
then that's followed by responses that lead to further violence, we see that as 
another sign that there must be a peace process and people have to be able to 
believe in a peace process," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would join Israeli government leaders in urging Arab governments 
and Palestinian activists to refrain from exploiting the killings to incite 
further violence, Boucher said Washington "calls on all sides to make an effort 
to reduce tensions." But he immediately turned back to his criticism of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not merely enough to have restraint," he said. "We need an active, 
viable peace process to create hope for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir had balked at a peace plan advanced by Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III that was designed to lead to negotiations between Israel and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, the Labor Party, which supported the Baker initiative, pulled 
out of Israel's national unity government in March and brought it down. 
However, since then, no party has been able to put together a majority in 
Parliament, so Shamir has continued to lead a caretaker regime. 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-Israeli friction over Shamir's refusal to go along with Baker's plan has 
driven the relationship between the traditional allies to the lowest point in 
at least a generation. Boucher's statement Monday is sure to cause additional 
tension. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government launched a major public relations campaign Monday. It 
directed its embassies around the world to explain its policies in the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip and to assure the world that the government did not 
condone the Rishon le Zion killings. 
</P>
<P>
However, Boucher responded by renewing U.S. criticism of the Israeli army for 
its use of force in trying to put down the Palestinian uprising.

"We're disturbed by the number of casualties inflicted by the Israeli army," he 
said. "We've repeatedly called upon the government of Israel to exercise 
restraint in these situations in order to avoid heavy casualties such as took 
place (Sunday)." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Boucher praised the government of Jordan for its handling of a 
Palestinian gunman who sprayed a busload of French tourists with bullets after 
shouting slogans of revenge for the Arabs killed in Rishon le Zion. 
</P>
<P>
"We deplore this tragic incident and extend our sympathies to the wounded and 
their families," Boucher said. "The Jordanian authorities have acted quickly to 
contain the incident, and we understand they are taking steps to ensure the 
security of foreign tourists and others visiting Jordan."

A Palestinian gunman, shouting slogans of revenge on behalf of the "Gaza 
martyrs," opened fire Monday on a busload of French tourists in Jordan, 
spraying them with bullets before pulling out a dagger and stabbing two 
passengers cowering behind the front seats. 
</P>
<P>
Nine tourists and a Jordanian photographer were injured in the mid-morning 
attack in downtown Amman, which security officials said was to avenge the 
killing of seven Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip by an 
Israeli near Tel Aviv a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you, Gazans?" the gunman yelled as he boarded the bus, according to 
witnesses, and at one point during the attack referred to the "Gaza martyrs." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of the attack, police arrested the man, identified as Ahmad 
Badwan, 28, a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip currently residing in Amman. 
</P>
<P>
French Embassy officials said five of the injured tourists were treated and 
immediately released. Four others, including a 55-year-old Parisian listed in 
critical condition, were hospitalized. A 30-year-old Jordanian photographer 
accompanying the tour group was listed in stable condition with gunshot wounds 
to both hands. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an isolated attack carried out by a lone gunman," the Jordanian 
Information Ministry said, quoting an unidentified security official. "The 
Jordanian government expresses its deep regret and strong denunciation of this 
criminal act and wishes to assure everyone that justice will take its course 
and that such acts will be dealt with with utmost stringency." 
</P>
<P>
The attack came amid heightened tension all over the region after the Sunday 
shootings near Tel Aviv by an Israeli. 
</P>
<P>
In Amman, thousands of protesters chanting anti-American slogans and waving the 
Koran, the holy book of Islam, marched near the U.S. Embassy, wire services 
reported. Some hurled rocks at police, who fired tear gas and used armored cars 
to seal off the street where the embassy is located. 
</P>
<P>
Also, protesters at a Palestinian refugee camp near Amman closed the 
Amman-Damascus highway Sunday night by throwing stones at passing vehicles, and 
at least 20,000 Palestinians staged a demonstration northwest of the Jordanian 
capital Monday, chanting "No to Arab Silence!" Thousands more Palestinian 
refugees demonstrated at camps in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, Egypt's fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood denounced an impending 
visit to Cairo by Israeli Labor Party leader Shimon Peres and criticized 
Egypt's conciliatory stance toward Israel. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Amman, Yassir Abed Rabbo, a senior Palestine Liberation 
Organization official, condemned the attack against the French tourists, saying 
it provided cover for Israeli actions against Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"We condemn all acts of violence against civilians and believe this was a 
suspect attack aimed at covering up Israeli actions in the occupied territories 
and diverting attention from what is happening there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference, in a statement issued 
from its headquarters in Jidda, Saudia Arabia, said Sunday's shootings by the 
Israeli were part of a "world Zionist plan and deceitful conspiracy aimed at 
terrorizing the Palestinians and forcing them to leave their country for the 
benefit of hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jewish emigrants (arriving) with the 
view of building a Greater Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Jordanian security officials said the incident began at 9:50 a.m., when a 
busload of 34 French tourists was disembarking in downtown Amman to visit the 
city's Roman amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the attacker followed the panicked tourists back onto the bus, 
exhausted his ammunition and then drew a dagger and stabbed two tourists who 
had taken shelter behind the first row of seats. There were conflicting reports 
as to whether the gun was a rifle or a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
"He forced everyone to the back of the bus, and he started shooting 
indiscriminately," one witness to the incident said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known why the gunman targeted the French tour group, which had 
arrived in Jordan on May 18 for a weeklong tour.

Nearly 1,000 AIDS activists staged a noisy demonstration resulting in dozens of 
arrests at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., on Monday, where 
they demanded an acceleration in AIDS-related research and complained that only 
one effective AIDS drug has been developed since the epidemic began. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 activists were arrested on the NIH grounds and charged with 
trespassing after blocking police vehicles or trying to enter buildings at the 
government's lead biomedical research agency. 
</P>
<P>
Another 21 protesters were arrested after taking over the office of Dr. Daniel 
Hoth, director of the division of AIDS for the National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases. Hoth's office is located in Rockville, several miles 
away from NIH. An NIH spokesman said nothing was damaged, and there were no 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Starting at 7 a.m. under drizzling skies, the protesters strung red streamers 
through the trees outside several NIH buildings to symbolize the "red tape" 
they charged was hampering the AIDS research effort. They also set up about two 
dozen cardboard tombstones with such slogans as: "One AIDS death every 12 
minutes" and "We will not R.I.P." 
</P>
<P>
Moving from one building to another among the key institutes involved in AIDS 
research, the protesters shouted and chanted: "Ten years, $1 billion, one drug, 
big deal," and "We want a cure. This is war." They were met at the entrances to 
each building by chained doors and a line of U.S. Park Police on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pessimism in the AIDS community right now because there is no 
new drug on the horizon that gives people hope," said Mark Harrington, of New 
York, a member of ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), which organized the 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
William F. Raub, acting director of NIH, issued a statement saying that "the 
tragedy of AIDS is keenly felt by scientists at the National Institutes of 
Health, and the frustration of people who are infected with the AIDS virus and 
their advocates is understandable." Raub said that NIH "is wholeheartedly 
committed" to finding "therapies and vaccines that will eventually defeat this 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
Further, he said, because of the research conducted at NIH, as well as by 
scientists outside the agency who are supported by NIH grants, "there is reason 
for hope." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration budget for AIDS is $1.6 billion this year and $1.7 
billion next year for research, prevention and care, other than Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the activists said that their tactics have already resulted in 
tremendous changes in the ways AIDS drugs are approved and released, in part 
due to a similar large demonstration in October, 1988, at the Food and Drug 
Administration. But they insisted that they have to keep the pressure on. 
</P>
<P>
"They've responded because they couldn't not respond," said Raymond Schmidt, 
from Cambridge, Mass. "(But) there's still a lot more to be done." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters demanded that funding for AIDS research be increased and that 
the NIH budget be doubled so that AIDS "not be forced to compete with other 
health care priorities." Further, they called for the development of new AIDS 
treatments, and increased research into drugs to combat the dozens of 
individual opportunistic infections and cancers that plague AIDS patients. They 
also urged that clinical studies be expanded to include more women, children 
and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
While current federal AIDS spending represents an all-time high, numerous 
organizations -- including the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, the 
National Commission on AIDS and the National Organizations Responding to AIDS 
Coalition -- have all said that significantly more money should be spent. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of AIDS research activities for the NIH, issued 
a statement defending the work of his agency, saying it has "made a dramatic 
impact on the lives of people who are infected with the AIDS virus." 
</P>
<P>
He said that except for AZT -- the only antiviral AIDS drug licensed thus far 
-- and a few related compounds, "very few promising . . . drugs have yet 
emerged from preclinical research; thus few are available for testing." 
</P>
<P>
Fauci promised that "we will continue to investigate any therapy with promise" 
and said that inaccurate statements made by ACT UP "do nothing to further the 
cause to which we are thoroughly dedicated -- that of conquering AIDS."

The Smithsonian Institution on Monday named W. Richard West Jr., an Indian 
activist attorney and former Stanford University professor, to direct the 
National Museum of the American Indian it will build on the Mall. 
</P>
<P>
West told reporters that he wants the $106-million museum to represent more 
than just the "romanticized past" of American tribal people. 
</P>
<P>
He said it will serve as a link to contemporary Indian culture throughout the 
Western Hemisphere, and address politically charged issues such as alleged 
genocide against Indians in Brazil and recent conflicts between Mohawk 
tribesmen along the Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
The collections will consist largely of items to be received from New York's 
Heye Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
West, a Cheyenne-Arapaho, was born in San Bernardino. A 1965 graduate of 
Redlands University, he earned a master's degree in American history from 
Harvard University and a law degree from Stanford's School of Law, where he was 
an adjunct professor.

MOURNERS PUT ON A HAPPY FACE FOR HENSON

There were happy songs, upbeat words, an overflow crowd of 5,000 and a gaggle 
of Muppet pals at a memorial service Monday for Jim Henson. 
</P>
<P>
Henson, who used the Muppets he created to entertain and educate children on 
"Sesame Street" and elsewhere, died Wednesday of pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
Henson had written instructions for his funeral four years ago that were opened 
after his death. He said he wanted the occasion to be a happy one and that 
mourners should not wear black. 
</P>
<P>
An old green coat emblazoned with a frog-shaped piece of scarlet cloth greeted 
mourners as they entered the church. The coat symbolized one belonging to 
Henson's mother, from which he was said to have cut material to make the 
original Kermit the Frog. 
</P>
<P>
With Big Bird and Harry Belafonte on hand, an organist began the service with a 
rendition of the "Sesame Street" theme song, "Sunny Day." 
</P>
<P>
Then the Dirty Dozen Dixieland band strolled in playing, "Please Release Me," 
followed by ministers, a red-and-white robed church choir and family members. 
</P>
<P>
Mourners fluttered colorful butterflies atop metal stems as Belafonte and three 
backup singers sang, "Turn the World Around," a song Belafonte wrote and Henson 
used. 
</P>
<P>
Big Bird, a character played by Carroll Spinney, sang, "It's Not Easy Being 
Green," a number usually done by Kermit. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Big Bird looked heavenward, said, "Thank you, Kermit," then slowly 
walked away, head hung low.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE DEBATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel M. Weintraub, The following is a discussion of those issues and an 
analysis of each by Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During Sunday's debate, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and former San Francisco 
Mayor Dianne Feinstein made points that were not fully explained and raised 
questions that went unanswered. The following is a discussion of those issues 
and an analysis of each by Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub: 
</P>
<P>
Issue: Feinstein criticized Van de Kamp for failing to prosecute leaders of the 
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue for violation of a court order. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The U.S. District Court in March, 1989, ordered members of Operation 
Rescue not to interfere with women seeking abortions. But 10 days later, the 
group's members barricaded a Los Angeles abortion clinic, and Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates recommended that four Operation Rescue leaders be charged with 
felonies. Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner declined to prosecute and referred the matter 
to the city attorney for investigation of misdemeanor charges. Abortion rights 
groups asked Van de Kamp to take over the case but he declined and stood by 
Reiner's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Issue: Van de Kamp questioned Feinstein's feminist credentials, saying that 
while she was mayor of San Francisco, the deputy mayor and the directors of 
eight "major" departments were all men. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Van de Kamp's campaign said Monday that he was referring to the 
Police and Fire departments, the Airport Department, public health, public 
works, social services, the general hospital and the municipal bus service. 
Feinstein's campaign did not dispute his contention, but said she appointed the 
city's first female city attorney and first female treasurer. As for Van de 
Kamp's record as attorney general, his 19-member executive staff includes seven 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Issue: Feinstein charged that Van de Kamp, because he opposes capital 
punishment, would "commute every single case" of those sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Even if Van de Kamp wanted to commute every sentence, he almost 
certainly could not do so. The state Constitution prohibits the governor from 
commuting the sentences of twice-convicted felons except on the recommendation 
of a majority of the state Supreme Court. Most of the more than 275 inmates on 
California's Death Row have been convicted of more than one felony. The Supreme 
Court, dominated by appointments of conservative Gov. George Deukmejian, would 
not be expected to go along with such a strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Issue: Feinstein said crime went down 20% in San Francisco while she was mayor, 
and she charged that "violent crime" increased 20% statewide since Van de Kamp 
became attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein's reference to her own record on crime includes only the 
most serious offenses. According to the San Francisco Police Department, all 
crime increased 0.1% during her tenure, and arrests for so-called "Part II" 
offenses -- including arson, narcotics, carrying weapons, embezzlement, 
prostitution and drunk driving -- increased 30.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the number of arrests for violent crimes has increased 19.8% since 
1983, according to "Crime and Delinquency in California," a 1988 report 
published by Van de Kamp's Justice Department. The definition of violent crime 
included murder, rape, robbery, assault and kidnaping. Those figures include a 
dramatic increase in assaults reported in 1986 after the definition of that 
crime was expanded to include domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
Issue: Van de Kamp charged that Feinstein would put cost-of-living increases 
for education programs "on the table" in her search for ways to close the 
state's current $3.6-billion budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein has said that she would consider any proposal to increase 
revenues or cut the budget. The kindergarten-through-community college portion 
of the education budget is protected by voter-approved Proposition 98, but the 
provisions of that measure could be suspended for one year by a two-thirds vote 
of each house of the Legislature.

HUNGARY SLOWING ITS RUSH TO CAPITALISM; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN EUROPE: THE GOVERNMENT WAS ACCUSED OF GIVING FOREIGNERS TOO GOOD A 
DEAL. NOW IT SEEMS WARY OF ALL OUTSIDE INVESTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hungarian proverb holds that when a listing rider attempts to right himself 
in the saddle, he usually falls off the other side of the horse. 
</P>
<P>
And this, liberal politicians say, is what has happened to Hungary's drive to 
transfer state-run industries to private ownership: First the government gave 
away the store, and now it is wary of all foreign investment, the key to 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Stung by a string of controversial sales that enriched a few at the expense of 
many, the center-right government that was voted into power this spring is 
scrambling to put up barriers against shady deals, get-rich-quick schemes and 
"golden parachutes" for departing Communist managers. 
</P>
<P>
As the most economically developed of the emerging democracies of Eastern 
Europe, Hungary is the first to have to grapple with deciding what to sell and 
what to keep. 
</P>
<P>
It put out the welcome mat for foreign investment, recognizing the need for 
Western expertise, technology and money to buy backward factories from the 
state and upgrade them to produce export-quality goods to help pay off 
staggering foreign debts. 
</P>
<P>
But a public backlash against outside ownership is threatened after sales that 
have deeded over Hungary's leading newspapers to foreign publishers and sold 
promising tourist and service industries at a fraction of their worth. 
</P>
<P>
"We are only at the beginning of capitalism," said Matyas Eorsi, a member of 
Parliament from the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats and a lawyer handling 
foreign trade contracts. "It's like a gold rush, and there are no fancy rules 
to guide it." 
</P>
<P>
Eorsi argues that Hungary needs immediate infusions of foreign capital, and he 
advocates a virtual open season on national assets, risking a few unwise 
transactions in creating an instant market that will eventually demand fair 
value for the assets leaving state hands. 
</P>
<P>
"It is better to have some scandalous transactions go through if the result is 
a speeding up of privatization," Eorsi said. 
</P>
<P>
But the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum argues that it's time for 
restraint. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bod, head of the economics committee in Parliament and a top adviser with 
the Forum, contends that the tax breaks offered as inducements for foreign 
investment are going to publishers of pornography -- a flourishing industry in 
Hungary -- and to those who took over prosperous businesses, not the failing 
enterprises the authorities hoped to give over to capitalism for another try at 
profit making. 
</P>
<P>
After investment laws were liberalized last year, several questionable deals 
were pushed through to make investment in Hungary appear attractive to 
foreigners, Bod said. 
</P>
<P>
In a few other cases, valuable businesses that had been run by the state, like 
the network of Apisz stationery stores and the HungarHotels chain, were quietly 
sold off for much less than what would be their market value if a market 
existed to determine such things, Bod said. 
</P>
<P>
He complained that the lack of an anti-monopoly law has allowed foreign 
publishers, such as West Germany's Axel Springer organization, to buy out the 
fledgling free press only recently liberated from Communist Party control. 
</P>
<P>
Springer now owns more than a dozen newspapers and 40 trade journals in 
Hungary, and publishing magnates Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell recently 
purchased large shares of the nation's most reform-minded publications. 
</P>
<P>
The Forum is pushing for more regulation of the conversion to private ownership 
among foreign investors and Hungarians alike, although the latter are relegated 
to a minor role in privatization because of the dearth of savings and ready 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
An international commission of economics experts determined in early April that 
Hungary's industries are worth about $30 billion. The report estimated that 
Hungarians could afford to buy only 1% of these properties a year, putting the 
burden on foreign buyers to break the state's grip on commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude toward foreign capital is very important," Bod said. "In general, 
that attitude is still very positive, but every case of corruption undermines 
this asset of support." 
</P>
<P>
In a rare show of unity among Hungary's fractious political parties, a State 
Property Agency was established in March to work with Parliament in drafting 
guidelines for privatization. The government has also contracted with the 
London-based accounting firm Price Waterhouse and the Chicago-based law firm 
Baker &amp; McKenzie to serve as international advisers in the transition. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Birch, a partner in the Price Waterhouse Budapest office, says a certain 
amount of caution is sensible when heading into uncharted waters. To date there 
is no precedent for converting a socialist, centrally planned economy into a 
free market. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Western business world is automatically wary of the capitalist 
instinct to make a quick profit, nations such as Hungary are not. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern Europe is very fragile because the people don't have that kind of 
expertise, and they lack the experience of having to protect themselves," Birch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that some industrial and service spheres should be shielded from 
foreign influence but says those decisions rest with the elected authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The State Property Agency operates outside the control of the government, 
answering only to Parliament, which has yet to draft a single law.

Agency director Istvan Tompe argues that Hungary should sell off failing firms 
to outside investors but hold on to lucrative businesses and those that are 
traditional responsibilities of the state. He says health care, banking, 
tourism and transport should stay in the hands of the government. 
</P>
<P>
State-owned hotels, restaurants and travel agencies in Budapest and at Lake 
Balaton are major hard-currency earners for the Hungarian government, as is the 
national airline, Malev. 
</P>
<P>
Whether to designate certain industries as off-limits for foreign investors 
will be decided by Parliament, which only in early May began the complicated 
task of building a new legislative framework. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, decisions about what should be sold, how soon and for how much 
are still the exclusive domain of Hungarian industrial managers -- often the 
Communist Party bosses that the new government plans to remove. 
</P>
<P>
Under the economic reforms of 1984-85, a first step toward privatization was 
taken by creating ownership councils in most factories and state enterprises. 
The councils were intended to make decisions in the interest of all employees, 
who as Hungarian citizens were considered owners of their state enterprises. 
But the council members tended to be the same officials who managed the 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
This has put the industrial chieftains who are responsible for enterprises that 
are over-staffed and underproductive in the position of making decisions that 
also determine the factories' future. 
</P>
<P>
Some Communist Party figures, anticipating imminent dismissal, have arranged 
the transfer of their enterprises to foreign consortia. With no oversight 
authorities, deals were struck behind closed doors that gave the retreating 
managers a sizable payoff -- the golden parachute -- in return for undervaluing 
the facility being sold. 
</P>
<P>
Bod contends that the Apisz stationery chain was sold for one-seventh of its 
value and that one-third of the shares ended up in the hands of a departing 
Communist bureaucrat. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell, the Czechoslovak-born newspaper magnate, reportedly got a 
bargain-basement price of $800,000 for 40% of Magyar Hirlap, the former 
government daily. 
</P>
<P>
Springer has evaded even the cursory review of the State Property Agency by 
labeling its newspaper holdings start-ups instead of takeovers. The West German 
group hired the publications' staffs and rented the same offices and printing 
facilities, then invited advertisers to switch over to the new papers. 
</P>
<P>
With no regulatory legislation, the moves cannot be deemed illegal. But the 
Free Democrats have called on Parliament to freeze Springer transactions in 
Hungary pending investigation of how it obtained its current holdings and until 
after legislation can be enacted to prevent media monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors appear to be taking a wait-and-see attitude, watching the 
progress of the first projects before embarking on their own commitments. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here with the prejudice that it might not be time to invest yet, 
because of the Gold Rush mentality," said Kevin Kinsella, managing general 
partner of Avalon Ventures of La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Kinsella visited Hungary with 40 other American businessmen in April. He said 
that he was impressed with the Hungarians' entrepreneurial spirit but that in 
the absence of any track record "we might want to let things settle out here 
first."

NBC REVAMPS SCHEDULE FOR NEXT SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE NO. 1 NETWORK ADMITS THAT IT IS VULNERABLE AFTER ALL OF THE 
SERIES IT INTRODUCED LAST FALL FAILED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Network leader NBC, acknowledging that it is "vulnerable" after a season in 
which all of its new fall series failed and its ratings dropped, on Monday 
announced a major overhaul of its prime-time schedule, replacing six hours of 
programming for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
Enlisting such TV veterans as Jane Curtin, Ed Begley Jr. and Robert Urich, as 
well as rap music performers, NBC will present nine new series in the fall, 
seven of them comedies. Significantly, seven of the nine shows are in the 
nightly lead-off slots, where NBC once was effective almost every evening in 
attracting viewers to stay with the network throughout prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Only three of NBC's 8 p.m. series -- "Matlock" on Tuesdays, "Unsolved 
Mysteries" on Wednesdays and "The Cosby Show" on Thursdays -- are back in those 
time periods on the fall schedule. CBS, last in the ratings, has been plagued 
for years by not being able to develop a steady flow of 8 p.m. hits to hook 
viewers for the night. 
</P>
<P>
"We have recognized our vulnerable positions and attacked them aggressively 
with diverse and exciting programming," said NBC Entertainment President 
Brandon Tartikoff, whose network, once the leader in creative series such as 
"Hill Street Blues" and "St. Elsewhere," has been increasingly criticized for 
its conservative shows. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, for instance, it introduced five new series -- "Sister Kate," "The 
Nutt House," "Hardball," "Baywatch" and "Mancuso FBI" -- and all have been 
canceled. The last time NBC failed with all its new fall entertainment series 
was the 1983-84 season, when it went 0-for-9. 
</P>
<P>
The only new series from this season returning in the 1990-91 lineup were late 
starters on NBC -- Carol Burnett's "Carol &amp; Company," "Grand" and "Wings," 
all comedies. And it is significant that each was aided greatly by powerful 
lead-in shows. "Grand" and "Wings" both were launched following "Cheers," and 
"Carol &amp; Company" was assisted by the lead-in tandem of "The Golden Girls" 
and "Empty Nest." 
</P>
<P>
With NBC's daytime schedule slipping in the ratings and "Today" in a prolonged 
slump since the departure of Jane Pauley at the end of 1989, there is more 
pressure on the prime-time lineup to pick up the slack. Revenues for "Today" 
have fallen off, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
But NBC's prime-time ratings, the backbone of the network, slipped from a 15.7 
season average in 1988-89 to 14.6 for the official 1989-90 season that ended in 
mid-April. With each rating point equal to 921,000 TV homes, that represents a 
loss of about 1 million viewing households. 
</P>
<P>
Although NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., has won the ratings race for five 
consecutive seasons -- coinciding with the dominance of "The Cosby Show" -- its 
lead over its chief challenger, ABC, was narrowed this season. ABC held firm 
with a 12.9 rating this season, the same figure it registered the year before. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, ABC inherited NBC's creative mantle by developing such shows as 
"The Wonder Years," "thirtysomething," "Roseanne," "Twin Peaks" and "China 
Beach." Where NBC once cornered the market on break-out hits, the two major 
successes this season came from competitors -- the cartoon sensation "The 
Simpsons" on Fox Broadcasting Co. and "America's Funniest Home Videos" on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Still, NBC is the network to beat and remains well ahead in the ratings. In 
announcing the network's new fall lineup Monday, Tartikoff said, "This new 
schedule represents an aggressive strategy by NBC to remain dominant in prime 
time by combining fresh, contemporary programming aimed at key demographics 
with an already solid list of returning shows." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "NBC has made changes on all but one night -- adding seven comedies 
for a total of 17." The network said that this represents "a record number of 
comedies on a prime-time schedule." NBC has been held together by two nights of 
comedies, led by "The Cosby Show" and "Cheers" on Thursday and "The Golden 
Girls" and "Empty Nest" on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
The network's seven new comedies for fall are: 
</P>
<P>
* "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," which stars pop rapper The Fresh Prince (Will 
Smith) as "a kid from a tough West Philadelphia neighborhood sent to live with 
his wealthy relatives in Bel Air, where he must adjust to his new family." 
</P>
<P>
* "Ferris Bueller," based on the film "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" and starring 
Charlie Schlatter as "a charming, clever young man who successfully schemes to 
prevent high school from interfering with his pursuit of happiness." 
</P>
<P>
* "The Fanelli Boys," in which the widowed matriarch of an Italian family in 
Brooklyn "orders her four adult sons to move back home to straighten out their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
* "Parenthood," based on the film of the same name and headlining Begley, 
William Windom, Sheila MacRae and Jayne Atkinson in a story focusing on "the 
characters and conflicts of an extended family." 
</P>
<P>
* "Working It Out," in which Curtin and Stephen Collins portray two divorced 
people involved in a relationship in "the presure cooker of life in the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
* "American Dreamer," which stars Urich and Carol Kane and deals with "a 
widower who gives up his career as a TV foreign correspondent to raise his two 
children and write a newspaper column." 
</P>
<P>
* "Hull Street High," a one-hour comedy -- all the other new NBC sitcoms are 30 
minutes in length -- which uses the musical form to chronicle events at a high 
school. The series stars Mark Ballou, Cheryl Pollack and rap performers G. Love 
E., Phillip DeMarks, Trey Parker and Carl Anthony Payne. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's two new drama series are: 
</P>
<P>
* "Signs of Life," a reality-based series that uses actors to show "how illness 
affects a patient both medically and personally, focusing entirely on the 
patient's point of view." A narrator helps weave the show's elements together. 
</P>
<P>
* "Law and Order," with Michael Moriarty and George Dzundza in a tale that 
focuses on police detectives and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
In an increasingly common programming move, NBC will present six consecutive 
comedies as its Saturday night lineup -- "Parenthood," "Working It Out," "The 
Golden Girls," "Empty Nest," "Carol &amp; Company" and "American Dreamer." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to last fall's series canceled by NBC, other shows not returning to 
the network include "Down Home," "Working Girl," "Shannon's Deal," "A Family 
for Joe," "Ann Jillian," "Alf," "The Hogan Family" (which will move to CBS), 
"My Two Dads," "227," "True Blue" and "Nasty Boys." 
</P>
<P>
The veteran sitcom "Amen," owned by Johnny Carson's production company, didn't 
make the fall lineup. But NBC said the show has received a full-season order 
"and will join the schedule in the first available time slot." 
</P>
<P>
Also rejected for fall was "The Magical World of Disney." But the network said 
"The Disney Comedy Adventure Hour," which will present half-hour action 
comedies, "will go into production shortly with several pilots to contend for a 
regular berth in January." 
</P>
<P>
Here is NBC's night-by-night lineup: 
</P>
<P>
Sunday: "Hull St. High," "Signs of Life," "Sunday Night at the Movies." 
</P>
<P>
Monday: "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," "Ferris Bueller," "Monday Night at the 
Movies." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday: "Matlock," "In the Heat of the Night," "Law and Order." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday: "Unsolved Mysteries," "The Fanelli Boys," "Dear John," "Hunter." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday: "The Cosby Show," "A Different World," "Cheers," "Grand," "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
Friday: "Quantum Leap," "Night Court," "Wings," "Midnight Caller." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday: "Parenthood," "Working It Out," "The Golden Girls," "Empty Nest," 
"Carol &amp; Company," "American Dreamer." 
</P>
<P>

DISNEY LOOKING FOR 'UNSUNG HERO' FOR NEXT PHASE OF ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

After four years of using sports stars to promote its theme parks, Walt Disney 
Co. is looking for an unrecognized hero to shout triumphantly at a TV camera: 
"I'm going to Disneyland!" 
</P>
<P>
The company said Monday it will pick a college student who has overcome unusual 
adversity to graduate to be the star of its highly successful "What's Next" 
television commercial and to prance down Main Street with Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
The winner, who will be chosen in a nationwide search, will join such 
well-known sports heroes as Joe Montana, Magic Johnson and Orel Hershiser, who 
are among those featured in the series of TV commercials that began airing in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
By broadening its star-studded advertising campaign, Disney said, it hopes to 
reach more of the college market. Though one might expect that college seniors 
might have larger problems on their mind, Disney officials say they believe 
that one lucky graduate will be their perfect banner carrier for the early 
summer campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for someone whose story will captivate the public," said John 
Dreyer, a Disney World spokesman in Florida, where the idea was cooked up by 
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner and Senior Vice President Tom Elrod. 
</P>
<P>
Disney has sent queries to colleges and universities and is appealing to the 
public to find the perfect candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Among the top contenders so far is a 24-year-old who became a quadriplegic 
while in college, then made up credits and went on to receive his degree. Also 
in the running are three brothers who are completing law school thanks to their 
mother, who worked two jobs to support them. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the in-house-produced campaign has run almost entirely on winning 
athletes, starting with the New York Giants' Phil Sims, who was the first to 
declare he was heading for Disney World after winning the Super Bowl in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has been joined by Dodger pitcher Hershiser, San Francisco 49ers 
quarterback Montana, retired Laker center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and others. The 
sole non-athlete was Miss America, Gretchen Carlson of Minnesota, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Dreyer said the company knew it had a promotion success when winning youth 
football and baseball teams started "going off the field saying, 'I'm going to 
Disney World.' " 
</P>
<P>
These days, the personalities in the spots are headed two places. Dreyer said 
most of the commercials are taped so they can be used for either Disneyland in 
Anaheim or Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
As the "What's Next?" campaign entered the popular culture, Disneyland and 
Disney World even had some unpaid -- and unwanted -- endorsements. After being 
sentenced to death, convicted Night Stalker Richard Ramirez told reporters: 
"Big deal. Death comes with the territory. See you at Disneyland."

GENETICS INSTITUTE OKS LANDMARK VENTURE IN JAPAN; 
</P>
<P>
PHARMACEUTICALS: IT'S APPARENTLY THE FIRST TIME THAT A U.S. BIOTECHNOLOGY 
COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SELL PRODUCTS DIRECTLY IN JAPAN RATHER THAN THROUGH A 
LICENSING AGREEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
Genetics Institute Inc. said Monday that it has agreed to a joint venture with 
a Japanese pharmaceuticals company to develop and market in Japan new 
genetically engineered proteins designed to promote bone growth. 
</P>
<P>
The venture with Tokyo-based Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. is apparently the 
first time that a U.S.-based biotechnology concern will have an opportunity to 
market products directly in Japan rather than selling through a licensing 
agreement. The companies will share equally in profits from the sale of 
products in Japan, Genetics Institute said. The companies also will form a 
partnership to develop and market the products worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Genetics Institute is considered one of the nation's leading biotechnology 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is important in that it provides financial resources for 
Cambridge, Mass.-based Genetics Institute to further develop drugs that are not 
yet commercial products, said David S. Webber, a New York-based analyst with 
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Webber estimated that Yamanouchi will contribute $30 million to $35 million to 
the venture. "That's help in funding the development that was not there 
before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers hope the products that emerge will be able to treat serious 
fractures or repair damage from diseases that cause bone deterioration, 
including osteoporosis and certain dental ailments. They may also be useful in 
cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Osteoporosis, a disease primarily affecting older women that is characterized 
by a reduction in bone density and brittleness, may ultimately be "the greatest 
market," Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
Genetics Institute cited analysts' estimates that the worldwide market for such 
products could exceed $2 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Other biotechnology companies, including Palo Alto-based Collagen Corp., are 
researching proteins to help the body's natural bone-repair mechanisms, but the 
Genetics Institute proteins, called BMPs, are designed to actually promote new 
bone growth. 
</P>
<P>
Garen Bohlin, Genetics Institute executive vice president, said its BMPs -- or 
bone morphogenetic proteins -- are in preclinical testing. The first is not 
expected to go into the human trial stage until 1991. The company was granted a 
patent last year for BMP-1 and has filed patent applications on other BMP 
proteins. 
</P>
<P>
Investors welcomed the news about Genetics Institute, which last week suffered 
a setback. Wellcome PLC withdrew from a deal with Genetics Institute to develop 
TPA -- a blood-clot-dissolving drug -- because of a continuing patent fight 
with Genentech of South San Francisco. Genetics Institute also continues to be 
embroiled in a patent fight with Amgen of Thousand Oaks over U. S. marketing 
rights to erythropoietin, or EPO, a drug that helps fight off anemia in 
patients with problems such as kidney disease. 
</P>
<P>
In over-the-counter trading Monday, Genetics Institute closed at $38, up 
$1.875. 
</P>
<P>
"This relationship provides a tremendous opportunity for us to accelerate our 
development of bone-growth-factor products and to participate significantly in 
profits from potential future sales of such products on a worldwide basis," 
Gabriel Schmergel, Genetics Institute's president and chief executive, said in 
a prepared statement. The agreement allows the company to keep exclusive 
worldwide manufacturing rights and exclusive North American marketing rights to 
BMP products. 
</P>
<P>
"Yamanouchi will benefit from participation in the commercialization of one of 
the pharmaceuticals industry's next major growth fields, as well as potential 
future products coming out of Genetics Institute's pipeline," said Shigeo 
Morioka, Yamanouchi chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Yamanouchi, one of Japan's largest drug companies, has made other deals with 
U.S. companies -- it purchased Shaklee Corp.'s Japanese unit.

Yeutter Criticizes Japanese Minister: Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter blasted his 
Japanese counterpart Tomio Yamamoto for reportedly saying the United States had 
interfered in Japan's internal affairs by suggesting it liberalize its 
protected rice market. "I am very troubled by these comments, " he said in a 
letter to the Japanese agriculture minister that was made public. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter also sought a meeting with the Japanese official to discuss the issue 
further and suggested that it be held during a ministerial meeting of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris next week. He 
said Yamamoto was quoted last week in a newspaper as having said Japan would 
not tolerate further meddling by U.S. officials in its rice policy. Japan 
virtually bans imports of rice to protect its farmers from lower-priced 
imports.

T-Bill Rates Inch Up: The Treasury sold $8.4 billion of new three-month bills 
at an average discount rate of 7.74%, up from 7.67% last week. Another $8.4 
billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.79%, 
up from 7.68% last week. 
</P>
<P>
The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.00% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,804.40 and 8.22% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,604.00. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value. In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield for 
one-year T-bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate 
mortgages, fell to 8.24% last week, down from 8.36% the previous week.

Bieber Outlines Bargaining Plan: United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber 
outlined a five-point bargaining plan for this summer's Big Three contract 
negotiations in the opening speech at the UAW's three-day bargaining convention 
in Kansas City, Mo.

Bargaining with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. begins 
in July. Bieber ticked off a list of bargaining priorities for when the union 
sits down with the Big Three shortly after Independence Day. Topping the list, 
as expected, were job and income security, followed by wage and benefit 
increases and maintenance of health-care benefits.

ROSEWOOD WANTS EX-ALLSTATE CHIEF ON 1ST EXECUTIVE BOARD 
</P>

First Executive Corp.'s third-largest and often dissident shareholder, Rosewood 
Financial, proposed that First Executive's seven-member board be expanded by 
one and that Donald F. Craib Jr., former chairman and chief executive of 
Allstate Insurance Group, be given a seat. 
</P>
<P>
Rosewood, the Dallas-based investment arm of heiress Caroline Rose Hunt, owns a 
9.9% stake in First Executive. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive's board earlier this year rejected a proposal by Rosewood to 
buy the company for $6 per share in cash and stock. One condition of the 
rejected offer was that Fred Carr, First Executive's chairman and chief 
executive, resign. 
</P>
<P>
Rosewood's proposal to put Craib on the board was contained in a letter 
disclosed Monday in a filing by Rosewood with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. The letter notes that when Craib retired as head of Allstate in 
1986, he "won praise from a broad range of industry, financial and media 
observers" and helped dramatically increase its life insurance business. 
Allstate is a unit of Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Rosewood said adding Craib to the board would improve the 
company's public image and help restore the confidence of policyholders and 
investors. First Executive's stock price and life insurance business have been 
hurt substantially by the drastic decline in market value of the company's junk 
bond investments. 
</P>
<P>
A First Executive spokesman said the suggestion will be reviewed at the next 
board meeting. The spokesman declined to comment on whether the company might 
go along with it. 
</P>
<P>
Rosewood declined to say if it is considering mounting a proxy fight to seat 
Craib if First Executive refuses. A spokesman said the firm is still weighing 
whether to make another attempt to gain control of First Executive. "We're 
still examining our alternatives," he said.

HUD OFFICIAL TO HEAD BAILOUT AGENCY'S BOARD

Peter H. Monroe, a Housing and Urban Development official and former Florida 
developer, was appointed president of the Resolution Trust Corp.'s Oversight 
Board, a key policy-making agency in the thrift cleanup effort, the agency said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe, 46, whose appointment takes effect June 11, succeeds William Taylor, 
who has been acting head of the agency since February, when former Oversight 
Board President Daniel Kearney abruptly resigned in a dispute with Bush 
Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who will return to his job as the Federal Reserve Board's top banking 
regulator, was recently mentioned by President Bush as a possible successor to 
L. William Seidman as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe has been HUD's general deputy assistant secretary and deputy 
commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration for the past year. Before 
joining HUD, he was president of Rutenberg Commercial Developers in Clearwater, 
Fla., where he has held various positions since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Monroe's extensive experience in real estate and finance make him an 
excellent choice to assume this critical leadership role at the Oversight 
Board," said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who chairs the Oversight 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
The Oversight Board's other four members include Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said Monroe has had a key role in reforming HUD's insured and assisted 
housing programs, which were plagued by influence-peddling and other scandals 
during the Reagan Administration. Monroe, a native of Grosse Pointe, Mich., is 
also a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The Oversight Board acts as the voice of the Bush Administration in determining 
policy for the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created last summer to 
dispose of hundreds of insolvent savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC is operating more than 300 other insolvent institutions and has 
liquidated, sold or transferred the federally insured deposits of 110 other 
dead thrifts.

DOW SPURTS 25 TO 4TH RECORD IN 6 SESSIONS 
</P>

<P>
The stock market roared to a record high for the fourth time in six sessions 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy buying in technology and consumer issues helped it resume its upward 
course after a brief lapse Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials climbed 24.77 points, or 0.88%, to close 
at 2,844.68, eclipsing the previous peak set Thursday -- 2,831.71. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. A total of 997 
were up, 538 down and 486 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 166.28 million shares, against 162.52 million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of an 11.80-point decline in the Dow index Friday, stock prices 
started the day weaker. They picked up speed by late morning as computer-driven 
program buying kicked in. The Dow climbed as high as 31 points during the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
As in previous rallies, buyers were attracted to familiar names, especially in 
technology -- IBM, Digital Equipment and Microsoft, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of leadership . . . this is what you love to see," said Alfred 
Goldman, director of technical research at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were encouraged by the breadth of the rally. It reached the broader 
averages and the over-the-counter stocks that have languished as blue chips 
have roared to record highs. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the market advanced when government reports indicated that inflation 
was easing -- a sign that the Federal Reserve would have more room to lower 
interest rates. Lower rates stimulate business activity and tend to boost stock 
and bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, saying declarations of a bull market are premature, expects the Dow to 
fluctuate for awhile in a narrow range. He believes that the 30-share index 
could rise to 2,900 or 2,950 before a substantial downturn. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being lifted to the top of a nine-month trading range," he said. "I 
don't think fundamentally or technically the underpinnings justify the start of 
a new bull market." 
</P>
<P>
William LeFevre, market strategist at Advest Group Inc., disagreed. "I think 
the market is going a lot higher. I think the fundamentals are there." 
</P>
<P>
In individual issues Monday, Philip Morris rose 3/4 to 44 1/2, IBM gained 1 5/8 
to 117, General Motors advanced 1 1/8 to 49 and Boeing added 1 1/4 to 79 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Among high-tech stocks, National Semiconductor gained 1/2 to 8 1/4, Advanced 
Micro Devices rose 3/8 to 10 3/4 and Compaq Computer climbed 2 3/4 to 121 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, which is expected to unveil an important new software package today, 
jumped 2 to 70 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
American Cyanamid's shares were up 1 7/8 to 56 3/4 on speculation that it may 
be a takeover target of Procter &amp; Gamble. P&amp;G, which forecast a strong 
1990, rose 1 1/8 to 77 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Cable television stocks gained on growing beliefs that new industry regulations 
will be less onerous than previously thought. Telecommunications Inc., the 
nation's biggest cable-TV company, added 1 1/8 to 15 7/8. Second-ranked Time 
Warner jumped 4 to 99 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana General Services jumped 3 1/8 to 20 1/4. The company agreed to be 
acquired by Citizens Utilities Co. through an exchange of each Louisiana 
General share for about 0.67 of a Citizens Class B share. 
</P>
<P>
Harnischfeger fell 1 3/4 to 19 7/8. The company reported earnings for the 
fiscal quarter ended April 30 of 55 cents a share, against 53 cents in the 
comparable period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks were down at the close but off their lows as most buyers and 
sellers watched from the sidelines. The key 225-share Nikkei index closed down 
248.67 points, or 0.78%, to 31,765.05. 
</P>
<P>
Prices advanced on the London Stock Exchange, pushed higher by strength in the 
stock-index futures market. Trading was light. The Financial Times 100-stock 
index rose 13 points to 2,282.1. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, West Germany, stock prices weakened, with uncertainty about the 
future trend of interest rates and worries about German monetary union 
overshadowing positive corporate news. The DAX index of 30 blue chip stocks 
fell 32.41 to 1,811.18. 
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bonds Up on News of Budget Surplus 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury securities closed slightly higher Monday after the federal 
government reported a record budget surplus for April. 
</P>
<P>
The government's bellwether 30-year bond rose 1/8 point, or about $1.25 per 
$1,000. That dropped its yield to 8.68% from 8.69% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Shorter-term issues also rose slightly in quiet trading. 
</P>
<P>
Steven A. Wood, economist for BankAmerica Capital Markets in San Francisco, 
attributed the modest increases to April's larger-than-expected budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department said a surge in income tax payments helped the 
government post a $42.52-billion budget surplus last month, cutting the deficit 
for the fiscal year that started last Oct. 1 to $108.34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The report made people think that the underlying deficit situation isn't quite 
as bad as initially thought," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Wood said activity was very light. Many traders, he said, are awaiting 
economic data to be released later this week, including revised figures on 
first-quarter growth in the gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was 8.188%, unchanged from late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Interest Speculation Sends Dollar Higher 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained ground in worldwide foreign exchange as traders speculated 
that U.S. interest rates would hold steady for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the market believes that the Federal Reserve will decide 
against easing credit policy anytime soon, and that should keep interest rates 
at their current levels. Higher rates tend to support a currency. 
</P>
<P>
Also boosting the dollar, particularly against the West German mark, were 
reports of political discord in West Germany over reunification plans with East 
Germany, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gabriele Schmitt, a corporate dealer for Bank of New York, downplayed 
Monday's dollar advance. She said trading was so light before the Memorial Day 
holiday that any movement in the dollar might have been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
"There really is not any liquidity in the market to have a reasonable trading 
pattern," she said. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Soybean Prices Continue to Erode 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade, continuing a 
recent trend linked to weather conditions and greater availability of South 
American supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Grain futures also retreated in Chicago. On other commodity markets, energy 
futures tumbled, precious metals were mixed and livestock and meat futures were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures settled 10 to 11.75 cents lower, with the contract for delivery 
in July at $6.105 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures ended 2.50 to 3 cents lower, with July at $3.37 a bushel; May 
corn was 4.50 to 5.25 cents lower, with July at $2.77 a bushel, and oats were 
2.50 cents to 3.25 cents lower, with July at $1.5125 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
All contracts for May deliveries of grains and soybeans expired at noon Monday. 
The May soybean contract went off the board at $6.045 a bushel, May wheat 
expired at $3.835, May corn at $2.80 and May oats at $1.445. 
</P>
<P>
July soybeans have dropped by 50 cents a bushel since May 10, when the 
Agriculture Department issued a report projecting a bountiful 1990 harvest of 
1.9 billion bushels and an increase in the U.S. soybean stockpile. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said rising South American soybean exports have bolstered perceptions 
that Brazil and Argentina can handle current global demand -- and at prices 
generally lower than in the United States.

BYE, BYE GRAMMY -- NEW YORK TO HOST '91 SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
AWARDS: THE BIG LOSS FOR LOS ANGELES IS TOURIST DOLLARS LURED BY THE SHOW. NEW 
YORK LAST HELD THE EVENT IN 1988.

<P>
New York City is the winner of the 1991 Grammys, leaving Los Angeles as the 
loser. 
</P>
<P>
The National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences announced on Monday that 
the music industry's most prestigious awards will be handed out in New York's 
Radio City Music Hall in late February. All but four of the Grammys' 32 awards 
shows had been in Los Angeles, including the two most recent, held at the 
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. New York hosted the Grammys in 1988, 1981, 
1974 and 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a New York press conference featuring appearances 
by NARAS president Michael Greene and New York Mayor David Dinkins, who touted 
the decision as "a vote of confidence in our city and for our city's future" 
and promised "the biggest and best celebration in the history of the Grammys." 
</P>
<P>
This is a triumph for New York, which has lobbied heavily for the Grammys to 
alternate between the two cities, if not move permanently to the Big Apple, 
though Greene gave no hints as to the future of the show beyond next year. 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles, which has campaigned just as concertedly to be the sole host, 
it represents a significant blow. 
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously disappointed by the decision," said Bill Chandler, 
spokesperson for Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who is on a trade mission in 
Korea and Japan. "But it is clear that Los Angeles, home of the Oscar ceremony 
and a number of other awards proceedings, is the true entertainment capital of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
Chandler also expressed confidence that the Grammys will return to Los Angeles 
soon, noting that NARAS is based here and continues to work with the city on 
various educational and industry development projects. 
</P>
<P>
Shell Ausman, chairman of Mayor Bradley's Grammy host committee, said he wasn't 
surprised by the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all suspicious that NARAS might have to succumb to the pressure of its 
New York members," he said, citing tourism dollars as the biggest loss. "The 
Grammys attracts a lot of people for that week." 
</P>
<P>
Ausman predicted that New York's harsher winter weather will continue to give 
Los Angeles an advantage in the competition between the cities for the awards 
show. 
</P>
<P>
But MCA Music Group chairman Al Teller, now a member of the Los Angeles host 
committee but a former member of the New York committee while he was president 
of New York-based Columbia Records in the mid-'80s, believes the trend may be 
toward more of an even split.

ARTIST SUES THE REV. WILDMON OVER MAILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A New York artist filed a federal court suit Monday against a right-wing 
political organization that sent severely cropped versions of 14 of his images 
to members of Congress, religious broadcasters and thousands of church pastors 
labeled, "WARNING! Extremely Offensive Material Enclosed." 
</P>
<P>
The action by multimedia artist David Wojnarowicz named as defendants the 
American Family Assn., based in Tupelo, Miss., and its director, the Rev. 
Donald Wildmon. Wildmon and his group have led an offensive against the 
National Endowment for the Arts. The conservative opponents have accused the 
NEA of funding pornography by giving grants to half-a-dozen exhibits, two 
featuring Wojnarowicz work. 
</P>
<P>
The Wojnarowicz suit seeks damages of "in excess of $1 million" for copyright 
violation, defamation of character and violation of a New York state law that 
seeks to protect artists against unauthorized alteration and dissemination of 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon could not be reached for comment at the American Family Assn.'s 
Mississippi headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The court action is believed to be the first direct attempt by an artist to 
strike back through litigation at any of the foes of the NEA. As such, it 
appeared to represent a major tactical development in the crisis over federal 
funding of the arts and a larger debate over artistic freedom of expression 
that has escalated sharply during the last 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
But, at the same time, some prominent arts attorneys said they were concerned 
that the Wojnarowicz lawsuit involves significant risks of failure -- 
especially on the claim of copyright infringement. They said, Wildmon may 
easily be able to defend himself under a legal doctrine known as "fair use," 
which says reproduction of copyrighted materials can be tolerated if the public 
interest is served and the reproduction does not engage in economic competition 
with the original work. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Duke Biederman, an attorney for the New York-based Volunteer Lawyers for 
the Arts, said Wojnarowicz's strongest case may be the defamation count, with 
the copyright infringement accusation the weakest. By and large, however, arts 
lawyers praised Wojnarowicz's decision, saying the filing of the litigation 
takes the political controversy over arts funding and censorship into an 
appropriate forum for at least partial resolution of the blistering dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a bona fide wrong here that needs to be resolved between the 
parties," said Duke Biederman. Filing the action, she said, "does sharpen the 
swords." But, at the same time, Duke Biederman said the risks for artists at 
large are great if Wojnarowicz should lose. "It would not only be a loss for 
that artist. It would be a loss for all artists," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a very dangerous thing, a terrible thing (Wildmon) did," 
Wojnarowicz said in a telephone interview from his Manhattan apartment. "I 
think he needs to be challenged on it. The nature of the mailing is basically 
destroying work of mine and cutting it up and coming up with a series of images 
that wholly misrepresented my work, and then putting my name on it. 
</P>
<P>
"He essentially portrays me as a banal pornographer," said Wojnarowicz. "I'm 
just beginning to show outside of New York. Once a museum sees something like 
that (the American Family Assn. mailing), the assumption will be that this is 
the essence of what I do." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Weil, deputy director of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 
Washington and an arts law expert, asserted that the Wojnarowicz suit clears 
the way for making an argument in court that conservatives "may just be beating 
up on artists incident to a larger agenda. I think artists ought not to permit 
themselves to be beaten up upon." 
</P>
<P>
The Wojnarowicz suit was prepared by a battery of private New York lawyers and 
attorneys for the nonprofit Center for Constitutional Rights. It attacks a 
Wildmon mailing that has emerged as one of the centerpieces of a renewed 
assault on the NEA by the American Family Assn. and several conservative 
congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
In his court papers, Wojnarowicz seeks an injunction barring Wildmon from 
distributing additional copies of the cropped artworks and from even calling 
the pictures in question Wojnarowicz's work. The artist asked U.S. District 
Court Judge William Conner to order the remaining copies of the American Family 
Assn. materials impounded and order an audit of contributions received from the 
mailing. 
</P>
<P>
In the version of the mailing sent to most members of the House and Senate, 
Wildmon wrote that the materials were being sent to 3,200 "Christian leaders," 
1,100 Christian radio and television stations and 178,000 pastors. "I think you 
will be as offended by the photos as the average American voter is," Wildmon 
wrote in a cover letter dated April 12. 
</P>
<P>
Artists immediately applauded the decision by Wojnarowicz to sue Wildmon and 
his group, which last year and earlier this year attacked the work of two other 
artists whose work appeared in exhibits supported by the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that artists start to fight back," said Nan Goldin, a New York 
artist who served as curator of a controversial show involving Wojnarowicz's 
work last year. "It does me good as an artist to see David taking control of 
this. I think it's a powerful example for other artists." 
</P>
<P>
"Wojnarowicz's work has been totally misrepresented," said Susan Wyatt, 
director of the New York gallery Artists Space, which hosted the show last year 
and became embroiled in the NEA controversy when arts endowment Chairman John 
E. Frohnmayer rescinded, but later restored, a $10,000 grant to support the 
show, "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing." "It is terrific that he has taken 
this step," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildmon mailing extracted small segments of 14 images from Wojnarowicz 
paintings, photographs and multimedia collages included in "Tongues of Flame," 
a one-man show at Illinois State University in Normal, Ill. The exhibit closed 
in March, a month before the Wildmon mailing was distributed. The show received 
$15,000 in NEA funding. 
</P>
<P>
Like the majority of Wojnarowicz's work, "Tongues of Flame" is dominated by the 
artists's rage at the plight of AIDS victims. Some of the pieces include 
sexually explicit elements among larger, complex montages and other treatments 
of the AIDS themes. 
</P>
<P>
Wojnarowicz has AIDS. He has been active in a variety of AIDS-prevention 
programs. Ironically, Wojnarowicz said, one of the images described as 
offensive by Wildmon is a still from a video intended to promote safe sex 
techniques among gay men. The freeze-frame shows two bare-chested men disco 
dancing -- but contains no sexually explicit image. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the images in the Wildmon mailing represent drastically cropped 
segments of other Wojnarowicz works. Two of the images are 8-by-10-inch 
sections of a larger work that is 6-by-9 feet overall.

'PEAKS,' 'CHINA BEACH' MAKE PRIME-TIME CUT; 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAMMING: ABC TAKES ANOTHER INNOVATIVE STEP BY SCHEDULING STEVEN BOCHCO'S 
'COP ROCK.' FIVE OTHER NEW SERIES WILL BE IN THE FALL LINEUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
ABC renewed two of its ratings-troubled but prestigious series, the cult soap 
opera "Twin Peaks" and the Vietnam War drama "China Beach," as it announced its 
fall prime-time lineup Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The network also took another step in enhancing its reputation for innovation 
by scheduling the Steven Bochco musical police drama, "Cop Rock," an hour 
series that is the latest of the producer's breakthrough efforts, which have 
included "Hill Street Blues" and "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, ABC finally found a companion show for its hit series "America's 
Funniest Home Videos." It is "America's Funniest . . . Part II," described as a 
"cross-country comedy tour" that seeks out people telling jokes, doing 
impersonations and demonstrating "their unique talents." Both shows are from 
producer Vin Di Bona, and they each finished among the top three programs in 
last week's national TV ratings. 
</P>
<P>
In scheduling six new series -- four comedies and two dramas -- that make up 
four hours of new programming, ABC also canceled several other series that 
attempted the unusual. "Brewster Place," which stars Oprah Winfrey in a 
half-hour drama about an inner-city black community in the 1960s, did not make 
the fall lineup. Nor did "Anything But Love," a witty romantic comedy starring 
Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
ABC previously yanked "Elvis," a critically praised ratings failure about the 
early days of Elvis Presley's career. Another praised series, "The Marshall 
Chronicles," a Woody Allen-ish comedy about a teen-age boy's adventures in New 
York City, did not make the fall lineup either. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the steadily sinking ratings of "Twin Peaks," which attracted only 17% 
of the national audience last week, ABC was virtually certain to bring back the 
show because of the phenomenal praise from critics and word-of-mouth generated 
by the show. 
</P>
<P>
"China Beach," which stars Emmy-winner Dana Delaney, reportedly was a closer 
call, but ABC has been under pressure to renew the series by the grass-roots 
organization Viewers for Quality Television, among other admirers. 
</P>
<P>
ABC clearly is trying to make an event of the weekly outings of "China Beach" 
and "Twin Peaks" by pairing the two shows back-to-back from 9 to 11 p.m. 
Saturdays. However, they also will run up against NBC's all-powerful Saturday 
comedy lineup that includes "The Golden Girls," "Empty Nest" and the new Carol 
Burnett series, "Carol &amp; Company." 
</P>
<P>
Beside "Cop Rock" and "America's Funniest . . . Part II," ABC's new fall series 
are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Baby Talk," a comedy based on the hit movie "Look Who's Talking"' and 
starring Connie Sellecca as a single mother trying to raise her child and find 
him a perfect father. The baby's thoughts will be expressed by Tony Danza, star 
of "Who's the Boss?," which will precede "Baby Talk" on Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Married People," a sitcom about three generations of couples who share a 
New York brownstone. The cast includes Bess Armstrong, Jay Thomas, Ray Aranha 
and Barbara Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Going Places," a comedy about four young people who move to Los Angeles to 
work on a "candid video" series. Astonishingly, "Going Places" gives producers 
Tom Miller and Bob Boyett four half-hour sitcoms that will run back-to-back on 
ABC's Friday schedule. The others are "Full House," "Family Matters" and 
"Perfect Strangers." The cast of "Going Places" includes Heather Locklear and 
Jerry Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Gabriel's Fire," an hour drama starring James Earl Jones as an ex-convict 
who becomes an investigator for a defense attorney (Lalla Robins) who gets him 
released from jail. 
</P>
<P>
ABC also renewed another prestigious series with less-than-spectacular ratings, 
"Life Goes On," which deals with a family that has a son (Chris Burke) with 
Down's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
But the network's casualties included the "ABC Saturday Mystery Movie," a 
rotating series that included Peter Falk in a revival of "Columbo," Burt 
Reynolds in "B.L. Stryker," Telly Savalas in a new version of "Kojak" and 
Jaclyn Smith in "Christine Cromwell." Reports were that "Columbo," the most 
successful of the shows, might return as a series of specials. 
</P>
<P>
Also dropped from the fall schedule were "Equal Justice," an admired series 
about a group of young prosectors, and "Head of the Class," a successful sitcom 
-- but ABC said both shows will continue in production as backup entries. 
</P>
<P>
Other ABC series failing to return from this season are "Capital News," "Free 
Spirit," "Living Dolls," "Mr. Belvedere," "Mission: Impossible," "H.E.L.P.," 
"Homeroom," "Just the Ten of Us" and "Sunset Beat." 
</P>
<P>
Along with "Twin Peaks," "Cop Rock" clearly marks an attempt by ABC to present 
a new kind of television. The music for the pilot was written by Randy Newman, 
and the network describes the series as "part opera, part rock concert and part 
intense drama." It will be broadcast from 10 to 11 p.m. Wednesdays, and the 
cast includes Ronny Cox, Barbara Bosson, Larry Joshua and Annie Marie Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
In "Cop Rock," Los Angeles police deal with "the constant trial of street 
crime," says ABC. A description from Bochco's office Monday said that the show 
"uses musical scenes as it follows the activities of the Los Angeles Police 
Department and its interactions with the city's political and criminal justice 
systems." 
</P>
<P>
With "Twin Peaks," ABC has attracted the young audience desired by sponsors and 
is presenting the unique vision of one of the world's hottest directors, David 
Lynch. Known for such films as "Blue Velvet," "Elephant Man" and "Eraserhead," 
his latest motion picture, "Wild at Heart," on Monday won the Golden Palm award 
at the Cannes film festival. 
</P>
<P>
The mixture of humor and horror in "Twin Peaks," which has revolved around the 
murder of a young woman in a small town in the Northwest, has been hailed as a 
TV work that looks like no other. Seen in the past on Thursdays, the season 
finale will be broadcast Wednesday at 10 p.m., and ABC obviously hopes the 
renewal of the series -- and interest in whether the murder will be solved -- 
will attract a large audience and build the audience in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
An ABC spokesman said that "Twin Peaks" has become "almost symbolic" of what 
the network's entertainment president, Bob Iger, "wants to bring to the 
company. It represents a whole new look for a particular program." 
</P>
<P>
Here is the night-by-night schedule: 
</P>
<P>
Sunday: "Life Goes On," "America's Funniest Home Videos," "America's Funniest . 
. . Part II," "ABC Sunday Night Movie." 
</P>
<P>
Monday: "Monday Night Football," "MacGyver." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday: "Who's the Boss?," "Baby Talk," "Roseanne," "Coach," 
"thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday: "The Wonder Years," "Growing Pains," "Doogie Howser, M.D.," "Married 
People," "Cop Rock." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday: "Father Dowling Mysteries," "Gabriel's Fire," "PrimeTime Live." 
</P>
<P>
Friday: "Full House," "Family Matters," "Perfect Strangers," "Going Places," 
20/20." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday: "Young Riders," "China Beach," "Twin Peaks."

BIG DAY AND NIGHT FOR DAVID LYNCH; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: THE DIRECTOR'S 'WILD AT HEART' WINS THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL GOLD PALM. 
AT THE SAME TIME, ABC-TV PICKS UP 'TWIN PEAKS' FOR THE FALL SEASON.

<TEXT>
<P>
David Lynch's "Wild at Heart," an erotic and violent black comedy about a young 
Southern couple's attempt to escape the woman's mother and an assortment of 
hired killers, was named the best picture of the 43rd Cannes Film Festival on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was a good day all around for the director. News of Lynch's Cannes win came 
at about the same time that ABC-TV announced that his quirky prime-time soap 
opera "Twin Peaks" will be returning in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
As is usually the case with the demonstrative international crowd, the 
announcement of "Wild at Heart" as the 1990 Gold Palm winner drew a mixture of 
cheers and jeers. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch's film, a twisted tale that blends flashbacks and fantasies with ironic 
dialogue and often graphic sex and violence, would seem to defy translation. 
And it was up against two very popular French films -- Bertrand Tavernier's 
"Daddy Nostalgie," and Jean-Paul Rappeneau's "Cyrano de Bergerac." 
</P>
<P>
It also marks the second year in a row that an American film has won here. 
Steven Soderbergh's "sex, lies, and videotape" was the 1989 Gold Palm 
recipient. This year's Gold Palm for best short film also went to an American 
film, Columbia University student Adam Davidson's "The Lunch Date." 
</P>
<P>
The Samuel Goldwyn Co. has picked up "Wild at Heart" and will open the film in 
the U.S. on Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Academy Awards, where directors are usually honored with their 
films, Cannes invariably splits those awards and this year the jury -- headed 
by Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci -- named Pavel Lounguine best director 
for the Soviet-French co-production "Taxi Blues." 
</P>
<P>
Gerard Depardieu, the popular French actor who has been many times a contender 
but never before a winner, was named best actor for his performance in the 
title role of "Cyrano de Bergerac." Poland's Krystyna Janda was named best 
actress for her role in "The Interrogation," a story about a Polish singer 
imprisoned as a suspected spy during the height of post-World War II Stalinist 
paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
"The Interrogation" was made eight years ago and banned in Poland until last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Special jury prizes, which are seen as runner-up awards, were presented to 
Soviet director Gleb Panfilov for "Matz" ("The Mother"), adapted from a Maxim 
Gorky story about a woman's anguish over her son's radicalization in czarist 
Russia, and to British director Ken Loach for "Hidden Agenda," a controversial 
political drama that depicts an act of terrorism by British secret agents in 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Two other awards for originality went to Burkina Faso director Idrissa 
Quedraogo's "Tilai" ("The Rule") and Japanese director Kohei Oguri's "Shi No 
Toge" ("The Sting of Death"). 
</P>
<P>
Although Lynch's film was the highlight of the festival for the American press, 
its winning of the Gold Palm caught many by surprise and obviously disappointed 
the bulk of the non-English critics. By the estimation of three panels of 
critics who were polled daily to rate the films in competition, the favorites 
were Lounguine's "Taxi Blues," a story of class conflict told through the 
love-hate relationship between a Moscow cab driver and a Jewish musician; 
Tavernier's "Daddy Nostalgie," about a young woman's reunion with her dying 
father; and Rappeneau's lavish production of "Cyrano de Bergerac." 
</P>
<P>
Italian director Gieuseppe Tornatore's "Everything's Fine," the story of an 
aging Italian widower (Marcello Mastroianni) who makes a painful round of 
visits to his five grown children, was also a big favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Commercially, Alan Parker's "Come See the Paradise" may prove to be the most 
successful film to come out of Cannes. The film, a sentimental interracial love 
story set against the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, was 
one of the festival's biggest crowd pleasers (along with "Cyrano de Bergerac") 
and has all the elements that make for Oscar contenders. 
</P>
<P>
"Come See the Paradise" stars Dennis Quaid and Tamlyn Tomita and is scheduled 
for release in December by Columbia-Tri-Star. "Wild at Heart," which co-stars 
Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern, is scheduled to open Aug. 17 in 100 theaters and 
go wide Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
There were three other American films in the Directors Fortnight, a side 
competition whose entries often overshadow the Gold Palm program. The Directors 
Fortnight is where Spike Lee ("She's Gotta Have It") and James Jarmusch 
("Stranger Than Paradise") were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Whit Stillman's "Metropolitan," a comedy about upscale young Manhattanites, was 
clearly the most talked-about American film in the Fortnight, and there were 
turn-away crowds at most screenings. Charles Burnett's "To Sleep With Anger," a 
film about disrupted family life in South-Central Los Angeles, was 
well-received here.

PROJECT ANGEL FOOD AUCTION IS HEAVENLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Can a benefit be too successful? That was the question Sunday afternoon at the 
Ace Gallery, where Project Angel Food held its first Angel Art auction. More 
than 350 paintings and photographs have been donated to the group, which cooks 
and delivers daily hot homemade meals to AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Mapplethorpe were among the names 
on the wall, and those who were there in person were a starry list too: 
honorary chairpersons Anthony Perkins and Berry Berenson, Marisa Berenson, 
Michael York, Howard Hesseman, Teri Garr, Nancy Walker, Mickey Rourke, Penny 
Marshall, Lesley Ann Warren, Jimmy Smits, Roddy McDowall (whose portrait of 
Elizabeth Taylor was valued at $1,000), Stefanie Powers, Dawn Steel, Barry 
Diller, Carrie Fisher, and Elizabeth Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,500 people showed up when only 600 had been expected, according 
to organizers. Halls were packed solid, oxygen was scarce, and the crush sent 
at least one artwork crashing to the floor. Even Wilshire Boulevard became 
crowded when some art lover abandoned a BMW in the street for the valets. Too 
bad he or she left it running with the keys locked inside. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little worried about people being uncomfortable," said Project Angel 
Food president Marianne Williamson, but most guests seemed to take it in good 
humor, penciling bids and sampling food from local restaurants. Prices ranged 
from some photographs in the $100 range to a David Hockney gouache estimated at 
$45,000. If the group can solve its logistic problems, Angel Art stands a good 
chance of becoming a staple on the L.A. fund-raising scene.

SHARE REAPS BENEFITS OF ANNUAL BOOMTOWN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For 36 years SHARE (Share Happily and Reap Endlessly) has thrown its 
Western-themed Boomtown party -- a chance to leave the gowns and jewels in the 
vault and drag out the denim and leather. (This being Los Angeles, much of the 
denim and leather costs more than the usual silks and sequins.) 
</P>
<P>
This year's event, held Saturday night at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, 
featured a raffle and auction with Marjoe Gortner at the mike enthusiastically 
conjuring up memories of his child evangelist days as he squeezed bids from the 
party-goers. "Say hallelujah!" he screamed at the crowd. "We're going to have a 
good time tonight because I feel the spirit!" His exhortations brought top bids 
for unusual merchandise, like dinner for 50, prepared by Wolfgang Puck -- which 
went for $22,000. 
</P>
<P>
The SHARE women were dressed in identical black suede dresses with silver 
buckles. Ann Miller wore red suede and a gold lame shirt; Marvin Davis wore a 
brown bomber jacket. Also there: Ed Begley Jr. and Camilla Sparv, Milton Berle, 
Tom Bosley, Bruce Boxleitner, Stephen J. Cannell, Jackie Collins, Barbara and 
Marvin Davis, Suzanne de Passe, Kirk Douglas, Freddie Fields, Budd Friedman, 
Ava and Chuck Fries, Constance Towers and John Gavin, David Horowitz, Quincy 
Jones, David Nelson, Madlyn Rhue, Ann Jeffreys and Cesar Romero, Jaclyn Smith, 
Candy and Aaron Spelling, Rosemarie and Robert Stack, Loretta Swit and Cristina 
Ferrare and Tony Thomopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
The auction was followed by a dinner party chaired by Sandra Scully, and a 
revue chaired by Abbe Lane Leff, who assembled singers Wayne Newton, Marilyn 
McCoo and Clint Holmes, as well as the children's group Universal Dance 
Theater.

RODEO DRIVE GETS A LITTLE TASTE OF ISLAND CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive is normally just an island of consumer excess. 
Sunday it was the scene of Island Carnaval, the Concern Foundation's 16th 
annual block party combining every type of island culture except Manhattan's. 
</P>
<P>
Jamaican music, Hawaiian dancers and Polynesian thatched huts were all part of 
the afternoon event, which was chaired by Rebecca Golden and designed by Arthur 
Simon. 
</P>
<P>
It raised $750,000 for the foundation's work in funding cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
"You start with a street and you end up with a party," is the way Concern 
co-founder Larry Powell described the work of 300 volunteers who began 
decorating at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Although the street was transformed with splashes of color in balloons and 
banners evoking the Caribbean, it was the more traditional Rodeo Drive pursuits 
of shopping and eating that occupied the 3,000-strong crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Lavish buffets were provided gratis by five local caterers -- Somerset, Just 
Off Melrose, L.A. Celebrations, Parties Plus and Someone's in the Kitchen -- 
and there was an extensive silent auction with everything from cosmetic dental 
bleaching (a $200 value) to New York vacations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance to shop and feel your money is doing some good," said Golden. 
</P>
<P>
It was also a chance to drink and have celebs do the pouring. Among the two 
dozens celebrity bartenders were Suzanne Pleshette, Lloyd Bridges, Maria 
Conchita Alonso, Della Reese, Mary Ann Mobley and Ed Asner, who said mixing 
drinks was "a good upper body activity."

The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council will meet Friday and 
Saturday to discuss a peace plan for Cambodia, according to U.N. diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Britain and China 
will hold the session, their fourth on the topic this year, to try to devise a 
plan for ending the 10-year-old Cambodian civil war. 
</P>
<P>
They are still far apart on issues such as how to disarm the combatants, how 
much of the current Vietnam-backed government in Phnom Penh would have to be 
dismantled and who could take part in any future elections. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals foresee the largest peacekeeping operation in U.N. history, with the 
world body supplying troops and temporarily taking over some of the functions 
of the government.

<P>
Here in the urban rain forest that is Britain's capital city, the once-hallowed 
umbrella is in danger of becoming little more than a means of staying dry. 
</P>
<P>
Although still a symbol of prim and proper Britishness, the umbrella's 
importance as a required accessory for the fashionable gentleman or lady is 
diminishing. These days it's thought of mostly as a tool, a piece of equipment 
that gets the job done. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days when no respectable Englishman ventured forth, rain or shine, 
without his bowler hat and slim, black "brolly," as umbrellas are casually 
known here. 
</P>
<P>
The bowler has been disappearing for decades and has now taken on something of 
a quaint air. The umbrella is in no danger of disappearing, mind you. Sales are 
brisk, and the local weather -- coming as no surprise to Londoners -- is 
expected to remain awful. But the umbrella's devaluation in social importance 
marks a dramatic change for a country built so firmly on tradition. 
</P>
<P>
A casual survey on the streets of London shows that, unless it's wet, few 
people feel it necessary to traverse the city with umbrella in hand. When 
someone is carrying one, it's often brightly colored or extremely short -- not 
at all the famous sleek, black model that could double as a walking stick. The 
favored model today is the compact umbrella with pullout handle that can fit 
easily into a briefcase or decent-sized handbag. 
</P>
<P>
"These days, everything is much more informal," says David Williamson, 
co-editor of Debrett's Peerage Ltd., the publisher of "Debrett's Etiquette and 
Modern Manners," Britain's definitive rulebook to proper behavior. 
</P>
<P>
So who cares about all this? Well, those in the umbrella business are paying 
careful attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Five or 10 years ago," says Trevor Palmer, managing director of Tag Umbrellas, 
"If you went down to London Bridge Station in the morning, you'd find that 30% 
or 40% of the businessmen getting off the trains had a walking-length, black, 
tightly rolled umbrella. Now you might find 5%. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't seem interested any more in brand names," Palmer goes on. "All 
they're interested in is the bottom line -- the price. Now they're looking for 
cheap and nasty umbrellas. The day of the disposable umbrella is upon us." 
</P>
<P>
A world away from cheap and nasty, on New Oxford Street in London, is James 
Smith &amp; Sons, umbrella makers and retailers since 1830. In a Victorian 
building that still retains many of the 1860s glass and wood cases, the 
umbrella store serves as a reminder that the age of the respectable gentleman 
and his proper brolly lives on here, at least. 
</P>
<P>
Employee Jonathan Wardle describes the store's array of tasteful umbrellas. The 
normal length for a gentleman's umbrella is 25 inches, he says, but they can be 
tailored to suit. 
</P>
<P>
Wardle's expert advice for umbrella care: Keep a brolly rolled tightly when not 
in use, but never roll it until it's dry. That means leaving the umbrella open 
indoors until the water has dripped off and evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
The people Wardle meets each day are umbrella connoisseurs who uphold British 
brolly tradition. "A lot of gentlemen would feel naked without their 
umbrellas," says Wardle.

THE MURKY POTION IS CALLED UNICUM. AFTER WAR, COMMUNISM AND EXILE, THE FAMILY 
THAT DISTILLS IT IS BACK IN BUSINESS, AND ALL HUNGARY IS TOASTING THEIR HEALTH.

BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It smells like medicinal herbs, comes in a round green bottle emblazoned with a 
red cross and is said to cure everything from hangovers to the malaise that 
afflicts deal-making Hungarian businessmen after too hearty a lunch of chicken 
paprikash. 
</P>
<P>
It is Unicum, the 84-proof liqueur so hallowed that the Roman Catholic 
archbishop of Hungary keeps the secret recipe locked up in his basement safe. 
</P>
<P>
Today, exactly two centuries after the Zwack family first concocted the 
aromatic alcoholic product that Hungarians embrace as their national drink, 
Unicum has evolved into a potent symbol of the changes that have swept this 
Eastern European nation. 
</P>
<P>
Encapsulated within its murky, greenish depths are all the romance and tragedy 
of Hungary's history since 1790: revolutions and midnight border crossings to 
freedom, castles lost and, finally, family legacies regained. 
</P>
<P>
It is the last that most warms the heart of Peter Zwack, a 55-ish polyglot who 
has returned to his native Hungary to run the family business, which the 
Communists seized and nationalized in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that after 42 years in exile the surviving scion and his partners 
had to pay $1 million for the privilege. Unicum and Zwack are back in business, 
selling 4 million bottles last year (in a country with 10.5 million people) and 
posting at least 10% profits on sales of $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a big success story," says Zwack, who claims to have made back his 
entire investment in the first year. "It's no longer a business story but a 
political one. The government uses us as an example to bring in foreign 
capital." 
</P>
<P>
Slender, with the absent-minded charm of aristocrats everywhere, Zwack is a 
familiar fixture in all the power haunts of Budapest, from Parliament to the 
Hilton. He boasts equally good ties with the newly elected government and the 
hordes of businessmen stampeding into Budapest in search of investments. 
</P>
<P>
"The phone rings from 6 a.m. till midnight," Zwack says. "I had to hire a 
full-time secretary to answer calls from people, many of them U.S. companies, 
who come to me for advice." 
</P>
<P>
Zwack sees himself as a sort of "good-will ambassador to the West." But he has 
the same advice for all callers: 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them you have to be very patient." 
</P>
<P>
Patience is an art the Zwacks honed in their years abroad, after they lost the 
ancestral business that had made them one of the wealthiest and best-known 
families in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The saga begins in 1790, when Peter Zwack's great-great-somebody-or-other first 
distilled Unicum from 40 different roots and herbs. By 1840, the Zwack firm was 
making 220 liqueurs and fine fruit brandies -- for which Hungary is also 
famous. 
</P>
<P>
Unicum and the Zwacks weathered the Austro-Hungarian Empire and two world wars, 
amassing a fortune and doing their bit for the Allied cause under the nose of 
the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
When the Germans shot down Allied planes headed over Hungary to bomb the rich 
Romanian oil fields of Ploesti, Zwack's father would hide the downed pilots in 
the family castle, near Szeged in southern Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the war's end, the Zwack factory was bombed, as were the bridges that 
spanned the Danube River, connecting Buda with Pest. So the Zwacks supplied 
wooden barrels that once held spirits to help build pontoon bridges across the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
But the family smelled trouble in 1948, and as the Communists consolidated 
their power, the Zwacks fled, with patriarch Janos Zwack, Peter's father, 
hiding in an upturned oil barrel on a Russian truck whose drivers he had bribed 
to take him over the border to Austria. In his back pocket he carried the 
secret recipe for Unicum. 
</P>
<P>
Young Peter walked through Yugoslavia, arriving in Trieste on New Year's Day in 
1948. The family reunited in Milan, then migrated to New York, where they hid 
away one-quarter of the Unicum recipe in safety-deposit boxes in each of four 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Communists seized the Unicum plant and continued producing the 
liqueur domestically. But without the exact formula, the Communists could turn 
out only a pale imitation, and sales dwindled, Zwack recounts with undisguised 
pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the Zwacks had to adjust to a less genteel life style. At a 
Lexington Avenue hotel, the unsuspecting Janos Zwack, accustomed to silk shirts 
and servants, left his shoes outside the door to be shined one night, only to 
have them disappear. 
</P>
<P>
Peter, who spoke five languages, went to work as a vacuum cleaner salesmen in 
Queens but gave it up when, asked for a demonstration by a prospective client, 
he couldn't get the contraption to work. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Zwack worked his way up to Connecticut sales manager for a national 
distilling firm, married a WASP and had five children. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not one who was wallowing in homesickness," Zwack recalls. "I had 
absolutely no intention to come back to Hungary." 
</P>
<P>
Those sentiments were echoed by the Hungarian Communists, against whom the 
Zwacks filed suit after the government continued producing Unicum under the 
Zwack name. 
</P>
<P>
After years, the Zwacks won, and the family was paid royalties out of Hungarian 
government assets that had been frozen after the war. 
</P>
<P>
But although Zwack called his family and the Communists "the deadliest of 
deadly enemies," fate and glasnost were working to bring them back together. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Peter Zwack moved to Milan to run the family's Italian liqueur 
operations. He also divorced, married an Englishwoman named Anne Marshall and 
produced two more children, a son, now 15, and a daughter, 13. 
</P>
<P>
Zwack still called the Communists "gangsters" but when they invited him home in 
1988, he agreed, gambling rightly that Hungary was about to usher in a new era. 
Last year, during President Bush's visit, Zwack signed a million-dollar joint 
venture with the Hungarian state distilling firm to produce Unicum. 
</P>
<P>
Zwack and the German distilling firm Unterberg each contributed $500,000 for a 
share of 25% apiece. The state distillery got 46% -- paying for most of it with 
equipment from Zwack's original factory. A Hungarian bank and an export firm in 
Budapest each contributed 2%. 
</P>
<P>
"We bought back what was stolen from us," Zwack says somewhat heatedly over a 
lunch of salad and espresso at a posh Western-style hotel where the waiters all 
know him by name. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps you'd better not say that," urges his wife, who is a bit more of a 
diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Monetary details aside, the Hungarians welcomed back the original Unicum like a 
long-lost cultural icon. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, it had never left. Zwack says that during the hard Stalinist 
years, the famous Unicum poster -- showing an ugly, bearded man, adrift at sea, 
who grins demoniacally when a bottle of Unicum bobs by to save him -- became a 
sort of symbol of resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"In the villages, it was a poster of hope, a sort of samizdat (underground 
letter) that said, 'We won't go under,' " Zwack explains. 
</P>
<P>
The brand name also played a modest role in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, 
when freedom fighters filled empty Unicum bottles with gasoline, added wicks, 
lit them and lobbed them at Russian tanks. 
</P>
<P>
And last summer, when then-Communist Party boss Karoly Grosz was foundering 
under the accelerating pace of reforms, a well-respected economic weekly 
replaced the man in the poster with a caricature of Grosz alongside the caption 
"Not even Unicum will save Grosz now." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Zwack employs 70 people in a Budapest factory and has installed new 
equipment. Sales of the original Unicum continue to mount, with Zwack profiting 
from the growing number of tourists who want to lug back authentic Hungarian 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem we had in Italy was one of identity," Zwack says. "It's an 
enormous plus to be back in your homeland." 
</P>
<P>
Zwack, who also holds U.S. citizenship, says he distributes 10,000 bottles a 
year in the United States and plans a marketing campaign this fall to try to 
turn Unicum into an "in drink." 
</P>
<P>
The liqueur already has a small but loyal following, says Peter Matt, president 
of Winebow Inc. in New York, the nation's only importer of Unicum. 
</P>
<P>
"Your customers are people who are sophisticated, who have some understanding 
of the product. It's like fine wines," Matt says of the spicy liqueur, which 
fetches $22 for a 24-ounce bottle. 
</P>
<P>
But Zwack himself admits that Unicum -- a digestive with many of the same herbs 
as Campari, a kind of bitters -- is an acquired taste. 
</P>
<P>
"Many Americans I know, the first time they try it, it's a disaster. The second 
time, they're hooked." 
</P>
<P>
When not running his own firm, Zwack is busy as chairman of the Foundation for 
Development of Small and Middle Companies, which doles out loans to fledgling 
firms and teaches Western business skills in former Soviet barracks vacated by 
departing troops. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the ugly capitalist, but the socially thinking free-enterpriser," says 
Zwack, who without any embarrassment calls himself "one of the most popular 
guys in Hungary." 
</P>
<P>
He also scotches rumors that he may play a role in the new government, 
dominated by a right-of-center party called the Hungarian National Forum; he 
says he has no aspirations for office "at this time." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Zwack and his wife keep a home in Milan and an apartment in Budapest's 
hilly castle district overlooking the Danube, just two doors down from the 
former Zwack family home -- which now houses the Turkish Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
But despite his confidence in the new government, Zwack says he plans to keep 
open his Italian operations, which produce 1 million bottles annually. 
</P>
<P>
The man who fled Hungary on foot 42 years ago leans forward to explain: 
</P>
<P>
"As a safety valve."

THE LATIN DEBT QUAGMIRE: UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY NO. 8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Latin American debt "crisis" is approaching its eighth anniversary, with 
most of the region's debtor countries no closer to resolving their grim 
economic and financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Although borrowing by Latin American debtors has slowed to a near-halt, they 
are not receiving enough money from other sources to finance the broad 
restructuring of their economies that is necessary to lay the foundation for 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of new sources of cash, a growing number of Latin American 
countries have been solving their debt problems by default -- that is, by 
refusing to pay the interest on their outstanding loans from commercial banks. 
The Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based monitoring group set 
up by commercial banks, says the amount of interest payments in arrears from 
eight key Latin American countries has surged from just over $1 billion in 1985 
to $16.9 billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Barry F. Sullivan, chairman of the First National Bank of Chicago and head of 
the Institute's board of directors, calls the increase "alarming." Unless some 
action is taken soon, Sullivan warns, "more serious difficulties lie ahead for 
these countries." 
</P>
<P>
Bankers and many other critics blame the Brady Plan, the sweeping Third World 
debt reduction scheme proffered by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. 
The plan, launched in March, 1989, has been adopted by creditor countries as 
the new global debt strategy. Arguing that new loans only exacerbate the 
problem, the Brady Plan seeks to slash debt burdens by enabling banks to get 
rid of problem loans by selling them -- at a discount -- to the debtor 
countries, which finance them through World Bank-backed bonds. So far, Mexico, 
Costa Rica, the Philippines, Morocco and, soon, Venezuela have been the major 
beneficiaries of the plan. Brady has declared it a first-year success, as have 
finance ministers of the other major industrial nations that have embraced the 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
But critics argue that the scheme has provided little real benefit to the 
participating countries -- and may well have been a factor in cutting off the 
new bank loans that Latin governments need to finance their badly needed 
economic reforms. Although bank lending to Third World countries was tapering 
off rapidly before the Brady Plan was put into effect, it has now all but dried 
up. "You can't ask banks to take a hit by discounting their loans and then prod 
them to make new ones on top of that," one critic says. At the same time, 
analysts say the plan's emphasis on debt-reduction is misguided. Ordinarily, if 
a country receives $1 in new loans, it has 90 cents to spend -- what is left 
over after interest. But if its debt burden is cut instead, it gains only the 
interest saved -- about a dime. 
</P>
<P>
Although Brady doesn't seem ready to scrap his initiative, the plan is being 
transformed -- by the marketplace. Despite the Treasury's emphasis on 
debt-reduction, the new package being negotiated by Venezuela has a large 
new-lending component. Others may follow suit. A close look at recent "Brady 
Plan" packages shows that the rubric is now being applied to virtually any deal 
that the debtors and creditors can hammer out. The debt-reduction package put 
together for the Philippines leans heavily on bank lending. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the large industrial countries may formally encourage such a 
liberal interpretation at the annual seven-nation economic summit, to be held 
in Houston in July. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund already have 
laid the groundwork for such a switch. 
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of new financing is forcing some countries to look inward and to 
begin making badly needed economic reforms on their own. Partly because of the 
dearth of available money elsewhere, Mexico has engineered sweeping changes 
that would have been politically unthinkable even three years ago -- selling 
off inefficient state-owned industries, liberalizing trade and welcoming 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil's newly elected president, Fernando Collor de Mello, also has moved 
swiftly to embrace free-market economic programs. Venezuela is beginning to 
move. Even Peru, which has been the region's bad boy on debt issues since 1985, 
is expected to return to the fold soon. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the shift stems from fears by the Latin governments that they had 
better move quickly before available money is diverted to Eastern Europe. 
Several of the region's top economic policy makers already have issued pleas 
urging creditor governments not to flee. The worry was a prime topic of 
corridor conversation among finance ministers of developing countries at the 
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Many Third World officials are bitter over Eastern Europe, which they consider 
a newcomer and far better able to attract capital than their own countries. But 
industrial countries have seemed unfazed by the appeals. Put your houses in 
order, they are telling the Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the economic situation in Latin America ranges from tolerable to 
plainly grim. Mexico, Venezuela and Costa Rica are experiencing modest economic 
growth, with diminishing inflation. And Chile, Uruguay and Colombia are 
essentially under control. But Brazil and Argentina are going through traumatic 
periods now, with substantial uncertainty about how well they will fare. And 
the region's smaller countries -- such as Ecuador, Honduras, Jamaica, Peru, and 
Nicaragua -- are in terrible shape. 
</P>
<P>
New figures show that per-capita income in Latin America fell 1% over the 
region as a whole in 1989 for the second year in a row. By contrast, it grew 
steadily during the mid-1980s. At the same time, inflation across the region is 
more virulent than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the fate of the region's economies will depend on the strength of the 
world economy over the next few years, analysts here say. If the industrial 
nations can maintain moderate growth and keep their markets open, Latin America 
will eke by. If not, a slump is certain. 
</P>
<P>
The region's biggest problem remains inflation, which is exacerbating the Latin 
countries' own internal debt -- the borrowing that governments must do at home 
to help finance their budget deficits. The internal debt crisis has become a 
far bigger strain on their resources than foreign debt. Brazil, for example, 
consistently has run a trade surplus of $16 billion to $19 billion for the past 
several years -- the world's third-largest, after Japan's and West Germany's -- 
but has been unable to pay its foreign creditors easily, in large part because 
of its own debt crisis. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some experts believe that the real battleground over the next few 
months will be an effort by debtor countries to persuade governments -- and 
international institutions such as the IMF and World Bank -- to write off large 
portions of their Latin American loans, much as commercial banks already have. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hakim, staff director of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based 
research group, says the Brady Plan, which deals solely with debt owed to 
commercial banks, "has no meaning for" countries such as Jamaica, which have 
borrowed almost entirely from governments. 
</P>
<P>
Hakim believes that the debt problem, which seems relatively quiet now, could 
re-emerge early next year, particularly if the U.S. economy begins to soften. 
"Right now, it's off the front pages," he says. "But it could be back again -- 
soon."

ZWEIBRUECKEN'S GIANT U.S. AIR BASE IS ON A HIT LIST. THERE GOES THE CITY'S MAIN 
SOURCE OF INCOME.

ZWEIBRUECKEN, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This is going to hit the town hard," Mayor Werner von Blon said. "It's a 
situation we didn't expect." 
</P>
<P>
Zweibruecken, a city of 35,000 people in the western Rhineland, is facing the 
grim fact that its primary source of income, a giant U.S. air base, will be 
shut down as part of a post-Cold War American retrenchment in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Some West Germans complain about low-flying warplanes and destructive military 
maneuvers, but Zweibruecken, named for two medieval bridges over the 
Schwarzbach, has welcomed American soldiers and Air Force personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The air base fuels the local economy: 340 civilians work at the base, and many 
more sell goods and services to it. The people of Zweibruecken rent out about 
1,440 houses and apartments to servicemen and women who choose to live off the 
base. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Von Blon figures that the base contributes $84 million a year to the 
city's economy. When the Americans leave, unemployment is expected to rise 
sharply, perhaps to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Von Blon, a stocky man with wavy gray hair, said he was upset by the abrupt 
notice that the base is to close by the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think Zweibruecken would be on the list; we don't have combat 
forces," he said recently over coffee in his office. "I don't blame the local 
air base people. . . . They didn't know themselves what was going to happen. It 
was decided in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced Jan. 26, and the people of Zweibruecken are still 
adjusting. They had assumed that the base would be among the last in West 
Germany to close, and -- because the economic future seemed assured -- they 
received no federal aid or advice. 
</P>
<P>
This rolling, wooded region has so many air bases it's called the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization's aircraft carrier. Zweibruecken has the 26th 
Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, with RF-4C Phantoms, and the 10th Airlift 
Squadron, with C-23A Sherpas. 
</P>
<P>
There are Army supply depots, too, and the center of all this military activity 
is Kaiserslautern -- "K-town," the GIs call it -- which has the largest 
concentration of Americans living outside the United States, more than 70,000. 
Next to government, the U.S. military is the area's No. 1 employer. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Sgt. Rick Schick told a visitor he was showing around the base at 
Zweibruecken: "We've got about 3,600 servicemen and another 3,600 dependents. I 
was really looking forward to another tour in Germany, but now we will all be 
relocated." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, cranes moved back and forth nearby where new barracks were going 
up. Canceling the contract would cost more than completing the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Schick, 38, of Freeport, Pa., said the future of the base was not clear: 
NATO might use it as a reserve field, or the West Germans might find use for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
At the Rosengarten, a restaurant patronized by American service personnel, 
bartender Albert Sieg said: "We've got a cozy atmosphere. Dancing on the 
weekends. . . . The Americans come in in uniform at lunchtime and in civilian 
clothes at night. I guess the closure was inevitable. But when the Americans 
go, it will be a big loss to the town and to this place." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Von Blon said that officials in Bonn will decide whether to hold on to 
the property or turn it over to the local people. City officials, who expect to 
inherit a 500-bed hospital that the Air Force built in the city but has never 
used, have suggested that Zweibruecken could become headquarters of the 
European Community.

"We have been host to the American military for the last 45 years," Mayor Von 
Blon mused. "While the Cold War was going on, no one ever thought of them 
leaving. Now, there's no question but that they will have to go. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have mixed emotions about this. I'm happy the Cold War is over and 
there is less need for guns and bombers. But I'm not happy the Americans are 
leaving."

TRAGIC FAMILY REUNION AFTER BORDER SLAYING 
</P>

It had been two years since Ana Maria Jimenez had set eyes on three of her 
children, including her 12-year-old son, Emilio. Her family, like so many other 
expatriate families from Mexico, has been divided by immigration status and 
economic necessity. All eagerly awaited a reunion scheduled for last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Emilio was so anxious to be with his parents again," Jimenez recalled Monday 
as she and relatives gathered at her family's modest apartment here. "He said 
the important thing was that we were together as a family," the mother said, 
remembering a recent telephone conversation with the boy. 
</P>
<P>
The reunion was never to be. On Friday afternoon, Emilio Eusebio Jime nez 
Bejines -- described as a conscientious youth who once collected bottles and 
old car batteries for resale in an effort to supplement his family's meager 
income -- was slain with a high-powered rifle as he and a group of other 
Mexican citizens gathered atop a border hillside in San Diego. He died from a 
single shot to the head. 
</P>
<P>
He and several relatives were en route from Tijuana to San Diego, and, 
eventually, a new life in this Orange County community. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who witnessed the killing were the boy's brother, Ernesto, 13; his 
sister, Raquel, 11, and their uncle, Emilio Bejines Gomez, 22, who was 
entrusted with bringing the three from their home in the Mexican state of 
Jalisco to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, San Diego police arrested Leonard P. Cuen, 21, a resident of 
Monument Road, one of the first streets north of the border. Cuen, who remains 
in custody, is believed to have fired the fatal shot from his home 350 yards 
away, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Cuen was not seen by family members but was spotted with a rifle by other 
migrants that afternoon, according to a verbal account that the dead boy's 
uncle says was provided by San Diego police. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Cohen, a police spokesman, declined to comment on a possible motive in the 
shooting, but speculation about the incident has been considerable. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of illegal aliens headed north frequently pass through the grounds of 
Cuen's parents' home, and one theory put forth by some of his neighbors is that 
Cuen may have grown tired of the constant intrusions. 
</P>
<P>
There have also been reports that Cuen may have been target shooting, a theory 
the uncle said was relayed to him by police investigators. 
</P>
<P>
For the Jimenez family, sorting out the motive behind Emilio's death seems less 
important now than coming to accept the painful reality that their long-awaited 
reunion had ended in tragedy. On Monday, Ana Maria Jimenez viewed her son at a 
Westminster mortuary, the first time she had seen him in two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to embrace his body," said a sobbing Jimenez, a deeply religious woman 
who has picked strawberries and cleaned offices, among other jobs, to support 
her family since she came to the United States in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"He appeared peaceful; he appeared to be sleeping," she said. "I heard my son 
speaking to me. I asked him to forgive me for not being with him during this 
time. I promised him I would care for his brothers and sisters." 
</P>
<P>
Her family is one of many split by immigration laws and poverty. U.S. and 
Mexican authorities report an increase in women and children crossing the 
border in recent years. Many of the recipients of amnesty under the 1986 
immigration law revisions were men whose families were left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Emilio's mother is undocumented in the United States, as are three of her four 
surviving children. (Her youngest, Ana Carol, 5, was born in the United States, 
she said.) Her husband, Ernesto Jimenez, 34, who is recuperating from several 
work-related accidents, has achieved temporary legal status through the amnesty 
program, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
Emilio and his siblings lived in the United States for four years before being 
sent back two years ago when the family was no longer able to support them 
here, the mother said. Since then, the children have been living with relatives 
in Mexico, while she and her husband sent home money for their care. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done my best to make a home in this little apartment," said the mother, 
one of nine children of a vendor of teguino, a regional drink made of corn. "My 
idea was always that my family would arrive, would go to school here, and we 
would be together. . . . I never worried about clothes or other things for me. 
What counted always were my children." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, the family prayed together while burning a candle to the Santo 
Nino de Atocha, a revered Roman Catholic child figure in Mexico. The boy's 
uncle, Emilio Bejines Gomez, is struggling with feelings of guilt because his 
sister's three children were entrusted to his care. 
</P>
<P>
"I was as careful as I could have been with them," he said, fighting back tears 
in the ground-floor family apartment that is part of a development where many 
new Latino immigrants reside. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled how he purchased seats in the middle rows of the bus that took them 
from Guadalajara to Tijuana, believing that they would have a better chance of 
surviving an accident that way. He said he watched out for the children during 
the five hours or so they spent in Tijuana on Friday before hooking up with a 
smuggler and heading to the paths that lead to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, he said, he carried the boy frantically on his shoulder for 
about 150 yards, seeking help, before feeling the warm liquid on his clothing 
and realizing that it was blood. He looked at the boy's eyes and saw that they 
were "lost," he said, then showed a visitor the blood-stained clothing he wore 
that evening. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the shooting, the uncle said, he had experienced a premonition 
that something bad would happen on the trip. He said he considered going back 
to Mexico, but realized that he couldn't do that, that it was important that 
his nephews and niece make it to their parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
"I prayed to God to ask that if something happened, let it happen to me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that I can never forget. I can't forget that spot on that 
hill." 
</P>
<P>
All family members voiced the hope that such a thing will not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish," said Teresa Jimenez, a sister-in-law of the dead boy's mother, 
"I just wish that the United States and Mexico would get together and just open 
their eyes to what's going on, and make it easier for families that have been 
separated for so many years to get together." 
</P>
<P>
Ana Maria Jimenez showed little rancor, expressing only the wish that no other 
mother will have to go through what she has experienced. "No one should have to 
live with this," she said, sunglasses hiding her tears. 
</P>
<P>
She showed a visitor a letter written in a neat hand three weeks ago by Emilio, 
who she said was a strong student. In simple prose, he spoke proudly of his 
good marks in school and noted that he had recently received his primary school 
diploma, which he planned to present to his mother personally. 
</P>
<P>
"I love you all a lot," he wrote, "and I'll never forget you."

RAMS: Four months after losing to the 49ers in the playoffs, some of the Rams 
were back on the field Monday (C2). . . . This year the problem is finding a 
field. After a two-week rookie camp at Rams Park in Anaheim, summer camp begins 
July 25 in Irvine instead of the Rams' usual Cal State Fullerton site, closed 
by construction. . . . Then it's off to Berlin for an Aug. 11 exhibition game

O.C. CONGRESSMEN AT ODDS OVER OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With President Bush's decision on offshore oil drilling expected within days, 
Orange County's five congressmen, who usually stand shoulder to shoulder in 
national debates, are deeply split over federal drilling policy off the 
Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
Reps. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) and Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who 
together represent the southern two-thirds of the Orange County coast, are 
adamant opponents of new drilling off Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum is Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), a 
member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and a strong supporter of 
the oil industry, whose inland district includes parts of Orange, Anaheim and 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In between are Reps. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), formerly a staunch 
advocate of offshore drilling, and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), whose district 
includes coastal communities from the Palos Verdes Peninsula south to 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said last week that "within days" he would announce his long-awaited 
decision on whether, when and where to permit leasing of new, federally 
controlled ocean tracts to oil companies for exploration and drilling. 
</P>
<P>
The decision has been awaited since February, 1989, when Bush suspended 
preparations for leasing three vast sections of the Outer Continental Shelf for 
oil drilling. One of the affected lease sale areas is southwest of the Florida 
Everglades. The other two -- involving lease sales 91 and 95 -- cover about 
two-thirds of the waters off the California coast, including most of the Outer 
Continental Shelf between San Luis Obispo and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's decision has attracted even more interest since Feb. 7, when the 
American Trader, an 811-foot tanker leased by British Petroleum Oil Shipping 
Co. USA, ran aground on its own anchor and spilled 394,000 gallons of crude oil 
at a mooring about a mile and a half off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The President suggested last month that he might bar new drilling off the 
Florida coast, while his aides have hinted that Bush might permit some new 
drilling off California. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the President has already said . . . that he is willing to restrict 
offshore oil drilling in environmentally sensitive areas," said Cox, "so 
therefore, the $64,000 question is 'Are we or aren't we?' " 
</P>
<P>
His own view, Cox said, is that "we should have no (new) federal leasing off of 
our coast." 
</P>
<P>
Two of four large drilling platforms that are anchored a dozen miles off the 
Orange County coast have been producing oil since 1980. A third began pumping 
in 1983, while the fourth came on line a year later. Three of the platforms are 
owned by Shell Western Exploration Production Inc., while the other is owned by 
Unocal Corp. The last federal lease of drilling tracts off the Orange County 
coast took place in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, three smaller platforms and an "oil island" sit about a mile off 
Seal Beach and Huntington Beach in state-owned areas. 
</P>
<P>
"People live in California because of its natural resources, in large part," 
Cox said. "Even people who live inland use the beach and like to have it 
attractive and not sullied with oil spills." In addition, Cox argued that 
offshore platforms are a source of nearly constant air pollution, which 
technological advances have not controlled. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Cox said, he believes that Bush "will do the right thing" and ban 
drilling off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
Packard, whose district includes southern Orange County and northern San Diego 
County, said he favors "leaving all of Southern California alone" south of Long 
Beach. "It's simply not appropriate, in my judgment, to put (more) oil wells 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the issue, Dannemeyer noted that drilling in federal 
waters south of San Luis Obispo has been proceeding for a quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
"We have clearly proved that technology exists to explore the resource, develop 
it, and protect the environment, both offshore and onshore," Dannemeyer said. 
"There's no question the country is in need of domestically produced oil and 
natural gas." 
</P>
<P>
In the years since the 1969 blowout of an oil platform off Santa Barbara, 
Dannemeyer said, technology to protect the environment from platform accidents 
has greatly improved. The most serious threat to the environment, he argued, is 
posed by oil tankers, not offshore platforms. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Dornan shared Dannemeyer's pro-drilling position, and both have 
been supported heavily by the oil industry. A recent study by Common Cause, the 
self-styled citizens lobby, ranked Dannemeyer and Dornan sixth and eighth, 
respectively, among members of the California congressional delegation in 
receipt of contributions from energy-related political action committees from 
1983 through 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However, in recent months, Dornan said, he has changed his position because of 
the fragmentation of the Soviet empire and the general easing of world 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think California and Oregon have a compelling case about how beautiful their 
coastline is, and I think (the President) is going to say that we're going to 
respect the environmental concerns here," Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however: "We will continue to have these areas (for leasing) 
identified so that in times of emergency, or if the world should get into 
another tense Cold War situation, we'll have to look at this, because our 
dependency on Middle Eastern, Persian Gulf oil is greater than it ever has 
been." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, who, like Cox, is completing his first term in Congress, said he 
is convinced that there are both economic and environmental reasons to proceed 
with offshore drilling. Like Dannemeyer, Rohrabacher argued that more drilling 
platforms offshore would cut the volume of oil-tanker traffic to local 
refineries. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he argued that oil platforms represent a visual nuisance only 
during daylight hours. "In fact," Rohrabacher said, "the oil rigs improve the 
nighttime view of the ocean. When nighttime comes and you're along the ocean, 
you just have pitch black. In Long Beach, they have some oil rigs . . . that 
are very beautiful at night." 
</P>
<P>
But despite his personal views, Rohrabacher said: "I don't think the President 
should approve any (oil) development off the California coast that's visible 
from the shoreline unless the people who live in those cities and along the 
shore fundamentally agreed with the need . . . of having those . . . areas 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't mean that I don't think there isn't a lot of room available 
to convince people that there is a . . . need." 
</P>
<P>
To help make the case, Rohrabacher argued that the federal government should 
share with local communities and county governments some of the millions of 
dollars in tax revenue generated by offshore oil production. That would 
encourage the communities to embrace offshore drilling, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said he has discussed the proposal with Interior Secretary Manuel 
Lujan Jr. and may propose legislation to implement it.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; 
</P>
<P>
FASTEST-GROWING CITY STILL A BIT 'COUNTRY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Carol Metz moved to Yorba Linda in 1971, she used to ride her horse into 
the open fields of what was then the eastern edge of Yorba Linda. Today, those 
fields are central Yorba Linda, covered with houses and shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth exploded in the last eight years," Metz said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Yorba Linda's growth has taken place over the past 12 years, as owners 
of large ranches east of the city sold to developers, said Phillip Paxton, the 
city's director of development. Since 1978, Yorba Linda has doubled in area and 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 4,480 people moved to Yorba Linda, making it the 
fastest-growing city in Orange County and the sixth fastest-growing city in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Recent growth has been so rapid that one of every 11 of the city's residents 
either moved to or was born in Yorba Linda last year, according to population 
estimates released this month by the state Department of Finance. The city's 
population is now listed as 52,367. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the fastest-growing South Orange County city, Dana Point, grew 
at half the pace of Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
The growth has meant more traffic and strained nerves for residents, most of 
whom moved to the city because of its rustic atmosphere, Metz said. But the 
city has struggled to maintain that atmosphere despite the growth, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved here because it was really country looking," she said. "It's not as 
country as it was, but it's still there." 
</P>
<P>
The city still requires large lots in several residential areas of the city, 
Paxton said. One-acre and half-acre lots are common. The average lot size in 
Yorba Linda is the second largest in the county, behind Villa Park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city also owns a five-acre equestrian center, maintains a series of horse 
trails throughout the city and has more lenient rules than most cities about 
stabling horses at home. 
</P>
<P>
You can drive through Yorba Linda and still find a horse tied up in front of 
someone's house. Children still occasionally ride horses to the local 
McDonald's for a burger. 
</P>
<P>
When the city incorporated in 1967, the hills east of Fairmont Boulevard lay 
empty. Even in the settled west side of the city, five- and 10-acre citrus 
orchards still existed, said Frieda S. Smith, 71, who moved to the 
unincorporated west side 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After incorporation, "an awful lot of houses" replaced the orchards on the west 
side, she said. "Now, you don't see an open acre. There are solid houses." 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Linda's new construction has taken place almost exclusively on the city's 
east side. After a series of annexations beginning in the late 1970s, developed 
sections of Yorba Linda now stretch through the hills to the San Bernardino 
County line. 
</P>
<P>
State figures show 1,427 homes were built in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But the city's phenomenal growth may be nearing an end, as available land runs 
out. Major annexations were completed in the mid-1980s, and the city's borders 
now are stable, Paxton said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be pretty much through with the big building and the big development in 
about three years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though growth has eroded some of the rural atmosphere, Smith said, Yorba 
Linda is still her favorite city. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to live in the city the rest of my life," she said. "I still like 
the area. I like it a little bit country."

will continue serving meals to the elderly as a result of recent donations 
received from the county and cities, the executive director said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Feedback Foundation Inc., which feeds about 2,500 elderly Orange County 
residents each day, announced last month that it would have to close nutrition 
sites for the month of June unless the county and local cities came to its aid. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the County Board of Supervisors pledged $100,000 and individual 
cities have committed amounts from $1,000 to $22,000, according to executive 
director Shirley A. Cohen. Over the next couple of weeks, other cities are 
expected to pledge financial support. 
</P>
<P>
"We're OK, we won't have to close in June," Cohen said. "I'm very grateful for 
the cities' and the county's support." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the organization is reeling from the shortfall, which Cohen said was a 
result of a 14% increase in food costs at a time when federal funding is static 
and participant donations have taken a sharp drop. 
</P>
<P>
The organization sent letters dated April 30 to 13 cities and the county asking 
for financial aid. Cities were asked to donate based upon the number of their 
residents who benefit from the program. Santa Ana, for example, which has 
164,112 residents who receive food from Feedback each year, was asked to donate 
$22,000. Fountain Valley, which is estimated to have 5,000 residents who will 
use the service during the 1989-90 fiscal year, was asked to give $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, cities have rushed to get their checks to the organization in 
time, Cohen said. Santa Ana and Anaheim, for example, quickly issued checks for 
$22,000 and $17,000, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the cities have been wonderful," she said. "When a city rushes a check 
like that, it's pretty neat." 
</P>
<P>
Feedback Foundation was formed as a nonprofit organization in 1967. Its first 
project was a school and summer lunch program for low-income Santa Ana 
children. When the Santa Ana school system took over the school lunch program 
in 1973, the foundation phased out its children's lunch service and began a 
program to provide nutrition for the elderly. The program was expanded in the 
mid-1970s when the federal government began funding a separate home-delivered 
meals program. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Feedback Foundation, one of three county nutrition programs, serves 
about 1,700 seniors in group programs and 800 housebound residents each day, 
Cohen said. The food is cooked in a central kitchen in Anaheim and delivered by 
truck or van to community centers and homes. The foundation asks for a $1.35 
per meal donation when possible. However, 67% of the clients have incomes below 
the poverty level. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GRANT GIVEN TO STUDY LATINOS' ENGLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton professor Maria R. Montano-Harmon has been awarded a 
$30,000 fellowship from the National Academy of Education at Harvard University 
to continue her groundbreaking research on Latino youngsters' command of 
English. 
</P>
<P>
Montano-Harmon, an assistant professor of secondary education, was one of 30 
educators in the nation to receive a Spencer Fellowship, which is awarded 
annually to outstanding researchers to pursue postdoctoral studies in the field 
of education, university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last four years, Montano-Harmon has studied compositions by more than 
900 ninth-graders in 10 school districts in California, Arizona and three 
cities in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
She said she has found that although English is the primary language of most 
Latino students, their literacy is limited to a conversational dialect of 
English dubbed "Chicano English." It is similar to a spoken dialect of English 
identified among black Americans and can hinder students' achievements, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a problem of Spanish-language interference," Montano-Harmon said. 
"This is a literacy problem and must be dealt with as such." 
</P>
<P>
Such students need special teaching strategies to improve their skills in 
written English, strategies that differ from those used in 
English-as-a-second-language (ESL) programs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Spencer fellowship will make it possible for her to expand her research. 
She will take leaves during the spring semesters of 1991 and 1992 to complete 
her study, which will be expanded to include students in New Mexico and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Montano-Harmon joined the Cal State Fullerton faculty in 1985 after 14 years 
teaching junior high and high school students. She won La Habra City School 
District's outstanding teacher of the year award in 1982. As a Fulbright 
scholar in 1969, she studied in Argentina. She is fluent in English, Spanish 
and Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
Besides teaching multicultural education at the Fullerton campus, she is a 
consultant to school districts in Orange, Los Angeles and San Diego counties.

SLAIN MAN MAY BE 19TH GANG VICTIM

<P>
A 19-year-old Anaheim man who was fatally shot while driving his pickup truck 
in Placentia may have been the county's 19th victim of gang-related slayings, 
police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Hernandez died at UCI Medical Center about 5:30 p.m. Sunday, about five 
hours after he was shot in the head near the intersection of Melrose Street and 
Orangethorpe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-year-old boy who was in Hernandez's pickup truck received minor gunshot 
wounds. He was treated at Placentia-Linda Community Hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia Detective Jerry Zamora said Hernandez was shot by occupants of 
another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The Placentia shooting occurred hours after a La Habra High School senior was 
fatally stabbed in another gang-related incident. Augustin Acosta Ruiz, 18, of 
La Habra was pronounced dead at the scene after he was stabbed several times as 
he walked near his home in the 700 block of South Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
The stabbing occurred around 3 a.m. Sunday when Ruiz was confronted by youths 
in a brown Nissan pickup. Police said Ruiz was chased and ran for his life by 
dodging between houses on East Pacific Street. But his attackers caught up with 
him and stabbed him several times, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A La Habra police spokesman said investigators executed search warrants at 
several locations in the city on Monday, but arrests are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has experienced a record number of gang-related deaths this year, 
fast surpassing the 16 recorded for all of 1989. DAVAN MAHARAJ

COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON LIBRARY SITE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council delayed a vote on a land swap agreement between the city and 
the Irvine Co. after one council member expressed concern that the exchange may 
not be equitable. 
</P>
<P>
The land swap is part of a package put together to gain a site for the city's 
new central library, and the agreement must be signed before design plans can 
proceed for the new research and community center. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the deal, the city will give two acres of land in Newport 
Center, plus development rights, in exchange for four acres near the corner of 
Avocado Avenue and Coast Highway. The Irvine Co. would still have some 
development rights on the remaining acres it owns at that site. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Jean H. Watt said last week that she was not sure that the 
exchange was fair since under the agreement, the Irvine Co. would have 
discretion to transfer development rights from the Avocado Avenue site to one 
of two Newport Center sites. 
</P>
<P>
If the developer transferred those rights -- which include rights to generate a 
certain amount of traffic -- the agreement could result in a larger project 
being built because the company would be entitled to combine the traffic 
allowances from the Avocado and Newport Center sites. 
</P>
<P>
Along with authorizing the land swap, the architect's contract, and a budget 
amendment to pay for the $7-million library building, the City Council must 
approve an application for a $1-million federal grant for construction costs. 
The city must approve the measures by June 1 to meet the grant deadline, City 
Librarian LaDonna Kienitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will reconsider the land swap at a May 28 meeting. LAURA

<P>
BUDGET PLAN BEEFS UP POLICE TO FIGHT GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Citing a commitment to battle gang activity in Santa Ana, City Manager David N. 
Ream unveiled a $218-million budget Monday that emphasized hiring more police 
to patrol the city's neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We see gang prevention as one of the top priorities in the city," Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, the Police Department would add six investigators to its 
narcotics unit and four to its gang unit. Another five non-sworn officers would 
be added to the department so that officers can spend more time patrolling the 
city, Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 investigators will be selected from within the department's current 
351-member roster. The city will hire 15 more people to fill the vacancies, 
Ream said. The Police Department's proposed $43.8-million budget is up 8.4% 
from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ream is also recommending that the council increase funding for Pride, a city 
parks and recreation program designed to prevent children from joining gangs. 
The program funding would increase from $66,000 to more than $110,000 under the 
proposed budget, allowing the program to be expanded to six more schools. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young said the emphasis on gangs in the budget reflects the 
city's concern with crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen gangs become more violent," Young said. "We want to beef up our 
gang unit and add patrol officers to have a chilling effect on these gangs." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Richards L. Norton says the city should hire even more officers. 
Norton says he went on a police ride-along May 6 to observe the Police 
Department's weekend gang sweeps. During his ride-along, Norton says, he and a 
police officer had to guard a body for two hours until homicide investigators 
were able to arrive at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not enough still," Norton said. "This is all political rhetoric. The fact 
is we don't have enough men and women on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget also emphasizes the city's efforts to clean up its 
neighborhoods. In a five-year plan to improve everything from trees to traffic 
signals, Ream is recommending that the city spend $34.8 million on capital 
improvement projects during the next fiscal year.LILY ENG

BOARD CONFIRMS ITS SCHOOLS CHIEF CHOICE

<P>
The Tustin Unified School District board on Monday confirmed David L. Andrews 
as its choice to replace outgoing Supt. Maurice A. Ross, who resigned last year 
after some stormy years heading the district. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews, superintendent of the 18,647-student Rialto Unified School District in 
San Bernardino County, will take over the job June 29. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, 58, who joined the district in 1977, gave his notice last September, 
citing a "difference of philosophy" between him and the board. During his 
13-year tenure, the school district was plagued by school closures and 
financial and labor problems. Three months before he resigned, teachers had 
given Ross a no-confidence vote, accusing him of ignoring needed improvements 
in curriculum and learning conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say I believe in accountability and the welfare of Tustin's 
students," Ross said Monday. "I wish the district luck, and I think the school 
board deserves to have someone to share their ideology with." 
</P>
<P>
When Ross resigned his post, his annual salary was $83,000. District officials 
would not disclose Andrews' salary. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said he plans to take time off to decide what he wants to do next. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews, 52, has been both a teacher and an assistant principal in the Tustin 
district, and he lived in Tustin from 1965 to 1986. ERIK HAMILTON

FLYING METAL KILLS MAN AT HOUSING SITE

<P>
A Riverside man was killed at a construction site Monday when a small piece of 
metal from a bulldozer snapped off, flew 30 feet and struck him in the chest, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Steven Bechel, 31, was pronounced dead at the scene, Sheriff's Lt. 
Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said the accident occurred shortly before 10:30 a.m. at the Foothill 
Ranch housing development in Lake Forest, an unincorporated area near El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were folding one of the metal tracks on a large bulldozer with a 
forklift when part of the track snapped off, according to Jim Johnson, vice 
president of McCoy Construction Co. of Calabasas, the contractor providing the 
grading for the development. 
</P>
<P>
Bechel, a driver for McCoy Construction, was standing by his truck 30 feet from 
the bulldozer when he was struck in the chest by a piece of metal "about the 
size of a fingernail," Johnson said. The metal pierced a blood vessel in his 
chest, causing him to bleed to death, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an extremely freak accident," Johnson said. "It has nothing to do 
with construction. . . . It was one of those things that if you were in there a 
thousand other times it wouldn't have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Bechel was the first McCoy employee killed on the job, Johnson added. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Brown, district manager for Cal/OSHA in Anaheim, said the accident was 
being investigated. DAVAN MAHARAJ

HIRING HALL PROPOSED FOR HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
To combat a rising crime problem in the city's Oakview section, Police Chief 
Ronald E. Lowenberg on Monday urged the City Council to establish a day-laborer 
hiring hall and a police substation in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The council members, while taking no formal vote, indicated majority support 
for Lowenberg's proposal. The day-laborer hiring hall, if built, would become 
the fourth such facility in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Lowenberg's proposals, which would cost about $500,000, are not included in the 
$176-million budget proposed by City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga. 
</P>
<P>
During a preliminary budget briefing, Mayor Thomas J. Mays told Uberuaga that 
the 1990-91 budget needs to be revised to cover Lowenberg's proposals for the 
Oakview area. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to support these items in our budget to maintain a safe community," 
Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jim Silva added: "I think the people of Huntington Beach deserve 
this." 
</P>
<P>
The city's Oakview area is roughly bounded by Beach Boulevard, Slater Avenue, 
Gothard Street and Warner Avenue. City officials have said the area is marked 
by overcrowded housing and has a large proportion of new immigrants, primarily 
Latino and Asian. 
</P>
<P>
Lowenberg said a hiring hall would greatly aid many adult residents of the 
area. He proposed using a trailer, manned by city staffers, which would be 
located on Nichols Street about a half block from Warner Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Lowenberg proposed that the hiring hall be modeled on one in Brea and operated 
in a similar manner. 
</P>
<P>
According to a written report that Lowenberg gave the council: "The Brea Center 
does not require the day laborer to carry proof of United States residency. The 
center will provide a designated location within the city where employer and 
employees can make contact with each other." 
</P>
<P>
The city's proposed budget includes no new city funds for the proposed 
municipal pier. Uberuaga said there is no room in the "lean" budget for more 
than the $1.6 million that the city allocated last year and which is being 
carried forward in the new budget. The new pier is estimated to cost $12 
million, and the city so far has raised only $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted May 7 to hire a professional fund-raising firm to try to 
solicit the remaining money for the new pier.

ETHICS: ACTIVIST CALLS FOR INQUIRY INTO ACTIONS OF COUNTY PLANNING 
COMMISSIONERS SAID TO HAVE HELPED HOST A DINNER FOR AN ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE.

<TEXT>
<P>
A civic activist has called on Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi to 
investigate what she termed the "improper actions" of two planning 
commissioners who reportedly solicited campaign funds from representatives of 
some South County developers with projects pending before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
In a formal complaint mailed Monday, Roe Gruber, a Santa Ana woman who helped 
organize the county's TIN CUP campaign reform effort in the late 1970s, said 
the commissioners appear to have violated state law as well as the spirit of 
the Time Is Now, Clean Up Politics ordinance, adopted in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last Friday that Planning Commissioners Stephen A. Nordeck 
and Roger Slates helped host a private dinner on behalf of 58th Assembly 
District candidate Peter von Elten of Huntington Beach. Nordeck strongly denies 
soliciting any funds or having any role in the dinner, which was held at his 
Trabuco Oaks Steak House last Tuesday. Slates has repeatedly declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Several people who attended the affair say both commissioners spoke on behalf 
of the candidate and encouraged guests to contribute to his campaign. The 
roughly 15 guests included several representatives of development firms that 
have multimillion-dollar projects that will ultimately require Planning 
Commission approval. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of us in Orange County feel it is of the utmost importance to monitor and 
investigate any actions that may not be appropriate by public officials . . . 
," Gruber said in her letter to Capizzi and his chief assistant Maurice L. 
Evans. "I do not believe that such explicit and flagrant activities as reported 
in The Times should be allowed to pass as 'business as usual.' " 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said the request for a formal investigation 
by the district attorney was to be expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling that something would happen . . . ," Stanton said. "Given the 
rather academic, blow-by-blow description in The Times, I'm not surprised an 
eyebrow would be raised high enough to ask for that kind of action." 
</P>
<P>
In making public her request for an inquiry, Gruber noted that the TIN CUP law, 
which prohibits county supervisors from voting on issues affecting major 
campaign contributors, does not directly address the actions of appointed 
commissioners. She noted, however, that state law bars appointed commissioners 
from soliciting campaign donations of $250 or more from individuals who have 
matters pending before them. In addition, Gruber said, the reported actions of 
the commissioners go against the spirit of reform in Orange County symbolized 
by TIN CUP. 
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly the type of thing we worked hard to eliminate," Gruber said. 
"Ethically, it's the same concept." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace J. Wade, supervising deputy district attorney, said Monday that he 
would acknowledge receipt of the complaint when it arrives but that he wouldn't 
"have much to say beyond that." 
</P>

INTENDS TO DEAL BELL, AS EARLY AS THIS WEEK.

Running back Curt Warner was in Ram Park Monday. Running back Greg Bell wasn't. 
And it appears the same probably could be said about the Rams' starting lineup 
on opening day: Warner in; Bell out. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who rushed for 2,349 yards and 31 touchdowns the past two seasons, became 
the odd man out when the Rams acquired Warner as a Plan B free agent March 30. 
Ram Coach John Robinson said Bell had been excused from attending the team's 
four-day mini-camp, which began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to trade him," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
That could happen as early as this week, during the NFL owners' meetings 
Wednesday and Thursday in Dallas. Bell was out of town and unavailable for 
comment, but, according to his agent, Steve Feldman, a quick deal would suit 
Bell just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two conversations with the Rams last week and they're definitely going 
into the meetings looking to make a trade," Feldman said. "They may not get the 
kind of compensation they want right away, but at some point, they have to 
realize it's time to let him go. He's anxious to get into a new situation as 
soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Warner is getting well-acquainted with new situations. Saturday, he was married 
in Seattle and Monday, he was running out of a new backfield, wearing a new 
uniform and a new number (21). He wore No. 28 with the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
"First, I'd like to thank the Ram organization and Coach Robinson for giving me 
this opportunity," he said. "I'm especially thankful because things up in 
Seattle were kind of a blur, but that's all I'll say about that situation." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Seahawks president Mike McCormack said he was not "interested in 
trading Curt unless we could get a blockbuster deal." He described a 
blockbuster as a trade which involved two No. 1 draft choices or an impact 
defensive player such as Philadelphia's Reggie White. 
</P>
<P>
Warner, who holds every Seattle career rushing record and is a three-time Pro 
Bowl starter, led the Seahawks in rushing in 1989 with 631 yards, but he took a 
mighty fall from grace. He averaged just 3.3 yards a carry, was being 
supplanted by fullback John L. Williams as the focus of the Seahawks' rushing 
attack and suddenly became expendable. 
</P>
<P>
Warner, who has undergone two knee surgeries -- the latest an arthroscopic 
procedure in 1988 -- and three ankle operations, says he feels fine, if a bit 
disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything feels a little strange here," he said. "Physically, I feel great. 
Mentally, there's a lot going on and I'm just sorting things out. Things here 
are very regimented, very structured. You do what you have to get done, you go 
hard and then go home." 
</P>
<P>
Warner figures to be battling Cleveland Gary for playing time at tailback, but 
he says he doesn't mind the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a tailback, always a tailback," Warner said, smiling. "I'm down here to 
play, but it's up to Coach Robinson to decide how much. I'll do whatever I have 
to do. If I get to carry the ball a lot, great. If not, I'll do whatever it 
takes to try and help this team win. That's my primary objective." 
</P>
<P>
After five years as a safety-turned-cornerback, Jerry Gray began his conversion 
back to free safety Monday. The Rams are hoping the acquisition of Bobby 
Humphery from the Jets and the maturation of second-year players Darryl Henley 
and Alfred Jackson will fill the void at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
"We think Jerry can be a great free safety and he's going to play there through 
the summer and the exhibition season," Robinson said. "If we don't feel 
confident at corner, though, then we'll have to be prepared to make the move 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Gray is taking a wait-and-see approach, but admits he likes the view from the 
free safety position. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be interesting (playing safety) in our defensive philosophy," he 
said. "Having the freedom to roam will be the biggest adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent the last five years trying to learn to just watch my man and not the 
quarterback, and I think I've finally mastered it. Now, I'm going back to 
watching the quarterback again." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Pete Holohan, an unsigned conditional free agent, was in camp Monday, 
but he wasn't risking injury. "I'm staying away from any contact," he said. 
"Basically, I'm just running my patterns against air." Holohan said he was not 
concerned about his contract status. "We're not even negotiating, but it's very 
early," he said. "There's no pressure or anxiety at all." Also in camp but not 
signed were linebacker Brett Faryniarz and defensive tackle Doug Reed. 
Linebacker Kevin Greene, nose tackle Alvin Wright and tight end Damon Johnson, 
also unsigned, elected to stay away this week. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Chuck Long was also missing. He returned to Detroit to be with his 
wife, Lisa, who is expecting the couple's second child. . . . Latin Berry, the 
Rams' third-round selection from Oregon, made his debut at cornerback Monday. 
The 5-foot-10, 196-pounder played running back in college. "He looked like he'd 
been playing cornerback for, oh, 50 minutes," Coach John Robinson said. "But 
seriously, he looks like an athlete and a competitor and we're excited about 
the person." . . . Best new name on the Ram roster: General Brown, a 6-foot-4, 
270-pound defensive tackle from Savannah State.

CAL STATE FULLERTON WILL RETAIN GYMNASTICS, FENCING PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

FULLERTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton's men's gymnastics and men's and women's fencing programs 
will be retained for the 1990-91 school year, President Jewel Plummer Cobb 
announced Monday. The school's Athletics Council had recommended in March that 
the three sports be discontinued in order to balance the athletic budget. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very difficult decision with reference to our athletics 
program," Cobb said in a statement. "All three teams have had an outstanding 
tradition of success, and I am pleased that they will have continued 
opportunities to develop greater community support." 
</P>
<P>
The men's gymnastics team, ranked among the nation's top 10 for much of the 
1990 season, finished sixth in the NCAA Western Regional in Oklahoma in April. 
Dick Wolfe, who completed his 22nd year as coach, guided the Titans to 
college-division national championships in 1971, '72 and '74. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe, who has signed 22 one-year contracts in the past, said Monday that he is 
still negotiating with the school for a contract for next year. 
</P>
<P>
The fencing program, under Coach Heizaburo Okawa, also has a national title to 
its credit -- the women's team won in 1973. Okawa, who recently completed his 
10th season as coach, led the women's team to a 16-0 record in the 
Intercollegiate Fencing Conference of Southern California; the men's team went 
10-6.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK: CHAPMAN'S OLIVAS FINALLY A BELIEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently, it takes more than a .432 batting average and 13 home runs to make 
Chapman College's Sandy Olivas believe she is a standout softball player. 
</P>
<P>
"I really never considered myself an outstanding player," Olivas said. "I was 
really more into having fun and just playing." 
</P>
<P>
Olivas, who plays third base, was among the few who were surprised that she was 
a first-team All-American selection. Olivas, a sophomore, is the first Chapman 
player to earn such honors since Janet Lloyd, a Chapman assistant coach and 
daughter of head coach Lisle Lloyd, was picked in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my friends said, 'Yeah, I knew you would make it,' but I never 
thought that I would," Olivas said. "It just never seemed possible." 
</P>
<P>
Olivas, who played at Sierra Vista High in Baldwin Park, hit 13 home runs in 56 
games to lead the NCAA Division II. It is the second-highest home run total in 
Division II history. Kay Tiper of Akron, who holds the single-season record, 
hit 15 in 60 games in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Lisle Lloyd is still amazed by a home run Olivas hit this season in a 
tournament at Cal State Hayward. Lloyd said the ball easily cleared the 
left-center field fence, which was about 200 feet from the plate, and hit the 
men's slow-pitch fence about 100 feet beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
"In 24 years of coaching, I've never seen a woman hit the ball that far," Lloyd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Add honors: Chapman pitcher Jacki Blake, who had an 18-2 record, a 0.39 
earned-run average and a .369 batting average for the Panthers (35-21), was a 
second-team All-American selection. 
</P>
<P>
Shocked: Chapman, which arguably had the country's most successful Division II 
men's tennis program in the last half of the 1980s, flopped in the first 
Division II championship of the 1990s last week in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers, the tournament's fourth-seeded team, lost in the first round to 
eighth-seeded Southwest Baptist, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in shock the whole day," said Coach Terry Davis, who as a player helped 
Chapman to its first NCAA championship in 1985. The Panthers finished second in 
1986, but returned to championship form in '87 and '88. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman lost the next two consolation matches and finished last in the 
eight-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In a cost-cutting move by its athletic department, Chapman stopped offering 
tennis scholarships last year, and Davis said the team may suffer in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"This should make them want to try to get the program back to where it was and 
help out a little more," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
No time to waste: The day he was hired as Christ College Irvine men's 
basketball coach, Greg Marshall was returning calls and calling recruits from a 
pay phone. Christ College officials had given Marshall access to offices and 
phones, but apparently he wanted his own work space. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the late recruiting start, Marshall said he is confident he can bring 
in the players necessary to be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there aren't as many players around as there were a month ago. But 
we may not have gotten them anyway," Marshall said. "At least guys will be 
seriously interested now if they are looking (at Christ College)." 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chapman College's baseball team, which finished third in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn., placed three players on the All-CCAA first team: 
sophomore pitcher Pete Coleman, who was 10-5 with a 3.82 earned-run average and 
led the conference in complete games with nine; senior shortstop Tom Allison, 
who batted .316 and led the team in hits with 65, and sophomore designated 
hitter Mike Giuseffi, the conference's second-leading hitter at .432. . . . 
Former Loara High School player Craig Clayton of Cal State Northridge was named 
the CCAA's pitcher of the year. Clayton, who was also fourth in the conference 
with a .387 batting average, was 12-5 with a 4.76 ERA. . . . Chapman assistant 
baseball coach Jim Benedict has resigned to become a pitching coach in the 
Texas Rangers' organization. . . . Southern California College's baseball team

College women's basketball team in the fall. . . . Kathy Carroll, a junior

All-American. Carroll batted .331 and had a 3.53 grade-point average as a 
biological sciences and chemistry double major. . . . Chapman Coach Bob Boyd 
will hold a basketball day camp sponsored by the City of Orange's recreation 
department. There will two sessions -- June 18-22 and June 25-29 -- and the

PACIFICARE LOSES ACQUISITION BID FOR HEALS AFTER FAILING TO MEET DEADLINE 
</P>

<P>
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., a cash-rich health maintenance organization 
eager to buy smaller companies in the same business, has stumbled twice on the 
acquisition trail. 
</P>
<P>
Recently rebuffed in its attempt to buy bankrupt Maxicare Health Plans, 
Cypress-based PacifiCare also lost out on its bid to buy Oakland-based HEALS 
Health Plan, a financially troubled HMO that had been courting suitors for a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bhoostelaere, HEALS' vice president of sales and marketing, said 
PacifiCare was too involved in negotiating with Maxicare to meet the timetables 
set by HEALS in its own sale negotiations. "It's a shame," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt they needed to move on at a different rate than we could," 
acknowledged Wayne Lowell, PacifiCare's chief financial officer. PacifiCare 
said earlier this month that it was seriously considering making an offer to 
acquire HEALS. 
</P>
<P>
Bhoostelaere said HEALS has signed a letter of intent to negotiate a sales 
agreement with Qual-Med, an HMO based in Monte Vista, Colo., with about 150,000 
members in five western states. He said the sale is expected to be completed by 
the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell said PacifiCare is disappointed with HEALS' decision. But he added: "We 
think they are a fine organization and wish them a lot of luck in their 
endeavors." 
</P>
<P>
Not that PacifiCare has given up its quest. "We are still looking at a lot of 
things," said Lowell, declining to be more specific.

<P>
Titan Value Equities Group Inc., a large brokerage and financial planning 
company in Tustin, said Monday that it has acquired the brokerage business of a 
White Plains, N.Y., investment banking firm for a price to be determined later. 
</P>
<P>
Titan, formerly called Titan Capital Corp., said the acquisition of Jonathan 
Alan &amp; Co.'s retail division gives it 1,400 agents and 360 offices in 42 
states, primarily on the West Coast and in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
"This is by far our most exciting acquisition to date," Frank L. King, Titan's 
president and chief executive, said in a prepared statement. "No other national 
firm has been able to balance its representation on both coasts." 
</P>
<P>
Before the acquisition, Titan's offices in the East were limited mostly to 
Georgia and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Jonathan Alan's president, Mitch Feinglas, will join 
Titan's board of directors. The New York company will continue to operate as an 
investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price will be determined by Jonathan Alan's sales during the next 
three to four years, said Allan Denton, Titan's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
Titan was founded in 1977 as a brokerage and built its business on providing 
its agents with an array of financial planning products. For its fiscal year, 
which ended April 30, Titan earned $250,000 on revenue of $23.2 million, Denton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Though a brokerage, Titan concentrates on financial planning through such 
products and services as annuities, limited partnerships and pension plan 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Alan entered the retail brokerage business in 1983 and provided 
full-service financial planning. In 1988, the firm started its investment 
banking division and recently decided to focus solely on that line of business, 
Denton said.

RHA GROUP TO JOIN SOVIETS IN COMPUTER DEAL

RHA Group, a small Irvine trading company, has signed an agreement with a 
division of the Soviet Union's Ministry of Transport Construction, establishing 
a joint venture company that will assemble personal computers in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Soviet venture, Arif, is 50% owned by RHA and 50% by the Soviet 
ministry's computer division. The two partners will initially invest $500,000 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Paul H. Armstrong, RHA's president, said Arif will buy computer components 
"from throughout the world via the RHA Group." Roughly 90% of the 
IBM-compatible computers to be assembled by the venture will be sold in the 
Soviet market. The rest will be exported to Eastern Europe for payment in hard 
currencies, Soviet rubles or through bartered trade agreements, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Lefebvre, an RHA vice president, was named assistant director-general of 
the venture. He will be based in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Arif plans to hire 30 Soviet workers to assemble the computers at a plant in 
the Moscow area, Armstrong said. At the height of production, the company is 
expected to turn out about 1,000 computers a month. 
</P>
<P>
RHA will need to apply for export licenses from the U.S. Commerce Department 
for the components that will be used in the assembly operation. Some previous 
U.S.-Soviet computer deals -- including one announced last year by Phoenix 
Group International Inc. of Irvine -- have encountered problems for various 
reasons, including bureaucratic delays and difficulties obtaining financing and 
licensing approvals. 
</P>
<P>
The licensing problem may be resolved, however, if the 17-nation Coordinating 
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls decides to loosen export controls on 
low-level computer technology to the Soviet Union when the group meets in Paris 
in June. Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for export administration at 
the Commerce Department, said during a recent visit to Orange County that 
exporters of low-level computers should expect some easing of export control 
requirements later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said RHA plans to establish a subsidiary in Mission Viejo next month 
that will support RHA's computer project in the Soviet Union.

HEALTH INSURANCE FRAUD SCHEMES THRIVE, MUTATE IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DARNELL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: Because of a production error, a portion of the following story 
did not appear in Sunday's edition in Orange County. We are reproducing the 
story in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, a computer at Blue Shield of California has been spitting out 
suspicious health-insurance claims for referral to its special investigations 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, many of the claims -- more than $2.6 million worth so far this 
year -- are simply repackaged versions of bills that the company had already 
rejected months or years earlier on suspicion of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to overlook a dime of potential profit, some entrepreneurs have been 
bundling up their contested claims and selling them as "investments." When the 
investors pass the claims on to Blue Shield for payment, the computer kicks 
them out and adds them to the special investigations department's growing 
workload. 
</P>
<P>
The rebillings allegedly are a new manifestation of a complicated kind of 
health-insurance fraud that took hold in Southern California in the mid-1980s. 
Despite some federal criminal convictions and a successful civil racketeering 
suit filed by a group of insurance companies, the scheme refuses to die. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it evolves: While insurance investigators cope with the rebillings, 
they say another group -- working primarily in Los Angeles and Orange counties 
-- has copied the original scheme and is busy trying to milk the system in its 
own way. 
</P>
<P>
Health-insurance fraud is a $60-billion-a-year problem for insurance companies, 
by the estimate of Aetna Life Insurance Co. But, as a major force driving 
insurance premiums and general health costs skyward, it is also a menace to 
consumers. Harry S. Miller, Blue Shield's vice president for consumer affairs, 
said fraud may account for as much as 5 cents of every health care dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Such fraud takes many forms, as clever criminals strive to stay a step ahead of 
the science of fraud detection. This story concerns just one type of scheme, 
but insurance officials say it is responsible for millions of dollars of losses 
and provides a glimpse of the state of the art of fraud in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
This recent contribution to the annals of health-insurance fraud is something 
that insurance companies have dubbed the "rolling labs" scheme. It is so called 
because it involves creating scores -- even hundreds -- of medical clinics that 
never seem to stay in the same place more than a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
Telemarketing techniques are often used to recruit patients, particularly the 
elderly, with offers of "free" medical tests. Only those with health insurance 
are targeted, because seeking reimbursement from the insurers is at the heart 
of the scheme. The clinics generally perform only routine, non-invasive 
procedures such as heartbeat and blood-pressure measurement. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a token cash payment is extracted from the patient, but the real 
payoff is in filing claims to the patient's insurance company. A creative 
biller can generate as much as $10,000 in claims from a single patient. Many 
insurance policies reimburse only a portion of a bill -- typically 80% -- 
leaving the patient to pay the rest. But operators of the "rolling labs" 
reassure patients that they will "waive" this co-payment and not send them a 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
Because insurance companies cover only medically necessary procedures and not 
general health screening tests, the scheme depends on doctors who are willing 
to invent an ailment that the tests are supposed to help diagnose. 
</P>
<P>
In a path-breaking 1986 civil suit that three insurance companies brought under 
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, two Soviet immigrants 
were identified as masterminds of the rolling labs scheme. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, brothers David and Michael Smushkevich, formerly of 
Los Angeles, set up clinics that filed more than $100 million in claims for 
unnecessary diagnostic tests. 
</P>
<P>
During their investigation, insurance companies contacted some of the clinics' 
patients to confirm their suspicions about the claims. Aetna, for example, 
questioned a 37-year-old man who said he was in good health before and after he 
plunked down $5 to take a series of tests. But on paper, he was almost blind 
and about to keel over from heart disease -- at least according to the false 
diagnoses on 10 different claims totaling thousands of dollars that flooded 
Aetna from 10 different providers. 
</P>
<P>
The Smushkeviches initially contested the lawsuit. But after the brothers and 
their lawyers failed to show up for several hearings, the judge last February 
awarded an $18-million default judgment to the insurance companies, who are 
still trying to collect. 
</P>
<P>
David Smushkevich was jailed in 1987 after he and several others were convicted 
of soliciting and receiving kickbacks for referring Medicare work to medical 
labs. His brother was never charged. 
</P>
<P>
David Smushkevich disappeared after serving his criminal sentence, insurance 
investigators say. They have had reports of Michael moving to the Midwest or 
returning to the Soviet Union. They are also pursuing tips that one of the 
Smushkeviches has been operating a medical clinic across the border in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
In what authorities say is another mutation of the rolling labs scheme, six 
people are scheduled to stand trial in U.S. District Court in San Diego next 
month on criminal charges that they attempted to bilk the civilian health 
program administered by the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
The six were indicted last fall in San Diego for mail fraud, making false 
statements and conspiring to defraud the U. S. government. They allegedly 
submitted "false and fraudulent claims" totaling more than $3 million to 
health-insurance companies, including Blue Cross/Blue Shield of South Carolina, 
which at the time processed claims for the Defense Department program. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants -- all of whom pleaded not guilty to the charges -- are: Max 
Sperling of Palos Verdes, his sons, Craig Allen Sperling of La Habra and Howard 
Aaron Sperling of Palos Verdes, and Donald and Minnie Bader and Marie Manuela 
Souza, all of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Documents filed along with the indictment link the defendants to Michael 
Smushkevich. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment accuses the six of submitting claims with false 
employer-identification numbers, which insurance companies require to identify 
providers of medical services. (Employer-identification numbers, issued by the 
U.S. Treasury Department, are assigned to all corporations for tax purposes.) 
</P>
<P>
According to the court filings, the scheme worked this way: The Sperlings would 
bring bills generated by two San Diego medical-testing clinics to the Baders' 
office, also in San Diego, at a company called Center City Funding. There, the 
bills would be processed and mailed out as claims to Blue Cross and other 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Although all bills were generated by the same two clinics, the claims would 
carry the employer-identification numbers of several companies created by the 
Baders, according to the indictment. The companies, including Center City 
Funding, Bader Financial Services, Mindon Investment Services and DaVisa 
Investments Inc., were falsely identified on insurance claims as providers of 
medical services, the indictment states. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics where the bills originated and where the testing was performed were 
the "K" and "W" medical clinics, operated in San Diego by Dr. William O. 
Kupferschmidt, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the tests administered by the K and W Medical Groups were 
administered without any showing of medical necessity," the indictment says. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kupferschmidt, who currently operates the San Jose Medical Clinic in 
Hawthorne, was not indicted in the case. A graduate of the University of 
Guadalajara, he has been licensed to practice in California since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
He would not respond to numerous telephone messages and a written request for 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Despite similar requests, written and oral, none of the six defendants agreed 
to be interviewed either. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Craig Sperling said only that his client "is not guilty of the 
charges." Max Sperling declined to be interviewed. Howard Sperling did not 
respond to interview requests, and his lawyer said he would not allow his 
client to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Souza's lawyer said she is innocent and merely did her job as office 
manager of Center City Funding. Although she did not respond to interview 
requests, a transcript of her testimony to the grand jury is on file with the 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Souza told the grand jury that Craig and Max Sperling and Michael Smushkevich, 
who represented another clinic that Center City handled billing for, told her 
staff not to use the identification numbers for either Kupferschmidt's medical 
clinics or a clinic that Smushkevich represented. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if they told her why she should use other identification numbers, Souza 
said: "Because they did billings themselves from their ID numbers and the 
volume would be very . . . would raise suspicion from the insurance companies." 
</P>
<P>
Donald and Minnie Bader, the couple that the government says controlled Center 
City Funding, dispute the charges in the indictment, according to Donald 
Bader's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Craig E. Weinerman of San Diego, who represents Donald Bader, said the 
Baders were in the business of factoring medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
Factoring is better known in the wholesale and retail garment industry. Factors 
are agents who finance a company's operations, often by purchasing its accounts 
receivable at a discount. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company receives less than the full face value of its bills, the 
advantages are that it gets its cash immediately and it doesn't have to operate 
a collection department. Experts say the practice is unusual in the medical 
industry because collecting from insurance companies can be complex and 
time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
Weinerman contends that the Baders themselves were cheated because the bills 
they bought had already been rejected by insurance companies when submitted 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"The Baders were pawns of the people who set up the clinics, the people who 
brought in all of those patients," Weinerman said. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Bader is the subject of a thick dossier of lawsuits on file in San Diego 
County Superior Court, dating back to 1984. One of the pending suits accuses 
him of defrauding people who invested with them in accounts receivable. He is 
contesting the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The Baders also face trial in Iowa in July on charges of criminal securities 
fraud in connection with the sale of investments in accounts receivable. Iowa 
investors lost thousands of dollars, according to the state's complaint. Donald 
and Minnie Bader have pleaded not guilty. Also pending in Iowa is a civil suit 
that the state brought against the Baders, alleging securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of packaging medical bills and selling them as investments first 
came to the attention of Blue Shield, Aetna and other insurers in 1988, when 
they started seeing old, previously rejected claims coming back to them like 
bad pennies. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Shield's computer cracked the codes that the rebillers were using and 
proved that the claims had been submitted before. Blue Shield trained its 
mail-room staff to send envelopes with certain markings to company 
investigators. The company identified 77 company names -- most with addresses 
in Southern California -- under which the bills were being resubmitted, said 
Louis L. Lovato, Blue Shield's manager of special investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Blue Shield also began to get complaints from some of its 
subscribers that credit-collection agencies were hounding them to pay bills 
that Blue Shield had refused to pay a couple years earlier. Blue Shield's 
lawyers got the collection agencies to back off after explaining the history of 
the claims. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies had been hired by investors who had bought bundles of claims, many 
of which the insurance companies say are fraudulent. When insurance 
investigators questioned investors, they said they had no idea that the 
validity of the bills was in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
One such investor is Les Thompson, who operates a medical equipment supply 
business in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he had never invested in medical bills until he met the 
Sperlings. Over time, Thompson said he invested $350,000 with Max Sperling to 
purchase medical bills that were said to be worth $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Today, piled alongside the medical equipment at Thompson's company are tall 
stacks of files on bills that he has been unable to collect a dime on. The deal 
has turned into a catastrophe for him, Thompson said, because not all of the 
money invested was his. He said he has gone broke trying to repay the partners 
he recruited. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost everything. I lost my house. It's going to take me several years to pay 
these people off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he did get $25,000 back, but he later learned that that money had 
come from new investors recruited into the Ponzi-style scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"All hell broke loose" when Thompson tried to collect on his investment, he 
said. For one thing, he discovered that Center City Funding was trying to 
collect on the same bills. 
</P>
<P>
Business associates introduced him to the Sperlings, he said. "I heard they 
were the good guys," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Max Sperling said he was a lawyer and an accountant, Thompson said. "They were 
driving Mercedes. They had this real facade of being businessmen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he made three short-term loans to the Sperlings. They paid the 
debts promptly each time, he said. Then, in the summer of 1988, Thompson said 
Max Sperling asked him to invest in accounts receivable from a medical clinic. 
"They said they had an opportunity and would let me in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To persuade Thompson that the bills were from a legitimate clinic, Max Sperling 
showed him a signed contract between himself and Kupferschmidt in which the 
physician agreed to pay Sperling's company a service fee of 10% of the gross 
billings sent out for collection. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he does not know precisely what Kupferschmidt's role was in the 
affair. Regardless of his role, he said, Kupferschmidt should admit 
responsibility to people who got hurt, Thompson said. "I brought (partners) in. 
The money I collected from those people, I am responsible for. I have to pay 
those people back," he said. "That hurts . . . losing my money and having to 
pay those people back besides."

GROVE OFFERS MOLIERE'S 'MISER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First, the good news. While other theaters give lip service to reviving the 
classics, the Grove Shakespeare Festival does it with perseverance and 
conviction. Part of that conviction is the notion that a theater's commitment 
to the classics only begins with Shakespeare and must include the Ben Jonsons 
and Molieres. 
</P>
<P>
Only last year the Grove staged Jonson's "The Alchemist" (a California Gold 
Rush version retitled "The Scoundrel"), and its current production of Moliere's 
"The Miser" is its second foray with the acerbic French master, after an 
earlier edition of "The Imaginary Invalid" (a New Orleans version). 
</P>
<P>
This new "Miser," directed by Deborah LaVine from a Miles Malleson adaptation 
at the Grove's Gem Theatre, is a roaring '20s New York version, on a pretty, 
sun-drenched Don Llewelyn set, with a glorious array of period costumes by 
Laura Deremer. The Grove does the classics, but it likes to see how they play 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
There's more good news. "The Miser's" rather contorted plot line -- which 
begins with the attempts by two siblings, bullied into obeisance by their 
miserly father, to marry against his will -- ends with one of literature's most 
outlandishly contrived denouements. LaVine and her cast make clean lines of 
what could be a very messy affair. With its timeless moral warnings about the 
evils of materialism and the good that comes to those who give, this "Miser" 
would make a fine introduction to Moliere for children. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the not-so-good news. 
</P>
<P>
LaVine's production takes a long, long time to get the comedy in gear, and at 
the center of it all, Jerome Guardino as the penny-pinching Harpagon is 
unthreatening, unfunny and uninspired. It's only when Kimberley LaMarque 
arrives as the devious Frosine (there has been no effort made, nor is it 
needed, to Americanize the characters' names) that a sense of Moliere's theater 
touches down at the Gem. 
</P>
<P>
And only in the second act does most of the cast seem involved in comedy that 
requires a balance of verbal and physical wit with a realization that each 
character has his or her scheming side -- a darker double that makes the comedy 
extraordinarily rich. 
</P>
<P>
"The Miser" also should have a dance-like quality, with characters moving in 
and out of Harpagon's sitting room in an increasingly mad roundelay of manners 
and plots and delusions. Exits and entrances, though, are generally slow, or 
too fast, or ill-timed: From the audience's point of view during one crucial 
moment of action, Harpagon's stolen casket of gold coins is in Guardino's clear 
view, though the plot demands that it be removed from his sight at the last 
moment. If these actors were making double plays, the runner at first would 
almost always be safe. 
</P>
<P>
Though much is made of Harpagon's advancing age, especially when he is trying 
to woo the woman his son (Paul Read) has his eyes on, Guardino plays him too 
old. The price paid: This Harpagon is not terribly intimidating. The threats, 
the bodily force, the stare-downs all are fairly hollow, as if the actors were 
going through the required paces. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the actors go further. Along with LaMarque's sweepingly polished 
Frosine, Rob Monroe's hapless servant Jacques is a towering fool, Marcelo 
Tubert's devious Valere gains comic force with every glance and Rudy Nemetz's 
street-tough moneylender is one of the freshest ideas in this 
red-white-and-blue version. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grove Shakespeare Festival's production of "The Miser" by Moliere will 
continue at the Gem Theatre, 12852 Main St., Garden Grove, May 30 through June 
23, Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. 
Tickets: $16 to $22. Information: (714) 636-7213.

Alpha Beta -- A story published Friday about American Store Co.'s plans to sell 
some Alpha Beta and Lucky stores incorrectly attributed comments to Ron 
Knechtel, the grocery warehouse manager at Alpha Beta's office and distribution 
center in La Habra. The comments were made by several Alpha Beta workers who 
had attended a meeting at which Knechtel spoke.

FBI RAIDS NORTHROP FA-18 PLANTS

<P>
FBI agents today raided Northrop Corp. plants in Hawthorne and El Segundo where 
fuselage parts are built for the Navy's FA-18 fighter-bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop spokesman Ron Owens confirmed the searches. 
</P>
<P>
"We are working with them in their search, and that is all that I can comment 
upon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
FBI Special Agent Fred Reagan said he could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas is the prime contractor for the carrier-based FA-18. Northrop 
assembles the center and aft sections of the plane as a subcontractor under 
what is known as a sole source, fixed-price agreement. That means only one 
contractor is considered qualified to do the work, and it is not subject to 
competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the Justice Department sued Northrop, claiming the company had 
fraudulently fattened bills submitted to the Navy for work on the FA-18. The 
department decided not to file criminal charges as part of a deal with Northrop 
last February involving a guilty plea in another fraud case.

JOB RIGHTS VOTED FOR DISABLED;

<P>

The House voted 403 to 20 today for landmark legislation prohibiting 
discrimination against America's 43 million physically and mentally disabled 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans with Disabilities Act goes to House and Senate negotiators after 
the Memorial Day recess to work out the one major difference in the two 
versions. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is a House amendment, passed 199-187 last week, to let employers 
reassign AIDS-infected workers to keep them from handling food. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the amendment would allow discrimination against one group of 
people despite overwhelming medical evidence that AIDS is not transmitted 
through such casual contact. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has urged speedy passage of the bill, aimed at doing for 
disabled Americans what the Civil Rights Act of 1964 set out to do for blacks 
and other minorities: guarantee access to jobs, businesses, services, 
transportation and telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to passage, the House voted 227-192 to defeat an amendment limiting the 
remedies disabled workers could seek from employers who willfully discriminate. 
The White House supported that amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Among key provisions of the bill: 
</P>
<P>
* Discrimination in hiring and on the job would be prohibited. The requirement 
would be phased in over two to four years, depending on the size of the 
company. Companies with fewer than 15 employees would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
* Hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, drug stores, and business and 
professional offices, along with any other "public accommodation," would have 
to make themselves accessible to disabled people. Accessibility includes 
structural adjustments, such as wheelchair ramps and widened doors, and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
* Transportation, public and private, would have to be made accessible. 
Fixed-route bus systems would have to be accessible for people with 
wheelchairs. Special facilities would be available for people with other 
disabilities who cannot use regular transit. Amtrak, Greyhound and commuter 
rail systems are covered. Timetables for implementation vary according to 
system. 
</P>
<P>
* People with speech and hearing impairments would have access to telephone 
service by means of relay services. These services would have to be provided by 
phone companies within three years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant and historical step forward for the disabled," Rep. 
Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation builds on the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which does not address the 
disabled, and the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, which does not specifically deal 
with public accommodations, private sector employment and programs not 
receiving federal money. 
</P>
<P>
The House rejected, 192-227, an attempt by Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr. ( 
R-Wis.) to limit the legal remedies for victims of job discrimination to those 
now available under the Civil Rights Act. These include getting a court-ordered 
injunction against bias and the awarding of back pay and attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
The bill allows disabled victims of discrimination to take advantage of 
whatever is provided in the pending Civil Rights Act of 1990. Under 
consideration is a proposal to allow monetary damages.

AIR ADVISORY PANEL CALLS MOTHERS' LAPS UNSAFE IN CRASHES

The National Transportation Safety Board recommended today that children now 
flying free in parents' arms be required to sit in separate safety seats on 
airliners. 
</P>
<P>
"All objects must be secured during takeoff and landing, including coffeepots 
and luggage," said board Chairman James L. Kolstad. "And yet infants, our 
precious children, are not." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, approved 4 to 0 by the board, does not deal with who will provide 
the seats or whether children will pay fares. But if such a regulation takes 
effect, airlines are expected to require that parents generally lug along an 
infant seat -- like those required in cars -- and buy a ticket if they want to 
be guaranteed passage for the child. 
</P>
<P>
When planes aren't full, the airlines are expected to continue to let infants 
fly at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation now goes to the Federal Aviation Administration, which has 
resisted a mandatory rule on the grounds that the 5,000 to 10,000 youngsters 
under 2 years old who fly in adults' laps each day are not at great risk. The 
FAA is not required to follow NTSB recommendations and sometimes doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Asked after the vote if the possible increased cost for travelers could be 
justified, Kolstad said, "I don't think the cost of protecting an infant's life 
is too much to ask." 
</P>
<P>
He said the practice of allowing infants to fly in parents' laps is "a hole in 
the law . . . an oversight we think needs to be corrected." 
</P>
<P>
Under the NTSB proposal, parents who arrive at the gate of a fully booked 
flight with an unticketed baby would not be allowed to take the child aboard. 
They also could be denied passage with any small child, with or without ticket, 
if they are not carrying an approved car seat. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA has said it will consider mandatory restraints but has proposed only to 
require that airlines allow seats on board if passengers chose to use them -- a 
practice now followed by most airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The airline industry, the flight attendants union, consumer safety groups and 
some members of Congress all have called for mandatory restraints. 
</P>
<P>
Some travel agents are among opponents of the measure who say it would add to 
the cost of flying for young families and possibly force them to travel by 
automobile on shorter routes. They say automobile travel poses greater risks 
per mile than flying. 
</P>
<P>
A Harvard Medical School statistical study in the early 1980s theorized that 
three infants might be saved over five years if all children used safety seats 
on airliners. 
</P>
<P>
But two recent crashes in which unrestrained infants were killed have led to 
more support for mandatory restraints. Two of the five unsecured children 
aboard United Flight 232 that crashed in Iowa last July died, and at least one 
unseated child was killed aboard the Avianca airliner that crashed in New York 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB proposal would prevent children under 40 inches or 40 pounds from 
flying without car seats approved for airliner use. 
</P>
<P>
The safety board proposal, in focusing on size and weight of the child rather 
than age, could also lead to required seats for small children older than 2 who 
are now allowed to use ordinary seat belts, board senior investigator Nora 
Marshall said.

Police battled hundreds of protesters outside the U.S. consulate today and 
troops killed a Palestinian in the Gaza Strip amid new rioting over the 
massacre of seven Arab laborers by an Israeli gunman. 
</P>
<P>
In Jordan, Palestinian protests broke out nationwide, and two people were 
reported killed and 23 injured. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations protesting the Israeli killing were held in the capital of 
Amman, the cities of Irbid and Zarqa and the Baqaa refugee camp. A Jordanian 
government official acknowledged only one death. 
</P>
<P>
At least 14 Palestinians were wounded by troops in clashes in the 
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, including a woman five months pregnant who was hit 
in the stomach with a plastic bullet, Arab hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Palestinian died of wounds suffered in an earlier clash, bringing to 12 
the number of Arabs killed since Sunday's massacre. The number of Palestinians 
injured by troops since Sunday reached at least 826. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians closed shops and schools 
and stayed home from jobs in Israel for a third day to protest Sunday's 
slayings in which an Israeli gunman lined up 50 Arab laborers and opened fire, 
killing seven. 
</P>
<P>
In Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem, police fired tear gas today to break up 
a protest by about 200 Palestinians, mostly women, who carried black flags of 
mourning and chanted pro-PLO slogans as they marched to the U.S. consulate.

DENG BLAMES LEADERSHIP FOR STUDENT UNREST

Senior leader Deng Xiaoping blamed poor party leadership as the root cause for 
last year's pro-democracy demonstrations, West German sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
The new Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, says he cannot rule out more such 
demonstrations this year, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The comments came in talks Monday with former West German Chancellor Helmut 
Schmidt, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said Deng and Jiang took a generally conciliatory stance toward 
students who took part in the pro-democracy demonstrations, which were crushed 
by the military in June. 
</P>
<P>
Deng, China's 85-year-old patriarch, said poor party leadership was the root 
cause of the popular drive for democratic reform. Then-party chief Zhao Ziyang, 
Deng's protege, was purged in June for being sympathetic to the student 
movement. Since then, many of Zhao's followers have been jailed or lost their 
jobs in a sweep against the ideologically suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt told Deng that China suffered a serious loss of prestige when the 
military killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, in ending the democracy movement, 
and that the West had no choice but to downgrade relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said Jiang told Schmidt the possibility of new demonstrations could 
not be excluded. He said "hostile forces" are trying to make use of 
anniversaries of events during the demonstrations last May and June. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China has built up its riot police, which is now better-equipped 
with non-lethal weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, secretary-general of the State Council, also told Schmidt that only 
police forces, not the military, would be used to put down any future political 
unrest.

ETHIOPIA EXECUTES 12 IN '89 COUP

Ethiopia said today that it has executed 12 high-ranking military officers for 
involvement in a 1989 coup attempt against President Mengistu Haile Mariam. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian news agency said the 12 had been found guilty of high treason and 
endangering the unity and territorial integrity of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 included the former head of the army ground forces, Maj. Gen. Hailu 
Gabre Michael, and former police chief Maj. Gen. Worku Zwede. 
</P>
<P>
Nine generals were killed during the May, 1989, attempted coup by several 
military commanders who said they wanted a negotiated end to the long-running 
civil war in northern Ethiopia and formation of a broader-based government. 
Mengistu was out of the country on a state visit to East Germany, but the coup 
was crushed by forces loyal to his Soviet-backed government within three days.

About 350,000 mourners beating their breasts and crying for revenge marched 
today in a funeral procession for the chief Muslim cleric of Kashmir, who was 
assassinated in his home by three unknown gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
The procession passed peacefully although police say at least 50 died Monday 
when security forces fired on thousands of Muslims who seized Mirwaiz Maulvi 
Farooq's body from a hospital and carried it through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported 25 of the 50 victims had died in hospitals after shootings 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police took no chances at the funeral, deploying thousands of combat-ready 
troops across the tense summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir state. The 
predominantly Muslim Kashmir area has been convulsed since mid-January by an 
uprising against Indian rule. 
</P>
<P>
A curfew was lifted in the areas through which the 3-mile-long funeral 
procession passed today and authorities withdrew security forces from those 
areas to avoid provocations.

BOESKY TELLS OF CASH PAYOFFS FOR INFORMATION

Ivan F. Boesky calmly admitted today that he paid for inside information with 
briefcases full of cash as Wall Street's most celebrated felon gave his first 
public testimony since his 1986 plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying against former friend John A. Mulheren Jr. on securities fraud 
charges, Boesky recounted the crimes he committed with other players in Wall 
Street's insider trading scandal -- such as Dennis Levine, formerly with Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc., and investment banker Martin Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you understand you were committing a crime when you traded on inside 
information from Dennis Levine?" Assistant U.S. Atty. Scott Gilbert asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Boesky said in a firm and loud voice. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky, center of the biggest insider trading crime scandal in Wall Street 
history, made his entrance through a back door of Manhattan federal court, 
where he faced Mulheren and a packed courtroom. It was Boesky's first public 
appearance since he was released early from a three-year prison term last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Clean-shaven, with his white hair cropped short, Boesky wore a charcoal gray 
suit, white shirt and dark tie. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky testified that he received inside information about proposed takeover 
attempts from Levine and Siegel, and that he had agreed to pay them up to 5% of 
his firm's profits for their help. 
</P>
<P>
He said he never gave Levine any money. Siegel, however, received a total of 
$800,000 in three cash deliveries, Boesky said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was assembled by a colleague out of my personal accounts, put into a 
briefcase and handed by an intermediary to Mr. Siegel," Boesky said. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth cash delivery to Siegel was canceled when he received word about a 
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Levine's dealings, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, the first to implicate Boesky, pleaded guilty to felony charges in 
June, 1986, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Siegel also pleaded 
guilty to securities fraud-related counts and is awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky is the government's main witness against Mulheren on charges of stock 
manipulation and other securities fraud violations. 
</P>
<P>
The two once were close friends but Mulheren became enraged when he learned 
Boesky had implicated him in wrongdoing a few years ago. At one point, Mulheren 
allegedly plotted to assassinate him with an assault rifle. Weapons charges 
against Mulheren were subsequently dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky, who avoided making eye contact with the defendant, said Mulheren was 
one of his few friends with whom he shared the information he received from 
Levine and Siegel.

A Colorado savings and loan that counted one of President Bush's sons as a 
director made inflated loans to developers who had to reinvest part of the 
money in the thrift, federal regulators said today. 
</P>
<P>
The House Banking Committee opened two days of hearings on the $1-billion 
collapse of the Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Denver. Bush's 
son, Neil, is to testify on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of thrift regulators told the committee that they found a "quid pro 
quo" lending program at Silverado, under which developers received loans to buy 
buildings at inflated values set by outside appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
The panel of regulators testifying today included Stephen P. Hershkowitz, 
deputy director of enforcement at the Office of Thrift Supervision.

Alan Bond's struggling flagship, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., struck a deal with 
its bankers and an independent subsidiary today that will cost it control of 
the Australian breweries that are its major asset. 
</P>
<P>
Bond Corp. agreed to sell the breweries, which supply about 40% of the 5 
billion cans of beer drunk every year in Australia, to its 58%-owned Bell 
Resources Ltd. for $1.85 billion ($1.4 billion U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
The deal does not affect Bond's U.S. breweries, which include La Crosse, 
Wis.-based G. Heileman Brewing Co., Bond Corp. said. 
</P>
<P>
Cash flow from the Australian breweries, producers of Swan lager, was the 
driving force behind the construction of Bond Corp.'s now shaky empire, which 
is struggling with debts of $5.06 billion (U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
Bond Corp. agreed today to limit immediately its voting rights in Bell 
Resources to 25% and to sell its holding in the company down to 25% by March, 
1991.

The Senate Commerce Committee approved today a uniform national system to deal 
with consumers injured by products, limiting punitive damages to cases of 
"flagrant indifference" by the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a uniform system, the bill, approved 13 to 7 and sent to the 
Senate for action, provides incentives for quick settlement of product 
liability cases. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was sponsored by two Democrats and two Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"American companies face 50 different state laws, plus liability costs that are 
20 to 50 times higher than their foreign competitors," co-sponsor Jack Danforth 
(R-Mo.) said. "And liability cases drag on for years, leaving too much of the 
money to attorneys instead of to victims." 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to put fairness and efficiency on the front burner," he said.

CHRYSLER ENDS EFFORT TO SELL SUBSIDIARIES

Chrysler Corp. said today it has taken down the "For Sale" signs at its 
defense, electronics and aerospace units that have been up since last December, 
after receiving no acceptable bids for the companies. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Chrysler Technologies in Washington said Chrysler will instead 
retain and nurture Electrospace Systems, Airborne Systems and Pentastar 
Electronics, which he said are all profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler sold its Gulfstream Aerospace division last March for $825 million, 
after paying $637 million for the Savannah, Ga., corporate jet maker in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"We said at the time of the Gulfstream sale that Chrysler was not in need of 
cash," Chrysler Technologies spokesman John Stellman said, adding that the No. 
3 car maker currently has more than $4.3 billion on hand. "We didn't find 
buyers so we are perfectly content to just continue owning them." 
</P>
<P>
In light of military cutbacks, Chrysler will instead concentrate on reducing 
the amount of defense business by those operations while increasing commercial 
sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at their potential profitability, it makes better business sense to 
hold onto them than to discount the price," Stellman said, adding that while 
these companies "don't interact" with Chrysler's vehicle business, "they don't 
interfere with it either." 
</P>
<P>
"Part of our ongoing plan has been to move into more commercial-type work," 
Stellman said. "We would like to increase that from 10% now to about 25% in the 
coming years." 
</P>
<P>
The three companies in Chrysler Technologies employ about 3,500 employees in 
Texas, Alabama and Virginia. While Chrysler does not disclose profits of its 
operating units, those companies posted $300 million in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said Chrysler could still sell one or all of those companies 
if it were to get a good offer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more that nobody decided to buy them," said David Healy, of Barclays BZW 
in New York. "It's probably true that Chrysler is under no particular gun to 
liquidate at this time since it does not have a cash squeeze. They've got more 
cash than they have had for some time."

Max Wall, the music hall dancer and comedian who blossomed into an acclaimed 
stage actor in the plays of Samuel Beckett, died today after a fall. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
Wall fell at a restaurant in central London on Monday afternoon, said his 
agent, Joan Prichard. He never regained consciousness and died early this 
morning at Westminster Hospital from a fractured skull. Wall became famous for 
his "Professor Wallofsky" character, a double-jointed eccentric whose bizarre 
walk was said to have inspired John Cleese of the Monty Python Flying Circus, 
the comedy troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Wall's career went into decline after the breakup of his first marriage, and he 
was reduced to working obscure north England nightclubs. He married and 
divorced twice more. His fortune dwindled to bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
But his career was resurrected when his comic talents and clown face, having 
reputedly attracted the attention of Beckett, landed him parts in the Irish 
playwright's "Waiting for Godot" and "Krapp's Last Tape."

Can "Star Wars" teach children about the solar system? The yet-to-be launched 
Sci-Fi Channel has entered into an arrangement with the science magazine Omni 
to create original programming -- including education programs for children. 
</P>
<P>
"Science fiction is really a great way of introducing science to children," 
said Kathy Keeton, president of Omni magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"Many scientists -- including Carl Sagan -- first experienced the thrill of 
science through the magic of science fiction." 
</P>
<P>
One of the first programs will be the newsmagazine "Omni Magazine's Space 
Watch," which will cover a range of topics, from launches to NASA's Space Camp 
to the Soviet Union's space program. 
</P>
<P>
Upon its launch, the Sci-Fi Channel will be made up of a mix of original 
programming, vintage television shows, motion pictures, situation comedies and 
live-audience game shows originating from the channel's studios in Orlando, 
Fla.

Zsa Zsa Gabor's Rolls-Royce had no star appeal for bidders at the annual

"Perhaps the right-wing audience didn't respond to it," Terry Cooper, spokesman 
for the auction, said Monday.

Auctioneers said the actress was driving the Rolls when she had her renowned 
run-in with a Beverly Hills motorcycle policeman. A California jury convicted 
her of charges alleging that she slapped the officer after he stopped her. 
</P>
<P>
The Rolls drew a $23,000 bid, Cooper said. Appraisers estimated that the Rolls

Bob Weiss, who won only 59 of 164 games in two seasons as head coach at San 
Antonio, became the new coach of the Atlanta Hawks today. 
</P>
<P>
Hawks President Stan Kasten announced the choice at a news conference at the 
Omni, saying he was "very, very confident that this is the right choice for 
this team at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss replaces Mike Fratello, who resigned last month after the Hawks finished 
the season at 41-41 and missed the NBA playoffs for the first time since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss was fired by San Antonio after the 1987-88 season and most recently was 
an assistant with the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
Kasten said over the weekend that Weiss and New Jersey Nets Vice President 
Willis Reed were the two finalists for the job. Reed withdrew on Monday and was 
named senior vice president of the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
By missing the playoffs, the Hawks won a berth in the NBA draft lottery but had 
only one Ping-Pong ball among 66 in the drawing and finished with the 11th pick 
in the first round of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
After his retirement as a player in 1977, Weiss spent two years as an assistant 
to Gene Shue with the San Diego Clippers. In 1980, he became an assistant with 
the Dallas Mavericks, where he stayed until he was named head coach of the 
Spurs in 1986.

SUMMER SQUALL IS A POWERFUL SYMBOL OF THE DRUG'S BENEFITS

Two weeks before the Preakness, the results of a scientific study of Lasix had 
been made public and touched off controversy throughout the racing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania concluded that the drug doesn't 
prevent horses from bleeding but that it does make them run faster. So with 
Summer Squall's impressive Lasix-aided victory Saturday at Pimlico, it seems 
inevitable that he will be a focal point of the raging debate over this 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
And both sides may point to Summer Squall as a vindication of their positions. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall has a serious bleeding problem. He gushed blood from his nostrils 
after a workout in Florida this winter, and ever since that incident he has 
been given Lasix before races and hard workouts. On a few occasions, blood has 
trickled from his nostrils after routine morning gallops when he wasn't treated 
with the diuretic. 
</P>
<P>
When this happened the day before the Preakness, many witnesses were alarmed, 
but trainer Neil Howard assured them: 
</P>
<P>
"The Lasix will hold the bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
And it did. Without the medication, Summer Squall would have been at such risk 
in the Preakness that Howard wouldn't have let him run. With Lasix, he was able 
to finish powerfully and defeat Unbridled (another Lasix user) by 2 1/4 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of Howard and owner Cot Campbell, as well as the vast majority of 
trainers, owners and veterinarians in America, Summer Squall demonstrates why 
it would be senseless to ban the use of Lasix. This extraordinarily talented 
horse suffers from one specific physical problem, and there exists a medication 
that can remedy that problem. 
</P>
<P>
Why deny the horse this help, deny racing the presence of a top attraction, 
deny the owners who put so much money into this game the chance to make a 
profit? 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Summer Squall's record casts plenty of doubts on the University of 
Pennsylvania study. That study said Lasix has "questionable efficacy" for the 
prevention of bleeding. But even if the medication is not foolproof, virtually 
all practicing vets say it is generally effective. What better evidence could 
there be than Summer Squall? On Friday, without Lasix, he couldn't even gallop 
without bleeding; on Saturday, with Lasix, he could win the second-fastest 
Preakness in history with no ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell reaffirmed after the Preakness that Summer Squall would not run in the 
Belmont Stakes, because Lasix is not permitted in New York State. The little 
colt needs a rest, he said. He would return to competition this fall, the main 
objective to be the Breeders' Cup -- at Belmont Park. And that decision seems 
to expose the hollowness of the arguments of the pro-Lasix forces. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell and Howard believe that Summer Squall will be able to run effectively 
without medication if he is given a sufficient period of rest this summer. 
Indeed, rest has been the traditional prescription for horses who bleed in all 
the other countries of the world where medication is not permitted and in the 
United States before Lasix was legalized in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
If that is the case, why wasn't Summer Squall given a long period of 
recuperation after he bled in Florida? Why aren't run-of-the-mill horses given 
rest instead of injections when they bleed? The answer, of course, is simple. 
Money. Most owners of thoroughbreds lose money anyway, and it is an expensive 
proposition to put a horse on the shelf for months when he will generate a pile 
of expenses but no income. How many of the anti-Lasix moralists, had they been 
members of the 28-man syndicate that owns Summer Squall, would have pleaded 
with Campbell, the syndicate manager: "Forget about the Kentucky Derby. Forget 
about the Preakness. Give this horse a rest." 
</P>
<P>
The Lasix dilemma is a difficult one for the thoroughbred industry because 
there are such strong arguments on each side of it. It is likely to remain a 
divisive issue for a long time, because each side seems immovable in its 
convictions.

The names of 25 players who survived the first cuts of the U.S. Men's National 
Team trials were announced by USA Basketball today, including four players from 
the national champion University of Nevada-Las Vegas team. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen players from the trials, along with six athletes who were granted 
waivers, will now converge on Duke University June 15-17 for a mini-camp. There 
the team will be cut to 15 to compete in the Goodwill Games in Seattle July 
23-29, according to Craig Miller, a spokesman for USA Basketball. 
</P>
<P>
A team of 12 will be dressed for play in the FIBA World Championship game in 
Argentina Aug. 8-19, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The four-day camp wrapped up Monday night. Forty-seven players attended the 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with the efforts that were given at the camp," said head 
coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke. "It made the decision very difficult, however, 
that's the type of decision the selection committee wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"The youngsters who were brought forward give us a lot of versatility. We have 
good size, quickness, and a nice mix of youth and experience. We're hoping that 
the waiver people will also be available at Duke and we'll cut down to a more 
workable number after the mini-camp at Duke." 
</P>
<P>
The 19 athletes who participated in the trials and were selected for the 
Durham, N.C. mini-camp include: Kenny Anderson (Georgia Tech); Randy Brown (New 
Mexico State); Todd Day (Arkansas); Chris Gatling (Old Dominion); Robert Horry 
(Alabama); Robert Hurley (Duke); James Jackson (Ohio State); Christian Laettner 
(Duke); Kevin Lynch (Minnesota); Lee Mayberry (Arkansas); Chris Mills 
(Arizona); Billy Owens (Syracuse); Mark Randall (Kansas); Sean Rooks (Arizona); 
Chris Smith (Connecticut); Doug Smith (Missouri); Bryant Stith (Virginia); 
Clarence Weatherspoon (Southern Mississippi), and Henry Williams (North 
Carolina-Charlotte). 
</P>
<P>
Six athletes who applied for and were granted a trial waiver include: Greg 
Anthony (UNLV); Stacey Augmon (UNLV); Danny Ferry (Duke graduate); Anderson 
Hunt (UNLV); Larry Johnson (UNLV), and Alonzo Mourning (Georgetown University).

RETIREMENT;

FOR SOME, LIFE OF RETIREMENT ISN'T NIRVANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After "a lot of personal soul-searching" and with no firm plan for the future, 
Pacific Bell manager Evelyn Augustus decided to accept the phone company's 
offer to take early retirement in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good offer," said Augustus, 56, who during a 20-year career with 
Pacific Bell worked her way up from an operator to manager of municipal and 
emergency 911 installations in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I had kind of reached the peak of management level that I could go," she said. 
"With the downsizing of the company, the opportunities to move into the second 
tier of management were not good." 
</P>
<P>
Augustus got the chance to do what many of us spend years daydreaming about: 
grabbing the good life after waving goodby to our employers. We think about 
playing golf every morning, crisscrossing the country by motor home or retiring 
to a quaint seaside village in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many of us think we would like to retire early if we could. According 
to The Times Orange County Poll, 55% of employed county residents would like to 
retire when they reach age 55, if not sooner. And that sentiment is even 
stronger among those who are in their early careers or mid-careers, with about 
two-thirds hoping for an early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll also showed, however, that those who are nearing retirement age 
are far less likely than their younger colleagues to want to retire early. One 
in three who are in the advanced states of their career want to retire at age 
66 or older, and 20% want to keep working past age 70. 
</P>
<P>
But while many of us may think we want to retire early, employment specialists 
said that many people soon discover that a life of leisure isn't all it's 
cracked up to be. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, a Chicago-based 
international outplacement consulting firm, found that about half of early 
retirees want to return to work after three months in retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people go out and travel for a year, and others go play golf for a year," 
said John A. Challenger, vice president of Challenger, Gray. "They realize that 
what was once play loses its charm when it becomes their full-time activity." 
</P>
<P>
But restlessness or boredom aren't the only reasons people decide to come out 
of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Some retirees find that they miss longtime friends at work and the office 
camaraderie. Others feel that retirement doesn't offer them the sense of 
purpose and self-accomplishment that their jobs did. This latter feeling, 
employment experts said, is particularly true among corporate executives 
accustomed to a fast-paced, decision-making environment. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar S. Brower is one such executive. Six years ago, at age 53, Brower took 
early retirement from Allied Signal Corp., where he was president of the firm's 
$1-billion electronic components division. He walked away with a lucrative 
severance package -- a so-called golden parachute -- that left him financially 
set for life. 
</P>
<P>
He spent the next three years playing golf and tennis, watching over his 
investments and "just kind of putzing around." But after a while, he said, "you 
suddenly realize that there are a whole bunch of hours in the day that you 
can't fill. You're kind of out of the club now. I didn't miss the limousines 
and helicopters and private jets. It was strictly the need to get those 
creative juices flowing again." 
</P>
<P>
Brower, a former U.S. assistant postmaster general, went back to work in 1985 
as president and chief executive of Pacific Scientific Co., a Newport Beach 
aerospace and industrial products manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not even thinking about retirement now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But many early retirees face a much different financial picture. Although the 
lump-sum payments and sweetened pension packages that companies often offer to 
early retirees may look attractive at first, people often find that retirement 
living is more expensive than they expected. Some discover that they are just 
not ready to live a more frugal lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Early retirement "is a big financial planning task, and trying to figure out 
what to do is very difficult," said Brian Mittman, a Rand Corp. analyst who is 
studying early retirement trends. "The normal worker is not equipped to make 
these type of decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell's Augustus discovered that very thing. Augustus was one of 
thousands of Pacific Bell employees struggling with the question of early 
retirement when the company's parent company, Pacific Telesis Group, was trying 
to cut costs to keep up with increasingly tough competition in the 
telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
To help nudge workers out the door, the company offered an attractive severance 
package: an extra five years tacked on to workers' age and length of service. 
Augustus took the bait. 
</P>
<P>
And after leaving the phone company, she enjoyed herself by redecorating her 
condominium in Orange and helping her son, Morgan, set up a Southwestern-style 
furniture store in Irvine. But eight months later, reality kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
"Financially, I wasn't prepared for full retirement," she said. "The pension 
check would not have allowed me to keep up my lifestyle, at least not until I 
was eligible for Social Security." 
</P>
<P>
So Augustus has gone back to work as manager of telecommunications for Colonial 
Insurance Co. of California in Orange. "There are a lot of new challenges, and 
this job has really stimulated my mind," she said. "It's like a whole new 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Employment specialists said, however, that Augustus is more fortunate than some 
early retirees who decided to go back to work. She worked in an industry with a 
strong demand for experienced professionals -- and she didn't stay out of the 
work force too long. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer they (retirees) are out of the workplace, the less desirable they 
become in the market," Challenger said. "Hiring companies wonder about their 
motivation, the currency of their skills and why other companies have not hired 
them."

COMMUTING;

<P>
COMPANIES ARE UNDER THE GUN TO LIGHTEN COMMUTER CRUNCH 
</P>

<P>
Under the iron-gray skies of morning, Chuck Denman listens to the steady 
swoosh-swoosh of his plastic skate wheels spinning against the blacktop. 
</P>
<P>
While his co-workers wallow in freeway traffic, Denman strides through a back 
route in Seal Beach, where he spies an occasional fox darting through the 
undergrowth or hawk gliding above the fields. 
</P>
<P>
"I find driving to work is pretty boring," said Denman, 42, a strategic 
planning and marketing analyst who either runs, bikes or skates to work most 
days. "You are encased in a box on four wheels." 
</P>
<P>
The nine-mile route from his home in Long Beach to his office at McDonnell 
Douglas Space Systems Co. in Huntington Beach generally takes him a little more 
than an hour to skate. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Denman said his human-powered commuting habit made him the butt of a 
few good-natured gibes. But he has become something of a company role model 
because county companies are under pressure to encourage employees to share 
rides, take van pools or buses or arrive under their own power to lessen smog 
and traffic congestion. For every Denman an employer can muster, one fewer car 
spews pollutants as it comes through the front gate in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
All companies with more than 100 workers at a single job site are required to 
survey employees' commuting habits and submit a plan to the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District to increase the number of riders per vehicle -- or 
get cars off the road altogether. Companies that fail to submit or update a 
plan face fines up to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
While the El Monte-based smog czars rule with a stick, companies trying to 
entice employees out of their personal cars have been handing out carrots. 
</P>
<P>
Most large county companies offer incentives to ride-sharing employees. Some 
companies offer preferential parking or awarding them in monthly drawings with 
such items as an earthquake survival kit or a weekend getaway. Others are 
forming bicycle clubs, paying car-poolers $1 or more a day or handing out extra 
vacation days. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers are doing away with driving to work entirely. They are allowing 
selected employees to "telecommute" by working at home on personal computers 
and staying in touch by phone. 
</P>
<P>
These changes in commuting habits are mandated by the AQMD's ominous-sounding 
Regulation XV -- the measure that requires employers to encourage a cutback in 
single-car commuting by their workers. It was enacted in 1988, when the 
district estimated that each car carried the equivalent of 1.1 people. 
</P>
<P>
County employers are required to try to meet a goal of 1.5 employees per car. 
Just how much the measure has reduced traffic since it went into effect has not 
been determined, district spokesman Bill Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
"Employers by and large have voluntarily complied with this, because they see 
it as a benefit and something they can do to ease congestion and clean up the 
air," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Those that have failed to submit plans have paid the price. Twenty-five 
employers -- ranging from a card casino to an airline -- have paid fines 
totaling $314,500 through last month. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the heady task of trying to break deeply ingrained employee habits, 
some county companies seek help from private consultants or the Orange County 
Transit District's commuter network. 
</P>
<P>
The network pairs a company's employees with neighbors for car-pooling. Also, 
through its Quick Start Program, the district loans vans to employers for up to 
three months for pooling experiments, district spokeswoman Mona Ziada said. 
About 450 companies have used the programs since their inception in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Consultant Marilyn Olson, who left the district after a decade as a 
ride-sharing specialist to start her own business, said she has been showing 
employers how to put their plans into action. 
</P>
<P>
Olson, who is assisting Bechman Instruments Inc. of Fullerton with 
implementation of its plan, said she formed a "commuter club" for car-pooling 
employees. They receive an embossed coffee mug to start and are eligible to 
receive $1 for every day they participate. 
</P>
<P>
Direct subsidies to employees result in "dramatic increases" in car-pool 
activity, said Olson, who operates her business under the name Commute Options 
of Anaheim. While the greatest growth has been in car-pooling, she said, she is 
"absolutely amazed at the number of people registered for walking and biking." 
</P>
<P>
Paying employees for every day they car-pool has proven more effective in 
building a program than monthly giveaways, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But some companies say the giveaways are popular. McDonnell Douglas in 
Huntington Beach, where Denman works, holds drawings for weekend trips to San 
Diego and other places via Amtrak. The company has more than a dozen van pools 
and a bicycle club with 60 members. 
</P>
<P>
Denman said he started his self-propelled commute to add more hours to his day. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided if I can arrange the logistics of getting my (business) suits to 
work, I could combine my commuting needs with my exercise goals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he drives once or twice a week to drop off a few clean suits at work. 
</P>
<P>
Some people no longer commute at all. Pacific Bell, as one might expect, is 
experimenting with allowing a handful of workers to "telecommute" to their jobs 
at the Tustin Center operations. That is, they work at home. 
</P>
<P>
Site Manager Barbara Carpenter said that while her location does not lend 
itself to telecommuting as well as some others, it is being explored as one way 
of helping to comply with the clean-air regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell is also considering using the concept of the guaranteed ride home 
-- having managers give workers a lift home if they work late or reimbursing 
their cab fare, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cigna Property &amp; Casualty Cos. in Orange, in another unusual strategy, is 
allowing regular car-poolers off work an hour early on Fridays and giving them 
an extra two days of vacation for year-round participation.

<P>
Behind the gleaming glass of the office buildings that dot Orange County, 
executives and secretaries alike toil away at computer terminals -- an activity 
that seems safe enough. One would think the hazardous duty at such locales was 
limited to the window-washers. 
</P>
<P>
But what appears to be the fastest-growing occupational safety problem in the 
country has more to do with screens than scaffolds. People who spend a lot of 
time working at video display terminals are increasingly being afflicted with a 
range of maladies that are often grouped under the heading "computeritis." 
</P>
<P>
The problems posed by computers range from relatively minor eye or back strains 
to serious muscular-skeletal disorders, such as painful and debilitating carpal 
tunnel syndrome. And the jury is still out on the question of whether low-level 
magnetic radiation from VDTs can cause reproductive disorders in women. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki O'Neil of Anaheim Hills was among the 10% of the respondents to The Times 
Orange County Poll who reported health problems from working at a computer. Her 
eyesight, she said, has definitely deteriorated during the eight years she has 
worked with a computer as an administrative assistant. She also complains of 
constant fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wasn't made to sit in front of one of these things all day," O'Neil 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She also believes two miscarriages were linked to constant exposure to VDTs, 
although she concedes that she cannot prove a link. But she suffered another 
problem that everyone associated with computeritis knows to be real: "If you 
tell someone their problems are from the computer, they laugh at you." 
</P>
<P>
No one at the Bureau of Labor Statistics is laughing, though. The federal 
agency reported a sharp increase in "cumulative trauma" disorders in its latest 
count of occupational illnesses, with 115,400 cases nationwide. That category, 
which accounts for 48% of all workplace disorders, includes injuries from a 
wide variety of jobs that require constant repetition of an activity. It 
includes such diverse occupations as meatpacking, piano playing, supermarket 
checking and newspaper reporting. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 these repetitive motion problems accounted for just 38% of all 
disorders, and in 1981 they represented only 18%. Experts are convinced the 
dramatic increase is due to computer-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Many employers have begun to recognize some of the physical problems associated 
with heavy computer usage. 
</P>
<P>
Carpal tunnel syndrome results from inflammation of the tendons that pass 
through a "tunnel" of bones in the wrist and can cause severe pain in the hands 
and forearms. Back and neck pain are also frequent complaints of computer 
users. And eyestrain, including claims of permanent vision damage, are the most 
common malady of VDT users. 
</P>
<P>
Many computer-related problems can be alleviated, at least in part, if the 
height and distance of screens are adjusted properly, if good lighting and good 
seating is used and if workers are educated about proper posture. 
Forward-thinking companies already have programs in place to make the computer 
workplace a safer one. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times, which has had numerous complaints of computeritis among 
reporters and editors, is currently taking part in a major National Institute 
of Occupational Safety and Health study of VDT maladies. 
</P>
<P>
"The business community has been responding, but we still have a very large 
number of people working in bad situations," said Laura Stock, associate 
director of the Labor Occupational Health Program at UC Berkeley and a leading 
authority on computeritis. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica-based Human Factors Society has developed a set of standards 
for adjustable workstations that take people's physical needs into account, and 
they were adopted by the national standards organizations. But the California 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration Standards Board refused last year 
to establish mandatory guidelines for safe workstations. 
</P>
<P>
Union and other worker representatives on the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on 
Visual Display Terminals had recommended such action, but the industry 
representatives declined to go along. The Cal/OSHA Standards Board instead 
recommended that standards be developed for training workers on proper VDT use. 
</P>
<P>
The board said no conclusive evidence had been presented that working at VDTs 
is a "hazard," defined as leading to permanent physical injury. It did 
acknowledge, however, that significant problems exist with regard to eyestrain 
and muscular-skeletal ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Stock and other VDT experts emphasize that while workstation design is 
important, many of the problems can be alleviated only through changes in the 
work itself. "If people are doing the same thing all day long, that's going to 
lead to problems," Stock said. She cites the need for changes in "job design" 
that will allow some variation in workers' activities. 
</P>
<P>
Even more controversial than repetitive motion injuries from computers are the 
persistent concerns that radiation from terminals can cause reproductive 
disorders. Studies have shown that the levels of "ionizing" radiation, or 
X-rays, produced by computer terminals are too small to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
But the same cannot be said for low-level magnetic radiation given off by VDTs. 
Little is known about the effects of long-term exposure to these waves, though 
short-term exposure is generally agreed to be harmless. 
</P>
<P>
Two major studies of the effects of magnetic radiation on pregnant women -- one 
by NIOSH, the other by Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, are now getting under 
way. But some fear that even these studies may be inconclusive, because so many 
factors -- including the stress produced by working at a VDT -- can potentially 
cause pregnancy problems. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the most workers can do is push for screens that can be 
adjusted and equipped with anti-glare devices, educate themselves about proper 
posture and try to take frequent breaks away from the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Anne Brown, program director for the Labor Occupational Safety and Health 
program at UCLA, said her organization developed a training program to show 
workers how they can rearrange their workstations and their work, even if 
management won't invest in expensive new furniture or change job descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Brown noted that computeritis "is still a new area, and a lot of industrial 
hygienists and safety engineers haven't thought much about it." A key step for 
many employees, though, is partially psychological: Don't let anyone laugh at 
what most recognize to be very serious problems. 
</P>
<P>

DRUG TESTING;

MORE COMPANIES INSTITUTING DRUG-TESTING PROGRAMS

<P>
By his experience as a clerk in Municipal Court in Fullerton, Scott Matthew has 
become convinced that employers should test their work force for illegal drug 
use. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that if the drug problem were eliminated, that would clear about 75% 
of the cases off the dockets," said the Yorba Linda resident, who has watched 
many trials prompted by illegal drug use in his 13 years as a court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Matthew said he probably wouldn't have championed compulsory 
drug testing. But now, he said, "I have come to the realization that it would 
probably help the people with the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews shares the view of the majority of local workers who appear eager to 
stamp out drugs, starting in the workplace. According to The Times Orange 
County Poll, 76% of those surveyed support drug and alcohol testing by 
employers. And 22% perceived drug and alcohol abuse as "somewhat" of a problem 
in their workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Orange County companies, like others throughout Southern 
California, are increasingly instituting drug-testing programs, especially for 
job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
According to surveys by the Merchants and Manufacturers Assn. of Southern 
California, the proportion of firms in the region that do pre-employment drug 
testing more than doubled, from 20% in 1987 to 48%, last year. In the same 
two-year period, the percentage of firms that administer drug tests to current 
employees has burgeoned from 20% to 41%. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are becoming less and less tolerant of drugged out people in the 
workplace," said Larry Bell, manager of the Santa Ana branch of the Merchants 
and Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Employers are motivated by a desire to protect productivity, which can be 
undermined by absenteeism and poor job performance associated with drug and 
alcohol dependency. They also are concerned about curbing the runaway costs of 
workers compensation and medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Employers share with employees an interest in enhancing on-the-job safety by 
reducing the risk of accidents caused by workers under the influence of drugs 
or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
While there may be good reasons for substance abuse testing, there are 
important legal issues revolving around an individual's right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Casey Hawes, a labor attorney in the Costa Mesa office of Latham &amp; Watkins, 
said that California is more stringent than other states in scrutinizing the 
drug-testing practices of employers because "the right to privacy is written 
into the California Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
He said that many California employers have been advised they could legally 
require job applicants to be tested for drugs, usually through urine samples, 
as part of their pre-employment physical examinations. That position was 
confirmed in March by the state Supreme Court, which let stand a state Court of 
Appeal decision that mandatory urinalysis to detect drug use among job-seekers 
represented only a limited intrusion on the right to privacy and did not 
violate the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
But in another decision, the same Court of Appeal in San Francisco in February 
upheld a $485,042 damage award to a railroad employee who was fired for 
refusing to submit to a drug test. This decision has strengthened the belief of 
many employers and employees that random drug testing of workers probably is 
illegal, especially if the person is not in a safety-sensitive job. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that test employees usually do so only "for cause," such as a bad 
accident in which drug use is suspected to be a contributing factor or as part 
of a scheduled recertification examination for bus drivers and others 
responsible for the safety of others. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Southern California, said the civil rights group believes pre-employment 
screening and random testing of employees is unconstitutional. She said an 
employee should be subjected to a drug test only if his job performance becomes 
erratic and drugs seem to be the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Some unions agree and want a say in how drug tests are administered. Mary Yunt, 
secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO Orange County Central Labor Council, said 
unions want to help spell out the nature and criteria for workplace drug 
testing in their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Perry, secretary-treasurer of the Orange County District Council of 
Carpenters, said there is considerable resistance to drug testing within that 
organization. Much of the increased testing activity is traced to the passage 
last year of the Drug Free Workplace Act, which requires firms with two or more 
employees and doing more than $25,000 in business with the federal government 
to have substance abuse programs. 
</P>
<P>
While this legislation did not require firms to test employees for drugs, many 
employers took it as a signal to start. Subsequently the U.S. Department of 
Transportation set specific testing requirements for mass transit workers and 
interstate truckers. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Edelman, chief of the toxicology service at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, said the hospital's toxicology laboratory does drug testing of 
employees for "everything from fire and police deparments to construction 
companies and high-tech industries." 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said that usually when a company begins pre-employment testing, between 
10% and 25% of the applicants test positive for drugs and are turned away. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you initiate the program, it is amazing how fast word gets out on the 
street that you are doing it and the percentage drops to about 2%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the Merchants and Manufacturers survey conducted in late 1989 showed 
that for the companies that do pre-employment testing, the substances detected 
most often are, in order of frequency, marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine and 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 733 employers who participated in the Merchants and Manufacturers 
survey, 97% said that they would not consider hiring a job applicant who 
refused to take a pre-employment drug and alcohol test. 
</P>
<P>
Some managers would like to extend the testing to current employees. Ron 
Wilson, 27, of Fullerton, said he would welcome such drug testing at the 
discount retail outlet for Albertson's in South Gate, where he works as 
assistant manager. He frequently has to cope with employee absenteeism caused 
by drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"About every two weeks you lose a shift or two because someone can't make it to 
work," Wilson said.

Monday was barely under way when we made our first UFO sighting of the week. 
</P>
<P>
It was a small, pilotless craft wending its way along Wilshire Boulevard 
between MacArthur Park and the Civic Center at an altitude of about 200 feet. 
It appeared to be carrying a camera. 
</P>
<P>
What is that you say? Of course, we collected evidence -- just before the 
voyager disappeared behind a skyscraper. 
</P>
<P>
But we're still searching for an explanation to relate at our next UFO 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
An LAPD air support officer did reveal: "We got a courtesy call from a guy who 
said he was taking some aerial photographs, something to do with Metro Rail." 
</P>
<P>
But spokespersons for the two Metro Rail agencies -- the RTD and the county 
Transportation Commission -- said they knew nothing about the flight. (And you 
know how well-organized the Metro Rail project is.) 
</P>
<P>
So . . . come to think of it, perhaps the spy craft only appeared pilotless to 
human eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Our Unreal Estate Market (cont.): 
</P>
<P>
You may recall that we recently ran a photo of a banner across a Long Beach 
house that pleaded: "BUY THIS HOME . . . $269,900 . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The picture brought back memories for Robert Paine, who lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"In the summer of 1932, that house was offered to my mother," Paine wrote. 
"She, my brother, and I were spending the summer in the house and paying $40 a 
month rent." 
</P>
<P>
Paine said that, with building costs what they were then, his family rejected 
the asking price as too high. 
</P>
<P>
It was $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
In assembling our proposed "Golden Treasury of Malathion Poems" -- still no 
publishers -- we had more than enough entries for Chapter 1, "Malathion 
Malcontents." 
</P>
<P>
But we didn't have a single submission for Chapter 2 -- "Pro-Malathion Prose" 
-- until we received this verse: 
</P>
<P>
 Malathion might be a curse. 
</P>
<P>
 But hordes of Medflies are even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 If the helpful spray is banned, 
</P>
<P>
 We will have an empty land. 
</P>
<P>
 So wrote Kam Cammer of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
But back to UFOs. Our last sighting turned out to be exercise guru Richard 
Simmons on Sunset Boulevard. He was in his convertible, talking to a woman who 
was in her convertible. She held up her car phone, indicating that she had 
someone on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons yelled out, "Just tell him to call me at . . . " and he gave a phone 
number whose last four digits were, naturally, "FOOD." 
</P>
<P>
Just to be sure, we checked with Simmons' spokesman, who said: "Please don't 
print the full number. That's his private line." 
</P>
<P>
Sure. Simmons probably shouts it out only occasionally on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>

Sierra Madre's Chinese wisteria is the world's largest blossoming plant, 
according to the Guinness Book of World Records. It has branches 500 feet long, 
covers nearly an acre and has been known to show as many as 1.5 million 
blossoms. It was planted in 1894 by a resident who purchased the tiny vine from 
a Monrovia nursery for 75 cents.

It was a graduation from foster care to being in no one's care but their own. 
Not so much a new beginning as it was a middle passage, said one -- an 
affirmation that, as children, they had gone up against the odds, and not only 
survived them, but beaten them. 
</P>
<P>
"You never really leave anything behind," said 18-year-old Stephan, who spent 
his senior year of high school in a group home and is going on to UC San Diego. 
"You pick up the pieces, put them together and make it whole." 
</P>
<P>
Such spirit was celebrated Monday evening at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 
where 101 foster youths, bound for colleges or vocational schools, were 
applauded for their achievements and awarded scholarships to assist them in 
paying for their education and living arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinated and sponsored by the county Department of Children's Services and 
United Friends of the Children organization, the first "Independent Living 
Celebration" had all the pomp and circumstance of a senior prom and 
commencement ceremony with a few twists that would make a Hollywood premiere 
shine. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in tuxedos and formal gowns, the teen-agers walked in front of a group 
of approximately 200 to the strains of singer Whitney Houston's, "One Moment In 
Time." And then the songstress, who had flown in from New York for the event, 
walked down the steps after them and finished the song. 
</P>
<P>
Also there to honor the youths were actors Henry Winkler, Edward James Olmos, 
and rapper M.C. Hammer, who was the emcee. 
</P>
<P>
It meant a lot, the teen-agers agreed, that they were more than a case file in 
some county worker's desk drawer. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us became adults at 14," said William, 18, who entered the foster care 
system at 12 and is planning to attend Cal State Dominguez Hills. "Our whole 
world was flipped over. Shattered. Some kids in our situations might consider 
suicide, but here you have 101 kids who decided we were going to fight to make 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"And now we're graduating. We used to feel nobody cared for us. Then we found 
out they did care. They just didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers, soliciting corporations and individual contributors, raised 
$200,000 to help assist the teen-agers, said Nancy Daly, founder and chair of 
the UFC, a nonprofit volunteer organization dedicated to assisting youths once 
they are "emancipated" from the foster care system at 18. 
</P>
<P>
"These are kids who dream like everybody else," said Daly, who added that many 
foster children wind up homeless once out of the system because of a lack of 
money, support and options. "But they need to have extra help to fulfill those 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the accolades and glamour, some of the youths admitted they had fears 
of going out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, said 18-year-old Richard, "I think what if I'm really scared, 
because I don't know where I'm going to get the money" -- to live, to go to 
school? 
</P>
<P>
That is a question many newly independent foster youths ask themselves, said 
William, president of a foster youth support organization called the "Foster 
Youth Connection." The other two, he said, are "where do I go from here. And 
who can help me?" 
</P>
<P>
Finding the answers may be the worst part of leaving the county system. But 
Virginia, 17, could only think of what would be the best: 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's knowing you don't have to leave (a place) at a certain time," she 
said. On your own "you can leave whenever you want."

JIM MURRAY: HE COULD RUN, OBSTACLES OR NO

<P>
In track and field, the most astonishing upset of the Olympic Games -- if you 
don't count a Soviet winning the sprints in 1972 -- is generally conceded to be 
Billy Mills' winning of the 10,000 at Tokyo in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
It had its moments. They made a movie about it. Americans aren't supposed to 
win any race over 400 meters long and Mills ran 50 seconds -- fifty! -- faster 
than he had ever run the distance in his life and set the Olympic record in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Others opt for Lindy Remigino's winning the 100 at Helsinki in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
But that wasn't even the greatest sprint upset. It is the notion of this 
observer that the order of finish in the 1948 100-meter dash was the top upset 
of all the Olympic Games of all the ages. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute!" the historians want to yell. An American winning a sprint is 
an upset? Usually, it's the other way round. An American losing a sprint -- or 
a long jump -- is dog-bites-man stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But what if the gold was won by a guy who wasn't even a sprinter? 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what happened at London in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
They called him "Old Bones." That's because, if you threw a hat at him, 
wherever it hit, it would stick. He looked more like a coat rack than a human. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison Dillard was so bony, he rattled when he walked. He sounded like a 
floating crap game. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in Cleveland in the shadow of the great Jesse Owens. He went to the 
same high school, he ran on the same tracks, he had some of the same coaches. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one thing wrong: Bones could run a hole in the wind, too, but he 
didn't care for the dashes. Legend has it Bones was not quite quick enough for 
the 100 and 200, so he switched to the 110-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, insists Harrison Dillard. He was fast enough for the sprints, all right 
(as he was to prove). It's just that he didn't care for them. Not enough 
challenge. Hurdling involved technique plus speed. Bones liked the idea of 
that. He also liked the sensation of flying through the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of like soaring," he says. "It was exhilarating." 
</P>
<P>
He became the most magnificent hurdler, not to say track and field athlete, of 
his day. He once won 82 races in a row. Not all of them were over timber. He 
was unbeatable on the flat, too, whenever he switched. 
</P>
<P>
When the Olympic Games were resumed in London after World War II, it was a 
given that Dillard would lead the United States in the hurdles. He went to the 
trials in Evanston, Ill., a prohibitive favorite. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows why he did it, but Dillard opted to try out for the 100-meter dash 
first. It was kind of a lark. The United States had two of the three greatest 
sprinters in the world at the time -- Mel Patton, of USC, who held the world 
record in the 100 and the 200, and the ebullient Barney Ewell. 
</P>
<P>
Dillard surprised the world by finishing third. He made the boat. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be providential. Because, he then shocked the world again by 
finishing last in his own event. He crashed into eight hurdles, lost his rhythm 
and lost his race. In those days, you didn't have the lightweight, easy-topple 
hurdles of today. You rapped one, it was like hitting a wall. Dillard rapped 
them all. 
</P>
<P>
It was an all-time shocker. An aghast press computed that Dillard had beaten 
that same field something like 19 of 20 times he had competed against them. He 
had set and reset the world record. 
</P>
<P>
His chances for a gold apparently gone glimmering, Dillard nevertheless set 
about making the best of it. 
</P>
<P>
No one paid much attention to the fact he was turning heats faster than Patton 
or Ewell -- or even the talented Panamanian, Lloyd LaBeach, or the Scot, 
Alistair McCorquodale. His 10.4s were beating their 10.5s and 10.6s. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll start to jump 40 yards out," it was snickered. 
</P>
<P>
Forty yards out, Dillard had blistered into such a lead that the world's best 
couldn't catch him. He not only won -- in 10.3 -- he tied the Olympic record 
and posted a time that wouldn't be broken till 1960. 
</P>
<P>
That's the one of the rare times in modern Olympic history an athlete won a 
gold medal in an event that wasn't his, that he hadn't trained for. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, it put Dillard on the relay team that got him a gold medal 
he hadn't counted on and probably wouldn't have gotten as a mere hurdler. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't make a movie about it. They didn't sing songs about it. But it went 
into the language. To "pull a Dillard" became to win any event other than the 
one you enrolled in. Not too many people ever did it. 
</P>
<P>
Dillard returned to his patented hurdle form for the 1952 Olympics, in which he 
nosed out USC's Jack Davis, a superb athlete who lost two gold medals in 
succeeding Olympics while posting the same time as the winner. Dillard also 
made the relay team again, thanks chiefly to the fact he was a defending 
gold-medal champion in it. 
</P>
<P>
It was an episode unique in the annals of the games. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison Dillard, today, is the business director of the Cleveland Board of 
Education and is in Southern California to help with the preparation of the 
USA/Mobil Track and Field Championships at Cerritos College in Norwalk June 
14-16. This is the venerable annual meet of The Athletics Congress, America's 
track open, contested every year for the last 115. Among other things, Dillard 
is the oil company's athletic adviser. 
</P>
<P>
He won more than 400 races, but he's most famous for one he didn't win. It's 
arguable that the greatest race he ever won was the race he lost. He has 
entered the track Hall of Fame; he has an award named after him. 
</P>
<P>
He is a track legend. Because he lost at Evanston that day, he has four gold 
medals instead of two, and the luckiest thing that ever happened to him was 
missing those hurdles at Evanston. He must wake up in a cold sweat dreaming he 
went over all of them and broke the tape. Then, he'd just be another name in a 
book.

TERRORIST? PATRIOT? HE VOWS A MARTYR'S DEATH BY FASTING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six months after he decided to give up his fight to remain in the United States 
and accept deportation, Orlando Bosch, the Cuban-born anti-Castro pediatrician 
the U.S. government calls a terrorist, remains locked up here in a federal 
prison. A State Department source said Monday efforts continue to find a 
country willing to take Bosch. 
</P>
<P>
But Bosch's daughter maintains that U.S. officials are lying. "They're not 
looking for any place to send him," said Myriam Bosch. "They're just holding 
him. They just want him to rot in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Now Bosch, 64, is three days into a seven-day hunger strike designed to put the 
U.S. government on notice. If no action is taken within 30 to 60 days after the 
week-long strike ends, he said in a statement released by his daughter, he will 
fast until death. 
</P>
<P>
"I fear he will starve himself to death," said Myriam Bosch. "And if this 
government lets that happen, it will be beyond comprehension. But it's 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
The story of Orlando Bosch -- called a patriot by many in Miami's Cuban 
community, and a national security risk by the U.S. Justice Department -- has 
been a 30-year saga here, and in most accounts it's a tale filled with 
intrigue, politics and violence. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Cuba for exile in Miami in 1960, Bosch briefly practiced medicine 
until he was discovered storing explosives in a hospital where he worked. After 
that, he became a full-time anti-Castro activist. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968 Bosch was convicted of firing a bazooka at a Polish freighter in the 
Miami harbor in what was said to be a protest against that country's trade with 
Cuba. Sentenced to 10 years in prison, he was paroled after four. But he fled 
the United States in 1974 after being subpoenaed to testify in an inquiry into 
the assassination of a controversial exile leader in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Bosch first turned up in Venezuela, and later, in the employ of the Chilean 
secret police. He was back in Venezuala in 1976 when a bomb ripped through a 
Cubana airlines plane, killing 73 people, including several members of the 
Cuban national fencing team. Bosch was charged with being involved in the 
bombing, and although tried three times, he was never convicted. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, after 11 years in Venezuelan jails, he returned to the 
United States and was immediately arrested for parole violation. Last November, 
after a federal court upheld the government's decision to deport him, Bosch 
declined to appeal, saying he would take his chances in a third country. 
Although the United States says he will not be sent to Cuba, Bosch's family has 
long argued that he would be a target of Castro agents anywhere outside the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Bosch has drawn support from Florida Republicans such as U.S. Sen. 
Connie Mack and U.S. Rep. Illeana Ros-Lehtinen, and within the Cuban community 
people have often taken to the streets to demand he be freed. But his hunger 
strike has attracted little notice -- in part, according to his daughter 
Myriam, "because there are certain leaders in the Cuban community who don't 
want him out; they feel threatened by him." 
</P>
<P>
Myriam Bosch hopes that her father's hunger strike may bring about his release. 
"He's kind of weak," she said. "He has bleeding ulcers, angina, and he should 
be on a special diet. But what's he going to do, rot in jail for not having 
done anything? Frankly, I think the U.S. government has some sort of deal with 
Castro. Why else would they not find a country to take him?"
