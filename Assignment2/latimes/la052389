NEWSMAKERS: EX-AIDE CALLS FOOT FAULT ON AN 'EGOCENTRIC' JACKSON

The Rev. Jesse Jackson is unlikely to get Elizabeth O. Colton's vote for best 
boss. Colton, a former press secretary and campaign consultant to Jackson, 
contends in a new book that the unsuccessful candidate for the 1988 Democratic 
presidential nomination was an abusive and sexist boss who was "incessantly 
critical and totally egocentric." Colton's "The Jackson Phenomenon: The Man, 
the Power, the Message," is being published June 26 by Doubleday. Jackson 
declined to comment on the book. But he disputed the notion that Colton was a 
campaign insider. Asked if he wanted to read the book, Jackson replied: "It's 
not a priority." In the book, Colton describes entering a news conference after 
a debate in Atlanta and says Jackson pushed her to get her out of the way when 
he saw television cameras on other candidates. She said Jackson deliberately 
stepped on her feet as she talked to reporters aboard the campaign jet "to 
signal me to quit talking."

 -- A visit to Texas 40 years ago is still paying off for Frank Sinatra, George 
Burns, Dinah Shore and other celebrities, and Texas Treasurer Ann Richards 
wants to make sure they get their overdue checks. The payments date to 1949, 
when oilman Glenn H. McCarthy opened the luxury Shamrock Hotel in Houston with 
a gala. McCarthy gave the celebrities who attended shares in an oil company, 
said Bill Cryer, spokesman for Richards. The hotel was razed in 1987 for an 
expanded Texas Medical Center. The shares have continued to pay dividends 
although the money did not always make it to the celebrities, Cryer said. 
Unclaimed property in Texas is turned over to the treasurer's office, he 
explained. "One of our researchers was looking through the files and began 
finding all these stars' names . . ." Cryer said. Other celebrities, or their 
estates, due money -- an average of about $25 each -- from that opening are 
Harpo Marx, Gene Kelly, Gracie Allen, Edgar Bergen, Tony Martin and Jane 
Russell, Richards said.

 -- The Aloha Airlines pilot who landed a crippled Boeing 737 in Hawaii on 
April 28, 1988, after the plane's upper fuselage ripped away went back to 
school to receive his alma mater's highest award. Aloha Airlines pilot Robert 
Schornstheimer, who was graduated from Ohio's Defiance College in 1968, 
received the school's Pilgrim Medal for showing "strength under pressure." Past 
recipients of the medal given to alumni and citizens included former President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower, Pearl S. Buck and Jackie Robinson. SHIRLEY MARLOW

STRUIKSMA ISSUES ULTIMATUM ON ROAD CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the result of a San Diego City Council committee hearing Monday is any 
indication, closing a dusty dirt road in North County might turn into a 
regional issue when the matter comes before the full council June 13. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour of testimony for and against closing Black Mountain Road west of 
Rancho Penasquitos, Councilman Ed Struiksma lost his temper and threatened -- 
in fact, promised -- that, if the east-west link between Penasquitos and the 
coast is closed, he will push to shut the north-south Black Mountain link 
between Rancho Penasquitos and Mira Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma, who represents Mira Mesa, argued that, if the east-west Black 
Mountain link to Interstate 5 on the coast is closed, 2,000 more motorists will 
become "transient traffic" on Mira Mesa arterials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shortcuts to Work and Home 
</P>
<P>
He said that Mira Mesa's streets already are congested with traffic from 
elsewhere using them as shortcuts to work and home. If Black Mountain Road to 
the coast is closed, Struiksma said, he will seek closure of Black Mountain 
Road to the south, inconveniencing about 10,000 Rancho Penasquitos commuters 
who now use the route to avoid traffic tie-ups on Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
His ultimatum came during a council committee hearing on temporary closure of 
Black Mountain Road from Penasquitos west to Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma pointed out that the city's aim in closing the "back door" route from 
Rancho Penasquitos is to limit San Diego's liability for accidents occurring on 
the 1 1/2-mile unpaved stretch that is labeled substandard under city 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The route, which meanders through the undeveloped "urban reserve" -- land 
precluded from development until after 1996 in the city's general plan -- is 
used by more than 2,000 motorists daily to commute to the coast. 
</P>
<P>
If the unpaved part of the road is closed, opponents argue, the traffic will be 
added to the already congested arterials in Mira Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only Outlet 
</P>
<P>
"So, if we close one part of (Black Mountain) roadway, I hope we are prepared 
to close two," Struiksma said. 
</P>
<P>
Closure of Black Mountain Road at both its western and southern ends would 
leave about 33,000 Rancho Penasquitos residents with I-15 as their only outlet. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Ron Roberts and Wes Pratt favored closing the east-west section of 
Black Mountain, citing the dirt road's safety hazards and the city's liability. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer sided with Struiksma, arguing that the unpaved 
road should remain open until alternate routes, such as Carmel Valley Road and 
Route 56 are opened. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Manager Jack McCrory said signs will be posted on the dirt part of 
Black Mountain Road warning motorists of the end of city-maintained roadway and 
that they proceed at their own risk. He acknowledged that this may not protect 
the city from lawsuits by motorists who incur property damage or injury on the 
unimproved section of the route. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said the council, in closed sessions scheduled for today, will hear of 
lawsuit after lawsuit filed by motorists who claim the city street where they 
had an accident was substandard. 
</P>
<P>
Black Mountain Road, Roberts said, "is one incredible liability this city is 
carrying," which should be closed until money can be found to bring it up to 
minimum city street standards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Balloon Firms Fighting It 
</P>
<P>
Among groups opposing the closure were balloon-ride companies, which said the 
road -- the only east-west connector in a 40-square-mile area -- is necessary 
for the industry because chase cars must negotiate the area to arrive at 
isolated sites where the balloons land, as well as members of Immanuel Baptist 
Church of Rancho Penasquitos, who protested that their proposed church site 
along Black Mountain Road would be inaccessible to half the parishioners if the 
road were blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in favor of the closure were residents of the Woodcrest subdivision of 
Rancho Penasquitos, who said the safety of neighborhood children is threatened 
by speeding cars and heavy trucks traveling through narrow residential streets 
on their way to the road. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members recommended the temporary closure of the road, listing as an 
alternative the creation of another entry to the route from Carmel Valley Road 
that would avoid the Woodcrest subdivision. Cost of the bypass was estimated at 
$1.8 million.

CALTRANS HOUSE DECORATED IN EARLY INTERSTATE TO MAKE A POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Department of Transportation has collected enough trash from San 
Diego's freeways in the last three months to furnish a three-bedroom house in 
East San Diego, complete with silverware, Beach Boys posters and a surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
In an exercise meant to draw attention to the amount and type of litter people 
drop on local highways, each bedroom was furnished with a box spring and 
mattress, and almost every room had a television. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,100-square-foot house, near 40th and Wightman streets, was also fitted by 
Caltrans litter crews with a porcelain bathtub and an 8-foot-long aluminum 
ladder. In the kitchen, officials placed a refrigerator and an upright stove 
with two ovens. Also picked up from a local highway were a washer and dryer set 
and a water heater. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a clock, none of the mechanical items were in working order. Some 
items were new but had been damaged when they fell onto the road, probably from 
the backs of trucks, Caltrans officials said. Many items, such as bottles and 
cans, were apparently thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
"We used this as an example of the kinds of things that are dropped on the 
freeway. . . . If you strike an object that size, there's a great potential for 
a fatal accident," Caltrans spokesman Tom Nipper said. 
</P>
<P>
Nipper said that, in the past year, he could recall only one such fatality -- 
when a car rear-ended a truck that had stopped because of litter on the highway 
-- but he warned that "just about anybody can find an object in their way." 
</P>
<P>
The still-running clock was placed in the house, along with a poster of 
Yosemite Valley and several oil paintings. The living room contained two 
couches, a wicker chair, a couple of reclining chairs and a bird cage. 
</P>
<P>
"There were clothes in all of the closets -- shirts, pants, entire wardrobes," 
Nipper said. 
</P>
<P>
The bathrooms were equipped with towels and carpets, and the refrigerator was 
stocked with cans and bottles. Lamps, a bookcase, curtains, plates and 
silverware completed the look. Two trash cans were placed outside by the 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interstate 8 Is the Leader 
</P>
<P>
"Anything we have to remove from the freeway is considered litter," Nipper 
said. "Last year, in the San Diego County area, it cost $800,000 to remove 
freeway litter." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, more than 1,600 cubic yards of litter was removed from San Diego 
freeways at a cost of $80,000. Nipper said half the litter collected locally 
comes from Interstate 8. Interstate 15 is a close second. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular household item found on highways is the mattress; Caltrans 
finds 50 a month. Aside from paper, bottles and cans, more tires are collected 
than any other item of litter. Several months ago, an electric pinball game was 
found on California 78. 
</P>
<P>
Half of all containers found on the highway are for alcoholic beverages, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers should securely tie down their cargo and invest in cargo nets, which 
are sold at home goods stores for about $14, Nipper said. 
</P>
<P>
The Caltrans-owned house, originally destined to be torn down to make way for 
the I-15 extension through 40th Street, will eventually be rented out. 
Unfurnished.

CITY COUNCIL APPROVES BAN ON ASSAULT RIFLES IN SYMBOLIC VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a symbolic gesture, the San Diego City Council Monday approved a slightly 
revised version of a ban on the sale and possession of semiautomatic assault 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The new city ordinance, modeled on legislation approved by both houses of the 
Legislature, will become moot if Gov. George Deukmejian signs the statewide 
legislation, despite the fact that some sections of the two laws conflict, 
Deputy City Atty. John Kaheny advised the council. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian is expected to sign the statewide legislation Wednesday, Kaheny 
said. Contained in two separate bills, the state law bans the importation, 
manufacture, distribution and sale of at least 33 semiautomatic weapons 
beginning Jan. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The state law will allow current owners of the weapons to keep them, but will 
require that they register them with the state Department of Justice by Jan. 1, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted Feb. 27 for a total ban on the sale and possession of the 
weapons, but three times since then had delayed a second, ratifying vote 
required to enact a new local ordinance while it awaited the outcome of the 
Legislature's deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
The council began Monday's discussions intending to pass an emergency ordinance 
to put provisions of the state law into effect in San Diego immediately. But 
Kaheny advised the council that its ordinance would be preempted by the state 
legislation as soon as Deukmejian adds his signature to the two bills. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the council abandoned the Feb. 27 ordinance and approved a new version 
of the ban by a 7-2 vote, with Councilmen Bruce Henderson and Ed Struiksma 
dissenting. By the time the ordinance returns to the council in two weeks for a 
second vote, Deukmejian almost certainly will have acted, council members 
agreed.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY HOPES AWARD WILL BOOST IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood officials are hoping the "All-America City Award" that the city won 
recently along with nine other municipalities nationwide will go a long way 
toward polishing the city's image. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they will use the honor to publicize Inglewood as a 
middle-class, multi-ethnic city where residents and officials have joined to 
reduce crime and beat back drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The city will advertise the award by adding the "All-America" designation to 
everything from official city stationery to street signs and the prominent 
"Welcome to Inglewood" sign that greets visitors at the city's Manchester 
Boulevard entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll definitely know you're in an All-America city," said Mayor Edward 
Vincent. "We're going to have it on our driveways, our storefronts -- we're 
going to have it everywhere that we're an All-America city." 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood was the only city in California to receive the honor, given annually 
by the National Civic League, after a two-day competition with 109 other 
applicants in Chicago.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
Without discussion, the San Diego City Council on Monday passed a resolution 
urging the federal government to close the Virginia Street border crossing and 
consolidate all commercial traffic at an expanded Otay Mesa border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
The move is supported by San Ysidro community groups concerned about traffic, 
noise, safety and pollution caused by southbound truck traffic, but is opposed 
by businesses near the Virginia Street crossing, according to a report from the 
city's Intergovernmental Relations Department. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. Customs Service plans to expand the Otay Mesa crossing, where 
northbound commercial traffic now crosses the international border and where 
the bulk of industrial development is occurring. However, the agency is 
attempting to determine whether the Mexican government will enlarge its side of 
the Otay Mesa crossing before proceeding, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, southbound trucks continue to use the Virginia Street 
crossing, which could remain open at least two years while the two governments 
reach agreement on the Otay Mesa expansion.

June is "amnesty month" for parking ticket scofflaws, who owe the city $12.9 
million in unpaid citations and penalties, the San Diego City Council decided 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning June 1, drivers with unpaid parking tickets will be allowed to pay 
their fines without being assessed penalties for overdue payments. An amnesty 
hot line, 533-4053, has been established to allow drivers to determine how much 
they owe. 
</P>
<P>
About $3.5 million is owed by owners of the 9,518 vehicles that have received 
five or more citations in the last 18 months. Another $5.9 million is owed by 
drivers who have received three or more tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Included in those totals is the city's current record holder, David Thomas, who 
owes the city $3,642 in fines and penalties for the 87 parking tickets he has 
received, Police Chief Bob Burgreen said at a news conference. During amnesty 
month, Thomas could pay off the citations at a cost of $1,386, Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
The grace period precedes the inauguration of the Police Department's 
stepped-up parking enforcement campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning July 1, police will tow and impound any vehicle with five or more 
outstanding parking citations. The city's 34 parking-enforcement officers will 
implement the program with the aid of hand-held computers containing 
information on all outstanding parking tickets.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DEL MAR

<TEXT>
<P>
Bail was drastically reduced Monday for the mother of twin boys who allegedly 
were abused and molested by her boyfriend and left abandoned at a hotel in Del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy DeSimone, 25, will be sentenced June 19 for child endangerment, but her 
attorney, Kirk Migdal, persuaded a judge to lower her bail from $100,000 to 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Migdal said the higher bail was unwarranted because of a sentencing agreement 
in which the district attorney's office will not be asking for a prison 
sentence. The defense attorney promised that his client will show up for 
sentencing if her bail was lowered to $2,000 or $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the preliminary hearing of co-defendant Charles Thomas McCoy, 27, of 
Oceanside is set for June 16. McCoy has pleaded not guilty to charges that he 
abused, molested and abandoned the boys, now 3, at the Del Mar Inn on March 25. 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone was arrested March 28 when she showed up at Children's Hospital to 
inquire about her children, who are now in a foster home.

A man caught driving a car belonging to the family of a slain Clairemont woman 
has been booked into County Jail on suspicion of murder and auto theft, police 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Marco Antonio Torres, 20, of San Diego was arrested Sunday after officers saw 
him about noon in the 200 block of 47th Street driving one of two cars stolen 
from the home of Sung Yee Barr, 62, police said. Torres is expected to be 
arraigned later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Barr was beaten to death last Tuesday, apparently with a baseball bat, in a 
robbery at her home during which her 26-year-old son, William, was also 
injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
William Barr was recovering Monday at Sharp Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Police said William Barr told investigators that two men attacked him and his 
mother with a baseball bat and that he played dead until the men left. He then 
crawled outside to the driveway and called for help. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they spotted the Barrs' two missing cars during the weekend and 
placed them under surveillance. No one was seen using the second car.

SUFFICIENT REASON TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Wright's claim to the speakership of the U.S. House of Representatives 
rests not with the adequacy of the legal defense he was prepared to present 
today to charges of violating House rules against conflicts of interest. The 
speakership is not an office that is held by legal right, but by political 
support, leadership ability and -- when necessary -- moral and parliamentary 
persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
Just like his 434 colleagues, however, Jim Wright does have a legal stake in 
his House seat, having been duly elected to that position by the voters of the 
12th Congressional District of Texas. As such, he deserves every opportunity to 
defend himself against the 69 allegations of unethical behavior brought by the 
House's Ethics Committee. The legal process is important both to Wright's 
rights as a member of Congress and to other members, so they can be certain 
what the rules are and how they are to be interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
But the speakership is different. It is a privilege, not a right. Wright sits 
in the Speaker's chair by virtue of his selection by a majority of his peers in 
the House. While it has not happened in modern times, House members can remove 
a Speaker any time they desire by adopting a motion to declare the speakership 
vacant and choosing a new Speaker. The speakership does carry considerable 
national prestige and responsibility -- succession to the presidency after the 
vice president, for instance. But the Speaker serves entirely at the pleasure 
of his colleagues. He can be elected with as few as 218 votes in the House and 
be removed by as few as 218 votes. Removal does not require any legal 
justification or proof of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The 69 accusations voted by the House Ethics Committee have not been proven, 
and there is no legal reason to date to require Wright to relinquish his House 
seat. But there is more than sufficient argument that Wright should yield the 
speakership. A successful Speaker must lead by example. He must set a standard 
that is higher than just a grudging adherence of the rules. He must be 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
Wright has failed those tests. True enough, the committee allegations have not 
been proven. But Wright has acknowledged the substance of the contentions, 
quarreling primarily with the committee's interpretation that they constitute a 
violation of the rules. His bad judgment is sufficient cause for removal as 
Speaker. Wright can spare the House that wrenching decision by resigning now.

U.S. CREDIBILITY AND LOST BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That hydrogen bomb that the U.S. Navy lost off the shores of Okinawa and sunk 
to a depth of 14,000 feet has alarmed the Japanese population and rightly so. 
Not because of any imminent explosive disaster, not because of any radiation 
hazard, not even because of pollution concerns. 
</P>
<P>
What I believe the general population of Japan is really worried about is that 
this scenario conjures up a myth no one has yet fathomed. Godzilla. 
</P>
<P>
We all tend to brush off the fantasy of our environmental abuses generating new 
and awful creatures to wreak havoc on us in the name of Mother Nature's 
revenge. Let's just wait and see if Godzilla emerges from the deep, if the 
Creature From the Exxon Black Lagoon slithers onto shore, and if The Thing 
falls to the icy earth beneath the holes in our ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Just wait and see.

STILL DRAGGING OUR FEET 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The election of Municipal Judge Rand Schrader as chairman of the County AIDS 
Commission holds the promise of continuing the vigorous and constructive 
leadership that Rabbi Allen I. Freehling has brought the commission in its 
first two years. However, the task will not be easy,because of continuing 
resistance on the part of some of the county supervisors to the policies 
required to stem the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic, and the 
shortage of public health funds. 
</P>
<P>
There is a sense of frustration among many, if not all of the commission 
members. They have not been involved in crucial budget negotiations by the AIDS 
Program Office of the Department of Health Services. And their advice has been 
frequently ignored by the Board of Supervisors, at whose pleasure they serve. 
</P>
<P>
But they have played a useful role, nevertheless. The monthly meetings serve as 
a sounding board for community groups involved in the AIDS effort. The 
commission was helpful in winning the support of the supervisors for the county 
anti-discrimination ordinance. And the commission has been able to serve as a 
voice of reason in the face of extremism. The commissioners helped defeat 
misguided initiatives on mandatory AIDS testing in two state elections. Only 
last week they set the record straight, appropriately disagreeing with 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum after he had asserted that "the vast majority of 
people would not have any interest in AIDS or AIDS funding." 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum and Mike Antonovich had opposed the anti-discrimination ordinance and 
had been part of a board majority that, over the years, has slowed the response 
of the county. Valuable time has been lost in mounting effective education and 
prevention programs. The commission, which includes some of the county's most 
distinguished public health and AIDS experts, has encouraged progress in 
expanding and diversifying county efforts. The county has almost doubled its 
financial commitment to fighting AIDS in the last two years. It is moving ahead 
appropriately in establishing a special AIDS ward and creating an enlarged 
out-patient AIDS facility at the County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Much remains to be done, however. Development of residential care and other 
alternatives to hospitalization is lagging. So are prevention programs directed 
where the risk of new infection is greatest, among adolescents and drug users. 
There is a critical need for expanded programs among blacks and Latinos, who 
have disproportionately high infection rates.

CRIMES BY JUVENILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story about an elderly hiker being shot by juveniles reminds me of a scene 
from "The Clockwork Orange" where an elderly man is being attacked by young 
thugs. Have we finally come to that? 
</P>
<P>
Juveniles are committing more and more violent crimes, partly because they know 
that the punishment, if any, will be light. Our juvenile criminal laws are a 
travesty! No wonder people have very little regard for the law. 
</P>
<P>
I will be watching closely the resolution of the above-mentioned incident.

AS CONTINENTAL RIFT MENDS, A PAN-EUROPEAN IDENTITY REQUIRES U.S. ADJUSTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By W.R. SMYSER, W.R. Smyser's book on German-American relations, Restive 
Partners, is to be published by Westview this fall. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The great gash that has split Europe between East and West is healing, with 
political effects for Washington and Moscow as well as for Europe itself. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 Poles visited West Germany and West Berlin during 1988. 
During one single holiday weekend last month, a quarter of a million Hungarians 
came to Vienna to shop -- producing a Viennese joke that Hungarians no longer 
want help seeking refuge, but to lift their appliances onto their cars. That 
was before Hungary began tearing down its border fence. 
</P>
<P>
European Community officials speak of a new Marshall Plan to help revive the 
East European economies. France, Great Britain and West Germany are vying for 
influence in Eastern Europe. One reason the West German public opposes nuclear 
missiles is to avoid threatening East Germany and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
These are not isolated events, but elements of a new and powerful trend: The 
gradual mending of the European rift and the reawakening of pan-European 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, a resurrected Europe also may offer another solution 
familiar to European history: A German framework that separates German 
political and national identities. As contacts between the two German states 
expand, they are increasingly reminiscent of earlier arrangements, such as the 
Holy Roman Empire or the German Confederation, under which German states of 
diverse and even opposite political, religious or social systems were linked 
under a broad umbrella while remaining separate. Those arrangements did not 
then fully satisfy German national aspirations, and may not do so now, but they 
reassured their neighbors and provided a European core open in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
This may ultimately be the essence of a European solution: The borders remain 
but their functions change; the armies remain but their weapons and postures 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev understands the new trend toward a 
reunited Europe and exploits it. His "common European house" proposals appeal 
to deep-seated feelings. He tried at first to exclude the United States, but 
the Europeans -- especially the West Germans -- insisted on an American role. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the revival of European consciousness can pose a problem for 
Washington. The United States has not had a durable relationship with a Europe 
at peace. America came to Europe in two world wars and remained during the Cold 
War. All too often, military considerations have dominated U.S. thinking. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy needs to adjust as Europe evolves and redefines its identity. The 
U.S. presence will need restructuring. One reason for the German-American 
dispute about missile modernization and negotiations is that we have not taken 
account of some of the changes in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The United States should not retreat from Europe, especialy after it has 
achieved its original goals, but it has to find a presence that corresponds to 
the emerging pan-European identity, to a reduced but potentially revivable 
Soviet threat, and to the long-term U.S. national interest. And it must begin 
to define its role soon, before it seems to be opposing the forces at work on 
the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and its partners in the Atlantic Alliance have not yet begun to 
consider how to preserve the essential strategic, political and economic 
relationship between Western Europe and the United States under new 
circumstances. But neither we nor the West Europeans can continue to delay such 
consideration, and the NATO summit next week is as good a place as any to 
begin.

OUR INTEREST IN UNWRAPPING BONN'S COCOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GRESS, David Gress is a senior research fellow at the Hoover 
Institution. He is the co-author, with Dennis L. Bark, of the two-volume A 
History of West Germany to be published in September by Basil Blackwell. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Atlantic Alliance is embroiled in the latest of many disputes about nuclear 
weapons and arms control. This dispute unfortunately has obscured what, from 
the U.S. perspective, is the real argument with West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
This argument is not about technical questions of defense and arms control. The 
persistent disagreements in this area are merely symptoms of far more profound 
divergences of perceived interest. The real argument with West Germany is about 
the implications of its re-emergence as a great European power, about Bonn's 
long-term policies in Eastern (more properly, Central) Europe, about German 
reunification and about the role and aims of the Soviet Union in the Gorbachev 
era. 
</P>
<P>
If we do not bring these questions into the open, but rather force the Germans 
into agreeing to positions they no longer believe in, we are not merely storing 
up resentment for the future; we are jeopardizing the future of Western 
security itself. 
</P>
<P>
The debate is urgent because a revolution is occurring in German and European 
elite opinion about East-West relations, the dimensions of which are hardly 
realized on this side of the Atlantic. Virtually without exception, Europeans 
believe that the Cold War -- and with it, the Soviet military threat -- is 
over. Furthermore, they believe that Western Europe can and should take a 
leading role in overcoming the division of Europe, and that it is far better 
qualified politically and morally to do so than the United States. So far, the 
Bush Administration has done nothing to disprove that belief. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening on the threshold of the 1990s is that West Germany, for long 
Europe's economic superpower, is becoming its political superpower as well. 
This development has three epoch-making implications. First, even almost two 
full generations after World War II, Germans remain remarkably unwilling to 
acknowledge their status openly. This means that they still feel obliged to 
describe their international political goal of expanding West German power and 
influence in Central Europe in moralistic terms as an altruistic peace policy 
that in no way reflects crude national and material interests. These pretenses 
cause far more harm than good. They oblige the West Germans to pretend to be 
everybody's friend at all times, thereby leading Washington, as we have seen, 
into entirely unrealistic assumptions about what security policies Bonn will 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
The second effect of West Germany's new status is that the left-right split on 
security and foreign policy that divided the country in the 1980s has 
disappeared. In its place we have a near-total consensus that West Germany can, 
should and will use its economic and political power to promote liberalization 
and pluralism in Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The final, and most remarkable, implication of Bonn's growing power is that it 
is welcomed, not feared, by West Germany's European neighbors, both East and 
West. This fact alone should encourage West German leaders and elites to be 
more honest about their interests. It also should encourage the United States 
to stop playing catchup with European opinion about West Germany's role or 
about East-West relations. Washington has every reason to take the lead in 
encouraging West Germany to take full responsibility for its actions as a great 
power. That way, the Germans will face the risks, rather that merely enjoying 
the gains, of their detente policies. 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for the U.S. position on German reunification. The West German 
government decided in the mid-1960s that the West had no chance of forcing a 
withdrawal of communist power from East Germany. For the past 25 years, the 
question of reunification has vanished completely from the U.S. policy agenda, 
though not from West Germany's. Forward-looking Germans speak now in terms of 
association or federation of the two Germanys, not reunification, but the goal 
is the same: national self-determination. Washington has much to gain, and 
nothing to lose, by publicly stating its full moral and political support for 
Bonn's endeavors to achieve this goal. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn's national self-assertion is not free of illusions, though those illusions 
would carry much less danger for the West as a whole if both we and the Germans 
were more honest about where our national interests coincide and where they 
diverge. On modernizing Central Europe and on German self-determination, they 
clearly coincide. On wholesale aid to the Gorbachev regime, perhaps they do 
not. I say perhaps because I think that honest West German appraisal of its 
great-power interests leads to the conclusion that lowering one's guard while 
helping to revitalize a still-powerful Soviet empire is a dangerous policy. As 
long as we allow the Germans to conceal their power policies in a moralistic 
cocoon, however, no German will be forced to make such an honest appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
Russia entered the arena of European power policies in the 18th Century as 
Prussia's enemy. Ever since then, the German eagle and the Russian bear have 
contested the political and cultural hegemony in Central Europe. After almost 
half a century of abnormal conditions, the old struggle is re-emerging in what 
one hopes is a peaceful form. It cannot fail to have intimate implications for 
American foreign policy and America's own shaky status as a great power. It is 
high time we started talking about it.

FRIEDMAN HAS ASSEMBLY'S HIGHEST OFFICE EXPENSE TAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) spent $332,552 -- more than any 
of the Assembly's 79 other members -- on his office expenses during the 1988 
legislative session, according to figures released by the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman's total was 19% higher than the Assembly average of $279,192 for the 
12 months ending last Nov. 30. It was $10,270 ahead of the $322,282 accounted 
for by the second ranking spender, Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear). 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem with anyone examining the way every penny was spent because 
it was spent prudently," Friedman said in an interview Monday. "There's no 
excessive salaries. There's no frivolous expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons cited by Friedman for his top ranking are the cost of renting 
his Sherman Oaks office, the cost of mailing newsletters to his San Fernando 
Valley and Westside constituents and a bookkeeping delay that caused some 1987 
expenses to be paid in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman's 43rd District includes Studio City, Encino and Sherman Oaks in the 
Valley and Beverly Hills, part of West Hollywood, Bel-Air, Brentwood and part 
of Westwood in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The figures, released Friday, are compiled annually and released by the 
Assembly Rules Committee. The totals include staff salaries, travel, cars, 
district office expenses, newsletters, postage, telephones, furniture, 
equipment, supplies, subscriptions and photocopying. 
</P>
<P>
The totals do not include staff and other costs connected with committee 
assignments. Some Assembly members who head committees have additional staff 
and expenses connected to their extra duties. Friedman, who is not a committee 
chairman, is a two-term lawmaker who easily won reelection last November. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Office Rent Cited 
</P>
<P>
In reviewing his expenses, Friedman said his office rent is higher than rents 
in other parts of the state. He paid $20,833 a year for his Ventura Boulevard 
office, compared to the average annual local office rent of $15,863 for the 
Assembly's 80 members. 
</P>
<P>
"There ought to be an allowance for the prevailing rent in a particular 
district," Friedman said. "The fact is that it costs more to rent an office 
space in Sherman Oaks than it does in Norwalk." 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the expenses is the cost of newsletters -- $63,490 for 
Friedman. Karin Caves, a spokeswoman for Friedman, said $15,800 in newsletter 
costs from 1987 were not paid by the state controller until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Caves said Friedman's newsletter budget was higher than most other 
members because it was pegged to the number of registered voters per household. 
Friedman, with 103,568 households, is among the Assembly members with the most 
registered voters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
That expense may have ended. Mass mailings by elected officials at public 
expense, including newsletters, were prohibited last June when voters adopted 
Proposition 73, which is being challenged in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
After Friedman, the next highest-spending Valley Assembly member was Tom Bane 
(D-Van Nuys), who listed $301,019 in expenses. Bane, chairman of the Assembly 
Rules Committee, reported spending $29,343 -- more than any of his colleagues 
-- on postage not connected with newsletters. He spent another $30,323 on 
newsletter printing and postage. 
</P>
<P>
The office expenses figures for other San Fernando Valley area Assembly members 
were: Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), $288,864; Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), 
$285,471; Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), $283,936; Burt Margolin (D-Los 
Angeles), $277,030, and Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), $269,235.

NEWHALL SCHOOLS HIRE NEW BUS FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trustees of the Newhall School District voted unanimously Monday night to hire 
a new school bus company to replace troubled and much-criticized Laidlaw 
Transit Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, children and district administrators have complained since October 
that Laidlaw drivers were poorly trained, unfamiliar with their routes and 
rarely completed their rounds on time. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints dogged Laidlaw for months, and school administrators have been 
threatening since November to sever the company's contract unless service 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw is the nation's largest school bus company, with about 180 contracts in 
California alone. 
</P>
<P>
In its place, the trustees awarded a $396,000 annual contract to Santa Barbara 
Transportation, a much different firm. Santa Barbara is a small family-run 
company that has only 10 contracts with school districts in Santa Barbara 
County, said Ken Stokes, company president. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. J. Michael McGrath said he was impressed by Santa Barbara's management 
practices. A consultant hired to review Laidlaw cited poor management as a 
major cause of the company's problems. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees of the William S. Hart Union High School District are expected to 
approve a $1.5-million contract with Santa Barbara tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Four bus companies, including Laidlaw, bid on the contracts. Santa Barbara was 
the lowest bidder on the Hart contract. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw, however, was the lowest bidder on the Newhall contract, submitting a 
bid $63,000 under Santa Barbara's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But McGrath said the trustees were not obligated to renew Laidlaw's contract, 
despite the low bid. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw officials also had to fend off allegations by former employees at a 
state Senate hearing last year that supervisors doctored training records to 
make rookie drivers appear more experienced. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol investigated but found no proof that records had 
been altered.

PALMDALE CELEBRATES START OF WORK ON 2 MAJOR MALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the story of the Antelope Valley in recent years has been all-out growth, a 
subplot has been vigorous competition between Palmdale and neighboring 
Lancaster for new residents and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
So Palmdale leaders Monday celebrated the start of construction on two 
important commercial projects: the first major enclosed mall in the Antelope 
Valley and an auto mall that will include eight dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
The 100-acre, $75-million Antelope Valley Mall will be anchored by six 
department stores, including J.C. Penney, Harris', Gottschalk's and Sears, 
Roebuck. 
</P>
<P>
The enclosed facility at Avenue P and 10th Street West next to the Antelope 
Valley Freeway is scheduled to open in September, 1990. It is expected to bring 
in $2 million annually in sales taxes and to attract shoppers who have been 
driving to malls in Glendale, Northridge and Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Major Coup' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major coup for the city of Palmdale," said Steve Buffalo, city 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Cleveland-based Four Cities Inc., had considered a site in 
Lancaster, Palmdale's northern neighbor, which has 26,000 more residents. 
</P>
<P>
But Palmdale was chosen because several of the major retailers preferred that 
site and because the city agreed to pay $13 million for street widening and 
other improvements, Buffalo said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a victory in terms of gaining a strong foothold for commercial growth," 
he said. "The flow of retail shoppers had gone from north to south, but that 
will change. This is a turning point." 
</P>
<P>
A Monday night reception at the Palmdale Cultural Center marked not only the 
new mall but ground breaking for the 65-acre Auto Mall Center at Avenue O and 
the Antelope Valley Freeway. Six of the eight dealerships committed to the 
center are moving from Lancaster. The auto center is expected to bring in close 
to $1 million annually in sales taxes, officials said.

Palmdale billed Monday's festivities as "the event of the year" on its 
invitations.

Occasional Tensions 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo acknowledged that rivalry between the two cities has led to occasional 
tensions. But he said: "This is not a case of gloating. It's a case of pride. A 
change of times, a change of trends." 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Susan Davis said Lancaster city officials disagree that Palmdale 
has turned the tide in attracting future commercial development. She said 
Lancaster still hopes to attract a major indoor mall anchored by the upscale 
department stores and boutiques that the Palmdale facility, which has room for 
two more department stores, presently lacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see the flow changing," she said. "We have a tremendously educated 
and well-compensated population, yuppies with a lot of disposable income." 
</P>
<P>
Davis noted that Lancaster's Valley Central outdoor mall is thriving and has 
attracted businesses from Palmdale, as has an auto mall under construction in 
Lancaster.

PANEL REJECTS EVENING MEETINGS; 
</P>
<P>
NO NIGHT SHIFT FOR AIRPORT BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the third time, the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority has 
rejected a proposal to hold its regularly scheduled morning meetings at night 
to make it more convenient for members of the public to attend. 
</P>
<P>
The vote against the change was 5 to 4. Only the three commissioners 
representing Burbank and one of the three commissioners representing Pasadena 
voted for the switch Monday during a special meeting of the nine-member panel. 
</P>
<P>
The board also turned down a proposed experiment to hold a night meeting in 
each quarter of the next 12 months. However, board President Robert Garcin said 
the panel would consider holding special night meetings on specific topics 
suggested by commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners also voted down the time change last year. 
</P>
<P>
Composed of three representatives each from Glendale, Burbank and Pasadena, the 
authority oversees operation of the Burbank airport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inconvenient Timing 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank City Council has pressured the board for years to meet at night. 
They have said it is inconvenient for the public to attend the regular 
meetings, held at 9 a.m. on the first and third Mondays of each month. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank commissioners -- Leland C. Ayers, Mary Lou Howard and Brian Bowman 
-- said during the special session that having night meetings would allow for 
more input from experts on airport issues as well as from citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of members of the community that could give us good input," 
Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
But Pasadena Commissioner J.C. Schwarzenbach said that the commission could 
handle its affairs without the additional input. 
</P>
<P>
"We're appointed officials, not elected officials," Schwarzenbach said. "'Our 
time should be spent on deliberate debate among ourselves without emotions 
being thrown in. If we hold open meetings, it will be a grave mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Carl W. Raggio, one of the three Glendale commissioners, said night meetings 
would not be as productive. "I favor night meetings for a particular subject 
but not for business as usual," Raggio said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said she felt that the vote against the night meetings was partially the 
result of the board's exasperation with several gadflies who regularly attend 
its meetings and berate board members at length. 
</P>
<P>
One of the gadflies, Jules Kimmett, told the board after the vote, "You have 
castrated and desecrated democracy."

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTH HOLLYWOOD MAN FOUND SHOT TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fast-food restaurant manager was found shot to death early Monday in an alley 
behind a Woodland Hills shopping center about a mile from his workplace, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators had no suspects and no motive in the slaying of Cesar Reyes 
Calderon, 31, of North Hollywood, Detective Patrick Conmay said. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon was night manager at a McDonald's Restaurant at 22611 Ventura Blvd., 
where he left work at 1:20 a.m. Monday in his car, Conmay said. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour later, police were called to the alley behind the El Camino 
Shopping Center at Mulholland Drive and Avenue San Luis by people who had heard 
gunshots, Conmay said. Calderon, an immigrant from the Philippines, had been 
shot several times in the upper body, the detective said.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL COACH IS FIRED BY SDSU; 
</P>
<P>
EARNEST RIGGINS HAS BEEN WITH AZTECS SINCE 1983; NO REPLACEMENT NAMED

<P>
Earnest Riggins has been fired as San Diego State women's basketball coach, 
Athletic Director Fred Miller announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Miller would not comment on the reasons for the firing, calling it "a personnel 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins, 52, said he learned about the firing when a reporter called his house 
late Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's news to me," said Riggins, who said last week that Miller had asked him 
to resign but he had refused. "I haven't heard one word today. Not one word. 
I've been home most of the day, and I haven't talked to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess my reaction now is the same as it was last week. I'm shocked and 
surprised. Obviously, they see a need to make a change. That's their 
prerogative. But my character and my future are at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said one year remains on his contract, but Miller said Riggins likely 
will not be reassigned at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not our intent," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to confirm that one year does indeed remain on Riggins' contract, 
Miller said, "No comment. I don't want to get into a public debate on that." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins took over the women's program in 1983 and has posted a 118-67 record. 
The Aztecs finished the 1988-89 season 25-9 and lost to Oregon in the 
championship game of the Women's National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins' tenure was not trouble-free, however. Star players Jessica Haynes and 
Tina Hutchinson, for example, both left the school in previous seasons because 
of academic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Jayne Hancock, associate athletic director, will head a search for a 
replacement. She was unavailable for comment, but Miller said the SDSU women's 
basketball coaching position is "an open situation." 
</P>
<P>
Several SDSU basketball players declined comment on Monday's firing.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: AZTECS FAIL TO GET INVITATION TO NCAA BASEBALL 
TOURNAMENT

San Diego State's baseball team, which finished second in the Western Athletic 
Conference regular season and third in the WAC playoffs last weekend in Hawaii, 
was not among the 48 teams selected Monday for the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. Division I tournament, which begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Three Aztecs, however, were chosen on the 12-man all-conference first team: 
outfielder Billy Miller, third baseman Lance Pinnell and pitcher Rob Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a junior and a graduate of Bonita Vista High, hit .326 with six homers 
and 34 RBIs. Pinnell, a senior and former Valhalla High standout, hit .280 with 
two homers and 24 RBIs. Brown, a senior, was 10-5 with a 2.98 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was a first-team selection last season and the WAC newcomer of the year. 
Miller and Pinnell were on the second team last year. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Jeff Barry, a first-team selection last season, made the second 
team. First baseman Harry Henderson and pitcher Dave Riddle were named 
honorable mention. Brigham Young pitcher John DeSilva (16-2) was named WAC 
player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU finished at 37-25. WAC champion Hawaii (40-25) received an automatic berth 
into the NCAA tournament. BYU, the regular-season champion, was chosen as an 
at-large team based on its 47-18 record. JIM LINDGREN

LIKE A METEOR, S&amp;L CAME AND WENT BEFORE ANYONE KNEW IT CRASHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
Even in an era when savings and loans were failing at a fast clip, regulators 
were amazed at how quickly Seapointe Savings &amp; Loan of Carlsbad was forced 
to close. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L opened for business in a Carlsbad shopping center April 17, 1985, 
and, in little over a year, lost more than $24 million. On May 30, 1986, the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board found Seapointe to be insolvent, its assets and 
capital dissipated by what federal regulators have described as a risky and 
fraudulent commodities and futures trading strategy set in motion by Strategic 
Investment Services, a Riverside-based financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"You blinked and (Seapointe) was gone," said William Davis, assistant 
commissioner with the state Department of Savings and Loans. "Everything 
happened so quickly that regulators were just behind (on detecting) . . . the 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Seapointe's brief existence also caught many S&amp;L executives in San Diego 
County by surprise. "Seapointe was like a meteor," according to one S&amp;L 
industry observer. "Nobody really knew it was there and all of a sudden it 
simply exploded." 
</P>
<P>
In reports to state regulators, Seapointe's executives described a fairly 
traditional S&amp;L that was growing in accordance with its conservative 
business plan. State regulators never conducted an in-depth review of Seapointe 
because the institution simply wasn't around long enough, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked pretty clean, right up until" the last report before the staggering 
losses occurred, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The reports that regulators were reviewing, however, masked the unusual and 
risky commodities- and futures-trading strategy that the financial adviser had 
devised to protect Seapointe from swings in interest rates. That strategy, when 
coupled with other unusual practices, led the S&amp;L to suffer a stunning 
string of losses in early 1986. 
</P>
<P>
According to regulators, once Seapointe's losses appeared, there was very 
little that could be done -- largely because the S&amp;L's complex options- and 
futures-trading strategy generated a $15.9-million loss on a single day in 
early February, 1986. That loss grew to $18 million in just four days, 
according to a recently amended lawsuit filed by the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
State regulators first considered a merger or an outright sale of Seapointe's 
remaining assets. But the losses had drained Seapointe's capital and regulators 
eventually sold the S&amp;L's insured deposits to Monterey Savings Bank of 
Monterey Park for $42,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to a lawsuit amended earlier this month by the Federal Savings and 
Loan Insurance Corp., there were several reasons for the S&amp;L's unexpected 
failure: 
</P>
<P>
* Unlike most failed S&amp;Ls, Seapointe was not destroyed by bad loans. In 
fact, Seapointe had yet to make its first loan -- or even hire a loan officer 
-- when federal regulators seized the institution. It instead used the deposits 
and its equity to purchase government securities, hoping to realize a profit on 
its interest-rate spread. 
</P>
<P>
Although that no-loan strategy was unusual, "it was not unique" during the 
mid-1980s, according to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
* Within two months of opening, Seapointe had attracted $31.8 million in 
deposits -- of which all but $6.3 million were Jumbo CDs. Although Jumbo 
CDs-certificates of deposit with a minimum worth of $100,000 -- help 
institutions build deposits quickly, they typically carry higher-than-average 
interest rates, which makes it harder for institutions to turn a profit. Jumbo 
CDs are also viewed as an unstable source of capital for S&amp;Ls because 
fickle depositors often withdraw and redeposit their funds elsewhere if they 
can receive a better interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Seapointe's business plan called for Jumbo CDs to account for just 
15% of total deposits throughout the first three years. The conservative plan 
also called for Seapointe's total deposits to grow slowly to $12 million during 
the first year, $27 million in the second year and $47 million by end of the 
third year. 
</P>
<P>
According to the FSLIC suit, Seapointe's collapse was caused by the complex 
trading strategy that Strategic Investment devised to protect Seapointe from 
interest-rate swings. Although S&amp;Ls traditionally use trading schemes as 
hedges against rate swings, the FSLIC suit alleges that Seapointe's trading 
strategy was actually a speculative -- and, consequently -- illegal program. 
</P>
<P>
Seapointe "risked and lost the entire net worth of the association, plus its 
Jumbo CD deposits, to conduct a speculative trading strategy built on the 
ultimately erroneous assumption that interest rates would rise," according to 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, (Seapointe was) the only institution that I knew of that was 
dealing so aggressively in these types of securities," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Seapointe "hired what they felt was an expert to transact their business and 
they relied totally upon their judgment," recalled Davis. "Then, whammo . . . 
they were out of business." 
</P>
<P>
Seapointe's use and alleged abuse of futures and options trading ran contrary 
to the staid plan that regulators approved during the early 1980s, when 
Seapointe was struggling to find enough capital to open its doors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planned to Be Traditional 
</P>
<P>
According to that plan, Seapointe would be a "traditional" S&amp;L that would 
use locally generated retail deposits to finance home mortgages in the Carlsbad 
area. 
</P>
<P>
To manage interest-rate risk, Seapointe would not "presume to outguess the 
marketplace" or "risk the net worth of the institution in an attempt to 'make a 
killing' for the sake of short-term earnings." 
</P>
<P>
Although Seapointe's business plan devoted a full page to outlining its 
interest-rate risk strategy, regulators have maintained that there was no 
mention of the futures and commodity options that Strategic Investment 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
Events leading to that failure were described earlier this month in the FSLIC 
lawsuit that seeks $24 million in damages from Strategic Investment and Kidder 
Peabody, the New York-based investment firm that conducted trades for 
Seapointe. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego attorney who represents Strategic Investment and Dirk Rose, its 
founder and president, declined to comment on the suit. A spokeswoman for 
Kidder Peabody has denied any wrongdoing in Seapointe's failure. 
</P>
<P>
The Seapointe suit is one of many to spring from federal investigations that 
try to set blame -- and, if possible, recoup losses -- in connection with the 
continuing stream of S&amp;L failures. Already, more than 100 lawsuits have 
been filed against S&amp;Ls and their advisers, Federal Home Loan Bank Board 
member Lawrence J. White said during a press conference last week in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The FSLIC suit stemming from Seapointe's failure is one of a growing number 
that hold outside professionals responsible for S&amp;L failures. "We've been 
suing the accountants, lawyers and others," White said. "There will be a strong 
effort to bring more and more of the parties" to trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hold Directors Responsible 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators also are exerting "more and more pressure on thrift 
directors to set (responsible) policies," White said. "We're not expecting them 
to become 'rocket scientists,' but we do want them to look harder at what 
they're signing off on." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Seapointe's dramatic failure, its officers and its board of directors 
-- including Ernest Dronenburg Jr., a member of the state Board of Equalization 
-- were not named in the lawsuit filed in the FSLIC suit. 
</P>
<P>
Dronenburg has denied any knowledge of the allegedly fraudulent trading scheme 
that Strategic Investment developed to shield Seapointe from unexpected 
interest rate swings. "There was a lot of deception going on," according to 
Dronenburg. 
</P>
<P>
Seapointe was "the only case I can recall where not one member of management or 
the board" was held responsible when federal regulators went to court to seek 
damages in the wake of an S&amp;L failure, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Seapointe's directors were unaware that Strategic Investment had developed a 
risky and illegal trading strategy that left the S&amp;L open to "a potentially 
unlimited loss" in the event of an interest-rate swing, according to the FSLIC 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
"What struck me was the total lack of sophistication of the management and 
directors for those types of transactions," Davis said. "They didn't know a 
damn thing about" futures and commodities trading. 
</P>
<P>
Seapointe's failure surprised the state Department of Savings and Loans, in 
part because regulators were beset by a dramatically changing industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Regulators Swamped 
</P>
<P>
At the time Seapointe was seized, regulators were responsible for 158 
state-chartered S&amp;Ls. Savings-and-loan examiners also were processing 
applications from more than 100 groups that wanted to open new S&amp;Ls. And, 
during 1985 and 1986 alone, regulators took over or created conservatorships 
for 23 state-chartered institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The state had been slowly bolstering its inspection team to meet the growing 
workload, but, even by 1987, there were still only 79 S&amp;L examiners. 
</P>
<P>
"When it blew, it caught everyone unaware," recalled David Ross, who had become 
Seapointe's second president just weeks before the dramatic losses. Ross, who 
now works for an executive search firm in Orange County, had been hired to 
bolster Seapointe's anemic retail deposits. The trading strategy "was already 
in motion when I got there," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Ross linked the losses to "very rapid movements in oil prices during the first 
few weeks of 1986. . . . That kicked off a very precipitous change in interest 
rates," which caused Strategic Investment's trading strategy to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Seapointe, which dismissed Strategic Investment one day after learning about 
the $15.9-million loss, decided to seek damages by filing suit against the 
financial-advice firm and Kidder Peabody. However, federal regulators took over 
the troubled S&amp;L the same day that Seapointe's board voted to file a suit, 
and the lawsuit was never filed. 
</P>
<P>
"The lawsuit (became) moot at that point," Ross said. "I ended up being a 
caretaker for four months. That was basically my job." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, a capital shortfall almost kept Seapointe from ever opening for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Seapointe's initial board of directors, which included mostly San Diego County 
residents, had trouble gathering $2 million in capital needed to gain deposit 
insurance from federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
As the group approached $2 million, regulators increased Seapointe's regulatory 
capital minimum to $3 million and many of the original investors backed out. 
"Evidently, it was one thing to be just a couple of thousand dollars short and 
another to be $1 million short," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Early in October, 1984, Strategic Investment's Rose told Seapointe's board that 
he could attract investors with enough capital to meet the stricter capital 
requirement. Rose eventually solicited 51% to 80% of Seapointe's capital, 
according to federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
But, with that new wave of investors, control of the Carlsbad-based S&amp;L 
passed to investors who were largely from outside San Diego County.

 Yuba Natural Resources, the troubled mining firm whose former chairman, 
Richard Silberman, was arrested April 7 on money-laundering charges, has made 
an overdue $131,000 payment to the U. S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of 
Land Management as part of a settlement of mineral trespass charges. 
</P>
<P>
The payment, which was due April 1, stemmed from charges filed by the bureau 
last year in connection with Yuba's 9,900-acre mining field near Marysville. 
Yuba still owes the bureau $400,000, which it will pay off in annual 
installments through 1993, bureau area manager Deane Swickard said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Yuba, which is hard-pressed for working capital, generated the money by selling 
hunting and fishing rights on part of its land to a sportsmen's club, Yuba 
spokesman Marshall Mintz said. 
</P>
<P>
Yuba is still negotiating to refinance an overdue $6.5-million loan from Bank 
of America, he said.

SCE TO FUND GROUP IN FAVOR OF UTILITY MERGER; 
</P>
<P>
ORGANIZATION LABELED 'FRONT' FOR COMPANY BY OPPONENTS OF PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Edison has agreed to pay the staff costs of San Diegans for 
the Merger, a recently formed group that will lobby in support of San Diego Gas 
&amp; Electric's proposed merger with Edison. Critics of the merger complained 
Monday that the new organization is simply a "front group" for the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence F. O'Donnell, a La Jolla-based energy-industry consultant who founded 
the group Monday, said that Edison had awarded his firm, Senior Policy 
Associates, a contract to perform the group's staff functions. The group will 
maintain a small office with two or three staffers, O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell declined to discuss the monetary value of the contract and Edison 
spokesman Lewis Phelps described the group's funding as "proprietary 
information, at the request of Mr. O'Donnell." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Former Link to SCE 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell acknowledged that his consulting firm has on one occasion contracted 
to complete a project for Edison. However, Senior Policy Associates has not 
contracted with SDG&amp;E for consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
The new organization's organizing committee includes 17 San Diegans who 
represent "a cross-section" of county residents and soon will make an initial 
mailing to gain support, O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
The group hopes to deliver "a clear explanation of merger benefits," O'Donnell 
said. "We are disturbed that the merger has become a highly charged, emotional 
issue with little attention being paid to the benefits we will enjoy as 
ratepayers and as San Diegans who prize our quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of Many Opinion Groups 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans for the Merger" joins a growing list of groups formed to sway 
public opinion on the proposed merger that would shift control of SDG&amp;E to 
Edison, a Rosemead-based subsidiary of SCEcorp. The merger, which is being 
studied by the state Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, would create the nation's largest gas and electric 
utility with 4.8 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a group of influential San Diegans who oppose the merger created the 
"Coalition for Local Control." That group includes the Greater San Diego 
Chamber of Commerce, the San Diego Economic Development Corp. and several 
consumer and public-interest groups. The anti-merger group hopes to raise 
$200,000 for its campaign against the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Fred Schnaubelt has drawn $10,000 from SDG&amp;E for "Taxpayers 
Against a Government Takeover," a group that has pledged to fight a government 
takeover of SDG&amp;E. The group has completed some mailings and raised an 
additional $3,000, Schnaubelt said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ratewatchers, a relatively tiny group of San Diego consumers, also has been 
formed to oppose the merger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harsh Words From Foes 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell's group "is obviously just a front group for Edison," complained Bob 
Hudson, executive director of the Coalition for Local Control. "We just don't 
have hundreds of thousands of dollars to go out and hire a crew of clerical 
workers to come up with massive mailing lists." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action 
Network, a San Diego-based consumer group, acknowledged that "it would be nice 
if some of that money was headed to us." 
</P>
<P>
UCAN, which has been involved in utility regulatory matters since 1983, has yet 
to take a stance on the merger, but Shames is concerned that the merger won't 
produce rate decreases promised by the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
UCAN has 56,000 members and "interest is rising," according to Shames. UCAN 
will spend $150,000 to $200,000 to study the utility merger, Shames said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to funding pro-merger groups, SDG&amp;E and Edison also have been 
directly involved in the public debate over their proposed merger. SDG&amp;E, 
for example, is now running a $1.5-million advertising campaign that includes 
radio and newspaper advertising. The campaign will be expanded to include 
television ads in early June. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of that campaign is being paid by SDG&amp;E's shareholders, not its 
customers, according to utility spokeswoman Karen Duncan.

HEALTH OF HCA, SCRIPPS BENEFITS FROM MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opening next month of Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation's new 
$6-million Sports and Health Center on the north end of its Torrey Pines campus 
is apparently further evidence that a somewhat unlikely marriage between 
medical and corporate partners is working out quite well. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage of Scripps with Hospital Corp. of America, a Nashville-based 
health-care management giant that owns or manages 400 hospitals nationwide, was 
announced in 1984 when Scripps contracted with HCA to manage its 173-bed Green 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, from Scripps' point of view, was good because it relieved the 
foundation of the burden of operating a hospital in an increasingly difficult 
economic environment in which the government and other health-care insurers are 
trying to cut health-care reimbursements to providers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aligned With Important Center 
</P>
<P>
And HCA benefited because the deal gave the company an affiliation with a 
prestigious health-care center that is also at the forefront of basic 
biomedical research, said Richard Bracken, whom HCA brought in as executive 
director to manage Green Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Several other research and university clinics, including those at University of 
Southern California, University of Louisville, Creighton University and 
University of Colorado, are run by professional management firms, so Scripps' 
deal with HCA is not unusual in that respect, Scripps president Dr. Charles 
Edwards said last week. 
</P>
<P>
But the contract is unusual in that HCA has been called on to make a huge 
capital investment in the Scripps plant, an investment so far totaling $60 
million, without actually taking title to the property. HCA simply leases the 
hospital from Scripps and is "totally at risk" on whether Green Hospital makes 
a profit or not, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
The sports and health center, which is built on land leased from the city, is 
only the latest HCA investment. The company also footed the bill for the 
$38-million Heart, Lung and Vascular Center that opened in March at Green 
Hospital as well as for a multimillion dollar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
HCA's lease agreement can be terminated by either party on 90 days notice as 
long as Scripps reimburses HCA for the book value of its investment at Scripps. 
</P>
<P>
Without offering specific figures, Bracken said the management arrangement is a 
"profitable" one for HCA, which was a publicly owned company until it was 
bought by a management-led group earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said Scripps made the decision to look for an outside operator for 
Green Hospital after determining that the foundation would have to make $200 
million in capital improvements over a 10-year period if the hospital were to 
remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps, a not-for-profit entity, was having difficulty enough raising funds 
for its research programs, funds which this year will total about $75 million, 
Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Days of Independence Numbered 
</P>
<P>
Scripps was also finding the operation of a hospital difficult in an age in 
which clinics were increasingly run in large chains for maximum buying power 
and economies of scale. "We saw that the days of the stand-alone hospital were 
coming to an end," said Edwards, who has been Scripps chief executive since 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
Giving up management of the hospital was not as traumatic as it might seem, 
Edwards said, because Scripps sees its mission as a research and out-patient 
facility first and a provider of in-patient clinical services second. Scripps 
Clinic received more than 700,000 out-patient visits last year compared with 
15,000 in-patient visits at Green Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"The business we knew least about was the operation of the hospital," Edwards 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps' 30,000-square-foot sports and health center will be operated somewhat 
like a membership health spa and will be managed in conjunction with Scripps' 
preventive medicine and fitness programs, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Built between Scripps and the Sheraton Hotel now under construction on North 
Torrey Pines Road, the health center will also be open to hotel guests, Bracken 
said, although details between Scripps and Sheraton have not been completed.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever is causing the current market to go up -- be it program trading or a 
melt-up (the opposite of a meltdown) -- Wall Streeters are in any case enjoying 
the runaway movement in stock prices, according to Irving Katz, director of 
research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 61 points, or 2.5%, this past week, for 
a total gain of 15.3% since the first of the year. Other averages have moved up 
comparably, with Standard &amp; Poor's 500 up 15.7% and NASDAQ over-the-counter 
average up 15.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Ten San Diego stocks reached new highs during the week, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Monitor Labs gained $.50 to a new high of $6.50. Monitor, which makes 
air-quality measurement devices, recently announced good prospects for the rest 
of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
TCS Enterprises reported excellent six-month earnings of $.15 a share and 
initiated a stock buy-back program. Its stock moved up $1, to $4.25. But TCS 
has one question to be answered, according to Katz: What will the government do 
with the 20% stake held by Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, which recently was taken 
over as insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
Additional new highs were made by Beeba's Creations, $12.375; PSICOR, $13.50; 
Mail Boxes Etc., $20.50; HomeFed Corp., $39.875; Price Co., $47.75, Maxwell 
Labs, $14.50; DH Technology, $10.875, and Medical Imaging Centers of America, 
$10.125. 
</P>
<P>
Cubic Corp. gained $1, to $17.50, in continued reaction to good second-quarter 
earnings of $.75 a share and good prospects for higher second-half earnings.

VALLEY EARNINGS: DICK CLARK PRODUCTIONS REPORTS 7% HIGHER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Clark Productions said its profit in the third quarter that ended March 31 
rose 7% from a year earlier, to $431,000. Revenue climbed 7% in the period to 
$8.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months, the Burbank production company said its profit was $1.6 
million, compared to a loss of $734,000 a year earlier. Revenue climbed 19% in 
the period to $20.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed its improved performance to better profits from its 
television series work and to special programs that it produced.

NEWBURY PARK SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY ENJOYS NEW HEALTH BUT BRACES FOR PREDICTED

John D. Poe grew up in northeast Montana in a hamlet called Medicine Lake, 
where his grandfather and father ran a drugstore for 75 years. The younger Poe 
opted for the electronics business, but he's brought aid to the sickly as well. 
</P>
<P>
In Poe's case, the ailing patient was a business, Semtech Corp. in Newbury 
Park, a tiny semiconductor maker founded in 1960. After humming along for 20 
years, Semtech by late 1985 was losing money and in danger of collapse. So it 
hired Poe. 
</P>
<P>
On his first day on the job, Poe was told Semtech did not have enough money to 
meet its payroll. That wasn't too surprising since Semtech had lost about $6 
million between 1980 and 1985. When Poe arrived, he said, the company "had very 
little financial management, or any management that had been able to sit down 
with the bank and lay out a plan." 
</P>
<P>
He held his breath and made the payroll, and since has been slowly nurturing 
Semtech back to health. The company, which lost $4 million on sales of $11 
million in its fiscal year that ended Jan. 29, 1985, earned $1.7 million on 
sales of $19 million in fiscal 1989. In the process, Poe, 37, was paid $216,300 
last year and now owns about 6% of Semtech's stock, worth about $830,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Capricious Cycles 
</P>
<P>
But he can't afford to be cocky. Semtech remains subject to the capricious 
cycles of the semiconductor industry, which affect nearly every company in the 
field. "We'd like to believe we're not, but unfortunately we are somewhat 
subject" to the cycles, Poe conceded. 
</P>
<P>
A full semiconductor cycle is like a roller-coaster ride except that it can 
last four years. Typically, the ride includes a period when the industry enjoys 
strong demand, boosts production to fill the big orders and earns healthy 
profits. Then, as computer manufacturers and other buyers cut back their 
orders, semiconductor makers find themselves laden with overcapacity and 
skidding profits. 
</P>
<P>
Now some in the industry think that there's a dip coming. "It seems to me we're 
in a decline right now," said Alan B. Lees, a vice president of Diodes Inc., a 
Chatsworth semiconductor firm. "Things are not moving ahead as quickly as we 
would like." 
</P>
<P>
At Semtech, some of the recent momentum seems to be slowing. The company's 
profit in the fourth quarter that ended in January fell 40% from a year 
earlier, to $220,000 from $366,000, in large part because industrywide demand 
for semiconductors flattened. "Last year had two distinct halves," said Poe, 
who occupies a modest, cork-paneled office that resembles a high school 
principal's office more than a chief executive's suite. "Our bookings in the 
first half were 30% higher than our bookings in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
So Poe has been building Semtech's capital to cushion it against the next down 
cycle by plowing earnings back into the company, conserving cash and issuing 
securities. Semtech's cash, a paltry $115,000 at the end of fiscal 1985, 
totaled $1.7 million in January. The company's net worth -- its assets minus 
its liabilities -- was $9.2 million at the end of the latest fiscal year, up 
from $5 million three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Power Rectifiers' 
</P>
<P>
The semiconductors made by Semtech, however, are not the remarkable tiny memory 
circuits that store huge amounts of information for computers, the so-called 
"chip" market that is dominated by Japan. Instead, Semtech's semiconductors, 
namely its "power rectifiers," serve more mundane purposes. A typical rectifier 
resembles a small ball bearing with two wires, or leads, sticking out each end 
that connect with other electronic circuitry. Using 30-year-old technology, 
Semtech's rectifiers mainly govern the flow of electrical power not only in 
personal computers, but in various other products such as jet airplanes and 
X-ray systems. 
</P>
<P>
Semtech has always focused on the military market, and today about 65% of its 
semiconductors are sold to military contractors such as Hughes, Westinghouse 
and Martin Marietta. Poe said Semtech's products are found on F-14 and F-16 jet 
fighters and the B-52 bomber. Its commercial customers include airplane makers 
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Because it mostly serves the military, Semtech is a custom builder of 
semiconductors that are made to fit the specific power needs, endurance and 
space limitations of, say, an Air Force jet or missile. 
</P>
<P>
Semtech was started in 1960 by Gustav H. D. Franzen and Harvey Stump Jr., who a 
year earlier had helped start Diodes Inc. After a year, Diodes' investors took 
control of the company, so Franzen and Stump started Semtech with the financial 
backing of Continental Device, an electronics firm. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1970s, Semtech was earning about $1 million on annual sales of $15 
million. But in 1979-80, Semtech was broadsided by the silver crisis, in which 
heavy purchases by the Hunt brothers of Texas helped send silver prices from $5 
to $50 an ounce. Semtech was using pure silver for all of its rectifier leads, 
so the silver crisis suddenly sent the cost of its product soaring. After all 
these years, Franzen is still bitter about it. "The Hunt brothers sort of 
killed us," Franzen said. "That hurt us tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Copper Leads 
</P>
<P>
Scrambling for an alternative, Semtech switched from silver to less expensive 
copper leads. But copper has much different properties than silver; for 
instance, at high temperatures, it oxidizes more quickly, rendering the 
semiconductor useless, Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one had really sat down to map out what it would take to change the process 
in going from silver to copper leads," Poe said. The products did not work, and 
"Semtech went for a period of six to nine months where there was virtually no 
product shipped." 
</P>
<P>
Semtech tried to fix its manufacturing problems, but the company still had not 
recovered by late 1985, when Poe arrived to confront the manufacturing problems 
and other headaches. 
</P>
<P>
Franzen was still a director of the company then and was temporarily filling in 
as Semtech's president. He recalled that he thought that Poe was to be hired as 
a financial officer. Instead, as Franzen vacationed in Europe, the rest of the 
board tapped Poe to be president, he said. "That caught me completely by 
surprise," Franzen said. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, Franzen's own ideas weren't getting much attention, so he 
quit voluntarily, he said. But he still has an interest in Semtech -- he owns 
50,000 shares of company stock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mild Praise 
</P>
<P>
He gives Poe mild praise for helping Semtech -- "everything looks quite good on 
the surface, I think." But he asserted that the company's change from silver to 
copper in the early 1980s was by necessity done "in a panic situation" and that 
"if we had had the proper time to do it, we could have made the conversion all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
For Poe, the lure at Semtech was his first crack at being chief executive. Poe 
had worked for the semiconductor unit of one-time industry giant Fairchild 
Camera &amp; Instrument and was vice president for operations at Silicon 
General, a San Jose semiconductor concern, when he was recruited by Semtech. 
Poe said he solved some problems at Silicon General and fancied himself as a 
fix-it man. 
</P>
<P>
His opening move at Semtech was simple: Save money. "The way you do that is you 
sign every purchase requisition," he said, and "absolutely anything that is not 
essential to keep the company going, you don't spend it. We were living on 
checks that we got in that day to pay bills we had to send out that afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Poe laid off 70 workers -- Semtech today employs 290 -- and sold a warehouse in 
Nevada for $600,000, which helped Semtech pare its bank debt. He raised $2 
million from investors, thereby padding the company's net worth. Most of top 
management was replaced in 1986-87. The switch to copper leads was finally 
ironed out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investors Cautious 
</P>
<P>
But judging by its stock, investors remain cautious about Semtech. The stock, 
which closed Monday at $3.25 a share on the American Stock Exchange, has 
drifted between $3 and $5 for much of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Poe has set up a new microelectronics division that makes more advanced 
semiconductors for the latest generations of aircraft and other military 
products. 
</P>
<P>
There is still that roller-coaster semiconductor cycle to worry about. Now that 
Poe has put the company on healthier financial footing, his said his next task 
is to "put a strategy in place to maintain that consistent growth." 
</P>
<P>
But Advanced Micro Devices, one of the semiconductor giants of Silicon Valley 
that is 50 times Semtech's size, still sees its fortunes swing up and down at 
the mercy of the semiconductor cycle. How can tiny Semtech do any better? 
</P>
<P>
"When you're smaller, it's a little easier," Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
His idea is that as markets shrink, "we think we're quick enough to maintain 
our business and even grow," that he can quickly shift his company's talented 
employees into new areas, and that movement is easier than at a bigger company, 
which has to "try to move thousands of people around." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. But investors probably will have to wait till the next semiconductor 
roller-coaster ride comes to a complete stop to see if Poe was right. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEMTECH AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Semtech is a Newbury Park maker of semiconductors that mainly regulate the flow 
of power in various products, from airplanes to personal computers. The 
company, founded in 1960, now has 290 employees and sells about 65% of its 
products to military customers.

GOVERNMENT RAIDS SYLMAR JET ENGINE PARTS FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jet engine parts company in Sylmar was raided late last month by units of the 
Defense Department and the FBI as part of a federal investigation into 
allegedly substandard parts the company sold that may have ended up in both 
military and commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation into McHaffie, Inc. was confirmed by Rodney Hansen, special 
agent in charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, or DCIS, in Los 
Angeles, which is operated by the Department of Defense's inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen declined to comment further on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed against McHaffie, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Norman McHaffie, president of the parts company, denied that his company was 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
But General Electric Aircraft Engines in Evendale, Ohio, confirmed that several 
weeks ago the DCIS told G.E. that it was investigating McHaffie, which supplies 
G.E. with fasteners for jet engines, said G.E. spokesman Dave Lane. 
</P>
<P>
"Upon learning of alleged irregularities regarding testing of fasteners by 
McHaffie," Lane said in a prepared statement, G.E. set up its own quality task 
force to review "the McHaffie fasteners in engines produced and under 
production" at two G.E. aircraft engine plants. 
</P>
<P>
Lane said that G.E. "thus far has not identified any engine safety concerns 
with McHaffie-supplied fasteners in field or test engines produced at G.E." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Technical Presentations 
</P>
<P>
Besides testing its equipment, Lane said, G.E. made "technical presentations to 
our customers, including the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy and the FAA." 
</P>
<P>
Fasteners are bolts that help hold the various parts of an engine together. 
</P>
<P>
One customer G.E. alerted was Boeing Co., which looked through its G.E. engines 
with McHaffie fasteners. "We have found no anomalies," said Jack Gamble, 
spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the engines G.E. produces at its Evendale plant are two models that are 
used in several Boeing aircraft. One engine model is used in some Boeing 767 
and 747 planes, while another engine, which G.E. jointly produces with a French 
company, is used exclusively in the Boeing 737 series. 
</P>
<P>
Various federal agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, the Defense Department and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
have been conducting a nationwide probe into companies suspected of selling 
faulty or counterfeit parts. 
</P>
<P>
At least a half dozen local parts companies have been investigated by the 
federal government, including Lee Aerospace Products, a Simi Valley firm. Last 
week a federal grand jury indicted the company and its two top executives and 
charged them with selling defective and substandard bolts that were ultimately 
installed in the space shuttle Discovery.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: MICROPOLIS BOARD OKS ANTI-TAKEOVER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Micropolis Corp.'s board of directors have approved an anti-takeover shield 
designed to discourage a hostile takeover bid by making the company more 
expensive for a suitor to buy. 
</P>
<P>
The plan gives stockholders the right to buy more shares if a hostile suitor 
should buy 20% or more of the company's stock or launch an unsolicited tender 
offer for 30% or more of Micropolis' stock. 
</P>
<P>
Micropolis, a Chatsworth maker of disk-drive data storage equipment used in 
computers, has suffered recently from an glut of product on the market, as well 
as its own production problems. In the past two years, the company's stock 
price has fallen from $44.13 a share in 1987 to $6.25 a share on Monday.

IN WAKE OF 4 SUITS, CHOUINARD SEEKS CHAPTER 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Yvon Chouinard may be best known for founding Patagonia, the 
Ventura-based distributor of outdoor clothing, the seeds of his $70-million 
empire were in the functional climbing gear he first fashioned in the early 
1960s in a metalworking shed in his parents' back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard Equipment Ltd. posted $6 million in sales last year. But it was the 
industry leader, buoyed by the reputation of its high-performance gear and its 
high-profile founder, who has spent months at a time climbing treacherous ice 
in Antarctica or scaling Himalayan peaks without taking oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
So, industry observers were surprised last month when the firm announced that 
it was filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said the firm's finances are sound but that pending lawsuits 
and the rising cost of liability insurance prompted the move. 
</P>
<P>
"I've taken a lot of pride in making the world's best climbing equipment and 
trying to do a good job at it, but times have changed," Chouinard said. "Nobody 
wants to take responsibility for their actions, to say, 'I screwed up, it's my 
fault, I didn't bother to learn how to use the gear.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4 Lawsuits Filed 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said four lawsuits blame Chouinard for injuries allegedly 
caused by inadequate instructions and warnings on climbing harnesses and other 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard denies the allegations. Officials of Lost Arrow, the umbrella firm 
that runs Patagonia, Chouinard Equipment and several other companies, declined 
to identify the plaintiffs or to say where or when the suits had been filed. 
</P>
<P>
"No equipment failed and no equipment broke, but when people get hurt . . . 
they sue," said Kevin Sweeney, a Lost Arrow spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard said none of the lawsuits were filed by experienced climbers. They 
were filed by beginners in climbing school, a window washer and an actor who 
used the equipment on stage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lost Arrow officials, who donate 10% of pretax profits to climbing and 
environment causes, said they aren't trying to evade their responsibilities or 
liabilities. They said they are trying to ensure the company's survival. 
</P>
<P>
They want to sever ties with Chouinard Equipment because they fear that Lost 
Arrow's $70 million in assets could be attached if a lawsuit against the 
mountaineering subsidiary succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Lost Arrow is trying to sell Chouinard Equipment. Lost Arrow 
officials hope Chouinard's 70 employees will be able to raise the money to buy 
the company themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely sets a precedent in the industry," said George Bracksieck, 
editor of Rock and Ice, a climbing magazine based in Boulder, Colo. "People 
have sued over equipment failure before, but this is the first time one of the 
major manufacturers of equipment has taken Chapter 11 because of suits." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
300 Trips Dropped 
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of lawsuits and rising liability insurance costs have put 
mountaineers between a rock an a hard place. Last October, liability concerns 
prompted the Sierra Club to drop all club-sponsored climbing trips requiring 
ropes or ice axes. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Sierra Club chapter has dismantled part of its popular 
mountaineering training course and dropped 300 mountaineering trips from its 
extensive program of outings. 
</P>
<P>
Some outdoor equipment business people fear that manufacturers and consumers 
stand to lose if the suits against Chouinard succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have a chilling effect on the climbing industry," said Michael 
Kennedy, editor of Climbing, a magazine based in Carbondale, Colo. "The 
equipment won't be as good, and people won't have the money to do testing and 
development. You'll end up with a lot of smaller, fly-by-night companies." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the industry, climbing aficionados and business people say that 
while more people are climbing today than ever before, mountaineering remains a 
high-risk sport with inherent dangers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Firms 
</P>
<P>
"You can have the best equipment, but if you're high off the ground and make an 
error, you can get killed pretty easily, and I think that needs to be 
emphasized," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard is one of only a few firms to file for Chapter 11 in the wake of 
pending lawsuits. Johns Manville, which manufactured asbestos, and A.H. Robins, 
which made the Dalkon Shield, an intrauterine device that caused severe medical 
problems for some women, filed for reorganization in two well-publicized cases. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said Chouinard might be making a smart move. 
</P>
<P>
"Filing Chapter 11 is not something that is socially reprehensible," said 
Kenneth N. Klee, a UCLA law school professor who helped draft the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. "They could be doing two socially progressive things: Keeping 
the business intact while they find out if they are liable and keeping their 
employees in jobs while they litigate this issue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Genuine Problem' 
</P>
<P>
"They're being pretty straightforward," agreed Chris Hughes, editor of 
Specialty News, a Bend, Ore., trade newsletter for the outdoor industry. "It's 
a genuine problem for the whole outdoor industry." 
</P>
<P>
Lost Arrow officials say the sale of Chouinard to its employees or another 
owner might help to discourage further lawsuits and reduce liability insurance 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
They added that Lost Arrow would retain responsibility for lawsuits filed 
against products sold before the ownership transfer. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, many who are familiar with Chouinard said the filing signifies the 
end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sweeney: "The company's roots were in hardware gear and to sever those 
roots does cause sadness around here."

SANTA MARGARITA CO. TO DEVELOP MORE BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Margarita Co., an enormous landowner in southern Orange County, has 
decided to build and develop more of its own apartments, stores and factories, 
a major change in the way the company does business. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the company had built most of the commercial buildings in the new 
town of Rancho Santa Margarita in partnership with other local developers such 
as Koll Co. and SDC Development Co. Or it had simply sold its land to 
developers, who then built their own buildings on it. 
</P>
<P>
The company may still do those kinds of deals, Executive Vice President Thomas 
Blum said earlier this month. But it also is anxious to build its own portfolio 
of buildings in which it will not have to share ownership with partners. 
</P>
<P>
The company had planned to do its own developing eventually, Blum said. In 
fact, it has already developed a few buildings by itself: apartments and two 
industrial buildings now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Employees 
</P>
<P>
But the loss of three key employees since December prompted President Anthony 
R. Moiso and Blum to "stand back and take a hard look at where we're going," 
Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
The result was to make the move now, Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the change also allows it to build a broader range of 
buildings, since it will no longer be dependent on finding a partner for a 
particular project. 
</P>
<P>
The move reflects a new confidence on the part of the company that it has the 
expertise to develop buildings on its own, local experts said. 
</P>
<P>
It also reflects the company's desire to keep for itself what it obviously 
expects to be very valuable buildings near a new freeway, the Foothill 
Corridor, those experts said. That could be built through the town as early as 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
The second largest private landholder in the county, after the Irvine Co., 
Santa Margarita owns 40,000 acres in booming southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
When the new town of Rancho Santa Margarita is completed in 15 years on 5,000 
of those acres, it will have 50,000 residents and provide 26,000 jobs, the 
company says. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it anticipates building about 200,000 square feet of 
commercial space a year. The majority will be free-standing industrial 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Plans 
</P>
<P>
Of 1,100 apartment units built or under construction now, the company has 
developed about half on its own and plans to build more, Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the commercial buildings will go up in the town's 400-acre business 
park -- already home to 60 companies and 3,000 employees -- and 230 acres in 
the town's planned downtown, now completely undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
One of the benefits of joint ventures is spreading the risk of development. But 
Blum said the company is not worried that it might be caught overextended in an 
economic downturn, which is believed by some economists to be in the near 
future. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, Blum said: The financial partner that Santa Margarita invited to 
help develop the entire town in 1985, Copley Real Estate Advisors, a subsidiary 
of New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. Copley provides Santa Margarita Co. 
with a strong financial partner. 
</P>
<P>
The company does not plan to add many employees, Blum said. It may be taking a 
lesson from the Irvine Co., which hired hundreds of people in the past but has 
been laying them off as it contracts out more of its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stay Small' 
</P>
<P>
"We're not hung up on having a lot of people," Blum said. "We want to stay 
small." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita Co. now employs 170, including employees in a mortgage unit, an 
escrow subsidiary and a cable television venture. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it was promoting two employees to manage its new businesses. 
A. Martin Stradtman, the former director of commercial and industrial sales, 
was named vice president for the business properties group. 
</P>
<P>
And Dennis Bean III, formerly director of project development, becomes vice 
president for the residential investment properties group.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN;

LATEST WAVE FINDS CARLSBAD AGAIN IN COMPUTER CONCERT

Asurvey of performers imported by Carlsbad's artist-in-residence program brings 
to mind that jaunty Rogers and Hammerstein song, "Everything's Up-to-Date in 
Kansas City." Over the past several seasons, an opera singer, a mime, a trio of 
modern dancers and a Japanese actress have displayed their talent and shared 
their performance secrets with the culturally inquisitive denizens of North 
County. 
</P>
<P>
With the residency of computer music composer and stage-wise Macintosh 
manipulator Carl Stone, no doubt a few traditionalists are intoning the song's 
refrain, "They've gone about as far as they can go." The savvy Los Angeles 
composer-performer, who likes to name his electro-acoustical compositions after 
his favorite Oriental restaurants, will spend May 24-25 with students at 
Carlsbad High School and Valley Junior High School. On Friday evening, he will 
give a concert of his recent compositions at the Carlsbad Community Cultural 
Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found that the high school students are a bit more receptive to this 
music than the average adult is. I was nervous the first time I went out to a 
high school, since I was accustomed to college and university audiences. I was 
afraid I'd run into an MTV mentality, but they were surprisingly open," said 
Stone from his music studio in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Stone brought his solo act to downtown San Diego's Sushi Gallery two years ago. 
For audiences used to watching a performer traverse the keyboard of a grand 
piano or even strum a high-decibel electric guitar, seeing Stone calmly seated 
in front of his computer, twisting dials and blithely changing floppy discs 
between movements, significantly redefines the term live performance. 
</P>
<P>
Stone has not built his performance career commuting to gigs in San Diego 
County, however. He has played in many festivals in Europe and Asia, and he was 
one of the composers commissioned to write a work for the 1984 Olympic Arts 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Asian Cultural Council awarded him a six-month residency in 
Japan, where he appeared on radio and television, as well as in concert. That 
sojourn may explain why his answering machine has messages in both English and 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Stone's computer compositions are based on the technique of sampling, 
which he likes to demonstrate to his student audiences. Sampling is an 
electronic process that manipulates recorded natural sounds as well as recorded 
music and electronic sounds. Stone has described his work "Hop Ken" as a 
disassembly and reconstruction of small segments of Mussorgsky's composition 
"Pictures at an Exhibition." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly everything Stone has composed has been written for his solo performance, 
but he has also written a work for piano and electronics, as well as a piece 
with no electronic components at all. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, he composed for a polka ensemble as a favor for a friend on 
the East Coast, Guy Kluceusec, whose sole claim to fame was commissioning a 
slew of new music for his polka band. 
</P>
<P>
South of the border. In a rare expression of cooperation between alta and Baja 
California, the International Orchestra of USIU and the Pro Musica Ensenada 
Choir will present a joint concert at the College Avenue Baptist Church on 
Friday. The two ensembles will perform Vivaldi's "Gloria," and the 
International Orchestra will complement that festive work with Vivaldi's "Four 
Seasons," featuring violinist Otto Feld as soloist. On Saturday, the 
International Orchestra will return the favor to the Pro Musica Ensenada, 
playing both the works in Ensenada's Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Going out in a blaze of glory. UC San Diego's contemporary performance 
ensemble, SONOR, promises a high-powered program as its seasonal swan song at 
La Jolla's Sherwood Hall on Thursday. Robert Erickson's "Fives," scored for 
piano quartet, will receive its world premiere, and Brian Ferneyhough's 
instrumental septet, "The Fall of Icarus," will enjoy its North American 
premiere. 
</P>
<P>
Ferneyhough, a British composer who was lured to UCSD in 1987 from a 
comfortable niche in the West German musical avant-garde, had "The Fall of 
Icarus" premiered at last fall's Strasbourg (France) Festival. A compact disc 
recording of the work, along with other recent Ferneyhough compositions, will 
be released next month on the Etcetera label. For those who wish further 
illumination about Ferneyhough's piece, the composer will give a pre-concert 
lecture in the Museum of Contemporary Art's Coast Room at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of SONOR's program includes Olivier Messiaen's "Exotic Birds," 
with Ruth Neville as piano soloist, and American minimalist Steve Reich's 
"Eight Lines." 
</P>
<P>
A rose by any other name. San Diego State University's resident ensemble, the 
Stauffer Wind Quintet, has changed its name to the Arioso Wind Quintet. So, 
what's in a name, we asked Marian Liebowitz, the quintet's leader. "Not a damn 
thing," she replied with total equanimity.

"Fine art has gotten so expensive that people are looking for another area to 
invest in, and movies are a common denominator," said Camden House Auctioneers 
President Barry Vilkin after a memorabilia auction held this weekend in Los 
Angeles. Among the 80 costumes auctioned off were Dorothy's gingham pinafore 
from the "The Wizard of Oz," which sold for $9,000, Rhett Butler's coat from 
"Gone With the Wind," which brought $6,000, and James Cagney's satin shirt from 
"Yankee Doodle Dandy," which sold for $4,500. Other items included police 
badges worn by the Keystone Kops, Robert De Niro's boxing trunks from "Raging 
Bull," dozens of animation celluloids and drawings from such early Disney films 
as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and "Sleeping Beauty," and Julius Caesar's 
throne from "Cleopatra." Two pair of scuffed black patent leather dance shoes 
worn by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers went for $9,000. However, many of the 
items in the sale failed to bring the hoped-for prices. A set backdrop of 
eyeball images created by surrealist Salvador Dali for the dream sequence in 
Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 "Spellbound" went for $10,000, half the minimum 
estimated sale price. Claudia Puig

IN SEARCH OF QUICK BUCKS IN FAST LUBES; 
</P>
<P>
GM AND FORD HOPE TO RECAPTURE SERVICE BUSINESS BY OFFERING SPEEDY OIL CHANGES.

<P>
General Motors and Ford have finally come around to what the Jiffy Lubes of the 
world have known for years: There is big money to be made in quick oil changes. 
</P>
<P>
Both auto makers have announced in the last month or so that they are entering 
the quick oil change business on a pilot basis, joining Jiffy Lube 
International, units of Valvoline and Quaker State and other companies in a 
fast-growing market. 
</P>
<P>
Both GM and Ford hope to recapture the service business that their car 
dealerships have lost to the quick-change outfits, and to improve their images 
with motorists who don't think that dealers have the time or inclination to do 
small-ticket maintenance work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge Profits Not Expected 
</P>
<P>
GM said two weeks ago that it had begun offering "Mr. Goodwrench Quick Lube 
Plus" service at 94 of its dealerships in four test markets: San Diego; 
Birmingham, Ala.; Columbus, Ohio, and Pittsburgh. If all goes well, the service 
could be available at as many as 3,500 of the 9,700 GM dealers in the nation by 
the first of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Powell, parts and service manager at John Hine Pontiac of San Diego, one of 
28 San Diego County GM dealers participating in the pilot program, said he does 
not expect it to generate huge profits. Rather, he said, the hope is that the 
service will build customer relations and thus improve car sales. 
</P>
<P>
"GM is wanting to sell its oil and filters, and dealers want to keep customers 
coming in on a more regular basis," Powell said. "We make some money (on oil 
sales), but as far as a whole lot, no." 
</P>
<P>
Modeled after the low-price, quick-service formula of Baltimore-based 
franchiser Jiffy Lube, the GM dealers will charge about $21 for oil, filter and 
a 10-point maintenance check. Customers are guaranteed that they will be back 
on the road after no more than 29 minutes or the next oil change will be free. 
That's slower than some competitors, but GM describes it as a "more credible" 
turnaround time. 
</P>
<P>
GM's action followed Ford's announcement April 21 that it had begun offering 
"Motorcraft/Ford Fast Lube" at 20 dealerships, including Theodore Robins Ford 
in Costa Mesa. The Ford package costs $19.95, and service within 15 minutes is 
guaranteed. Ford expects to expand the program to perhaps 500 of its 5,700 U.S. 
dealerships by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corp. spokesman Tom Houston said Friday that, for the time being, 
Chrysler does not plan to offer quick-lube service. The company looked at quick 
oil changes two years ago and decided that there were too many "geography" 
problems on dealer lots that might make it impossible to "deliver the 
convenience that the quick-lube places already deliver." 
</P>
<P>
"If Brand X and Y make a zillion dollars doing it, we aren't loathe to 
admitting we are wrong, and we'll take another look at it," Houston said. "This 
is a highly competitive business, and everyone watches what everyone else 
does." 
</P>
<P>
Up-front costs to the GM dealers are relatively low: They promise to dedicate 
one or two service bays to the oil change service and man them with employees 
in special uniforms. With no "brick and mortar" costs, dealers will end up 
spending only about $20,000 each -- mainly for signs and advertising, although 
GM is pitching in with nationwide marketing. 
</P>
<P>
That compares to a start-up cost of $490,000 or more for a typical Jiffy Lube 
franchisee (at least $370,000 for the site and building, and $120,000 or more 
for the franchise, equipment, working capital and inventory). 
</P>
<P>
Although making a small investment, the auto makers think that they can 
dominate a fast-growing market. Dave P. Robison, director of marketing for GM 
Service Parts Operations, said stand-alone, quick oil change outlets now do 
$4.4 billion in annual sales. He expects the number of stand-alone outlets -- 
not including those planned by GM and Ford -- to double, to about 6,000, by 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Conceding a "fast start and name recognition" to Jiffy Lube, Robison said, 
nonetheless, that he expects GM to become the leader in quick oil changes. "As 
the business grows more mature," he said, "there will be a small number of very 
large players with an awful lot of outlets." 
</P>
<P>
There are risks: Robison admitted that GM is nervous about its dealers' ability 
to get customers in and out within the prescribed time. Also, many dealership 
locations are not as convenient as franchise outlets, which typically are in 
high-traffic, commercial areas where motorists can easily stop for service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Change in Perception' 
</P>
<P>
Both car companies see quick lubes as a sure-fire way to help them win back 
customer trust, which is critical to car sales but has been declining in recent 
years. Robison said most car owners view going to a dealership for service -- 
even for something as minor as an oil change -- as a time- and money-consuming 
proposition that is best avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"Our studies have shown the customer has never been able to associate fast 
service with any manufacturer dealership, and I'm not talking just about GM, 
but Ford, Toyota, Honda and all the rest," Robinson said. Successful quick-lube 
service could change that perception, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Ford's sales have grown faster than its network of dealer-service 
facilities over the past decade, it is not unusual for Ford owners to wait two 
weeks for an oil change appointment, Ford spokesman Michael Parris said. That's 
not good positioning in a market where Americans are, to use Robison's phrase, 
"increasingly time-impoverished." 
</P>
<P>
Jiffy Lube has indeed become synonymous with the quick-lube industry. Although 
the franchiser has gone through some rough patches financially, it is still 
growing rapidly, with 1,050 outlets, up 26% from 823, as of March, 1988. Jiffy 
Lube's systemwide sales are expected to reach $350 million for the fiscal year 
that ended March 31, up from $252 million the previous year, spokeswoman Joan 
Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stepped Into Vacuum 
</P>
<P>
Apart from customer dissatisfaction with dealers, Jiffy Lube and the other 
chains have benefited from the disappearance of the full-service corner gas 
station, where motorists once went for oil changes and other minor services, 
said Franklin Morton, an analyst with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"That's forced a significant portion of auto owners to look elsewhere for their 
lube needs," Morton said. Into that vacuum stepped Jiffy Lube and other 
pioneers, he said. "Now, the auto companies have seen the success of some of 
these operators and decided to go at it on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Other major players in the quick-lube game are motor oil companies Quaker 
State, which owns Minit-Lube, and Valvoline, a unit of Ashland Oil, with its 
Rapid Oil Change outlets. Pennzoil recently helped Jiffy Lube with refinancing 
as a means of safeguarding one of its most important distribution channels. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens said the entry of Ford and GM will do no serious harm to Jiffy Lube 
franchises because "the quick-lube industry only has 6% of the oil change 
business. That means there is a huge (untapped) market out there." More than 
half of all oil changes are done by the car owners themselves, she said. 
</P>
<P>
John Reddan, an analyst with Moran &amp; Associates of Greenwich, Conn., is not 
so sure that Jiffy Lube and the other chains won't suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"People like GM and Ford will create a big wake that could swamp the little 
boats out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
CHECK YOUR OIL? 
</P>
<P>
The oil-change market is divided evenly into two basic segments: 
mechanic-installed and do-it-yourselfers, with about 50% each. Figures below 
are for 1986, the most recent data available. 
</P>
<P>
Do-It-Yourselfers: 50% 
</P>
<P>
Gas Stations: 14% 
</P>
<P>
Independent Repair Shops: 10% 
</P>
<P>
New Car Dealers: 15% 
</P>
<P>
Quick-Change Centers: 6% 
</P>

Transco Quits Field: Transco Energy Co., getting out of the oil-production 
business, said a subsidiary would sell oil and gas reserves in the Gulf of 
Mexico to Amerada Hess Corp. for $911 million, far more than had been expected. 
The sale by Transco Exploration Partners Ltd., including 41 gas fields, three 
oil fields and shore-based support facilities, is expected to close by the end 
of September. Transco Exploration, 74% of which is owned by Houston-based 
Transco Energy, is being liquidated so the parent company can concentrate on 
its core business of transporting natural gas through a 16,000-mile pipeline 
network.

After operating its Bumble Bee canned seafood business for less than a year, 
Pillsbury Co. said Monday that it has decided to sell the San Diego-based unit, 
as well as its Van de Kamp's Frozen Foods business in Long Beach, with the 
assistance of the New York investment firm Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Pillsbury, since it was acquired by Britain's Grand Metropolitan for $5.7 
billion earlier this year, has sold off a number of subsidiaries and fired 550 
workers from its Minneapolis headquarters in efforts to streamline operations, 
Larry Haeg, a Pillsbury spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
"Van de Kamp's and Bumble Bee are both valuable brand names that command 
prominent positions in their respective market sectors," said Pillsbury 
Chairman Ian A. Martin, who also is chief executive of Grand Metropolitan's 
U.S. operations. He added: "However, neither Van de Kamp's nor Bumble Bee is 
sufficiently linked to the core Pillsbury businesses in brand identity or 
product fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
Bumble Bee Seafoods was bought by Pillsbury in August, 1988, and had sales of 
about $283 million for the year ended Dec. 31. Van de Kamp's, which produces 
frozen fish products, was acquired by Pillsbury in November, 1984, and had 
sales of about $135 million for the year ended May 31, 1988. But Pillsbury 
noted in its 1988 annual report that "intense competition has held profit 
margins below an acceptable level." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts would not speculate as to who might buy the two businesses but said it 
is unlikely that a single suitor would be interested in both. 
</P>
<P>
William M. Fallon, vice president of finance at Heinz Pet Products, which until 
last November was part of Star-Kist Foods, said one large food processor, 
Heinz, is out of the running because of an antitrust ruling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compatibility Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Heinz sought to acquire Bumble Bee Seafoods last year for an estimated $200 
million, but the deal was blocked by the Justice Department on antitrust 
grounds and Bumble Bee was later acquired by Pillsbury. 
</P>
<P>
"When Pillsbury bought both of them it didn't seem like a good fit, so I'm not 
surprised they are getting rid of them now," Fallon said. 
</P>
<P>
Pillsbury Foods, a division of Pillsbury Co., had total sales of about $2.4 
billion for the year ended May 31, 1988. Other Pillsbury brand names are Green 
Giant, Haagen-Dazs, Totino's, Jeno's and Hungry Jack. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Met had annual sales of about $17 billion before its takeover of 
Pillsbury in January.

BARNEYS N.Y. TO OPEN SOUTH COAST PLAZA STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Barneys opens at South Coast Plaza early next year, it may be one of the 
snootiest -- and most expensive -- specialty shops around. 
</P>
<P>
This is not just any old Barneys, mind you. It is Barneys New York: purveyor of 
$570 silk blouses and $300 cotton shirts, outfitter of Manhattan's upper crust 
and upwardly mobile. 
</P>
<P>
The specialty apparel retailer said Monday that it plans to open a 
7,500-square-foot store in Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza and a 
7,000-square-foot unit in Seattle in February, 1990. They will be the first 
West Coast stores for the tony clothier, which has formed a national retail 
company called Barneys America that plans to open five or six stores annually 
for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Barneys also plans to open two stores in Tokyo and at least one more elsewhere 
in Japan within the next few years under a joint venture agreement with Isetan 
Co., one of Japan's largest retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Barneys New York sells clothing to upscale, fashion-conscious customers from a 
170,000-square-foot flagship operation in the Chelsea section of Manhattan and 
a smaller men's store near Wall Street. Founded in 1923, Barneys is known for 
selling contemporary clothes, as well as accessories and gifts, considered to 
be on the cutting edge of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most snobbish store in New York -- even more than Bloomingdale's -- 
and it has the most expensive things in the city," said Doreen Weisenhaus, a 
magazine editor who works a block away from the flagship. "My husband and I 
make a very decent, six-figure income, and we can't afford to shop there. . . . 
It's definitely a ritzy store." 
</P>
<P>
But in affluent Orange County, Barneys hopes to find plenty of customers. 
"There's a high level of people making more than $75,000 a year," said Bob 
Pressman, one of two grandsons of the company founder, Barney Pressman, and 
co-president of the new retail company. "The mix and quality of (other South 
Coast) stores is good. . . . . This absolutely will be one of our best stores." 
</P>
<P>
Merchandise at the Costa Mesa store will be 75% women's apparel and 25% men's. 
The stores outside Manhattan will have more of the medium-priced merchandise, 
said Gene Pressman, Bob Pressman's brother and co-president of the new national 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't mean cheap," he said. "We'll have a (bigger) proportion of 
younger, newer designers." 
</P>
<P>
Barneys' designer lines include Comme des Garcons, Gaultier and Romeo Gigli -- 
all designers whose outfits can sell for more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
But the store, intended to appeal to customers aged 25 to 55, includes more 
moderately priced apparel, with dresses priced at around $150 and pants for as 
little as $75 to $125. 
</P>
<P>
Barneys "is a high-service, specialty retailer, which is a niche that Nordstrom 
has filled very well," said Sarah Stack, a retail analyst in Los Angeles with 
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. "It's an aggressive strategy. . . . . But 
do I see Barneys as a threat to Nordstrom? No, I do not."

AWARDS PLANNED; 
</P>
<P>
TRUST FORMS TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS FOR BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-powered group of business executives, including investor Warren E. 
Buffett and television producer Norman Lear, announced an organization in Los 
Angeles on Monday to set standards for corporate behavior and reward "acts of 
courage, integrity and social vision." 
</P>
<P>
The group, calling itself Business Enterprise Trust, plans to conduct research 
on ethical issues facing corporations and to hand out "Spirit of Enterprise" 
awards to responsible individuals. 
</P>
<P>
James E. Burke, retired chairman and chief executive of Johnson &amp; Johnson 
and chairman of Business Enterprise Trust, said the organization wasn't formed 
to dress up corporate America's image in the wake of Wall Street's long-running 
securities fraud and insider trading scandal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoid Criticism 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Burke said, the group is more concerned with the pressure that 
corporate executives feel to show short-term profit at the expense of the 
long-term needs of their businesses and society in general. "We want to 
encourage a long-range view and a careful examination of the choices facing 
business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The group was started by Lear, producer of "All in the Family" and a founder of 
People for the American Way, a liberal activist group. "This is something that 
would have been appropriate at any time in the last 20 years," said Lear, who 
is providing $1 million to get Business Enterprise Trust started. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to maintain a positive tone, the group said it would steer clear of 
criticizing companies that don't meet their standards. "Actual examples of 
praiseworthy behavior are more valuable than criticism," said Kirk O. Hanson, 
president of the organization and a Palo Alto consultant on business ethics 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
But during a news conference at the Century Plaza Hotel, Burke said he would 
have handled events surrounding the recent Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska 
differently. Exxon has been accused of moving slowly to clean up the massive 
amounts of oil that spilled into environmentally sensitive Prince William Sound 
after its tanker ran aground in March. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether Larry Rawls (the chairman of Exxon) should have flown up to Alaska, I 
can't say," Burke said. "I would have handled it differently." 
</P>
<P>
Burke won praise in 1982 when, as chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson, he 
recalled Tylenol after cyanide-laced capsules killed seven people. Tylenol was 
reintroduced in "tamper-proof" packaging. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of Business Enterprise Trust said they were searching for modern-day 
heroes who would be examples to young executives and to students at the 
nation's business schools. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, quipped 
that the directors were looking for a successful businessman who "you would 
want to marry your daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the group said they would look for their heroes throughout the 
ranks of management, or perhaps in research and development. The group said it 
was unlikely that a chairman or chief executive would win a prize. 
</P>
<P>
But a number of the personal heroes of Business Enterprise Trust directors 
were, in fact, heads of their own companies. Asked to name a few outstanding 
business leaders from the past, directors mentioned David Packard, a 
Hewlett-Packard co-founder, and Robert Wood (General) Johnson, who took over 
J&amp;J in 1932 and built it into a pharmaceutical giant. 
</P>
<P>
Business Enterprise Trust is based at Claremont College, and its directors also 
include John F. Akers, chairman of IBM; Robert A. Burnett, chairman of Meredith 
Corp.; William T. Coleman Jr., senior partner of O'Melveny &amp; Myers; Peter 
F. Drucker, professor of business management at the Claremont Graduate School; 
Douglas A. Fraser, former president of United Auto Workers; Katherine Graham, 
chairman and chief executive of the Washington Post; Karen N. Horn, chairman 
and chief executive of Bank One; Sol M. Linowitz, senior counsel of Coudert 
Bros.; James T. Lynn, chairman and chief executive of Aetna Life &amp; 
Casualty; John D. Maguire, president of Claremont University; Robert C. 
Maynard, editor and president of the Oakland Tribune; Robert B. Reich, 
management professor at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of 
Government; Henry B. Schacht, chairman and chief executive of Cummins Engine 
Corp., and John A. Young, president and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard.

CARL'S JR. SCORES HIT WITH ITS 1ST FAST-FOOD STORE IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Famous Star has met the rising sun. 
</P>
<P>
The result, gauged over the first three days of sales at the newest Carl's Jr. 
restaurant, is that the Japanese like the Anaheim company's brand of fast food. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's opening of the first Carl's Jr. outside the continental United States 
"was one of our highest opening-day sales volumes ever," said Patty Beckman, a 
spokeswoman for Carl Karcher Enterprises. "I can't release the actual figures, 
but sales were in five digits." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is in the Minoo, a suburb north of Osaka, and was built by 
Friendly Corp. of Osaka. Friendly became Carl Karcher Enterprises' first 
international licensee 13 months ago when Carl Karcher, founder, chairman and 
chief executive of the hamburger chain, and Zenshiro Shigesato, Friendly's 
president, signed a 25-year exclusive licensing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Friendly, which operates more than 100 Western-style coffee shops in the Osaka 
area, will open at least 30 more Carl's Jr. restaurants in Japan by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher's international franchising staff reportedly is negotiating similar 
deals in several other Pacific Basin nations. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the Japanese characters on the menu boards and a popular 
melon-flavored soda in the soft drinks dispenser, the Minoo Carl's is no 
different from the Carl's in the Broadway Plaza in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of visitation from Japan in California, so many people from 
there have visited a Carl's Jr. We believe the Carl's Jr. concept will be well 
accepted," said Steve Kishi, Carl's Jr.'s director of international 
development.

NEW ABC LINEUP IS END OF A 'DYNASTY'; 
</P>
<P>
AARON SPELLING SHUT OUT OF 3 NETWORKS' PRIME-TIME SCHEDULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six new comedies, two new dramas and an hourlong news magazine hosted by Sam 
Donaldson and Diane Sawyer will join ABC's prime-time schedule in the fall, the 
network said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the long-running shows that were canceled to make room for the rookies 
was "Dynasty," the 8-year-old soap opera about the wealthy Carrington family of 
Denver that once was the nation's most popular TV series. Its ratings had been 
declining for the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of "Dynasty" also marked the fall of its executive producer, Aaron 
Spelling, once Hollywood's most successful television producer. With ABC's 
cancellation of "Dynasty" and another drama, "HeartBeat," plus NBC's decision 
last week to drop his series "Nightingales," Spelling will be unrepresented on 
the three major networks' prime-time schedules next fall for the first time in 
21 years -- a span that saw him turn out such hits as "The Mod Squad," "The 
Rookies," "The Love Boat," "Family" and "Fantasy Island." 
</P>
<P>
Other shows canceled by ABC Monday included "Hooperman," "A Man Called Hawk," 
"The Robert Guillaume Show," "Coach" and "Have Faith." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several New Comedies 
</P>
<P>
First-year shows that were renewed by ABC were its top-rated comedy "Roseanne," 
the revival of "Mission: Impossible," the comedy "Anything But Love" and the 
"Mystery Movie" that included "Columbo," "B. L. Stryker" and "Gideon Oliver." 
</P>
<P>
The six comedies that ABC is adding are "From This Moment On," with Jackie 
Mason as a former pajama salesman who takes up work at a New York community 
center; "Family Matters," a spinoff from ABC's "Perfect Strangers" starring Jo 
Marie Payton-France; "Homeroom," about an inner-city school teacher; "Living 
Dolls," about four teen-age models; "Doogie Howser, M.D.," about a teen-age 
genius who is a doctor, and "Free Spirit," about a witch who lives with a 
suburban family. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's two dramas are "The Kid," a Western about the young men who rode for the 
Pony Express, and "Life Goes On," about a working-class family whose members 
include a child with Downs Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The new magazine series, "Prime Time," will be ABC's second, joining the 
long-running "20/20." The network said it is tentatively scheduled to debut in 
August and will be slotted come fall on Thursdays at 10 p.m. opposite NBC's 
"L.A. Law" and CBS's "Knots Landing."

FIVE ADMIT AUTOMATED TELLER SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five people pleaded guilty in Los Angeles on Monday to an ambitious scheme to 
loot what could have been millions of dollars from automated teller machines 
during a three-day holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
When arrested Feb. 4, the five were busy manufacturing up to 7,500 bogus 
automated teller cards using account information and personal identification 
numbers stolen from Bank of America, prosecutors said. The scheme was called 
the largest of its kind uncovered anywhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Koenig, 28, alleged mastermind of the plot, admitted to all six charges in 
an indictment, including conspiracy and using and producing counterfeit 
automated teller cards. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Koenig stole the banking information while working as a 
computer operator for a subsidiary of General Telephone in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Jacklyn Bobby, 33, admitted to three counts under the same plea 
agreement with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hussey, 28, of Marina del Rey also pleaded guilty to all six felony 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby's sister, Bobbi Jo Bobby, 20, of Ladera Heights, admitted to two counts. 
Koenig's brother, Scott Koenig, 27, of Lincoln, Neb., pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
All are scheduled for sentencing Aug. 25 before U.S. District Judge Pamela 
Rymer and face prison terms of up to 72 years each. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Carolyn Kubota told the judge that the Secret Service was 
alerted to the scheme by an unnamed informant who was recruited by Jacklyn 
Bobby to join the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
The plan called for the defendants to manufacture nearly 7,500 counterfeit 
automated teller cards, then use them to withdraw cash at machines in 
California and the Midwest over the three-day Presidents Day weekend of Feb. 
4-6. 
</P>
<P>
Agents who raided the Ladera Heights apartment of Mark Koenig and Jacklyn Bobby 
on Feb. 4 found the defendants had manufactured 1,500 bogus cards from poster 
board and magnetic tape that were encoded with account information using a 
stolen device used to manufacture bank and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Kubota said earlier that had all the cards been used to withdraw the maximum 
amounts from each account, the potential theft could have reached $14 million.

New York Times Co., which already publishes Family Circle magazine, said Monday 
that it has agreed in principle to acquire McCall's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed, but the sale agreement followed recent published 
reports that the U.S. subsidiary of France's Hachette SA had broken off an 
informal agreement to buy McCall's. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is subject to approval by the boards of the companies, regulatory 
approval and signing of a definitive agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Family Circle and McCall's are part of a group known in the publishing industry 
as the "Seven Sisters" women's service magazines. The others are Woman's Day 
from Hachette's Diamandis Communications, Good Housekeeping and Redbook from 
Hearst Corp., and Better Homes &amp; Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal from 
Meredith Corp. 
</P>
<P>
William T. Kerr, president of New York Times Co.'s magazine group, said adding 
McCall's would enable advertisers to reach nearly one-third of the adult U.S. 
women with little duplication. 
</P>
<P>
McCall's, owned by Working Woman-McCall's Group, a joint venture of Time Inc. 
and media investor Dale W. Lang, is a monthly magazine with a circulation of 
5.1 million, mostly subscription. 
</P>
<P>
Family Circle is published 17 times a year and has a circulation of 5.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Working Woman-McCall's Group would be left with the monthly magazines Working 
Woman and Working Mother.

<P>
Federal regulators on Monday announced new rules requiring savings institutions 
to meet more stringent standards in documenting their securities activities, 
the latest in a series of steps to tighten supervision of the troubled 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board issued amended regulations requiring S&amp;Ls 
to report their securities transactions according to generally accepted 
accounting principles and to clearly distinguish between those securities held 
for sale, for trading and as investments. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Lockwood, a spokesman for the bank board, said S&amp;Ls would be able to 
conduct the same securities transactions as in the past, "but they've got to 
account for (them) in a more realistic sense." 
</P>
<P>
"They've been lumping them all together, which makes it very hard for auditors 
or for our own exam staff to get a handle on the exact financial picture," 
Lockwood said. "This is just one more step of a series that we've taken to 
tighten up the supervision of savings institutions." 
</P>
<P>
A Bush Administration proposal to restructure the industry and rescue 
depositors with money in insolvent S&amp;Ls is working its way through 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy Must Be Adopted 
</P>
<P>
Brian Smith, director of regulatory affairs for the U.S. League of Savings 
Institutions, said the bank board's new rules "establish a much more stringent 
standard" as to when S&amp;Ls can value securities at their higher, historical 
costs as opposed to market value, which could be lower. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;Ls would have to hold securities "through thick or thin" to maturity in 
order to value them for accounting purposes at the higher level, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank board's action requires an S&amp;L's board of directors to adopt an 
investment policy on securities and to monitor the institution's compliance 
with that strategy. Management, meanwhile, will be responsible for carrying out 
securities transactions that comply with the investment policies. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood said the rules would help federal regulators assess the financial 
status of S&amp;Ls and help thrift managers "have a better handle on their own 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the new rules could reduce S&amp;Ls' flexibility in deciding whether 
to sell off or hold on to securities. If securities were classified as a 
long-term investment, institutions wouldn't be able to switch course and "just 
get rid of (them) if they don't like (them)," he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market closed a trace higher Monday, barely reaching a new post-crash 
high as a rising dollar and surging Treasury bond prices shored up a market 
weakened by profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which surpassed the 2,500 level on 
Friday for the first time since Oct. 13, 1987, added 0.92 to 2,502.02. At one 
stage the average had been down about 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 833 up, 695 down and 486 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 185.01 million shares, down from 
242.41 million Friday, when the total was inflated by program trading linked to 
expiring options and stock index futures. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose sharply in world currency markets Monday. That prompted 
strength in the American credit markets. (Story, Part I, Page I.) 
</P>
<P>
That all was seen as positive for stocks. Falling rates mean less competition 
for stocks from interest-bearing securities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, analysts say, falling interest rates reduce the perceived chances 
that the economy will have to go through a recession. 
</P>
<P>
But brokers also noted that the market has come a long way in its rally since 
last November, when the Dow got as low as 2,038. They said some traders moved 
today to cash in on those gains. 
</P>
<P>
Avon Products led the active list and rose 2 3/8 to 34 5/8 on conjecture that 
the company, which recently fended off a takeover bid by Amway Corp., might 
become a target for other offers. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq Computer, which introduced a new high-power desktop personal computer, 
climbed 3 1/8 to 87 1/8. International Business Machines, faced with that 
competitive development, dropped 1 1/4 to 109 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
American Family fell 1 to 16. The company said it was looking for 
second-quarter operating earnings per share to be flat with the comparable 
period last year, and projected lower results for the full year than analysts 
had been estimating. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks also closed modestly higher on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in cautious 
trading despite the sharp decline of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. 
The Nikkei 225-share average, which jumped 144.65 points Friday, added another 
65.90 points to 34,067.86. 
</P>
<P>
On the London Stock Exchange Monday, share prices plunged amid heightened fears 
that European interest rates might have to rise to halt the dollar's surge. The 
Financial Times 100-share index finished 35.7 points, or 1.6%, lower at 
2,169.0. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
The surging dollar and an improved outlook for inflation propelled bond prices 
sharply higher and drove interest rates downward. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 13/16 point, or nearly $12 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield fell to 8.59%, the lowest closing yield 
since March, 1988, and was down from 8.70% on Friday. Bond prices and yields 
move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's surge helped spark a sharp drop in commodity prices, and that in 
turn increased bond traders' hopes that inflation would slow down and the 
economy would cool off, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
When the economy is slow, the Federal Reserve Board is less likely to tighten 
credit, which raises interest rates and sends bond prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Held, chief financial economist with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; 
Co., said money that had flowed out of bonds as interest rates rose was moving 
back into Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
"People are realizing the economy is slowing down," he said. "People are 
under-invested in bonds." 
</P>
<P>
Ward McCarthy, a managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates 
Inc., a money market research firm, said he expected bond prices to continue to 
move higher because "there's a lot of people who want to get on the bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
9.688%, up from 9.675% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures prices dropped sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade, 
reflecting investor reaction to wet weather forecasts and the relentless rise 
in the dollar's value. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, precious metals continued their slide, copper fell sharply, 
livestock and meat prices were mixed,and energy futures were off. 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean prices dropped, largely in reaction to weekend rains in farm 
regions and a National Weather Service forecast of normal or above-normal 
rainfall for six to 10 days beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver continued to slide on New York's Commodity Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"There nothing new to say about them," said William O'Neill, an analyst for 
Elders Futures Inc. in New York. "They remain under pressure from the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's increasing attractiveness has caused many investors to sell their 
positions in gold and silver. 
</P>
<P>
Gold was $2.90 to $5.40 lower, with June at $363.70 an ounce; silver was 12.3 
cents to 15.8 cents lower, with May at $5.106 an ounce.

YOUR BODY: EYEING NEW SUNGLASSES? CONSIDER THREE TYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunglass shoppers, take note: Labels on non-prescription sunglasses are getting 
more specific. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new voluntary labeling program developed by the Sunglass Assn. of 
America, in cooperation with the Food and Drug Administration, non-prescription 
sunglasses will be classified in three categories: cosmetic, meant for wearing 
during shopping and other activities in non-harsh sunlight; general purpose, 
recommended for outdoor activities such as driving or hiking; and special 
purpose, meant for wearing during skiing and other bright light activities. 
</P>
<P>
The categories will indicate that the glasses in each block differing amounts 
of visible light and ultraviolet A and B light. Excess exposure to ultraviolet 
B light has been linked with cataract formation, and, some believe, retinal 
degeneration. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean outdoor-loving shopaholics who drive and ski need three 
different pairs of sunglasses? 
</P>
<P>
Not at all, say some eye care specialists, who suspect the labeling change may 
be motivated as much by marketing reasons as medical concerns. 
</P>
<P>
When sunglass shopping, it is most important to pick a pair blocking as close 
to 100% of UVB light as possible, says Jay Schlanger, a Los Angeles 
optometrist. Under the new guidelines, sunglasses labeled cosmetic block 70% or 
more of UVB, while general purpose glasses block 95% or more and special 
purpose models block 99% or more. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to tint, grays and greens result in less color distortion, 
Schlanger added. 
</P>
<P>
The new labels reflect a consensus of standards, not a change in manufacturing, 
said Tom Loomis, technical director of the Sunglass Assn. of America. He said 
sunglass prices might increase slightly, but only temporarily, as a result of 
the new labeling. 
</P>
<P>
A 'Mini-Epidemic' 
</P>
<P>
An upper respiratory infection has been hitting Los Angeles area youngsters 
especially hard in recent weeks, according to several local pediatricians and 
the county health department. 
</P>
<P>
Caused by a Coxsackie virus, the disease is marked by blisters in the mouth and 
small red bumps on the soles and palms, said Dr. Loreta Matheo, a Santa Monica 
pediatrician. She's seen a recent "mini-epidemic" of the contagious but not 
serious disease, fielding at least a call a day from concerned parents. 
</P>
<P>
The disease most often strikes toddlers, is usually not seen in children older 
than 9, and is often accompanied by runny nose and diarrhea, Matheo said. There 
can be fever, ranging from low-grade to 103 degrees. Often spread by sneezing 
or sharing cups and bottles, the disease usually disappears by itself in three 
to five days, Matheo said. 
</P>
<P>
What to do? "Keep kids out of school until the blisters are gone," advised Dr. 
Laurene Mascola, acting chief of the acute communicable disease control unit of 
the Los Angeles Department of Health Services, who said she has gotten several 
calls about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Give children acetaminophen if they're uncomfortable and whatever liquids they 
want to drink," added Matheo. "Be scrupulous about hand washing and have family 
members use separate towels. If there's a marked decline in fluid intake or the 
fever seems out of control, call the doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Type A vs. Type B 
</P>
<P>
Women with hard-driving, competitive Type A personalities may climb the career 
ladder faster than their more laid-back Type B colleagues. But their marriages 
are not as happy. 
</P>
<P>
That's the conclusion of Marie Morell, a UCLA assistant professor of psychology 
who interviewed 42 married couples with her colleague, psychologist Megan 
Sullaway, to determine the consequences of behavior types on marriage 
satisfaction. "When the wife was Type A, both partners reported more marital 
problems, particularly with communication," said Morell, whose study was funded 
by the National Institutes of Health. These couples also complained that they 
spent too little time together, lacked problem-solving skills and were 
sometimes dissatisfied sexually. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting the most marital satisfaction in her study were Type B women married 
to Type A men and Type B women married to Type B men. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the study, Morell isn't suggesting that only certain personality types 
mate. Her advice: "Recognize the needs of the individual." She speculates that 
men married to Type A women were dissatisfied partly because their wives did 
not always have enough time to provide emotional support. 
</P>
<P>
Men should develop broader social support networks in addition to relying on 
their wives for emotional support, Morell suggested. A lot of the 
dissatisfaction arose from husbands who relied primarily on their wives for 
emotional support, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion of a social support network might be a good idea for men, agreed 
Marcia Lasswell, USC clinical professor of marriage and family therapy and 
professor of psychology at Cal Poly Pomona. "But a quicker route to marital 
satisfaction might be for busy Type A's to schedule in some time, regularly, 
for nurturing the relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Morell acknowledges her study may have built-in bias because it included many 
more Type A's -- both men and women -- than Type B's. Once they signed up for 
her study, Type A's -- sometimes called compulsive -- were very likely to 
follow through. Not so the Type B's. "We tried to get a sample more equally 
divided," she said. But many Type B's who signed up were no-shows.

ART BUCHWALD: LITIGATING THE QUARRELS OF YOUNG LOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was in all the papers. A young woman in Palm Beach, Fla., named Tomontra 
Mangrum was stood up by her 17-year-old date who had promised to take her to 
the high-school prom. Tomontra did what any jilted young woman would do -- she 
filed a lawsuit to recoup the cost of her new shoes, her hairdo plus the 
flowers for her hair. 
</P>
<P>
Wait, there is more. . . . The defendant, Marlon Shadd, says that he had 
fractured his ankle and had informed Miss Mangrum a week before that he would 
not be able to take her to the dance. 
</P>
<P>
It must be obvious to anyone reading this that the only way this dispute can be 
resolved is to turn it over to the lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Something about this story was familiar. My mind went back to my youth when the 
situation was very different from the one we have now. Those were the Roosevelt 
years when many more men than women were stood up. I can remember at least 10 
-- no, make it 12 -- occasions when I arrived at a young woman's door only to 
be informed by her father that she had already left for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, corsages did not grow on trees -- nor did tickets to the 
Paramount Theater on Broadway. We're talking about five bucks for the entire 
package, but they were 1940 dollars, worth about $100,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, no matter how cruel the rejection, the last thing I would have done in 
that distant time and place would have been to sue the girl who wasn't there. 
The fact is I respected her for seeing through me, and for giving me a lower 
opinion of myself than I had ever had before. 
</P>
<P>
It just wasn't in for teen-agers to seek out a lawyer's help to resolve our 
lovers' quarrels. Most of us didn't even know a lawyer, which is more than can 
be said for the affluent kids of today, who usually have one attorney living on 
either side of them. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of taking our cases to court, we suffered -- sometimes for weeks and, 
if it was serious enough, even a month. We wove fantasies in which we went off 
to join the Navy, came back in uniform and then refused to dance with the girl 
who had broken our heart. We never wanted monetary satisfaction -- we only 
wanted the one who had wronged us to weep tears and beg forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who grew up in the '40s, '50s and even '60s did not wish for a 
black-robed judge to mete out justice against the person who had stood us up. 
We dealt with our sorrow alone. 
</P>
<P>
So back to Miss Mangrum who, I am sure, is quite lovely. Yet, according to 
Marlon, she suffers from a communication problem. The reason that her suit has 
today's parents unnerved is that young people are breaking dates all the time, 
and if they're going to be dragged into court for it, they'll never get their 
homework done. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the newspapers, I read that Marlon's mother offered to compensate 
Tomontra for her expenses, but Tomontra's mother refused, saying that Marlon 
had to be taught a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of lesson could Marlon possibly be taught, you may be wondering? He 
claims that he gave Tomontra notice and therefore he is not responsible for 
Miss Mangrum being left standing in the hall in her prom dress. I know that 
there are many people who say Tomontra has no case, but that's the kind lawyers 
like best. 
</P>
<P>
All over America teen-agers are awaiting the outcome. The price of suing may be 
very high. The terrible thing is that if Miss Mangrum wins the $50, she will 
never know if the boys who ask her out are inviting her for herself or because 
of her money.

DEBUNKING THE 'FAIRY TALES' OF SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Science a la Mode: Physical Fashions and Fictions by Tony Rothman (Princeton 
University Press: $19.95; 207 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Science is based on the assumption that there is an objective truth in the 
world out there that scientists can get closer and closer to through 
experiment, observation and thought. Scientific truths are therefore not like 
hemlines, which go up and down with the season and whose truth is socially 
constructed, a matter of consensus. 
</P>
<P>
The "objective truth" model is an ideal, and we feel it in our bones, but no 
one can prove whether it is accurate or not. There is also an irreducible 
element of referendum to truth. In some sense, what's true is what everybody 
believes to be true. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Rothman, a physicist and science writer, doesn't care much for the 
referendum aspects of truth. For one thing, he says, too often scientists jump 
on popular bandwagons and accept things as true when they should know better. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman calls himself "a debunker of fairy tales," and in his book, "Science a 
la Mode," he sets out to debunk six popular "fairy tales" of contemporary 
science. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope after reading the book you will hesitate before hopping on the next 
bandwagon that rolls by," he tells us in the preface. "You will in all 
likelihood not be able to stop it. But at least you can gaze mournfully into 
the distance as the cymbals and trumpets fade." 
</P>
<P>
Having read those words, and being something of a congenital iconoclast myself, 
I was all ready for the book, in which Rothman takes on some standard 
scientific stories from cosmology to nuclear winter to the duel in 1832 in 
which the mathematician Evariste Galois was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, he bumps up against some of the oldest questions in the philosophy 
of knowledge, namely, how do we know what we know? and how do we know when 
something is proved? 
</P>
<P>
Rothman starts off with cosmology, our picture of the universe and how it got 
started. Virtually every physicist today believes in the Big Bang theory, which 
asserts that everything in the universe and time itself got going in one 
gargantuan explosion between 10 and 20 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, no experiments can possibly be performed on events that happened 
long in the past, so theorists must base their ideas on examining the detritus 
of that explosion, which is the stuff all around us and out in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman says that this is like examining tea leaves, and he suggests that there 
are other possible explanations for the observable data that lead to different 
theories. 
</P>
<P>
"A scientific approach to cosmology must be based on a consideration of all the 
alternatives," he says, "not just the one family of models that happens to be 
the simplest to consider." 
</P>
<P>
This argument is true, but it is weak. There are always alternate explanations 
for things. But just because they are possible doesn't make them likely. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman argues that while the Big Bang theory has several appealing strengths, 
it also has some disturbing weaknesses. "The most serious difficulty," he 
writes, "is the existence of a singularity at the instant of the Big Bang, that 
is, a time when the pressure, density, and temperature all become infinite and 
the known laws of physics break down completely." 
</P>
<P>
Here we come to the philosophical heart of Rothman's book. Virtually every 
theory in science and in life has gaps. Very little that is not trivial 
explains all the data. 
</P>
<P>
There are two possible responses to the gaps. One is to assert that knowledge 
is always incomplete and in time the gaps will be filled in. The other is to 
assert that the gaps prove that the theory is hopelessly flawed. 
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Big Bang theory, virtually every physicist adopts the first 
view. Rothman adopts the second. In this debate, as in most others, neither 
side can deliver a knockout blow to the other side. Neither side can prove that 
it is right. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman's discussion of nuclear winter takes a different form altogether. 
Nuclear winter, you may recall, is the theory that an atomic war would fill the 
atmosphere with soot and ash, cutting off sunlight, causing temperatures to 
drop and killing most life that had survived the nuclear exchange. This theory 
was widely discussed a few years ago, though not much has been heard about it 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman asserts that the scenario was suspect and scientifically unprovable in 
the first place but that many scientists withheld their criticisms for 
political reasons. They wanted to use nuclear winter to increase the public's 
anti-war sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not clear to me at what point a scientific theory should become the 
basis of a political issue," he says, "but my instincts tell me that the 
science should be established first, the politics second." 
</P>
<P>
This is a very different criticism from his discussion of the Big Bang theory. 
This verges on deliberate deception rather than mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman uses both examples to argue his point that scientific truths should be 
treated skeptically. But he does not give sufficient attention to the 
possibility that most scientists believe scientific truths not because they're 
popular but because they're right.

A bomb expert for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command, a group suspected in the downing of Pan Am Flight 103, was freed 15 
days after his arrest in West Germany because he worked for Bonn's intelligence 
service, Stern magazine reported. Marwan Khreesat, 44, was among 16 suspected 
Palestinian terrorists arrested in raids in October but was released in 
November and returned to his native Jordan. "Five weeks later, a radio bomb of 
the type that Khreesat had built . . . blew up in the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie 
(Scotland)," Stern said. The bombing killed 270 people. The magazine said 
Khreesat worked for the West German BND intelligence agency, but an agency 
spokesman denied the report.

The vast majority of Americans would accept mandatory trash recycling, higher 
electric bills and other inconveniences to help clean up the environment, a 
national poll has found. Broad perceptions exist that pollution is on the rise. 
The Media General and Associated Press survey also found backing for 
initiatives ranging from a ban on household aerosol products to strict power 
plant emission controls.

A deal allowing a private ski resort in Vermont to cross the Appalachian Trail 
was improperly struck, three environmental groups charged in a lawsuit. The 
National Park Service in January approved an easement to let the Killington Ski 
Area cut trees from a 200-foot corridor across a 1.2-mile stretch of the trail 
and cross it twice with ski runs. The park service also waived its right to 
review future development by the resort at Mendon, the Appalachian Trail 
Conference, Sierra Club and Vermont Natural Resources Council said in the U.S. 
District Court suit.

Belgium lodged a strong protest with Romania after a Belgian political leader 
said he and a colleague were beaten by Romanian police when they tried to visit 
dissident writer Doina Cornea last week. Gerard Deprez, chairman of the Social 
Christian Party, said he and Christian Leonard, the party's former press 
attache, were punched by police when they approached Cornea's home in the 
Romanian town of Cluj. Leonard, who suffered a black eye, was almost run over 
when a police officer tripped him and pushed him toward a passing car as the 
two men tried to flee, Deprez told reporters in Brussels.

Fear over the possibility of an environmentally devastating oil spill was the 
major concern raised by those addressing a meeting in Carlsbad of a 
presidential task force reviewing proposed offshore oil lease sales. "They do 
not want another catastrophe like the one in Alaska," said the panel's 
executive director, Robert Kallman, referring to the disaster in Alaska's 
Prince William Sound. The workshop, in which the task force was hearing from 11 
local elected officials during the afternoon and members of the public during 
the evening, was the first of six in California between now and July. President 
Bush formed the task force in February, saying proposed lease sales off the 
California and Florida coasts raised "troublesome questions."

The Florida Supreme Court refused to allow enforcement of a new state law 
requiring minors to get parental or judicial consent for abortions, but moved 
up a hearing on the law's validity. The decision means that single women under 
18 throughout Florida will be able to get abortions without consent of parents 
or judges, at least until the high court rules following oral arguments June 
27, a lawyer for the state said. The justices last week had decided to hear a 
case involving a 15-year-old girl in September, but agreed to expedite the case 
at the request of Florida Atty. Gen. Bob Butterworth's office. The state 
repeated a request to allow enforcement of the law until the Supreme Court 
rules on its validity, but the justices denied that motion. The state's 5th 
District Court of Appeal, ruling in the case of the 15-year-old, struck down 
the abortion consent law as unconstitutional. The case last week went from the 
Florida high court, which denied a stay of the 5th District ruling, to the U.S. 
Supreme Court, which also declined to order enforcement of the law.

AIDS VIRUS FOUND IN 1 IN 500 AT COLLEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first large study to determine the rate of AIDS infection on college 
campuses found that about one in every 500 students was infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus, health officials reported. If the results of the 
anonymous blood-testing survey on 19 campuses reflect the situation at colleges 
around the country, about 25,000 of the country's 12.5 million college students 
are infected with the virus, said Richard P. Keeling, director of student 
health services at the University of Virginia and president of the American 
College Health Assn. The overall rate of infection, 0.20%, is slightly higher 
than the 0.14% infection rate reported for military recruits and is comparable 
to rates found by the Centers for Disease Control in hospitalized patients and 
in pregnant women giving birth, a CDC official said.

A top Communist Party official with links to two controversial criminal 
investigators has been cleared of bribery charges because of a lack of evidence 
and released from custody, the Tass news agency said. Viktor I. Smirnov, former 
second-ranking party official in the Moldavian republic, was charged Jan. 11 
with taking bribes. Tass said prosecutors "apologized to Smirnov for the 
serious violations of socialist legality with regard to him on the part of 
officials from the prosecutor's office."

SCOTT OSTLER: WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN MVP?; 
</P>
<P>
MAGIC: WITH HIM, L.A. IS A FABULOUS PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

There is a list, although I've never actually seen it, that is circulated 
throughout the Western Hemisphere and updated periodically. It is a list of 
"Reasons to Hate the Lakers." 
</P>
<P>
It includes such items as: 
</P>
<P>
No. 7,483. Turbowash. 
</P>
<P>
According to a regular Forum PA announcement, Turbowash is "the official 
washing tool of the Los Angeles Lakers." You think that doesn't create waves of 
jealousy around the National Basketball Assn.? I hear the Pistons don't have 
even have an official washing tool, that after games they have to take regular 
showers. 
</P>
<P>
No. 279. Bank sponsorship of the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Most other NBA teams play in dismal buildings. Boston Garden, you wouldn't send 
your cockroaches there for summer camp. The Lakers already have a very nice 
building, and now a bank comes along and gives Jerry Buss lots more money to 
make it even nicer. In exchange, the bank is entitled to stencil its logo on 
everything at the Forum that doesn't move, including the people in line at the 
pizza counter. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1,066. Jack. 
</P>
<P>
Sure we in Los Angeles love the big leering lug, but in rival NBA cities, fans 
are sick of Nicholson's sinister courtside visage, and are praying that the 
rumors are true and that he really is the new Clipper coach. 
</P>
<P>
Today there is a new entry, coming onto the list at No. 1 with a bullet: 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, MVP. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, there actually are people who don't think Magic Johnson is 
deserving of the MVP trophy, that it should have gone to Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The people who hold this belief are mostly Easterners, transplanted Easterners 
or other kinds of religious fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
This pettiness-born-of-envy-and-ignorance puts me in the awkward position today 
of having to take sides against the very player after whom I pattern my own 
game. On the playgrounds, I actually am referred to as Air Ostler, although not 
so much for soaring through it as gasping for it. 
</P>
<P>
No, there will be no cheap shots taken at the Sultan of CO2 today, not in this 
column. You probe for weaknesses in Michael Jordan's game and his character and 
the best you can come up with is that his shoes are overpriced and not 
Turbowash-proof. 
</P>
<P>
Let's forget about Jordan for a moment and concentrate on the MVP himself. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit A: Last Saturday the Lakers opened the Western Conference finals 
against the Phoenix Suns. With 2:22 remaining in the game and the Lakers 
leading by seven points, Magic fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers held on and won the game by eight points. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, you would have thought the Lakers had saved the Alamo by fighting 
off the forces of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna while armed only with 
Turbowash tools. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley praised his players, and the players praised themselves, 
for being able to protect a seven-point lead, against a much less experienced 
opponent, on the home boards of the All's Quiet on the Western Forum, or 
whatever it's called. I bring this up only because it illustrates how much 
Johnson means to the Lakers, how much his teammates rely on him. 
</P>
<P>
To say that the Bulls need Jordan more than the Lakers need Magic is simply 
erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
When Magic came to Los Angeles 11 years ago the Lakers were a struggling team, 
their great center on the verge of retirement. When Magic leaves the Lakers in 
a few years they will again be a struggling team, their same great center on 
the verge of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
This particular season was marked by experts as the beginning of the inevitable 
Laker fade-out. The main reason that fade-out has yet to begin is that Magic 
lost about 10 pounds of ugly fat, swore off nachos, shaved off his goatee and 
rededicated himself to the game. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to discount the efforts of James Worthy and A. C. Green and other 
equally fiery-eyed Lakers. But we're talking about the most influential guard 
of all time here. 
</P>
<P>
Look at it this way: Air is impossible to guard. Magic is impossible to beat. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Michael Jordan would have a better chance of reaching the NBA finals if he 
had James Worthy up front instead of Horace Grant, and Magic's act would be 
less spectacular if he couldn't kick the ball out to Byron Scott. But you're 
rated on how you work with the materials you're given. Da Vinci didn't get 
graded down as an artist because Mona Lisa had a nice smile. 
</P>
<P>
But why am I bothering to argue with the Jordan-is-MVP faction, which includes 
my esteemed colleague, Hot Air Downey? 
</P>
<P>
Voting for a basketball MVP is an affair of the heart. Debating the issue is 
like arguing over sunsets. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone loves Air Jordan, as is only right, but anyone who can't see that 
Magic is the MVP should have his or her contact lenses Turbowashed.

All I ask is that you ask yourself one question. That's all. Just one question. 
Answer it honestly. After that, if your opinion still differs from mine, OK, so 
be it. You're entitled. 
</P>
<P>
Please, though, do that much for me. 
</P>
<P>
Ask yourself this: 
</P>
<P>
How many basketball games would the Lakers have won without Magic Johnson, and 
how many games would the Chicago Bulls have won without Michael Jordan? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's two questions. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, ask. 
</P>
<P>
I'll pretend this is Final Jeopardy and hum some theme music while I wait for 
you to think it over. 
</P>
<P>
Da da da da, dum dum dum. Da da da da DUM, da da da da da. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, time's up. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is: 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers would have won about two-thirds as many games without Magic Johnson, 
but the Bulls would have won about two games without Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Agreed? 
</P>
<P>
Swell. 
</P>
<P>
So, let's think about this announcement made Monday, the news that Mr. Johnson, 
not Mr. Jordan, is the most valuable player in professional basketball for 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
I have two words in response. Two simple words. 
</P>
<P>
Come on. 
</P>
<P>
Look, nobody loves Magic (Earvin) Johnson more than I do. The guy might be my 
favorite human being in pro sports. He is a winner, a champion, a marvel, a 
miracle, a sweetheart of a person. I don't just like watching him play, I'd 
like to adopt him. 
</P>
<P>
But take a message from Michael: 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's the real MVP. 
</P>
<P>
He outscores Johnson, probably because he can and definitely because he has to. 
He makes the National Basketball Assn.'s all-defensive team. He also rebounds 
and passes, not better than Johnson, but better than most. He brings the ball 
down, breaks the press, shoots the shot, crashes the boards, drops back to 
guard the other team's best guy. And he leads the league in minutes played. 
</P>
<P>
Defenses swarm Michael Jordan wherever he goes. Do other teams double-cover 
Magic Johnson whenever possible? Of course not. They can't afford to. The rest 
of the Lakers are too good. 
</P>
<P>
You think the Bulls would be any good without Jordan? 
</P>
<P>
Spare me. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bulls without Michael Jordan would be Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
Here's Coach Chuck Daly of the Detroit Pistons, whose team currently is under 
siege by Jordan in the NBA's Eastern Conference finals: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared to death just watching him. He's a frightening player. He's one of 
those players who comes along once in a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Here's Joe Dumars of Detroit, whose job is guarding Jordan: 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm going to work hard. So will the rest of the team. But with Jordan, 
sometimes it just doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
Here's Mark Jackson of the New York Knicks, who recently tried and failed: 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't imagine any way of stopping him for a full game. We tried, we 
tried hard -- but he's Michael." 
</P>
<P>
Good explanation. 
</P>
<P>
He's Michael. 
</P>
<P>
If only somebody would say that about me. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson is a VP. He's a very VP. He's an extremely VP. But he wasn't the 
most VP. Not this season. 
</P>
<P>
Valuable. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Chambers was more valuable to the Phoenix Suns than Magic Johnson was to 
the Lakers. The Suns never could have turned that 28-54 record upside down 
without Chambers. You think Phoenix would have even made the playoffs without 
Chambers? Doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
Now, look at the Bulls. These guys have bounced Cleveland. They have bounced 
New York. They are tormenting Detroit, taking a 1-0 advantage into tonight's 
Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bulls could -- holy cow, Harry Caray -- meet the Lakers for the NBA 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
You think the Lakers couldn't beat the Bulls in the NBA finals if they had to 
play without Magic Johnson, if Magic got hurt the day before the series began? 
</P>
<P>
The hell they couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
You think the Bulls could beat the Lakers in the NBA finals if they had to play 
without Michael Jordan, if Michael got hurt the day before the series began? 
</P>
<P>
They'd lose every game, 100-50. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan is more valuable than the NBA's most valuable player.

NFL MAY HAVE ITS MAN, AND NOT KNOW IT

For better or worse, the National Football League committee searching for the 
next Pete Rozelle hopes to find him tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Only it won't know -- for sure -- that he's the one. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage, the next commissioner will merely be classed with eight or 10 
other finalists, Wellington Mara, co-chairman of the search committee, said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get the final group down (from nearly 50 candidates) when the committee 
meets (tonight) in New Orleans," said Mara, president of the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going into this meeting with fewer than 10 names. And we expect that 
there will be fewer than 10 (others) submitted by the professional search firm 
that's working with us. 
</P>
<P>
"There won't be any new candidates after (today). 
</P>
<P>
"I can't get into names or exact numbers, but we've asked the search firm 
(Heidrick and Struggles) to evaluate them all. Next, after we choose the 
(finalists), the search firm and perhaps some (NFL people) will interview them 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the committee will make one or two or three recommendations to the clubs 
at a special election meeting. If we stay on target, the election will be next 
month." 
</P>
<P>
The search committee members have agreed to mention no names but other NFL 
people say former Congressman Jack Kemp is still the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
"Kemp is the one candidate who would have a chance to get quick approval," one 
source said. "Kemp has no enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"But he personalizes the dilemma facing the owners. On the one hand, you've got 
to have something on the ball to get as far as he has -- powerful congressman, 
(Republican) candidate for president, secretary of housing and urban 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, what do we really know about Jack Kemp? You don't know 
anybody until you know them -- you personally see how quick they are. 
</P>
<P>
"The league is totally flying in the dark in this. I don't care how careful you 
are, you could make a whale of a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
The only in-house candidate seems to be Jim Finks, the general manager of the 
New Orleans Saints, and at 62, Finks is Rozelle's age. 
</P>
<P>
The only other candidate with NFL connections is Washington lawyer Paul 
Tagliabue, who often represents the league. 
</P>
<P>
There is a possibility that more than one man will be chosen, as 
co-commissioner or a commissioner and one or two deputy commissioners, because 
there is a consensus in the league that the job has become too much for one 
man. 
</P>
<P>
Other business to be considered will include the new 80-player roster limit and 
the direction of the NFL's new international league. 
</P>
<P>
More than half the clubs are concerned about the roster limit, which they say 
should be lifted to a more realistic 85 or more. An effort will be made to 
raise it. 
</P>
<P>
The Worldwide American Football League, as the new league is being called by 
Commissioner Tex Schramm, has caused a bit of a split. Some NFL club owners 
want the WAFL to be an NFL subsidiary. Others want WAFL investors to be 
individual NFL club owners, not the NFL itself.

STANLEY CUP;

<P>
VERNON'S DEFENSE GIVES CALGARY BIG ADVANTAGE

<P>
After winning an important game over the Montreal Canadiens Sunday night to tie 
the Stanley Cup final series at two games each, Calgary goalie Mike Vernon 
addressed the frustration he and his team have with their reputation for being 
unable to win the big games. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a new subject for him. In fact, Vernon might even be forgiven for 
slashing, with a big, fat goalie's stick, at anyone who makes him go over it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not his way. It's his way to stand in there and deflect each shot as 
it comes. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon has won at least 30 games for the last three seasons. No other National 
Hockey League goalie has done that. But along the way the Flames have spent 
seasons at the top of the league, only to fall short in the playoffs. The 
goalie is the key in the playoffs, so a good goalie should get his team the 
Stanley Cup, right? 
</P>
<P>
There is only one cure, of course. Win the thing and have done with it. 
</P>
<P>
And now, the Flames are two victories away from stopping all this nonsense. 
They are playing on their home ice at the Saddledome tonight and returning to 
Montreal for Game 6 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If they haven't won the Cup by then -- or if the Canadiens haven't won it by 
then -- the Flames will be back home at the Saddledome for the final game 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
They have never been in such an advantageous position. 
</P>
<P>
But in this series, the teams have been so even that a seventh game seems 
inevitable. Consider the first four games -- Calgary, 3-2; Montreal, 4-2; 
Montreal, 4-3, in double overtime; Calgary, 4-2. That's 12 goals each. 
</P>
<P>
And Vernon is measuring up just as well in comparisons with Montreal's young 
star in goal, Patrick Roy. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal's Brian Skrudland said: "I think this series has been what everybody 
expected it to be so far. The goaltending has been outstanding, both teams are 
playing great defense and that shows on the power play." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are being asked why their power plays aren't scoring more. The 
answer is the goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
In his raving after Sunday's victory, Calgary Coach Terry Crisp called a save 
that Vernon made on a shot by Mats Naslund not only the turning point of Game 4 
but, quite possibly, the turning point of the series. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon was asked if that save pushed from his mind the nasty picture of Naslund 
scoring the tying goal on him with 41 seconds to play in regulation in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon considered that for a long moment. He smiled and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think one game wipes out another," he said. "We had dominated in Game 
3. We dominated the first three periods and then lost it. From my standpoint, 
they had 17 shots in three periods, and we had them. And we let them tie it up 
with 40 seconds left. We knew we lost that game. 
</P>
<P>
"But the guys kept their composure. This is a more mature hockey club than we 
had in '86. We knew what Game 4 meant. It could put us out of it, or give it to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
And now, the Flames have the edge again. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to this game is to get a goal lead or two," Crisp said. "Mike Vernon 
played very solid in net. And so did Patrick Roy. But the Canadiens are the 
type of team that doesn't need a lot of scoring chances. They probably have had 
the fewest opportunities of all the teams we've played in the playoffs. But, 
percentage-wise, they have the most goals. They don't need that many 
opportunities to score." 
</P>
<P>
As Montreal Coach Pat Burns said earlier, the Canadiens don't waste shots. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, the magnitude of the saves -- and the pressure. This has been quite a 
defensive series with a lot of emphasis on the goalies. 
</P>
<P>
One of these days, Vernon is going to have to be noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary General Manager Cliff Fletcher was telling the Toronto Globe and Mail 
the other day: "The only difference between Mike Vernon and other top goalies 
is color. Ron Hextall has notoriety for his stick and Patrick Roy has notoriety 
for his twitch. Others have colorful masks. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike just has a plain mask. He doesn't have that notoriety. He just stops 
pucks."

Attorneys for basketball Coach Jerry Tarkanian of Nevada Las Vegas have asked 
the Nevada Supreme Court to uphold a 12-year-old injunction that bars UNLV from 
suspending Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. asked earlier this month that the state 
high court order the District Court to vacate the injunction, which has 
prohibited UNLV from suspending Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian claimed that his rights to due process were violated when he was 
ordered suspended from coaching for alleged recruiting violations in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA won a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in December that it did not have to 
provide coaches due process.

For the first time since Fidel Castro took over Cuba in 1959 and sparked an 
anti-communist exodus to Miami, a Cuban national sports team will compete in 
South Florida.

Organizers of the Junior World Weightlifting Championships, which begin

The Rams announced the retirements of veteran linebacker Carl Ekern and 
fullback Mike Guman. Each spent his entire pro career with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern played for 13 years and started at inside linebacker since 1981. He led 
the team in tackles three times and was named to the Pro Bowl in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Guman gained 1,286 yards and scored 15 touchdowns in his nine-year career with 
the Rams during which time he became a valuable and versatile player. 
</P>
<P>
Guman spent most of last season on injured reserve with a knee injury, although 
he appeared in the Rams' regular-season finale against San Francisco.

ANOTHER TITLE ISN'T IN CARDS AS STANFORD LEFT OUT IN THE COLD

Stanford, two-time defending national champion, was not included in the 48-team 
Division I field for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball tournament 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Included are USC, Pepperdine, Cal State Long Beach and Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Eight six-team regionals will begin Thursday and Friday, the winners of the 
three-day, double-elimination tournaments advancing to the College World 
Series, June 2-10 in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
USC (41-23), 11-time national champion, is seeded third in the Midwest Regional 
beginning Friday at Austin, Tex. The Trojans, third in the Pacific 10 Southern 
Division, open against Western Michigan (38-13-2), in a regional that also 
includes Texas, Oklahoma State, New Orleans and Sam Houston State. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine (41-17-1), West Coast Athletic Conference champion, is seeded fourth 
in the West II Regional at Fresno. The Waves open Friday against Michigan 
(47-14) in a regional that includes Wichita State, Fresno State, Portland and 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (46-13), co-champion of the Big West Conference and seeded third in 
the West I Regional Friday at Tucson, Ariz., opens against Hawaii (40-25). 
Loyola (37-22), WCAC runner-up, plays Oklahoma (43-17). The regional also 
includes Arizona and Eastern Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the last two years, when it selected four teams from the Pac-10 Southern 
Division, the selection committee bypassed Stanford, which will miss a regional 
for the first time since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (30-28) was 12-18 in conference play and 27-28 against Division I 
opponents. The Cardinal, however, won nine of its last 10 and played 46 of its 
58 games against teams that were ranked in the top 30 at some point in the 
season, including 32 against teams that were in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State, five-time national champion with a 40-17 record, has not 
traveled to a regional in 25 years, but is seeded second in the Northeast 
Regional at Waterbury, Conn. The Sun Devils will play George Washington (30-22) 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame won four games in 22 hours 9 minutes last Saturday to win the 
Midwestern Collegiate Conference tournament at South Bend, Ind., qualifying for 
the NCAA tournament for the first time in 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
The victory run began at 1:38 a.m. and included wins over Dayton (20-4), 
Evansville (11-2) and a doubleheader sweep (4-1 and 21-10) of the University of 
Detroit that ended at 11:47 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Dayton game ended at 4:21 a.m. with about 200 fans -- culled by radio 
announcements and campus word-of-mouth -- in the bleachers. The Irish were back 
in uniform at 2:30 for the game with Evansville. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish, who beat Butler in the conference tournament opener last Wednesday, 
needed to win five straight games after losing to Detroit in 10 innings on 
Thursday. Friday night, they beat St. Louis, 10-6, before a 4 1/2-hour rain 
delay postponed the scheduled start of their game against Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (47-17-1) meets ninth-ranked Fresno State (42-17) in the West II 
Regional Friday at Fresno.

EX-COLONIES GIVE PORTUGAL THE BLAME

LUANDA, Angola 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The taps are dry for days, weeks, even months in large parts of this seaside 
capital. Once running water disappears, whether in the poorest or the 
wealthiest neighborhood, it is usually gone for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Angolans do not blame this on the water department or on the country's lack of 
trained plumbers, or even on a decade-long shortage of spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
They blame it on Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Did They Take the Maps? 
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed here that the Portuguese took all the maps of the 
underground waterpipe network when they left at the time of Angolan 
independence in 1975. Those maps are now in Lisbon, the story goes, and will 
not be returned until the government hires a Portuguese company to repair the 
pipes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably true," a Swiss relief worker here said, only half-joking. 
</P>
<P>
In Mozambique, another of Portugal's former African territories, the gray 
concrete truss of an unfinished high-rise hotel stands as an everyday reminder 
of colonialism. Fourteen years ago, the departing Portuguese poured concrete 
down the elevator shafts, and that made it too expensive to go ahead with the 
beachfront project -- and too expensive to tear it down. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the colonizers of Africa, tiny Portugal held onto its five provinces the 
longest, deeply implanting its language and culture. But when independence 
came, the Portuguese settlers, unlike the British and French in Africa, fled en 
masse, leaving foundering economies and earning Portugal the reputation as the 
worst colonizer on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Many thousands of Portuguese ended up in South Africa, where they toast the 
good old days and argue that they have been maligned by the history books. 
Recently, some have been watching changing attitudes in the once rigidly 
Marxist governments of Angola and Mozambique, thinking that maybe one day they 
will be able to return home. 
</P>
<P>
"People say the trouble was caused by the Portuguese running away," said Jose 
da Silva Ramalho, a former Mozambique resident who edits South Africa's 
Portuguese-language newspaper, O Seculo. "We didn't run away. We were kicked 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Angola and Mozambique are still among the least-developed nations in Africa. In 
fact, living standards have improved in only one Portuguese-speaking African 
nation, the archipelago of Cape Verde, with a population of 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
A perpetual shortage of even semi-skilled workers forces Angola to continue 
relying on foreigners, as it did in colonial times. For example, a European 
worker was on his knees in the Hotel Turismo lobby on a recent Saturday 
morning, repairing a loose tile in a country with more than 50% unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changing Approach 
</P>
<P>
But Angola's leaders have lately replaced Marxist rhetoric with free-market 
solutions to their economic woes. And they hope that the U.S.-brokered peace 
accord with South Africa and Cuba will remove the political barriers to trade 
with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Mozambique also has recently embraced a pragmatic approach to its problems, 
looking to the United States and Europe as well as its Soviet ally for help. It 
has improved relations with Pretoria in recent months, and trade between the 
two neighbors has picked up for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
Although few, if any, Portuguese have resettled in Angola or Mozambique, some 
Portuguese have returned temporarily as advisers, and Portugal's relations with 
its former colonies, while not especially warm, have improved. 
</P>
<P>
"You no longer have the feeling that the Portuguese are hated here," a European 
diplomat in Luanda said recently. "But they're not loved, either." 
</P>
<P>
With many Portuguese, the feeling is mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"If people were allowed to return, they would die of a heart attack because of 
what is left today," said Mozambican-born Giorgio Pagan, now a wealthy South 
African liquor dealer. "I'd go back for business, but no longer for love. That 
love is lost." 
</P>
<P>
Angola's capital, Luanda, on the Atlantic Ocean, and Mozambique's capital, 
Maputo, on the Indian Ocean, were the pearls of Portugal's African empire, 
which was founded by seafarers on their way around the Cape of Good Hope. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Continental Image 
</P>
<P>
Portugal made those capitals in its continental image, with palm-lined 
esplanades, stucco buildings with verandas, late-night coffee shops. Luanda, on 
a crescent of gentle coastal hills, came to be known as the Rio de Janeiro of 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 Portuguese lived in Angola and 250,000 in Mozambique at the 
time of independence, and for generations they had raised their children and 
buried their parents there, with no thought of leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the farmers and college-educated professionals who settled Africa's 
British and French colonies, the Portuguese were taxi drivers and bricklayers 
as well as engineers and architects. And long after the other European powers 
had relinquished their colonies in the 1960s, Portugal refused to loosen its 
grip on Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau and the dual-island 
territory of Sao Tome and Principe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Settlers Were Shocked 
</P>
<P>
But in 1975, when a coup in Lisbon opened the way for independence, the Marxist 
liberation groups in Angola and Mozambique shocked the Portuguese settlers by 
nationalizing industries, confiscating firearms and closing the private 
practices of physicians and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Portuguese left almost overnight, sometimes taking or destroying 
equipment. Soon the elevators stopped working, the factories shut down, the 
farmers' markets collapsed -- and civil wars broke out. 
</P>
<P>
Some returned to Portugal, but 100,000 from Mozambique and a smaller number 
from Angola ended up in South Africa, where they have replanted their 
settlements in the last vestige of white rule on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
600,000 in South Africa 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Lisbon, which now has 28 branches in South Africa, estimates that 
South Africa has as many as 600,000 Portuguese or Portuguese descendants -- one 
of every seven whites in the country. There is a Portuguese newspaper and radio 
station, and a new Portuguese cable TV channel went on the air this month. Last 
year, a South African woman was crowned Miss Portugal in Lisbon. 
</P>
<P>
About half the Portuguese in South Africa are farmers and greengrocers from 
Madeira who have been around for years. The white flight from the colonies 
brought blue-collar workers as well as bankers, teachers, doctors, lawyers and 
businessmen. 
</P>

Few of the Portuguese take part in politics in South Africa, where they are 
classified white under apartheid laws, and many have never applied for South 
African citizenship. But their average income is $300 a month higher than the 
average white South African's. They control more than half the cigarette sales 
in the country, operate the largest wine-importing business and produce 80% of 
the vegetables sold at the Johannesburg market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Recalled Fondly 
</P>
<P>
But the homes and factories and futures that were abandoned in Mozambique and 
Angola are never far from their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"Life in Mozambique was a paradise," said Dr. Jose Carlos Garcez, 41, who is 
typical of the Portuguese who left his birthplace of Mozambique to settle in 
South Africa. "There was good food. Good housing. Beautiful beaches. You could 
hunt, you could fish. We never imagined a future anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Garcez and his young wife, Maria, then medical school students, would browse 
the bookshops and listen to music in the cafes of Lourenco Marques, now called 
Maputo. Sometimes they would pass the Hotel Polana parking lot to gaze at the 
shiny Jaguars driven by South Africa's well-heeled tourists. 
</P>
<P>
When Mozambique became independent, Garcez had finished his hospital residency 
and was preparing to go into private practice. But faced with the prospect of 
feeding a wife and two children, aged 2 and 3, on the $100 a month that the 
government said it would pay him, Garcez opted for South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought socialism was something that had to happen," Garcez said. "But I 
didn't think it should happen overnight. They said, 'Listen, you have to 
sacrifice.' I was not prepared to sacrifice that much." 
</P>
<P>
At first, life in South Africa was a struggle. The Garcezes spoke only a few 
words of English and had to learn by reading newspapers with a dictionary. And 
they missed Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
They went a few times to parties of the Asociacao de Antigos Residentes de 
Mocambique, an association of former residents of Mozambique, where the 
saudosistas -- the homesick ones -- gathered. The association still meets to 
raise glasses of vinho verde on July 25, the day the old colonial villa of 
Lourenco Marques became a city. 
</P>
<P>
But Maria Garcez said she quickly tired of hearing "everyone cry on each 
other's shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Garcez opened a practice between a car dealer and a vegetable store in a 
working-class suburb, where most of the phones are still answered in 
Portuguese. Most of his patients are Portuguese and a few are Mozambicans, 
referred to Garcez by doctors in Maputo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Living Well 
</P>
<P>
Today, Garcez drives a $30,000 BMW and lives in a large townhouse decorated 
with paintings by, among others, Malangatana, Mozambique's most respected black 
revolutionary artist. The family, now with three children, still speaks 
Portuguese at home, carries Portuguese passports and socializes with other 
former residents of Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
But too much time has passed, they say, to seriously consider returning to 
Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe one day we can go back and live happily ever after, like a Walt Disney 
movie," Maria Garcez said. "But I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
For the small number of Portuguese who stayed after independence, though, there 
are few regrets. 
</P>
<P>
When Manuel Gonzalvez's first wife took his children back to Portugal at 
independence, he married a Mozambican woman and set up a transportation 
business in the port city of Beira. Today, he drives a 20-year-old Volkswagen 
Beetle, understands no English and chain smokes cigarettes of coarse Mozambican 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
"The war is still a problem, but no one troubles me," Gonzalvez, 58, said 
through an interpreter. "I'm here 37 years now, and I stay no matter what. I'm 
too old to run away."

ACCUSATIONS OF LYING MARK START OF SECOND WEEK AS TEACHERS HOLD RALLY; DISTRICT 
POLICE ARREST 11 
</P>

With accusations of lying flying back and forth, relations between the two 
sides in the Los Angeles teachers' strike reached the boiling point Monday as 
thousands of teachers rallied and 11 union leaders and supporters were arrested 
later outside district headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said it is increasingly likely that the strike, entering its second 
week Monday, may not be resolved until after school board runoff elections June 
6 and could last the rest of the school year. The last strike in 1970 lasted 23 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not holding up much hope at the moment," school board President Roberta 
Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Bernstein, a vice president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the teachers' 
union, called the standoff an "absolute disaster for Los Angeles. I don't know 
if we'll ever have school again this year," Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
She was among 10 adults and one juvenile who were arrested on suspicion of 
trespassing Monday afternoon after they allegedly attempted to cross school 
district police lines at district headquarters downtown. Those arrested 
included two other UTLA vice presidents and the secretary and treasurer of the 
union. The union charged school district police with brutality in the arrests, 
an allegation that was denied by the district's officers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two sides exchanged the harshest rhetoric since the strike 
began, most of it over whether or not the district had indeed put a better 
offer on the table. 
</P>
<P>
According to school board member Jackie Goldberg and other sources, negotiators 
for the school board on Sunday had offered teachers a three-year contract with 
guarantees of 8% raises each year, regardless of how much the district may 
receive in new state funds. Such a contract offer would be a significant 
advance from an earlier offer, in which the raise in the middle year ranged 
between 5.5% and 8%, depending on the availability of state money. 
</P>
<P>
"It was eight, eight and eight, with no formula," said Goldberg, who had acted 
as a go-between in the labor dispute. "No ifs, no contingencies, nothing." 
Goldberg said she decided to violate a news blackout on the latest negotiations 
and reveal what had taken place because "I believe the people in the city have 
a right to know." 
</P>
<P>
The union had privately indicated that it would accept such a 24% increase. 
Union official Bernstein said a lot of figures were mentioned during the 
bargaining but an offer of 24% was never formally made. Goldberg, she insisted, 
was not present during the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders claimed that the offer was still tied to the state windfall. They 
also said the district refused to make concessions on teacher pay docked for 
job actions and on the issue of sharing decision-making at schools. 
</P>
<P>
UTLA President Wayne Johnson, in a bitter speech to about 7,000 teachers at a 
Sports Arena rally, called district leaders and negotiators "desperate, 
despicable people" and said of the board's money claims: "They are lying, they 
are lying, they are lying." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson ridiculed Weintraub for what he claimed were naps as long as two hours 
she took during bargaining sessions. "We finally made a condition that Roberta 
had to be awake and at the table," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about those charges, Weintraub said in a telephone interview: 
</P>
<P>
"I have no comment on anything like that. If I were really to reveal what went 
on in those sessions . . . about the language used by the other side. . . ." 
She declined to be more specific, citing the news blackout, but added that "Mr. 
Johnson has made it impossible to bargain." 
</P>
<P>
Symbolizing how quickly the situation had changed in a day, the union held its 
massive pep rally Monday in space it had rented to vote on a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Monday, school Supt. Leonard Britton insisted that the 
district had increased its pay offer during weekend negotiating. Of union 
charges to the contrary, Britton stated: "You will have to choose which one of 
us is lying." 
</P>
<P>
Britton said talks collapsed after union leaders refused a package that the 
board was told would be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Board members Julie Korenstein and Warren Furutani proposed a settlement 
package Monday which Goldberg confirmed was identical to one offered by the 
district Sunday. The package, among other things, included a provision that the 
district reimburse teachers for about half of the wages they were docked last 
winter for failing to report student grades for the fall semester. The rest of 
the wages lost during job actions before the strike could be made up by working 
extra hours. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also called for the membership on school management councils, 
which would decide such things as school discipline, to be evenly divided 
between teachers and district appointees. In addition, elementary school 
teachers would have 40 minutes a day for preparing lessons and be paid for 
voluntary schoolyard duty. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders said the non-monetary proposals are unacceptable because they do 
not give teachers enough power in deciding school issues. 
</P>
<P>
Britton said that no talks are scheduled with union leaders and the district is 
prepared to weather the strike "for as long as it has to." The district is 
continuing to recruit and hire substitute teachers and the state mediator who 
was called into the talks over the weekend has returned home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district saved about $12 million in salaries during the strike last week, 
money that could be used as part of a final contract settlement, Britton said. 
</P>
<P>
UTLA spokeswoman Catherine Carey said the union will return to the bargaining 
table immediately if the offer of 24% is formally made. 
</P>
<P>
Current starting pay for Los Angeles teachers is $23,440 and the top is 
$43,319, although that amount can be raised by extracurricular and summer 
school duties. 
</P>
<P>
At the campuses, student attendance and the number of regular teachers at work 
both increased Monday, the district said. But it was clear that about half the 
students and two-thirds of the teachers remained out. 
</P>
<P>
Morning rolls found 293,482 of the nearly 594,000 district students in 
attendance. That was 34,362 more than on Friday, which had the lowest 
attendance of last week, possibly because youngsters wanted a three-day respite 
from substitute teachers and makeshift educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
The number of regular teachers at work increased by 654 Monday, to 9,314. The 
union said such attrition was expected and that the numbers of its strikers 
remains above 20,000 of the 32,000 regular teachers, nurses, counselors and 
librarians. The number of substitutes jumped by 74, to 2,527, the district 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some board insiders speculated Monday that the district may not be back to 
normal until two school board seats are decided next month and the board 
members inaugurated July 1. Up for reelection in runoffs are Korenstein, who 
has union backing in her West San Fernando Valley district, and Alan Gershman, 
who is facing a union-backed challenger in the race for his Westside seat. 
</P>
<P>
The school board met for about an hour Monday morning and then canceled its 
usual public Monday afternoon meeting. Several hundred strikers rallied in 
front of the building housing the offices of O'Melveny &amp; Myers, the 
district's law firm, and at the district's office about five blocks away where 
the arrests were made. Among the protesters' chants was "Wake up, Roberta," 
another reference to Johnson's charge that Weintraub napped during talks. 
</P>
<P>
UTLA spokeswoman Carey accused district police of using "excessive force," 
saying Frances Haywood, a union vice president, was thrown onto a district 
police car and handcuffed when she and the others tried to enter district 
headquarters to express outrage over the stalemated talks. In addition to 
Bernstein and Haywood, other union officials arrested were Vice President Nina 
Greenberg, Treasurer Betty Karnett and Secretary Deborah Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
School Police Chief Wesley Mitchell, denying that his officers used excessive 
force, said: "I am confident that the officers handled themselves in a very 
professional manner." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the arrested demonstrators were released later in the day on their 
own recognizance.

CONTROVERSIAL BLM GRAZING PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
RANCHERS TURN A PROFIT BY SUBLETTING U.S. LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like a lot of western ranchers, Stan Davidson needs public grazing lands to 
survive. He owns a small ranch, but needs additional pasture in the spring and 
summer. Suitable land not owned by the government is too expensive to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a lot of western ranchers, Davidson has to pay fair-market value for the 
public grazing lands he uses -- and he pays it to his competitors, who have 
exclusive government permits to graze those lands. 
</P>
<P>
The permittees pay the Bureau of Land Management $1.86 a month for each cow 
allowed to graze the vast expanse of BLM-managed public land. Then they charge 
Davidson and others like him from $8 to $12 per month per cow. And they pocket 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
What they do is illegal. But since they have the permits, Davidson and many 
other small ranchers must pay, federal appraisers have found. Some pay in cash 
while others pay with livestock. Often, payments are concealed by arrangements 
that defy outsiders, including the BLM, to uncover and prove. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the ranchers who sublease public lands are willing to talk about it. 
Davidson spoke only as long as his actual name and state were not used. He and 
others said they fear ostracism by other cattlemen, and worry that if they are 
known to speak out they could find no place to graze their herds next year. 
</P>
<P>
The reason he and others are so reluctant to talk is that subleasing public 
grazing permits for private profit -- a practice that the BLM and cattlemen's 
groups say does not exist -- illustrates what conservationists and other 
critics assert is wrong with the Bureau of Land Management's grazing program. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble, they say, is that the grazing fee set by Congress and extended by 
presidential fiat is scandalously low. Not only does this fail to generate 
revenue to cut the federal deficit, it fails even to produce enough revenue to 
cover the cost of running the grazing program itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Damage to Land 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, critics argue, the fee is so low that it becomes economic to 
run cattle on sparsely vegetated lands, sometimes denuding them and turning 
them into desert, other times eradicating native grasses and leaving behind 
only unpalatable sagebrush. 
</P>
<P>
Such problems are especially troubling, they say, because grazing occurs on 
more of the bureau's vast store of public land than any other single activity. 
Cows graze more than 170 million of the 272 million acres of BLM-managed land, 
an area larger than California and Nevada combined. 
</P>
<P>
"Those impacts on wildlife and habitat are not worth the hamburger," said Larry 
LaPre of the San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society, noting the fact that only 
2% of all domestic cattle rely on public range -- fewer than the number of 
cattle grazed on private pasture in Florida alone. 
</P>
<P>
Ranchers counter that BLM's fees are fair as they are, for several reasons. For 
example, public lands are by definition open to the public, increasing the 
danger of rustling. Ranchers using public lands also must install and maintain 
their own fences and sometimes roads, they add. 
</P>
<P>
Several ranchers also applauded the BLM for several recent wildlife-enhancement 
projects, such as the reintroduction of bighorn sheep in some parts of Montana 
and the construction of waterfowl nesting habitats in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
However, a number of BLM workers privately concede that subleasing, common or 
not, does indicate that the grazing fee is too low and that low fees encourage 
overgrazing that threatens thousands of acres each year. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to raise the federal grazing fee -- or to enact other reforms, such as 
trimming grazing allotments to reduce overgrazing -- have met with ferocious 
opposition in Congress and, recently, the White House. 
</P>
<P>
For example, after the BLM and the Forest Service jointly pursued an exhaustive 
1985 study of more than 47,000 individual grazing leases throughout the West -- 
the study that documented more than 1,000 cases of illegal sublets -- an effort 
was launched in Congress to raise the grazing fee. 
</P>
<P>
That effort was quashed by a 1986 executive order, signed by then-President 
Ronald Reagan, continuing the fee at $1.35 per "animal unit month," or AUM. 
This is the amount of vegetation an average cow consumes in a month, roughly 
about 800 pounds of forage. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent analysis of the raw government data by Colorado State University 
agronomists C. Kerry Gee and Albert G. Madsen led them to conclude that bureau 
grazing privileges were being subleased for an average of $7.76 per AUM in the 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a rancher with federal leases permitting him to graze 2,000 head of 
cattle each month on BLM-managed land could have realized more than $10,000 a 
month by simply subleasing the privileges on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BLM Denial 
</P>
<P>
Despite the conclusions of the report it co-sponsored, BLM officials flatly 
deny that subleasing occurs, at least not for profit. Rex Clary, who runs the 
BLM's district in the high desert rangeland around Susanville, Calif., said 
that any such profit would be seized by the government if the bureau knew about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
He and others noted that the documents used to prepare the 1985 audit -- and 
which allegedly proved rampant subleasing -- were shredded in 1986 to satisfy a 
promise of confidentiality made to ranchers participating in the study. 
</P>
<P>
Confidentiality was promised by the staff researchers, and bureau officials 
said that without the papers it is difficult to locate ranchers who illegally 
sublet their federal grazing rights. 
</P>
<P>
Individual BLM staff members, however, say that little effort is made to 
uncover illegal sublets because they believe it would attract political 
pressures from the influential livestock industry. 
</P>
<P>
By retracing some of the steps of the BLM and Forest Service appraisers who 
researched the 1985 study, The Times was able to confirm several subleases and 
learn anecdotally of others. But because of the controversy over the activity, 
participants discussed the practice only if promised anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, public grazing privileges for which BLM charges less than $2 per AUM 
can be subleased by private permittees for whatever the market will bear, from 
$6 an AUM for poor-quality land to $10, $11 or even $12 an AUM. 
</P>
<P>
In one extreme case, a rancher along the Idaho-Oregon border reportedly paid 
more than $26 an AUM -- almost 20 times the government rate -- to graze cattle 
on a parcel that was 97% public land. Thus, grazing privileges for which the 
permit-holder of record was charged only $891 were costing the evidently 
desperate cattleman $18,000. The arrangement lasted for three years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helping Hand 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, permittees subleased their grazing privileges to help a neighbor in 
trouble or to give a head start to a young relative unable to pay the inflated 
land prices that dog ranchers in many parts of the West. Even in such cases of 
generosity, however, the fee charged by lessors has hovered around $6 per AUM, 
regardless of whether the public lands portion of the pasture is 20% or 77%. 
</P>
<P>
Subleased land is not always wholly public land. Subleases have ranged from 
100% public land in northern Montana to about 20% public land in north-central 
Oregon. Often, sublessees do not know that part of the land for which they pay 
$8 to $12 an AUM costs the lessor only $1.86 an AUM -- the official BLM fee. 
</P>
<P>
Just as often, they do not care. 
</P>
<P>
"As high as the interest rates are, it (subleasing) is still cheaper than 
trying to buy something," said rancher Lloyd Jones of Hinsdale, Mont. He was 
quick to add that he owns his own land now and no longer leases any pasture -- 
public or private -- for the 250 head of cattle he runs with his son. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are doing this (subleasing) are probably maintaining the fence and 
other things people don't think about," speculated John (Pat) Peterson of 
Castleford, Ida. He said he leases lands directly from the state and BLM and is 
not involved in subleasing. 
</P>
<P>
"(Subleasing) is a little more expensive," Peterson said, "but (lessors) assume 
some of the responsibilities that the BLM doesn't do . . . like providing water 
and maintaining roads." 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, contend that BLM lands leased at $1.86 an AUM often offer the 
same features as adjacent private land that leases for four to six times that 
fee. Even where private and public lands are "checkerboarded" in a pattern of 
alternating "sections," or square miles, the price disparity persists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers' Burden 
</P>
<P>
And the cost to taxpayers, they add, is substantial. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. George (Buddy) Darden (D-Ga.) said the BLM and Forest Service collected a 
total of $26 million from grazing in 1984, while the two agencies' grazing 
programs cost $73 million to run. Taxes made up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the latest year for which statistics have been published, BLM said it 
collected $14.3 million in grazing leases, licenses and permits. If the fee had 
been equal to the average amount reportedly charged by sublessors, the BLM 
would have collected $87.2 million -- a sixfold increase. 
</P>
<P>
BLM, which recently raised its grazing fee to $1.86 per AUM, sets that cost 
with a complicated formula that considers factors ranging from 1966 production 
costs to 1989 supermarket prices. 
</P>
<P>
California, on the other hand, determines fees for its grazing program by using 
the same fees sought by nearby private pasture owners. Its fees range from $6 
to $10 per AUM. 
</P>
<P>
Gee and Madsen reported that government statisticians estimated the private 
lease rate at $10.32 per AUM in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this, few expect the system to change. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think, in the final analysis, Congress has the guts to raise the fees 
or to radically restructure the (grazing) system," said Gerald Hillier, manager 
of BLM's California Desert District. 
</P>
<P>
Darden has introduced legislation to raise the grazing fee by rewriting the 
federal fee-setting formula. The bill, however, has run into fierce opposition 
from several western politicians, including Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) and 
three Idaho Republicans, Sens. James A. McClure and Steve Symms and Rep. Larry 
E. Craig. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special-Interest Bill 
</P>
<P>
Some ranchers are not satisfied with simply blocking attempts to hike fees and 
have been looking around Washington for a member of Congress willing to sponsor 
a particularly aggressive piece of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed bill, called the National Rangeland Grazing System Act, would, 
among other things, establish designated grazing zones that would essentially 
allow such public lands to be treated as the private property of ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one section of the draft bill states that grazing would be the 
"dominant use" for federal rangelands, and that the government could protect 
wildlife and otherwise manage the public's property only "with the advice and 
approval" of the individual leasing the water and grazing rights. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also would make it a felony punishable by 10 years in prison and a 
$10,000 fine for BLM workers to "present the private grazing permittee in a 
false light as a poor or incompetent grazer" by falsifying range conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Strickland of the Sierra Club said that such penalties are excessively 
harsh and would serve to further intimidate BLM range conservation specialists 
from ever challenging grazing practices on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
Intimidation already is a frequent concern of many in the BLM, according to 
interviews with the employees themselves and congressional investigations into 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
An especially egregious example was reported recently by General Accounting 
Office investigators. It involved a BLM employee who stopped a certain rancher 
in the process of illegally cutting down trees on an environmentally sensitive 
piece of BLM property. 
</P>
<P>
The rancher complained about the incident to several elected officials, who 
pressured BLM to relent. Swiftly, the BLM employee who had stopped the rancher 
was ordered by his boss not only to apologize to that trespassing rancher, but 
also to personally deliver the illegally cut wood to the rancher's house. 
</P>
<P>
"BLM is not managing (ranchers)," the GAO concluded. "Rather, (ranchers) are 
managing BLM." 
</P>
<P>
All but a few of the dozens of BLM employees interviewed by The Times spoke 
candidly only with the assurance that their names would not be used. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to become the next Bob Buffington," said one, referring to a 
former Idaho state director and 26-year BLM worker who had been targeted for 
demotion by BLM Director Robert F. Burford -- and later ushered out of BLM 
completely -- after speaking out against overgrazing and in support of a 
wilderness study program. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, critics say Congress is not the only source of political heat on the 
bureau. They say BLM's grazing management policies often are influenced by 
political appointees within the upper management of the bureau itself. 
</P>
<P>
Often used as an example of this is the problem of overgrazing by livestock 
that eat vegetation into extinction in some areas. The President's own Council 
on Environmental Quality has called overgrazing a leading cause of the growing 
amount of western rangeland turning to desert. 
</P>
<P>
Hillier, manager of BLM's California Desert District, said BLM policy-makers 
blocked efforts to cut livestock numbers or otherwise adjust grazing practices 
until after years of range-monitoring data was collected. BLM leaders then cut 
the range-monitoring budget, forcing a reduction in the range-management staff 
and effectively freezing in place destructive grazing practices. 
</P>
<P>
Congress traditionally relies on home-state lawmakers to set the agenda for 
issues of regional interest. This leaves BLM in the domain of lawmakers elected 
in rural western constituencies where cattlemen and miners usually are among 
the wealthiest, most influential and politically active citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constituent Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Even those that aren't directly linked to the livestock industry realize to a 
certainty how critically important federal grazing lands are to a great many of 
their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, miners and livestock operators grew dependent on the public 
lands. Many western ranches, for example, have little summer or winter pasture 
of their own; their real value, and the income of their owners, depend largely 
on the right to graze nearby public lands. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, the right to graze public land, a right contained usually in 
10-year leases but often handed down from one generation to another, is viewed 
as such a valuable and tangible real asset that banks will accept it to secure 
a loan. 
</P>
<P>
The product of all these questionable influences on BLM's management policy is 
serious deterioration of public lands. 
</P>
<P>
BLM estimates that 58% of its millions of acres of range is in fair or poor 
condition -- that is, more than half of its native vegetation has been stripped 
by grazing livestock.

TIME TO GIVE UP TERRITORIAL CLAIMS, BAKER TELLS ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, delivering an unusually stern warning to 
a major pro-Israel lobbying organization, called on Israel on Monday to 
renounce its claims to territory that it has seized in wars with neighboring 
Arab nations. 
</P>
<P>
"For Israel, now is the time to lay aside, once and for all, the unrealistic 
vision of a greater Israel," Baker said in a speech to the American Israel 
Public Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Israeli interests in the West Bank and Gaza -- security and otherwise -- can 
be accommodated in a settlement" that would involve trading land for peace, 
Baker told his unreceptive audience. The Israeli government of Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Shamir has steadfastly refused to swap land for peace. 
</P>
<P>
"Forswear annexation," Baker urged. "Stop settlement activity" by Jews in the 
West Bank. "Allow schools to reopen. Reach out to the Palestinians as neighbors 
who deserve political rights." 
</P>
<P>
Baker acknowledged that it would be difficult for Israel "to enter a 
negotiating process whose successful outcome will in all probability involve 
territorial withdrawal." But, he said, "continuation of the status quo will 
lead to increasing violence and worsening prospects for peace." 
</P>
<P>
In setting the tone for a series of meetings between Israeli Defense Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin and senior Administration officials in Washington this week, 
Baker said it was "high time for serious political dialogue" between Israel and 
the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
During their first months in office, senior Administration officials generally 
have refrained from publicly joining the diplomatic effort to resolve the 
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories of the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip. But Baker recently dispatched a senior aide, Dennis Ross, on a 
low-key visit to Israel, and the Administration has quietly begun to focus on 
the region, following an introductory series of one-on-one meetings between 
President Bush and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Shamir and King Hussein of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, Rabin conferred with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney about the 
current military situation in Israel. Defense officials said Rabin sought 
assurances that the United States would maintain promised levels of military 
aid. He met with Baker later and is scheduled to meet with Bush on Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
While Cheney and Rabin did not discuss specific weapons systems that Israel 
hopes to buy from the United States, officials said that Cheney promised to 
work for congressional approval of $1.8 billion in foreign military sales 
financing in each of the next two years. The Defense Department administers the 
foreign military sales program, which supplements $1.2 billion in proposed 
economic support funds. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, reiterating in his speech the U.S. preference for Palestinian 
self-government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip "in a manner acceptable to 
Palestinians, Israel and Jordan," said: "Such a formula provides ample scope 
for Palestinians to achieve their full political rights. It also provides ample 
protection for Israel's security as well." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "the gap between the parties on key issues such as Palestinian 
representation and the shape of a final settlement remains very, very wide." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Atmosphere of Violence 
</P>
<P>
"Violence has soured the atmosphere," he said, referring to the deaths of 19 
Israelis and more than 425 Palestinians since the uprising began in December, 
1987. "So, a quick move to negotiations is quite unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a speech prepared for delivery today to the same group, Rep. Les 
Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, seemed to echo 
Baker's message, saying that "military dominance is not for eternity. . . . In 
the end, a true and comprehensive peace settlement is required. Only that can 
bury the menace." 
</P>
<P>
Aspin will also say that U.S.-Israeli strategic cooperation, as well as U.S. 
efforts to stem the proliferation of chemical, nuclear and ballistic missile 
technology to the Middle East, could "buy time" for Israel to make peace with 
its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"But we cannot turn the clock back. . . . Time is not in inexhaustible supply," 
Aspin will say.

HIGH COURT OKS MOON CHURCH TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
LETS STAND CALIFORNIA RULING IN RECRUITING PRACTICES CASE 
</P>

<P>
In a case that has been watched anxiously by mainstream churches, the Supreme 
Court cleared the way Monday for a damages trial against the Rev. Sun Myung 
Moon's Unification Church for allegedly having used trickery and brainwashing 
to recruit two young members. 
</P>
<P>
The justices refused to hear an appeal by Moon's lawyers on grounds that the 
Constitution's guarantee of the "free exercise of religion" protected the 
church in proselytizing for new members. 
</P>
<P>
The high court action leaves intact a California Supreme Court ruling in 
October that the church could be held liable for lying and deceit by its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stopped on Street 
</P>
<P>
The two young persons suing the church said that they were stopped by followers 
of Moon on a San Francisco street in 1979 and were persuaded to spend a weekend 
at a group farm. 
</P>
<P>
Although the followers at first denied that they were "Moonies," the two young 
persons were subjected at the farm to brainwashing and "coercive persuasion" 
that led them to join the church, the two said. Later, after spending time with 
"deprogrammers," they renounced their faith in Moon's church and filed suit 
seeking damages for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of mainstream churches warn that the California Supreme Court ruling, 
if finally upheld, would threaten all organized religion. Lawyers for four 
groups said that the ruling, by holding that a church may be forced to pay 
damages for having successfully persuaded someone to become a member, would 
have "a serious chilling effect on religious proselytizing and conversions in 
California and elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urge Intervention 
</P>
<P>
The four groups -- the National Council of Churches of Christ, the Presbyterian 
Church, the American Baptist Churches and the Catholic League for Religious and 
Civil Rights -- filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to intervene in the 
California case. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what significance the U.S. Supreme Court attached to its 
decision to turn down Moon's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The justices may believe that the California court ruling was correct and 
therefore should be allowed to stand. Or they may have doubts about it but 
prefer to let the case go to trial. If the trial results in a large damage 
verdict against Moon's church, the church would almost certainly appeal again 
and the justices could agree to hear the case then. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not too surprised they turned it down," said Jeffrey S. Ross, a San 
Francisco lawyer representing the Unification Church. "They usually want to 
hear a case when it's final." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started With Bus Trip 
</P>
<P>
The case that resulted in Monday's Supreme Court action developed in 1979, when 
David Molko, a 27-year-old graduate of Temple University Law School, moved to 
San Francisco, and Tracy Leal, a 19-year-old San Diego college student, took a 
bus trip to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Both alleged that they were deceived into joining a Moonie group for a weekend. 
After several weeks of constant meetings and lectures, they decided to join the 
church, and Molko later contributed $6,000 to the church. In their lawsuits, 
they are seeking damages for emotional distress as well as punitive damages 
against the church. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge in San Francisco and a mid-level state court threw out 
the suit because it clashed with the church's freedom to practice religion. 
Last October, however, the state Supreme Court revived it on a 6-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subject to Regulation 
</P>
<P>
Justice Stanley Mosk, writing for the court majority, said that religious 
beliefs are fully protected by the First Amendment but that religiously 
motivated conduct is subject to state regulation. Molko and Leal, he said, 
should be given the chance to prove that the church engaged in fraud to win 
recruits. 
</P>
<P>
Without comment or dissent, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the church's appeal 
in the case (Holy Spirit Assn. for the Unification of World Christianity vs. 
Molko and Leal, 88-1600). 
</P>
<P>
In another action, the court said that the owners of the Italian cruise ship 
Achille Lauro would have to defend themselves in New York in a civil suit 
growing out of the 1985 hijacking by Palestinian terrorists. American 
passengers, including Leon Klinghoffer, who was killed during the episode, 
bought their cruise tickets in the United States. The tickets contained a small 
warning that any legal actions must be brought in Naples, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
But a district judge in New York ruled that the passengers' suit may be tried 
here, and an appellate court said that the owners had no right to appeal before 
the trial. In a 9-0 ruling, the high court endorsed that conclusion (Lauro 
Lines vs. Chasser, 88-23).

THATCHER ASSAILS SOVIETS ON ENVOYS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMATIC RIFT WIDENS; MOSCOW ORDERS BRITISH CUTBACK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A diplomatic dispute between Britain and the Soviet Union deepened Monday as 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher accused the Soviets of reverting to 
crude, old-style diplomatic tactics and the Kremlin ordered a sharply reduced 
British presence in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute erupted over the weekend when Britain ordered the expulsion of 
eight Soviet diplomats and three journalists for alleged spy activities. While 
initial news of the expulsions was suppressed to avoid disturbing what has been 
acknowledged here as one of the warmest periods in Anglo-Soviet relations since 
World War II, Moscow quickly retaliated by announcing the expulsion of an 
identical list of 11 Britons. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in an additional move, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. 
Gerasimov told a news conference in Moscow on Monday that the number of Britons 
permitted to live in the Soviet Union would be reduced by 170 from a present 
level of 375 to 205, a figure he described as a quota agreed upon by the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The quota, at 205, has been radically violated, and as a reciprocal measure, 
it is stated that now we establish the quota of personnel of British 
representation at the figure of 205," Gerasimov said. 
</P>
<P>
In London, however, Foreign Office officials said they are unware of any such 
quota and expressed confusion over Gerasimov's figure of 375. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 78 registered British staff working in the Soviet Union," a Foreign 
Office spokesman said. "We have no idea what he (Gerasimov) is talking about 
with 375." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman speculated that the figure might relate to all personnel, both 
Soviet and British, who work for British organizations or diplomatic missions 
in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the confusion over the exact target of the latest Soviet action, 
Thatcher left little doubt about her personal reaction to developments, 
bristling with thinly controlled anger during interviews Monday with both major 
British television networks. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave them the chance to say 'things have changed,' as we hoped they might 
have done," Thatcher said, referring to her government's decision to handle the 
initial expulsions discreetly. "They didn't take the chance, and they showed 
that things haven't changed as much as we had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a very, very significant decision," she added. "What a pity." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a formal statement to the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary 
Geoffrey Howe justified the initial expulsion order, declaring that "the 
decision . . . was taken only after very careful consideration and on the basis 
of incontrovertible evidence." 
</P>
<P>
"The action we took was absolutely necessary for the security of the country," 
Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
No details of the Soviets' alleged activities were released. 
</P>
<P>
British officials dealing with the affair said illegal activities by the 11 
Soviets were first brought to Moscow's attention as early as last January and 
that warnings had been repeated since. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave them every opportunity to . . . cease their activities," said a senior 
government official. "We didn't want this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lunched With the Queen 
</P>
<P>
The present diplomatic row comes just one month after Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev's visit to Britain, during which he strengthened his personal 
links with Thatcher and lunched with Queen Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
The British monarch's acceptance of a formal invitation to visit the Soviet 
Union -- the first such invitation since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution -- 
seemed to symbolize a high point in post-World War II Anglo-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this warmth, Thatcher has consistently been among the severest critics 
of Soviet policy. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent dispute within the Western Alliance over how best to react to 
Gorbachev's offer to negotiate away short-range nuclear weapons in Europe, she 
has been the most strident opponent of talks. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic political opponents Monday linked her tough stand on short-range 
weapons with the diplomatic expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) summit next week, and 
Britain is completely isolated there," said Labor Party foreign affairs 
spokesman Gerald Kaufman. "Everyone else (but Thatcher) is willing to consider 
negotiations with the Soviet Union on short-range nuclear weapons at some 
point. Mrs. Thatcher is alone, and what she's doing is whipping up the Cold War 
in an effort to somehow justify her isolation." 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1985, six months after Gorbachev took power in Moscow, Britain 
and the Soviet Union engaged in a series of expulsions that affected 31 
nationals of either country and left Anglo-Soviet relations in a shambles. 
</P>
<P>
Only 18 months later, however, Thatcher embarked on a triumphant visit to 
Moscow that established a strong personal relationship with the new Soviet 
leader and began the revival of ties between the two countries.

A Turkish Cypriot court Monday sentenced a German mother and daughter to prison 
for killing a rapist who had attacked them in a lonely seaside campsite. 
</P>
<P>
Uthe Loh, 48, received four years in prison. Her daughter Melani, who turns 21 
today, got three years. Both are from West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The court said that by the time of his death, Ozmen Tulga, 20, was weakened by 
his struggles with the two tourists and no longer posed a threat to them. It 
also said the women had failed to flee from the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
The women, who came to Cyprus on vacation in March, were found guilty of 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
In statements read in court, they said Tulga forced his way into their tent and 
hit both of them with a stick before raping Melani. They said that in the 
struggle, they strangled Tulga with a belt but did not intend to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to appeal against the conviction and against the sentence," 
defense lawyer Ali Dana said.

ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT TO TACKLE OLD PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officially, the Arab League summit conference opening here today is another 
"emergency" meeting of the 22 kings, presidents and emirs of the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, the leaders who began arriving in Casablanca on 
Monday for the two-day conference will be preoccupied with old and by now 
tiresomely familiar themes. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what is likely to be the most significant event at this 16th Arab 
League summit in 25 years has quietly taken place already. 
</P>
<P>
At a preparatory foreign ministers' meeting on Sunday, Egypt, the most populous 
country in the Arab world, resumed its seat in the league 10 years after it was 
suspended for signing a separate peace treaty with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
While Egypt's readmission underscores the extent to which political perceptions 
have changed in the region over the past decade, the chief topics on the agenda 
are anything but new: Palestine, the perennial centerpiece of Arab summitry; 
Lebanon; lingering tensions in the Persian Gulf, the Iran-Iraq cease-fire 
notwithstanding, and various inter-Arab conflicts such as those between Iraq 
and Syria, Syria and the Palestinians and Yemen and South Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, the most urgent and intractable of these conflicts, dominated the 
preparatory discussions leading up to the summit and threatened to undermine 
it. 
</P>
<P>
A six-member committee chaired by Kuwait has been trying to devise a formula to 
consolidate a cease-fire in Lebanon, but after two days of intensive and 
often-acrimonious talks, it was not even able to decide who should represent 
Lebanon at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hassan Gets Hot Potato 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it was decided to pass the issue along to Morocco's King Hassan II, 
the conference host, with a recommendation that Lebanon's Christian army 
commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, and Muslim Premier Salim Hoss be invited to 
take separate seats at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A similar question mark hung over Libyan participation, with Col. Moammar 
Kadafi threatening a boycott because of Egypt's readmission to the league. 
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Syria, Algeria and Tunisia flew to Libya over the weekend to 
try to persuade Kadafi to come, but whether he does is not likely to have much 
of an impact on the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice, from the point of view of Arab unity, to have everyone 
here," one Arab diplomat said, "but Kadafi himself is irrelevant. If he comes, 
he will be tolerated. If he boycotts, he will be ignored." 
</P>
<P>
The other main "emergency" the meeting was called to deal with is the 
Palestinian question, in particular the intifada against Israeli rule in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, is coming 
with an agenda that seeks to win the political and financial support of his 
fellow Arabs for the uprising and for recent PLO peace efforts, including its 
recognition of Israel, renunciation of terrorism and the creation of an 
independent Palestinian state in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the PLO will be pressing fellow Arabs to honor the commitments 
they made at another so-called emergency meeting last year in Algiers to 
finance the intifada with a one-time contribution of $128 million plus $43 
million a month. Only Saudi Arabia and Libya have been paying their share. A 
Palestinian source said the PLO has so far received only $40 million of the 
lump-sum payment, along with $12 million a month from the Saudis and the 
Libyans. 
</P>
<P>
Summit sources said they expect the leaders to endorse the PLO's peace moves 
but -- in deference to radicals such as Syria -- only in general, non-specific 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to condemn the peace plan recently proposed by 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. It calls for elections in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip to choose non-PLO leaders who would then negotiate and 
administer an interim plan for limited Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
Expressing the consensus that is considered certain to emerge at the summit, 
Arab League Secretary General Chedli Klibi told the foreign ministers Sunday 
that the transparent purpose of Shamir's plan is to counter "the growing 
sympathy the Palestinian cause is winning in Western countries . . . to get rid 
of the intifada . . . and then to try to impose local leaders in an illusory 
attempt by the Zionist leadership to wipe out the role of the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
While virtually everyone attending the conference agrees that the Shamir plan 
is, in the words of a senior Egyptian diplomat, "a complete non-starter," how 
this sentiment is expressed in the final communique is likely to be the subject 
of intense negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Morocco's Rehabilitation 
</P>
<P>
Whatever shape the final resolutions take, the main point of this meeting has 
already been made. It is the first Arab summit conference in Morocco since King 
Hassan was forced to resign his chairmanship of the Arab League three years ago 
for meeting publicly with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the meeting marks not only Egypt's formal rehabilitation in the Arab 
world but Morocco's as well. In so doing, it affirms and furthers the sense of 
unity and moderation that has been gaining ground in the Middle East in the 
last few years. 
</P>
<P>
This is due in part to Iraq's emergence relatively unscathed from its war with 
Iran and its alliance with Egypt, Jordan and other regional moderates at a time 
when Syria, the traditional spoiler of Middle East politics, is becoming more 
bogged down in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The intifada and the pressure it has put on the PLO to come up with a realistic 
peace plan to capitalize on the sympathy the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories have earned over the past 18 months has been another major factor. 
</P>
<P>
But as is so often the case in this part of the world, the main motivation is 
fear -- in this instance fear that as the intifada turns more violent, a 
historic opportunity for a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict will be 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
"If that happens," a senior Palestinian official said, "then the pendulum will 
swing back to the radicals, and we will all have to stand prepared for another 
Middle East war."

U.S. HOPING FOR PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF CHINA PROTESTS, QUAYLE TELLS BEIJING 
OFFICIAL

In the highest level U.S.-Chinese contact since massive pro-democracy 
demonstrations began in China, Vice President Dan Quayle on Monday told Chinese 
official Wan Li that he hopes the confrontation between protesters and the 
government "will be successfully concluded without any violence." 
</P>
<P>
Wan, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, 
was given a private message by Quayle -- as well as a public warning during a 
photo session -- that the United States is keeping careful track of the 
demonstrations and the progress of rights and democracy in China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoid Violence 
</P>
<P>
An Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that -- 
although Quayle spoke about the need to avoid violence without mentioning 
either side -- the message was clearly directed at the government. 
</P>
<P>
"We support the advancement of democracy, freedom and human rights around the 
world," Quayle said. "We certainly hope that the public demonstrations that 
have gone on in China and that continue will be successfully concluded without 
any violence." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Voice of America reported that its broadcasts to China are being 
jammed by Chinese authorities on several frequencies -- a step that would 
deprive Chinese listeners of one of their main sources of Western news coverage 
of the turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VOA Jamming 
</P>
<P>
It was the first jamming by the Chinese of Voice of America transmissions since 
some time before the United States and China restored diplomatic relations in 
1979. Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said: "We are disturbed 
with any interference with news media or communication." 
</P>
<P>
Wan is in Washington to acquaint Administration officials with the results of 
the recently concluded Sino-Soviet summit. In addition, Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen is also being dispatched to Washington, to assure the United States that 
in the wake of the summit, Beijing has not tilted toward the Soviet Union. The 
Wan visit was scheduled well before the student uprising began. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the White House has taken pains to maintain its cautious 
approach to the Chinese turmoil for fear of damaging bilateral relations -- a 
stance so far supported at least by some in Congress, although there has been 
some criticism. But, rather than appear too chummy with the Chinese official, 
officials canceled plans for Wan to play tennis with President Bush today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inappropriate Time 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it was felt that, given the current situation, the need maybe to 
discuss the situation in China, it would be inappropriate at this time," 
Popadiuk said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has made clear his preference for a peaceful resolution to the turmoil in 
China and has cautioned both sides to avoid violence. 
</P>
<P>
"We do support freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, 
and clearly, we support democracy," he told a news conference in Boston on 
Sunday. "I don't want to be gratuitous in giving advice, but I would encourage 
restraint." 
</P>
<P>
Saying that he does not want to see bloodshed, Bush reminded the Chinese of the 
respect in the United States for the nonviolent efforts of the late Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. and added: "I might suggest a familiarization with that for the 
people in China." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not 'Too Involved' 
</P>
<P>
The President's approach was supported by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who 
said that "it doesn't help to get too involved" in the unrest in China, while 
also supporting the efforts by the United States to express support for 
political freedom there. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I think we should encourage them (the Chinese leaders) to be more 
forthcoming." 
</P>
<P>
He said that given the situation, "It's not wise to do anything provocative" 
and that a statement any more encouraging to the demonstrators on the part of 
the Bush Administration would be seen by the Chinese government as provocative. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rep. Robert G. Toricelli (D-N.J.), a member of the House Foreign 
Affairs subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific, was sharply critical. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the Bush Administration has lost an opportunity to ally itself 
with the forces for greater human rights and change in China and that it is 
taking too much care to avoid antagonizing the aging Chinese leadership, 
particularly Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Same Scale 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush is balancing the chances of offending an 84-year-old Communist 
leader during his last days in power with speaking to the aspiration of one 
billion Chinese people," Toricelli said. "I don't think the two should be 
weighed on the same scale." 
</P>
<P>
Toricelli said that Bush's approach would be "remembered by a new generation of 
Chinese for a long time." He added: "A democratic revolution is taking place 
and the world's leading democracy will be remembered as being silent and the 
Soviet Union will be remembered as the source of change." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said that during the meeting between Wan and Quayle, the Chinese official 
appeared to be "positioning himself on everybody's side." 
</P>
<P>
Wan told Quayle, the official said, that "reasonable demands will eventually be 
granted but we can't make any progress as long as there is any disruption and 
civil unrest." 
</P>
<P>
The official added that the Chinese leader reported there would be "no 
bloodshed" on the part of Chinese army units called in to put down the unrest 
if the students act in a restrained manner.

PROTESTS SPARK UNREST IN SHANGHAI, CANTON, OTHER CHINESE CITIES

The chaos that has gripped the Chinese capital for the past week has spread 
swiftly to the south and east, sparking major unrest here in China's largest 
city and industrial hub and infecting even the country's deep south, where 
Canton was brought to a virtual standstill by demonstrators Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, a thriving new city near China's frontier with Hong Kong, more 
than 100,000 protesters -- a fifth of the population -- marched through the 
streets, chanting for democracy and calling for the firing of Premier Li Peng. 
</P>
<P>
Like their contemporaries in Beijing and elsewhere in the north, the 
demonstrators appear to sense victory. "We have the old men on the run," a 
student in Canton said. "There's no turning back now." 
</P>
<P>
Here in Shanghai, an east China city of 12 million people, thousands of people 
have taken to the streets every day for nearly a week, with their ranks 
swelling each evening after workers end their shifts. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest inflicts rising economic losses and could even trigger strikes, in 
the view of foreign diplomats and some workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are angry," said a worker from an affiliate of the huge Baoshan steel plant 
as he stood in front of Communist Party headquarters in a driving early morning 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
"We are showing up for work but we don't do anything. Morale is very low." 
</P>
<P>
China's factories are known for overstaffing and inefficiency, but workers said 
that productivity had fallen to a new low. "We are registering our protest on 
the job," a truck plant worker said. 
</P>
<P>
There was a special irony in the revolutionary fervor in Canton. 
</P>
<P>
The city, with a population of 7 million, holds an almost mythical place in 
modern Chinese history -- the place where Sun Yat-sen first moved to topple the 
Manchu Dynasty in 1911 and where the fledgling Chinese Communist Party 
organized its first strikes and protests in the early 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Cantonese students are well aware of the city's special status, and they 
deliberately staged the focus of their protest near the Sun Yat-sen memorial 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon, protest leaders decided to bring Canton to a near-halt. They 
ordered the protesters to break up into groups of a few hundred each and to 
march through the main streets, meeting each other at major intersections and 
disrupting as much traffic as possible. As they did so, most sang a well-known 
marching song of the 1930s, the time when China was menaced by the Japanese: 
</P>
<P>
"Our beloved land is now in serious danger," a student translated the song's 
lyrics. "If all the people of the country join in the fight, then there will be 
hope, and we will succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Liu Jianqing, a 23-year-old woman law student, said: "We sang that and drove 
out the Japanese. With this song, we will drive out the despots who are ruining 
this country with their corruption and their incompetence." 
</P>
<P>
At Shenzhen, where the march was organized by the University Students' Union, 
one police officer mounted a platform and shouted pro-democracy slogans as 200 
of his colleagues and the protesters watched. "Down with Li Peng!" and "I 
support the students!" he shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Other police officers watched as the crowd sang patriotic songs and listened to 
speeches supporting the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
A young man from Dong Guan, near Shenzhen, watched the march and said, "Even in 
my village we have heard of and support the students' campaign in Beijing."

Students camped in Tian An Men Square in defiance of Chinese authorities have 
displayed organizational skills matching those of the army ordered to confront 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Student leaders have set up food and water distribution outlets, broadcast 
facilities, roadblocks, medical centers and a complicated security check system 
complete with special passes. 
</P>
<P>
The remarkable organization by the students, helped by Beijing citizens, has 
put them in effective control of the city center in the most dramatic show of 
anti-government defiance since the Communists took power in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
The organization has also kept alive students' morale and brought a method to 
the madness prevailing in the square, the symbolic heart of Communist China 
that now looks like something midway between a refugee camp and a rubbish dump. 
</P>
<P>
A Beijing resident described the scene this way: "There is no chaos. There has 
been no violence, and the students have been generally nice to the citizens." 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen student leaders are believed to control the demonstrators' nerve 
center, situated at the base of the Monument to the Peoples' Heroes, a giant 
obelisk at the center of the 100-acre square. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders, mostly from universities in Beijing, are huddled inside makeshift 
tents and surrounded by a human wall. 
</P>
<P>
All students entering Tian An Men have to produce student passes, while key 
personnel have been issued special passes that they said help prevent 
penetration by plainclothes police. 
</P>
<P>
Sheltered by giant beach umbrellas, students from Beijing University, China's 
premier college, distribute food and water donated by, or bought with funds 
from, Beijing residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to 50,000 people came for food during the critical periods," said Xu 
Hongbing, 22, a student who heads a group distributing bread and bottled 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
"During the initial demonstrations, we brought our own food and drinks," said 
student Wu Lizhi, 20. "But from mid-May on, we saw the need for organized food 
outlets to cater to the guards and medical personnel." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of doctors, nurses, medical students and volunteers from the Chinese 
Red Cross have set up medical centers around the monument, mainly treating 
colds, coughs and diarrhea. Donations of money and supplies have poured in, 
according to students running a medical supply center. 
</P>
<P>
However, for all the organization, the students appear to have neglected 
collecting piles of rubbish, mostly empty plastic and glass bottles and 
abandoned flags and poles. 
</P>
<P>
The authorities say rubbish and poor sanitation, causing a stench hanging over 
the square, could spark a health epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"We know it is an eyesore, but rubbish collection is just not a priority for us 
right now," one student leader said.

JURY SEATED IN REP. LUKENS' TRIAL ON SEX CHARGES

A jury was seated Monday for the trial of U.S. Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens, who 
is accused of having sex with an underage girl. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and defense attorneys spent seven hours selecting the jurors, who 
will hear evidence on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency 
and unruliness of a minor. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant prosecutor Rita Mangini challenged defense attorney Thomas Tyack in 
court to explain his decision to excuse the only black potential juror. The 
girl who made the allegations against Lukens is black. 
</P>
<P>
Tyack said he excused the woman because her husband works for the state; there 
were other jurors who he believed would be more appropriate from the defense's 
point of view, and because the potential juror appeared to be "living in a 
vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
Tyack was referring to her statement that she had absolutely no knowledge of 
the case despite widespread media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Lukens, a 58-year-old conservative Republican, was elected to Congress in 1986 
and previously served from 1967-71. In between, he ran unsuccessfully for 
governor and served in the state Legislature.

WRIGHT'S ASSETS DROP SHARPLY AS HE PAYS OFF ALL DEBTS 
</P>

<P>
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), fighting charges that he violated House 
ethics rules, saw his financial assets shrink in 1988 along with his political 
fortunes, according to his annual financial report, made public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Wright paid off all his debts last year, reducing his net worth sharply, the 
report shows, even as the House Ethics Committee was compiling evidence that 
appears to be eroding his political capital among his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the new figures present a classic portrait of a man eliminating 
liabilities and selling off assets to restore financial balance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assets Below $100,000 
</P>
<P>
Wright repaid loans totaling at least $105,000 and possibly as much as 
$220,000, the report said. His assets, excluding his personal residence, were 
valued at less than $100,000 at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Speaker drew a one-time refund of more than $28,000 from a 
civil service retirement fund, plus a $6,456 pension for his service in the Air 
Force Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Betty, 64, started drawing Social Security and civil service pensions 
and withdrew funds from an individual retirement account last year. She 
received a salary -- reportedly $36,000 -- from the Pacific Institute, a 
company that sells motivational and self-help services to corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The report shows that in 1988 Wright received no gifts and no book royalties, 
two items that led to his current difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
He is accused of improperly accepting $145,000 in gifts from his business 
partner, George A. Mallick Jr. of Ft. Worth. The Ethics Committee has also 
charged him with evading a congressional limit on speaking fees by making bulk 
sales of his book to special-interest groups that heard him speak. He received 
an unusually high royalty rate of 55% of the book's retail price. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee is to hear arguments today by attorneys for Wright seeking 
dismissal of the two major charges against the Speaker. Wright's defenders have 
said that his survival in office may depend on his success in persuading the 
12-member committee to reverse itself on those key issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker's financial disclosure report noted that he paid off a debt last 
year to Mallightco Inc., the firm formed by the Wrights and Mallick as an 
investment vehicle, along with a loan from the Republic Bank of Mineral Wells, 
Tex. Both loans were in the $50,000 to $100,000 bracket. 
</P>
<P>
Wright repaid a smaller note -- less than $5,000 -- from the Congressional 
Credit Union and a fourth loan in the $5,000-to-$15,000 bracket to Springhill 
Lake Investors Corp., a partnership that invested in land in nearby Prince 
George's County, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Wright listed his assets as having a value between $31,000 and $100,000, not 
including his personal residence. In 1987, by contrast, his holdings were 
valued between $305,000 and $430,000. His major asset then was his share in 
Mallightco, worth at least $250,000 by his account. 
</P>
<P>
Among his assets in 1988, the Speaker listed stock in Jewell Enterprises, a 
defunct chain of nursing homes, as worth less than $5,000. Originally he paid 
$100,000 for the stock, borrowing the entire amount. It is now considered 
almost worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Wright's 1988 income was between $188,183 and $203,579, including 
his House salary of $115,000. 
</P>
<P>
He reported income of $5,000 to $15,000 in oil and gas well royalties from 
Southeastern Resources Inc., as well as smaller amounts in interest from a 
Texas bank, sale of stock in Central Texas Cable television and income from his 
Springhill Lake partnership. 
</P>
<P>
He earned $30,000 in fees for 16 speeches to a variety of special-interest 
groups and collected ancillary expenses as well. The Washington lobbying firm 
of Campbell-Raupe paid his air fare and $2,000, for example, to deliver a talk 
at a conference in Bermuda last November. 
</P>
<P>
House Republican leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois reported that his assets 
ranged between $165,000 and $400,000. He earned $60,500 in speaking fees in 
1988 but gave $30,900 of that amount to charity. 
</P>
<P>
House Democratic leader Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) supplemented his $99,500 
salary with speaking fees and investment income that brought him $134,250 to 
$138,250. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced) received $90,100 in 
speaking fees but gave $63,575 to charity. House members may keep speaking fees 
equal to no more than 30% of their House salary. 
</P>
<P>
House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia kept a total of $26,800 from speeches. 
He listed no investment income of his own and said that his wife's investment 
income was between $1,000 and $2,500.

FIRST PATIENT UNDERGOES GENE INSERTION IN CANCER TREATMENT

Genetically engineered cells were injected into a human patient for the first 
time Monday, in a federally approved experiment designed to enhance an already 
novel cancer therapy. 
</P>
<P>
This first round of gene transfer experiments, in which a gene was inserted 
into a patient's white blood cells, is not expected to directly benefit an 
individual patient. Instead, the inserted gene is being used to track the 
movement in the body of the cancer-fighting white blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the technique of "gene insertion (could) produce therapeutic 
results in a wide range of diseases," National Institutes of Health Director 
James B. Wyngaarden said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's experiment was designed to track special, laboratory-grown white blood 
cells known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The TILs in turn attack 
the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Using gene transfer technology developed by W. French Anderson of the National 
Heart Lung and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute's R. Michael 
Blaese, the NIH team inserted into the TIL cells a bacterial gene that 
inactivates the drug neomycin. This will allow them to track the cells in the 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
The bacterial gene acts as a marker for the affected cells, giving them the 
ability to resist a version of neomycin, called G418, that poisons human cells. 
The researchers can then routinely take blood samples and biopsies from the 
patients and either treat the white blood cells with G418 to kill all but the 
genetically changed TIL cells or probe the DNA of white blood cells to find the 
genetic marker. 
</P>
<P>
Inserting human genes to repair defects may one day help with a host of 
inherited disorders, including cystic fibrosis or Duchenne's muscular 
dystrophy. Gene insertion might also help brain disorders such as Alzheimer's 
disease or other illnesses, such as growth disorders, heart disease caused by 
alterations in the way cholesterol is metabolized and defects of the immune 
system.

SURGE REPORTED IN HEALTH EMERGENCIES TIED TO COCAINE

<P>
In an indication of cocaine's growing toll on American users, hospitals across 
the country reported a sharp surge in cocaine-induced health emergencies in the 
last year, the government said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency room cases linked to cocaine reached unprecedented levels in 15 major 
cities, with only one city showing a decline, the survey said. At the same 
time, the number of cocaine-related deaths increased in nearly every city 
studied. 
</P>
<P>
Although the survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse also recorded 
increased numbers of heroin- and marijuana-related health emergencies, the 
government said the results leave no doubt that cocaine remains "the most 
noteworthy drug" of national concern. 
</P>
<P>
In a bipartisan statement, ranking members of a congressional panel on drug 
abuse blamed the trend on the increasing popularity of "crack" and other 
smokable forms of cocaine, which allow the drug to be ingested in highly 
concentrated form. 
</P>
<P>
"People need to know that crack and other cocaine forms maim and kill," said 
Reps. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) and Lawrence Coughlin (R-Pa.) in a joint 
statement on behalf of the House Select Narcotics Abuse and Control Committee. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of 
National Drug Control Policy, described the survey as a vital "barometer" of 
the nation's drug problem. "This is a good measure of just how bad it is," said 
the spokesman, Larry Cirigiano. 
</P>
<P>
The drug abuse institute has been conducting the semiannual survey for three 
years. Based on information collected through December, this installment 
provided the government's most up-to-date portrayal of national trends in drug 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The data showed that drug-related health emergencies continue to accelerate 
even after the previous years' steady climb. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles was among the cities showing an increase in cocaine-related health 
crises, with nearly 2,000 such emergency room admissions in 1988. The figure 
represented a 33% increase over the same period in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of cocaine-caused deaths in Los Angeles remained virtually unchanged 
from the previous year's total of 360, the report showed. 
</P>
<P>
The surge elsewhere was far steeper, with a 134% increase in cocaine-related 
emergency room admissions in Washington, a 199% hike in Philadelphia and a 210% 
leap in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities in which cocaine-related hospital emergencies leaped by more than 
50% in 1988 from the previous year included Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, 
Phoenix, St. Louis, Seattle, Dallas/San Antonio and Newark, N.J. Only Miami 
reported a decline, with cocaine a factor in 17% fewer hospital emergencies 
than the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the 19 cities surveyed showed an increase in heroin emergency room 
cases, with New Orleans alone reporting a 300% increase. The report, however, 
cautioned that a change in reporting criterion for heroin might have been 
partly responsible for the surge. 
</P>
<P>
Heroin-related deaths increased in the Northeast, the report said, but declined 
or remained stable in the West. 
</P>
<P>
As for marijuana, 16 of the 19 cities reported increases in emergency room 
cases, with seven cities showing increases of more than 100%. 
</P>
<P>
Research data indicated that episodes "involving marijuana in combination with 
one or more other drugs" had been principally responsible for the sharp 
increase in emergency cases, the report said. Emergencies involving marijuana 
alone also increased, but at a significantly slower rate.

Neighbors of a high-rise apartment building were kept away Monday while 
demolition experts worked out plans to bring down the building that wouldn't 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We told you so," said a grass-roots neighborhood organization that had argued 
that the building and two others were solid enough to be renovated for 
low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
More than 550 pounds of dynamite failed to bring the 36-year-old building down 
Sunday, although a second round of explosives knocked out the first two floors, 
leaving the main part of the building and a wing leaning against each other. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood organization, Project BASIC, had tried unsuccessfully in 
federal court to stop the demolition of the 10-story Hartford Park building, 
contending that it was structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't it fall? That's an open question," said David R. Evans, the 
explosives expert who coordinated the blasts. "I knocked out the two floors I 
wanted to knock out and, by all indications, the building should have fallen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the way it's built," Evans said. "It's built like a honeycomb." 
</P>
<P>
The Providence Housing Authority decided to switch from explosives to a 
wrecking crane, which will begin work today, Director Stephen O'Rourke said. 
The process could take up to two weeks.

STATE FARM'S SURPLUS TOO LARGE, SUIT CONTENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawsuit claiming that State Farm retains far too much of its policyholders' 
premiums in surplus reserves and asking that it be ordered to distribute $6.9 
billion to its customers across the country was filed Monday in Los Angeles 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Trial attorney William Shernoff, a former president of the California Trial 
Lawyers Assn. who frequently appears in court against insurers, cited two 
previous cases -- in 1919 and 1977 -- in which courts had compelled a regular 
stock company to pay a dividend to stockholders when it was determined that 
there was an excessive accumulation of surplus. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm is a mutual company, meaning that it is supposedly a nonprofit 
association of all of its customers, and not a stock company. But Shernoff 
said: "We think the principle applies with even more force to a mutual 
company." 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for State Farm at its Bloomington, Ill., headquarters had not 
studied the lawsuit and declined to comment, but pointed out that State Farm 
had recently rebutted suggestions it was holding too large a surplus in 
California. The company suggested that distributing surplus funds would only 
mean higher insurance prices later. 
</P>
<P>
All insurance companies hold some funds in surplus against the eventuality of 
claims. But the Shernoff suit says State Farm holds such funds in far higher 
proportion to the amount of premiums collected than most other companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry standard for sound and prudent management is the maintenance of a 
surplus of about one-third of annual premium (or) a 3-1 premium-to-surplus 
ratio," Shernoff's suit declared Monday. But, it said, State Farm's ratio in 
1988 was 1.23 to 1, meaning that State Farm holds nearly one dollar in surplus 
for each dollar it collects in premiums. Nineteen other comparable insurers 
averaged one dollar in surplus to more than two dollars in premiums, an exact 
ratio of 2.17 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
"The foregoing statistics," the suit said, "show that State Farm, unlike any 
other major property and casualty company, is pursuing a bizarre policy of 
accumulating more and more surplus by refusing to distribute reasonable 
dividends and by plowing its extra premium and investment income back into the 
surplus, thus compounding the problem." 
</P>
<P>
The $6.9-billion distribution the court is requested to order would bring State 
Farm into conformity with the currently prevailing industry average of a 2.17-1 
ratio. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also asked the court to order State Farm to reimburse customers who 
did not support the insurer's contributions to last year's initiative fight. 
State Farm contributed more than $5 million to the ballot initiative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In another legal development on insurance Monday, the Assn. of California 
Insurance Cos., the industry's major lobby in the state, announced it would not 
appeal the recent state Supreme Court decision upholding Proposition 103 to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The lobbying group said the six insurance companies which had joined as 
individual plaintiffs in the case had informed it they also will not appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Association general manager Edward Levy noted that the high court decision in 
some ways was favorable to the companies even while upholding most of 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Court essentially rewrote Prop. 103 to provide that insurance 
companies are entitled to 'fair and reasonable rates,' instead of having to 
show a 'substantial threat of insolvency' before rolling back their rates," 
Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the decision not to appeal did not necessarily mean the 
insurers would not appeal any rate rollbacks that ultimately might be ordered 
by state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie.

Five people were killed and 100 injured when two freight trains collided in 
Soviet Kazakhstan, starting a fire that destroyed 13 homes, the Communist Party 
daily Pravda reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred Saturday outside a railway station in Alma-Ata, capital 
of the Soviet republic. A train carrying six tankers of liquid propane hit 
another train that was switching tracks, Tass said. The tanker train caught 
fire and one tanker exploded, spreading the flames to nearby houses where 26 
families lived, Pravda said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Actor and former pro football star O.J. Simpson pleaded no contest Monday to a 
charge that he beat his wife at their Brentwood home New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, 41, entered the plea to one count of spousal battery through his 
attorney, Howard Weitzman, in West Los Angeles Municipal Court, said city 
attorney's spokesman Mike Qualls. 
</P>
<P>
The plea is not an admission of guilt, but allows the defendant to be judged as 
guilty. A no-contest plea allows a defendant to deny guilt in another legal 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson is accused of slapping, kicking and threatening to kill his wife, 
Nicole, in the New Year's Day argument. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is set for Wednesday in West Los Angeles Municipal Court. The 
maximum penalty is a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Avalon City Council has asked officials of the all-male Tuna Club to meet 
with them in July to discuss concerns that some of the club's practices 
discriminate against women. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon City Manager Chuck Prince said that "there are some continuing concerns" 
about reports that the facility is divided into men-only and women-only areas. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the nature of the practice," Prince said, "simply an explanation 
isn't sufficient. They're going to have to change that practice." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter last month, City Atty. Michael Jenkins notified the sportfishing 
club that such separate rooms would constitute sexual discrimination, "which 
would be unacceptable to the city and unlawful in a publicly owned facility." 
</P>
<P>
The club on Santa Catalina Island leases its oceanfront facilities from the 
city.

You may recall the stories of parents discovering to their horror that their 
children had fallen prey to advertisements for 976-prefix, dial-a-porn numbers 
and had run up hundreds of dollars in telephone bills. 
</P>
<P>
Now City Hall is having the same problem. 
</P>
<P>
An internal audit has revealed that city phones may have rung up as much as 
$8,000 in charges in the last year for calls to such nongovernment concerns as 
"Adult Fantasy Line," "Call Me, I'm Michelle -- Live" and "Gay Introductions." 
</P>
<P>
So, as of June 25, the General Services Department plans to block access to all 
pay-per-call numbers on the city's lines. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an ugly part of the operation," conceded Don Keith, director of 
communications for General Services. "But we had to wait until the (state) 
Public Utilities Commission gave Pac Bell permission to block those lines." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the naughty calls were made during off hours, including some traced to 
one city councilman's phone. The culprits turned out to be employees of a 
company that had installed carpet in the councilman's office. 
</P>
<P>
Keith pointed out that dial-a-porn has ballooned the city's multimillion-dollar 
phone bill only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the city wastes more money in other areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales of a T-shirt that says, "Long Beach Police -- We Do Windows," have been 
halted, according to its designer. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Gorba, an emergency room clerk at a hospital, said that she would donate 
the $800 in profit she has made to charity, inasmuch as the shirt has drawn 
criticism from dozens of residents as well as the city's mayor and police 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
The slogan refers to a January incident in which Long Beach Police Officer Mark 
Dickey allegedly pushed Don Jackson, a black civil rights activist, head-first 
into the window of a motorcycle shop. Dickey, who is white, faces a charge of 
assault in the case, which was secretely videotaped and drew national 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Gorba said the T-shirt represented "a kind of gallows humor around the 
emergency room. It was tongue-in-cheek stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Dickey and Officer Mark Ramsey, who are also charged with filing a false police 
report, had previously rejected use of the profits for their defense. 
</P>
<P>

In the midst of a search for 4,000 species of birds, author Jim Clements 
stumbled upon a yellow-feathered, 8-foot-tall giant at the County Museum of 
Natural History. Clements, whose quest is intended to raise money for the 
museum's Hall of Birds, dubbed the one-of-a-kind creature Megagallus humongous.

Mayor Tom Bradley's aides vowed recently that he'll soon unleash some major 
policy proposals to show that Hizzoner isn't being hampered by the myriad 
investigations into his personal finances.

It was just a coincidence that a film crew was stationed on the mayor's floor 
Monday, shooting a film called "Vital Signs."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RTD TO GET 30 BUSES FUELED BY METHANOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty new methanol-powered buses will be added to the RTD fleet in Los Angeles 
this summer, doubling the number of such vehicles in use in the nation, transit 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"RTD is proud to be a leader in the field of testing alternative fuels as a 
viable way of improving air quality," said Southern California Rapid Transit 
District Board President Gordana Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the new $164,000, 40-foot coaches was unveiled Monday, along with 
an identifying logo -- a white cross within a circle to denote good health. 
Each bus seats 43 passengers and is equipped with a lift for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Methanol, a colorless liquid with a faint alcohol odor, is made from natural 
gas and emits less smoke than diesel fuel. To achieve equivalent horsepower, 
however, twice as much methanol must be burned as diesel. RTD is buying 
methanol for 53 cents a gallon under a special program with the state.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VETERAN PROSECUTOR SUSPENDED WITH PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran Los Angeles County prosecutor has been suspended amid charges of 
deliberate misconduct in an attempt to gain a tactical advantage in a 1988 
robbery trial. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalie Morton, a deputy district attorney in the San Fernando Courthouse, was 
suspended with pay based on a preliminary review of the case by U.S. Magistrate 
Volney Brown, said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations stem from a robbery trial in which Morton, 66, introduced 
evidence in her opening statement to the jury that the judge had ruled 
inadmissible. A mistrial was subsequently declared and Morton filed a motion to 
disqualify the trial judge, Judge Dana Senit Henry. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys then filed a plea with Henry charging that Morton forced a 
mistrial in an attempt to have the case tried again before a new judge that 
would admit the suppressed evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Morton is a 19-year-veteran of the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL ACCUSED OF FAVORING REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southwest Carson neighborhood leaders have accused City Council members of 
subjecting residents to "environmental abuse" by not opposing a controversial 
project at the Fletcher Oil refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Post charged that council members are too close to industry and fail to 
heed neighborhood concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher is building a $16-million vacuum distillation unit that will allow 
production of asphalt at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Post said Fletcher's 1978 conditional use permit has expired and the project 
cannot proceed until an environmental impact report is updated. City Atty. 
Glenn Watson said he will take a second look at whether the refinery should 
file an updated environmental impact report.

ARMENIAN PAPER MODERNIZES, BUT KEEPS LINKS WITH THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When George Mason drove into Fresno to start an English-language weekly 
newspaper for Armenians in 1959, there were about 50,000 Armenians in 
California. They were mostly fruit farmers who had lived for a generation or 
more in California. And they wanted a way to keep in touch with a culture whose 
language they had mostly forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Mason is a Beverly Hills financier and the Courier is based in Glendale. 
His paper's original editor, Reese Cleghorn, is dean of the College of 
Journalism at the University of Maryland, and the modest paper they founded in 
the back of a gas station is the state's oldest Armenian newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
It is virtually unknown outside the Armenian-American community, but among its 
readers -- immigrants and children of immigrants -- it is a link to the simpler 
Armenian life style of a generation ago and a fiercely independent political 
journal that tackles the problems of the Southern California Armenian community 
today. 
</P>
<P>
It has survived, Armenian scholars say, by adapting to the times. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, a group of California Armenians toasted the Courier at a lavish 
$500-a-plate banquet, with Gov. George Deukmejian as guest speaker. 
</P>
<P>
The Courier, now owned by a young Armenian from Syria, Harut Sassounian, has 
3,000 subscribers and an estimated readership three times that. It has offices 
in an Armenian-owned building in Glendale, a city whose population is about 
one-fourth Armenian. 
</P>
<P>
It circulates in 35 states and 20 foreign countries. Its subscribers, an 
affluent, worldly group, include Deukmejian and former California Court of 
Appeal Justice Richard Amerian. It is owned and edited by a Columbia University 
graduate who writes articles about U.S. refugee policy, and it takes 
controversial stands that often get its readership hopping mad. 
</P>
<P>
"The amazing thing about the Courier is the extent to which it has mirrored the 
community's growth of self-confidence," said Salpi Ghazarian, director of the 
West Coast office of the Zoryan Institute, a nonprofit Armenian educational 
foundation. "It started out as a small little weekly and has grown to a point 
where there is more discussion of political and social issues that are 
difficult and controversial. This is a crisis time for Armenians and the 
Courier is one of the few papers dealing with that." 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian-American community, with a Southern California population of more 
than 250,000 and thousands more arriving every month, is swiftly changing. The 
Courier is read by leaders of many of the Armenian organizations that serve the 
refugees and by many of the organizations still coping with the aftermath of 
December's earthquake in Soviet Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
The Courier began responding to some of those concerns a few years ago, under 
the leadership of Sassounian, the paper's editor since 1983. The paper has 
become lively, political and a good deal more liberal than many of its readers, 
but so far it has retained the loyalty of its founders and longtime 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Shamlian, an Armenian banker who lives in Glendale, has been a Courier 
subscriber since the beginning. He kept his subscription after Sassounian and 
his wife, Irene, took over, and doesn't mind the way the paper has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually I don't agree with Harut's point of view; he's a little bit more 
liberal than I," Shamlian said. "But it's nice to have a contrasting point of 
view. It opens up your thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
There are at least five Armenian newspapers in Los Angeles today and about a 
dozen more around the country. Several publish in English and several based in 
Boston are older than the Courier. 
</P>
<P>
But the Courier is one of only three papers published in English not affiliated 
with one of the Armenian political parties. Its motto is "The Newspaper for All 
Armenians." 
</P>
<P>
Sassounian bought the weekly from Mason in 1986, three years after taking over 
as editor. From the first, he insisted on moving the paper to Los Angeles, the 
heart of Armenian life in the United States. Once a money loser, the paper has 
increased its advertising by almost 75% and turns enough of a profit to support 
Sassounian and his wife. Sassounian has done it by working late at night and on 
weekends and learning about journalism through common sense. 
</P>
<P>
Sassounian is Syrian by birth and political by temperament. He has a master's 
degree in business from Pepperdine University and one from Columbia University 
in international relations. He speaks Armenian, Arabic, English and French. 
</P>
<P>
Sassounian is one of the more recent arrivals among Armenians who derisively 
call people such as Mason and the Fresno community his paper served "shish 
kebab" Armenians -- suggesting that their interest in their homeland's culture 
ends with a skewer of meat. 
</P>
<P>
The Courier under Sassounian concerns itself intimately with Armenian culture. 
He reviews events and political lectures, travels to Washington and New York to 
interview Armenian leaders there, and has written about international issues 
such as arms talks, Soviet glasnost, the age-old conflict between Armenians and 
Turks, and the recent heated ethnic protests in Soviet Armenia.

BLACK CHURCHES QUIETLY WAGE WINNING WAR AGAINST A SILENT KILLER: HIGH BLOOD 
PRESSURE

DURANT, Miss. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the first Sunday of every month, Mary Glover-Horton brings to church a 
stethoscope and an aneroid manometer, a Velcro-banded instrument for measuring 
arterial blood pressure. After worship, she sets up shop in the fellowship 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, the dozen or so members of the Durant Missionary Baptist church who 
have been identified as hypertensive -- including her mother, father and 
grandmother -- sit down, stretch out their arms and have their blood pressure 
checked. 
</P>
<P>
Those whose readings are within acceptable limits are praised for sticking to 
their regimens. Those in the danger zone are questioned: "Have you been staying 
off the salt? Have you been taking your medication regularly? Have you been 
under any unusual stress lately?" 
</P>
<P>
Glover-Horton and her church were pioneers eight years ago when they set up the 
volunteer testing. Now they are part of one of the quiet success stories of 
American public health. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by growing alarm over high rates of hypertension among blacks, blood 
pressure control workers are joining deacons, pastors and church secretaries as 
regular fixtures among black congregations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
In the program involving Durant Missionary and 16 other churches in central 
Mississippi -- a region with the highest documented rates of hypertension in 
the world -- participants have achieved an overall 80% success rate in keeping 
their blood pressure under control. That compares with an average of less than 
35% among all hypertension sufferers, according to the latest national figures. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an idea that is exploding nationally," said Dennis A. Frate, program 
director of the University of Mississippi's Rural Health Research Program, 
which instituted the church project in central Mississippi and has published a 
free guide for churches interested in setting up similar programs. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, two dozen churches and more than 250 volunteers in the 
predominantly black southeast quadrant are involved in a project that has 
screened more than 2,300 residents since it was initiated five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Francisco Bay Area, which has one of the oldest and largest high 
blood pressure control programs in the nation, the work among the churches in a 
six-county district has been so successful that the program has been expanded 
to include post offices, barber shops and public housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the movement appears not to have gained much ground yet. The 
Watts Health Foundation operates one of the few programs: weekly screening 
sessions by a mobile unit that goes to about half a dozen churches in the 
South-Central section and screens about 75 to 100 people weekly. 
</P>
<P>
The local chapter of the American Heart Assn. notes, however, that most senior 
citizen centers in Los Angeles County screen elderly residents once a month. 
More than 60 million Americans of all races are estimated to suffer from high 
blood pressure, a major contributor to strokes, kidney failures and heart 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
But for reasons that still perplex health researchers, blacks are twice as 
likely as whites to have the disease -- which is sometimes called the "silent 
killer" because its symptoms usually go undetected unless medically diagnosed. 
Moreover, blacks are dying at a rate three times greater than that of whites as 
a result of untreated high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
There is no known cure, but effective treatments usually involve some 
combination of low-salt and low-fat diets, anti-hypertensive medication and 
changes in health habits, such as rest and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is to keep people on their treatment regime. It is especially 
pronounced among blacks on the lower economic rungs, who are among the most 
likely candidates to have hypertension and the least likely to seek medical 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"This problem of non-compliance in hypertension therapy is a major contributing 
factor to the reason cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 cause of death in this 
country," Frate said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peer Pressure Helps 
</P>
<P>
This is where the church steps in. Next to the family, it is usually the major 
social institution in black neighborhoods and communities. As such, it is a 
place where people congregate regularly and where peer pressure easily can be 
brought to bear to ensure the diagnosed hypertensives stay on their treatments. 
</P>
<P>
The programs require little more than the $50 cost of a stethoscope and a 
manometer and the half-day or so that it takes to train a volunteer. And the 
payoffs can be dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
In central Mississippi, volunteers were chosen from each of the churches to 
serve as hypertension control counselors. Each was trained in measuring blood 
pressure and was given a basic education on therapies. 
</P>
<P>
Under guidance of staff from the Rural Health Research Program, based in 
Goodman, volunteers screened their congregations to identify members with 
hypertension. From then on, periodic monitoring sessions -- usually scheduled 
once a month after religious services in most churches -- were all that 
basically was required to keep the programs going. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten to the point where I can tell when a person's pressure is up 
sometimes just by looking at them," Glover-Horton said. "Their ankles may be 
swollen or their eyes may be puffy." 
</P>
<P>
If any of her charges misses a session, she checks up on them during the week. 
</P>
<P>
Frate said that the unusual effectiveness of church-based hypertension control 
programs stems from just such close, personal interaction between volunteers 
and church members. 
</P>
<P>
"People need support to get through their therapy," he said. "That's what the 
church provides. It's really a simple form of what I call sophisticated 
nagging. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In many churches, there also is a sense of competition among members who are 
hypertensive, and they get on each other about staying on their medication and 
getting their blood pressure checked regularly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost All Cases 
</P>
<P>
Frate said that, if it has not advanced to a critical stage, hypertension 
ordinarily can be brought under control in almost all cases. 
</P>
<P>
When it was pointed out to one hypertension victim in the central Mississippi 
project that she was compounding the danger of her condition by cooking with 
bacon drippings, then adding salt to season the food, she put the bacon 
drippings in a container and shipped it off to her son in Chicago.

THEY'RE COSTLY RETREATS FOR OVERWEIGHT KIDS, BUT DO THEY GET TO THE HEART OF 
THE PROBLEM?

<P>
They arrive with swim suits, sandals and a shared dream: to begin the new 
school year svelte shadows of their former selves. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the world of weight-loss camps for kids, where the unspoken motto is 
simple -- "Have fun, lose pounds." In body-conscious Southern California, 
business appears to be booming with at least eight such camps now preparing for 
the upcoming summer season. Most offer sessions from two to eight weeks and 
promise weekly losses of three or more pounds. Some are coed with campers as 
young as 8; others are segregated by gender and offer separate programs for 
preteens, teens and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
That business is brisk is no surprise given that children and teens have been 
steadily expanding in numbers and girth. The American Academy of Pediatrics 
estimates up to 30% of children and adolescents in the U.S. exceed the healthy 
height-weight range recommended by government guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone agrees that sending a plump preteen or adolescent to camp is 
the best solution to a weight problem. Programs that stress rapid weight loss 
and don't have intensive parental involvement can be counterproductive, said 
Laurel Mellin, a registered dietitian who directs the Center for Adolescent 
Obesity at the UC San Francisco School of Medicine. She worries about programs 
that don't get to the root of obesity, which could spring from depression, too 
much television viewing or family problems. Another potential danger is weight 
yo-yoing, added Mellin, who believes overweight kids should lose no more than a 
pound a week. 
</P>
<P>
Other experts say the camps are too expensive, costing from $600 to $850 a week 
in Southern California, compared to weekly fees of $480 and $550 at two 
traditional camps. And when it comes to keeping weight off, a day camp approach 
-- offering many of the same tools at a fraction of the charge -- may be a 
better bet, note other weight control specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the resident camp approach maintain campers are bound to lose 
weight when exposed to healthful menus and lots of physical activity. Fees are 
higher, they point out, because of highly trained staffs which usually include 
a doctor on call and a nurse and nutritionist on 24-hour duty. 
</P>
<P>
Schedules vary from camp to camp, but the daily agenda at Camp Murrieta, a San 
Diego weight-loss camp for girls is fairly typical. The wake-up call is at 6:30 
a.m., followed by breakfast and an exercise session of walking, jogging or 
running. After lunch there are group rap sessions, nutrition classes, field 
trips and a late-afternoon aerobics class. 
</P>
<P>
"We have speakers talk about hair care; we have drama, arts and crafts and 
other classes," said camp director David Kempton. After dinner, he added, 
there's time to socialize. 
</P>
<P>
Most campers come with 20 or 30 pounds to lose, say directors, but most accept 
normal weight participants as well. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the goal, menus are carefully controlled. Both Camp California, near 
Santa Barbara, and Camp Ojai, run by Weight Watchers, follow the program's diet 
plan, which allows choices of foods from different categories, said Tony 
Sparber, the camps' executive director. The menus at Camp Murrieta and Camp Del 
Mar, also directed by Kempton, are patterned after guidelines established by 
the American Dietetic and American Heart associations. 
</P>
<P>
Other camps teach how to count calories. At Camp Camelot in Whittier, for 
instance, boys are limited to about 1,500 per day; girls, 1,200. The approach, 
said director Michele Friedman, is based on a meal plan adopted by the New York 
City Board of Health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Goodies Banned 
</P>
<P>
Some camps prohibit marshmallows and other traditional goodies; others do not. 
At Castleview Camps, opening a new site in San Diego this summer, popcorn will 
be substituted for marshmallows, said Jim Denniston, executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Reasoning that kids need to learn moderation, Kempton prefers to introduce 
foods like marshmallows and ice cream, "because we want (campers) to know 
nothing's forbidden." 
</P>
<P>
To test campers' resolve in the real world, "We take them to the movies and 
Universal Studios, where there are high-calorie temptations," Friedman of Camp 
Camelot said. If they cave in and get ice cream, it must be counted in the 
calorie tally. "They have to learn thin people simply make the right choices," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Progress is monitored by weigh-ins and, at some camps, by periodic evaluations 
of body fat. But the emphasis goes beyond the scale and calipers, say 
directors. Campers also learn how to develop good nutritional and exercise 
habits and how to make the mental switch from fat to thin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boosting Self-Image 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish that, most camps have therapists or counselors to initiate 
discussions. Campers are encouraged to talk to each other about eating habits 
and how being overweight affects them. "We try to boost self-image," Kempton 
said. "It's tied in with the ability to feel in control." 
</P>
<P>
Group dynamics help bring the programs together, say proponents, who maintain 
kids feel less embarrassed about their weight problems when surrounded by 
others in the same boat. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids compare weight loss," explained Kevin Sands of Encino, a 16-year-old 
veteran camper. "Or they challenge each other to see who can lose the most." 
Said another camp veteran: "I liked the fact that everyone was alike -- 
everyone had weight to lose." 
</P>
<P>
However, the buddy system isn't foolproof. "Some of the thinner girls would 
tease the fatter girls," recalled one former camper. "They would talk behind 
girls' backs, saying things like, 'Isn't she big?' " 
</P>
<P>
THE FOLLOW-UP 
</P>
<P>
Losing weight at a summer camp is just the beginning; keeping it off at home is 
the real challenge. So once camp ends, follow-up begins. 
</P>
<P>
"We send them home with diets and menus," Friedman said. Other programs send 
monthly newsletters or telephone graduates at regular intervals for progress 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
Those who attend Camp La Jolla take home an exercise video and an invitation to 
call toll-free for advice or a pep talk. Campers at Camp Murrieta and Camp Del 
Mar are grouped according to hometowns, said Kempton, and once home are 
encouraged to form support groups. 
</P>
<P>
Weight Watcher camps offer free eight-week memberships to campers, allowing 
them to attend meetings in their communities, Sparber said. 
</P>
<P>
Also considered crucial to long-term success is parent involvement. Camp La 
Jolla invites parents to a weekend, free of charge, said executive director 
Nancy Lenhart. Other camps provide parents with instructional materials or 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
THE RESULTS 
</P>
<P>
In a follow-up survey, Camp Camelot found that 75% of graduates who answered a 
progress report had maintained their weight loss a year later. The figure for 
the same period was 82% among La Jolla graduates. Yet even camp directors 
acknowledge the built-in biases of such surveys, noting that those who regain 
weight aren't likely to respond. 
</P>
<P>
Some weight-control experts believe such success rates are much lower but don't 
have the scientific data to prove it. Studies are almost nonexistent with one 
exception -- a report on 18 boys who attended a weight-loss camp in 1981, 
published two years later in the International Journal of Obesity. In a 
seven-week period the boys lost an average of 29 pounds, reported Judith Stern, 
a UC Davis professor of nutrition. Average body fat decreased from 39% to 27.5% 
-- noteworthy but still higher than ideal for them, she said. "What was 
remarkable was the loss of fat, not muscle," she added. "And the boys felt good 
about themselves. They viewed themselves (at the end) as normal weight. That's 
unusual (for formerly fat people)." 
</P>
<P>
FINDING THE RIGHT CAMP 
</P>
<P>
To maximize the experience, experts suggest the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be wary of camps that promise too much too fast. Exactly how quickly 
adolescents and preteens should lose weight is a matter of debate. While some 
promise campers will shed three to five pounds a week, some obesity experts say 
that's too much. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be sure the child is motivated. "When parents push weight loss too much, 
the child resists," noted Dr. Barbara Ferguson, a child psychiatrist who 
directs the Child Study Center at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Obtain a thorough physical examination beforehand. Most camps require one 
before enrolling, but an examination might also turn up depression or other 
conditions contributing to a weight problem, said Dr. Adel Eldahmy, a Long 
Beach psychiatrist who specializes in treating eating disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If a weight-loss camp is not nearby or not financially feasible, consider a 
traditional camp and alert the staff to your child's need to lose weight, said 
Albert Marston, a USC professor of psychology and weight control expert. 
</P>

 -- Ask about the expertise of the staff. Most weight loss camps in Southern 
California are accredited by the American Camping Assn., but there are no 
special requirements for weight loss camps, said Shirley Walch, executive 
director of the association's Southern California chapter. Parents should 
inquire about the staff's expertise and training in weight control. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Request documented weight-loss results, or ask about average weight loss. 
Talk to parents who have sent their children to the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't skimp. A two-week session is probably not enough to instill habit 
changes, said Dr. Morton H. Maxwell, a UCLA clinical professor of medicine and 
director of its Risk Factor Obesity Program. A four-week session is better but 
eight weeks is ideal, he said, noting it takes months to change eating habits.

AN END RUN AROUND CHINA LIVE-TV BAN 
</P>

Still hampered by a ban on live broadcasts from China, the three major 
broadcast networks and CNN continued Monday to ferry out footage of the 
protests in Beijing that news crews taped despite severe martial law 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Couriers and staffers were able to bring the footage out for relay from network 
satellite facilities in Tokyo and Hong Kong. The most prominent tape-toter 
since the prohibition on live transmissions took effect Friday night (U.S. 
time) was CBS anchor Dan Rather, who left Beijing Saturday. Piper Parry, a Hong 
Kong-based CNN publicist who was in Beijing when the protests erupted, also 
brought tapes out over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some instances of authorities trying to confiscate network tapes at the 
Beijing airport, network officials were keeping their fingers crossed that they 
would be able to get more footage out. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, ABC and CNN, meanwhile, were trying to send more correspondents in, 
despite government restrictions on reporting -- such as a ban on taping at Tien 
An Men Square, which several news crews disregarded Sunday without incident. 
</P>
<P>
NBC News, a spokeswoman said, was seeking visas for three additions to its 
Beijing staff -- correspondents Arthur Kent and Rick Davis, and Keith Morrison, 
an anchor at NBC-owned KNBC Channel 4 in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
ABC said it was dispatching Mark Litke from Manila on Monday night and Moscow 
correspondent Jim Laurie on Thursday. CNN, which already has a 60-member staff 
in Beijing, sent Brian Jenkins from his Tokyo post. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its staff buildup, NBC also worked out an arrangement with 
Britain's BBC and Canada's CBC network to share Beijing footage taped by those 
organizations' correspondents and news crews, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the tapes out of Beijing remained a big concern for all the networks. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, "there were a couple of attempts at confiscations" of CBS 
news tapes by government authorities, said Don DeCesare, CBS vice president for 
news coverage. "But so far, we're getting it. We have a lot more trouble with 
that sort of thing in other places." 
</P>
<P>
But the situation in Beijing could change at any time, he added. "We're just 
trying to be relaxed and do what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Network reporters in Beijing still were able to report live by phone Monday, 
despite fears over the weekend by some there, among them CNN anchor Bernard 
Shaw, that authorities might cut off phone service. 
</P>
<P>
The portable satellite transmitters that CBS and CNN brought to Beijing 
remained off, by government order. But not CNN's Charles Hoff, who until Friday 
had been in charge of the operation of that network's transmitter. A former 
correspondent, he was back on reporting duty over the weekend, with his taped 
report on events in Beijing played in the United States early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Network executives continued to hope that China might lift its ban on live 
video transmissions, since there is a delay of five to seven hours in getting 
taped footage to Tokyo or Hong Kong. ABC has ordered satellite time from an 
international satellite authority just in case, said Robert Murphy, vice 
president for news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"We check every time we can, and we've ordered the (satellite) birds every 
day," he said, but the authorities "have given no indication when they might 
start taking them again."

FEE PROBLEMS MAR COUNTRY FEST

Country singer T. Graham Brown left the Country Fest '89 at the Santa Fe Dam 
Recreation Area in Irwindale without performing Sunday after the event's 
promoter was unable to pay the singer's contracted fee, the promoter 
acknowledged Sunday. Several other musicians were also not paid in full, but 
agreed to perform after getting partial payment. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Milt Petty blamed his lack of funds during the event to poor turnout 
(a two-day total of 18,000 compared to more than 70,000 last year) and the 
"withholding" of some of the promised corporate sponsorship money. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Miller Brewing Co., the event's primary corporate sponsor, said 
on Monday that half of the promised funds were delivered before the concert 
began on Saturday and the remainder was delivered Sunday night upon the event's 
conclusion. Neither Miller nor Petty would disclose the amount. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to let the people down," Brown said by phone from his Nashville 
home Monday. "That was my first concern. This is the first time since I've been 
making records that I haven't gone on . . . It's a no-win situation for the 
artist." 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Crowell performed after settling for transportation costs, according to 
Crowell's road manager, Lin Smith. Crowell, who engaged in a tense backstage 
conversation with Petty before agreeing to perform, said he felt uneasy about 
going on stage after his friends Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt told him that 
they had not been fully paid for Saturday's appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"Every promoter thinks he's going to have a good walk-up business," a dejected 
Petty said late Sunday. "We thought word-of-mouth would be enough to bring 
people."STEVE HOCHMAN

Patrick Swayze fans who turned out to see their favorite hunk as a bar bouncer 
gave "Road House" a respectable opening. During its first weekend in release, 
the MGM/UA film grossed nearly $6 million at 1,927 theaters, a per-screen 
average of $3,092. And the Richard Pryor-Gene Wilder comedy, "See No Evil, Hear 
No Evil," continued to enjoy strong business in its second week, grossing $6.1 
million at 1,680 theaters, or $3,634 per screen. But both movies are likely to 
take a beating when Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" opens 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
* Fox's teen comedy, "How I Got Into College," easily qualified as a bomb, 
grossing only $651,850 at 743 theaters. Meanwhile, New Century Vista's horror 
picture, "Fright Night Part II," enjoyed fairly good business at 148 theaters, 
where it grossed $3,704 per screen.

NBC, AFFILIATES AGREE ON NEW INCENTIVE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The traditional system by which network-affiliated TV stations are paid by 
their respective network for carrying its programming and advertising is being 
revamped at the annual NBC affiliates convention here this week. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a straight deal in which the network and its affiliate agree to a 
fixed fee that is based largely on how the station ranks in its market, NBC and 
its stations have agreed on a new "incentive-driven" compensation plan that 
could see rates vary. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike NBC's attempt last fall to cut its approximately $145-million annual 
compensation budget, the new plan initially will provide about the same amount 
of compensation dollars, though they may be redistributed to the benefit or 
loss of given stations. 
</P>
<P>
Each station's slice of the pie, moreover, could also grow or shrink in 
subsequent years depending on NBC's overall profitability. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference during the convention, which began Sunday and ends today, 
NBC Television Network President Pierson Mapes said that the network would base 
its re-evaluation of each of its 208 affiliated stations on four criteria: Its 
local audience ratings in the 4-8 p.m. time slot leading into prime time; its 
performance at other times of the day; the size of its market, and "subjective" 
evaluation of the station's effectiveness in promoting NBC shows, along with 
consideration of other financial factors affecting the station. 
</P>
<P>
Mapes also said that compensation would be affected by how much NBC programming 
a given station clears. Questioned whether that policy would interfere with 
Federal Communications Commission rulings preventing networks from interfering 
with a station's right to refuse unsatisfactory programming, he said a station 
would have to fail to clear the majority of NBC programs in order to suffer 
significant compensation loss. 
</P>
<P>
Mapes added that in the first year of the new plan, NBC will avoid any major 
changes in station compensation by "capping the spikes" at 20% -- that is, no 
station will increase or lose more than 20% of its current compensation 
regardless of performance. 
</P>
<P>
Having compensation dependent not only on individual station performance but 
also on NBC's overall success as a network "gives great incentive for everyone 
to pull their oars in tandem" and may provide a model for ABC and CBS in the 
future, Mapes said.

SUSPECT RECANTS CONFESSION IN SKI MASK BANDIT ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Razo, who emerged from a modest La Habra neighborhood to win an academic 
scholarship at Harvard University, denied Monday that he was the Ski Mask 
Bandit and testified that he was high on drugs and thought he was God when he 
confessed to a string of holdups. 
</P>
<P>
Razo, 22, told Orange County Superior Court jurors in Santa Ana that the 
confessions he gave to both police and reporters in 1987 were based on the 
exploits of a real armed robber who had been a friend. 
</P>
<P>
He also testified that his Harvard studies intensified his interest in crime, 
but he refused to divulge the alleged real robber's name. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a young armed man wearing a ski mask held up about a dozen stores 
at gunpoint in Orange and Los Angeles counties from about 1985 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Razo confessed to police that he committed those robberies while on vacations 
from Harvard, but on the witness stand Monday, Razo said he had used the 
mind-altering drug PCP for about a month before he made his confessions. 
</P>
<P>
He said his mind was so distorted when he went to police in June, 1987, that he 
believed that he was divine. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I was Christ," he testified. "I felt I had the ability to ask for 
anything I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Razo testified that he had encountered the real Ski Mask Bandit more than a 
year before he confessed to the man's crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by the prosecution, Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Ravinder Mehta three times asked, "Who is the robber, Mr. Razo?" 
</P>
<P>
Razo's only response was: "I can't answer that. I've already involved myself. I 
fear if I involve someone else . . ." He did not complete the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of defense attorney John Barnett, Judge Jean M. Rheinheimer 
recessed the court late Monday afternoon before Mehta could continue to press 
Razo about "the robber." 
</P>
<P>
But Mehta said outside the courtroom that he will continue the same questioning 
this morning when court resumes. "If he knows, he should tell," the deputy 
district attorney said, but he added: "I personally think Razo was the robber. 
Why else would I be prosecuting him?" 
</P>
<P>
Razo is accused of holding up the stores and escaping with thousands of 
dollars. In his confessions and interviews with reporters after his arrest in 
1987, Razo said he used the money to help his family and friends. He also said 
he used some of the money for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, Razo's court-appointed attorney, told the jury that PCP 
(phencyclidine, also known as "angel dust") caused Razo to confess to crimes he 
did not commit. 
</P>
<P>
And Barnett, in his opening statement, said he would also prove that Razo 
became enmeshed in learning about the crimes he confessed to because of his 
Harvard studies. One of Razo's sophomore courses in 1986-87 -- the academic 
year just before he was arrested -- was entitled "Crime and Human Nature." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett told the jury: "Once Mr. Razo went to Harvard, he was interested in 
(studying) why a disproportionate number of Chicano youth wound up in prison." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said Razo thus was academically interested when he met the real robber. 
</P>
<P>
Razo was the first defense witness. As the defendant, he had the constitutional 
right not to be required to testify. But Razo waived that right by taking the 
stand -- and thus left himself open to cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
The trial began May 5. Barnett said Monday that he expects the defense phase to 
last 2 more weeks before the case goes to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a businesslike, charcoal-gray suit, gray-patterned tie and white 
shirt, Razo looked like the Ivy League scholar he had been before his 1987 
arrest. Razo won the academic scholarship to Harvard after being a star 
football player and scholar at Servite High, a Catholic boys' school in 
Anaheim. During his high school years, Razo had also been very active in an 
affiliate of the Boys' Club of La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
As a virtual model youth of the community, Razo's arrest 2 years ago shocked 
teachers and adults who had worked with him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used Marijuana Extensively 
</P>
<P>
But on the witness stand Monday, Razo, in response to prosecution questions, 
conceded that he had used marijuana throughout his junior high and high school 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Razo, however, said he had not used any "hard" drugs, such as cocaine, and said 
he experimented with PCP only beginning in May, 1987, when he returned to La 
Habra from his sophomore year at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett asked Razo why he started using PCP. Razo looked down at his hands and 
quietly responded: "I think there were a whole lot of factors. It was easily 
the most regrettable decision of my life." 
</P>
<P>
In response to other questions from his attorney, Razo said he had some painful 
adjustment problems because of shifting between La Habra and the heady academic 
world of Harvard in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Razo said: "I was feeling very guilty about being a student at Harvard and the 
direction my life was heading, compared to my friends at home. . . . I felt I 
had to come back and find my roots, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feelings of Estrangement 
</P>
<P>
Razo also said he confessed to the robberies, in part, because of his feeling 
of estrangement from his Latino friends. "In hindsight, I felt that that by 
confessing I would be part of their misery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Razo indicated that his mind had been essentially altered by PCP use when 
he made his police confessions. As jurors watched, Barnett played a videotape 
of Razo's June 6, 1987, talk with police, shortly before he was arrested. 
During that tape, Razo made bizarre statements to the officers, including: "God 
has sent me to change the world. . . . I have seen the Lord and spoken to Him." 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination, Razo said he had met the real robber "by chance" 
shortly after the man had committed the first of the string of robberies -- a 
holdup of a dairy near Razo's home in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Razo said "the robber" was a friend from his elementary school days in La 
Habra. Razo said he was "fascinated" by the man's discussion of his holdups. 
</P>
<P>
But Razo said he did not help the man commit the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta, the prosecutor, asked Razo a string of questions about "the robber." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls to Harvard? 
</P>
<P>
"Was he a good friend of yours?" Mehta asked. 
</P>
<P>
Razo answered, "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Mehta also asked, "How many times did he call you" at Harvard? 
</P>
<P>
Razo responded, "Perhaps once a month." 
</P>
<P>
Razo said he learned virtually all of the details of the crimes he confessed to 
from talking to "the robber" about the actual holdups. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta said that in this morning's continuation of his cross-examination of 
Razo, the prosecution will try to uncover more about "the robber." 
</P>
<P>
But Mehta, in comments outside of court, said he believes that Razo has simply 
invented "the robber" as a fictitious scapegoat for his own crimes.

MAN BREAKS INTO BURNING HOUSE TO SAVE FOUNTAIN VALLEY WOMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old woman from Fountain Valley, Calif., apparently near death as her 
mother's home here burned around her, was saved by a man who broke through a 
door after seeing smoke at about 3 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
David Jones, 30, and his wife went to the burning house, pounding on doors and 
windows trying to wake anyone inside. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said he had seen two cars in the driveway and believed that there were 
people inside the burning house, so he broke through a sliding-glass door to 
the master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who was barefoot, plunged into the burning room. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pitch black," Jones said, and the smoke stung at his eyes, but he felt 
his way to the bed. 
</P>
<P>
There he found Julie Layton, who was watching the home for her vacationing 
mother. "I shook her and I said 'We got to get out of here, there's a fire.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jones said he put the woman's arm around his shoulder and helped her out of the 
house. As he brought Layton to the front yard, she recovered enough to tell him 
that she had been alone in the house. 
</P>
<P>
Layton suffered from smoke inhalation but no other injuries. She was treated 
and released at Chandler Regional Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that we were there because another 10 minutes and it would have been 
all over for her, " Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler Fire Department investigator Lou Carlucci said the fire started in a 
couch and may have been ignited by a smoldering cigarette. The house was 
destroyed, and damage was estimated at $70,000.

CALLOUS COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Costa Mesa City Council has delayed a final decision on a proposed new law 
that would give police the power to arrest people they thought "intended" to 
solicit employment on the street. It should have simply rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
In its frustrated effort to discourage dayworkers from gathering on city 
streets, Costa Mesa has been taking increasingly firm and insensitive steps. 
The city, which once sought more humanitarian approaches, already has a law 
that bans curb-side soliciting of employment. 
</P>
<P>
That ordinance, however, doesn't seem to have solved the problem. Dayworkers 
are still congregating on some streets. And obviously police haven't been able 
to catch enough of them making the curb-side job requests. So now the council 
is thinking of amending its ordinance to allow police to arrest people for 
soliciting jobs -- even if officers do not see them actually doing the dreaded 
deed. Circumstantial evidence, the proposal implies, will be enough to prove 
intent. 
</P>
<P>
One thing missing thus far is a guideline that would define the "intent" that 
would constitute the crime. Even more disturbing is the rationale outlined in a 
city memo supporting the amendment that reasoned, given the scarcity of police 
resources, that it was too much of a burden to require officers to actually 
observe a violation before they can make an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
If the city pursues that policy of expediency in other areas, too, we shudder 
to think what constitutional shortcuts it could take in making misdemeanor 
arrests on unseen acts, merely because the officer thought the suspect 
"intended" to violate the law. 
</P>
<P>
And would such a selective amendment to the city's anti-dayworker law put any 
Latino on the street in danger of being arrested because police thought he 
intended to solicit employment from someone in a car? 
</P>
<P>
It reminds us of the law Santa Ana tried to pass that would have allowed 
officers to arrest prostitutes for just being on Harbor Boulevard. A judge 
threw that out of court. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point is taking a far more sensible approach to the problem of dayworkers 
gathering on street corners. The city is exploring the idea of setting up a 
telephone hot line that would match employers with workers. It takes a new and 
possibly more effective tack that could fill the needs of the employers and 
workers and clear the streets of the groups of dayworkers that disturb many 
merchants and residents. And it is far preferable to Costa Mesa's callous 
approach of making it against the law to even "intend" to take to the streets 
to find a job.

Coach Jim Valvano's name has been put back into the title of Peter Golenbock's

<P>
A New York publishing company planned to delete Valvano's name from the book 
title to shorten it. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the publishing company said that the decision was 
misconstrued, so the book has its original name, "Personal Fouls: The Broken

SHORTSTOP IS DEDICATED, BUT IT'S NOT TO FASHION 
</P>

<P>
Saddleback High School shortstop Nikkanni Andrews stands out in a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
It is not just her athletic skills, which make her one of the fastest and most 
fluid players on almost any softball diamond. It is her dare-to-be different 
attitude. Her Bohemian approach to her wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
"She likes to dress a lot differently than anybody else in school," Saddleback 
Coach Yvonne Alonzo said. "She will come to practice with some really crazy 
clothes on. She will wear purples and greens and it just all mixes in and 
everybody knows its Nikkanni, and it looks good so she gets away with it. 
</P>
<P>
"She has got the tall, thin body type where any type of clothing she puts on 
will look good. Nobody likes to tease her because they know where Nikkanni 
stands." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews stands for individuality. She achieves it through her cutting-edge 
fashion off the softball diamond. On it, she achieves it with performance. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews, a junior, ended the regular season as the county leader in home runs 
(seven), runs scored (24) and was third in RBIs (21). And she has committed 
only three errors at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews, the Sea View League's co-most valuable player, has stolen 19 bases in 
20 attempts and helped Saddleback to a second-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Today, she will be wearing the standard Saddleback uniform when the Roadrunners 
play third-seeded Irvine at home in the second round of the Southern Section 
3-A playoffs. Even without her flamboyant wardrobe, she stands to be a player 
of impact for Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
"Nikkanni is so valuable because she can come through for you with a big hit," 
Alonzo said. "If she gets on base on a walk, she can make a big play happen 
because she can steal and possibly cause an overthrow. If she is on base, she 
is going to probably get into scoring postion and somebody else can drive her 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews is quick, but it is neither her speed nor her hitting that Alonzo 
values most. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably her attitude is the most valuable thing to the team," she said. "She 
is a real well-rounded kid as far as attitude goes. She keeps up her pep with 
everybody else on the team, and no matter how well she is doing, she is pretty 
level-headed about everything." 
</P>
<P>
Said Andrews: "I like to be different -- a lot different. I don't really have a 
style. I just wear whatever I want to. . . . A lot of people say I dress weird, 
but I just dress how I want to." 
</P>
<P>
But her fashion does not clash with her purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people just play softball because it is a sport, it is something they 
want to do because they think it is fun. I take it more seriously than that. 
I'm not saying that I am great or anything, but I do know what I am doing." 
</P>
<P>
In other 3-A games today: 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (18-12), the South Coast League's third-place representative, plays 
host to Montclair (22-4); Mission Viejo (15-8) is at home against top-seeded La 
Mirada (26-1); San Clemente (18-12) travels to West Torrance (18-6).

BATTLE OF HENLEY BROTHERS CARRIES INTO MINI-CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Growing up in La Verne, Darryl and Thomas Henley regularly lunged for each 
other's throat in an expression of brotherly love known as Smear Ball, a game 
that required a dozen or so neighborhood kids, a football and apparently little 
regard for human dignity. 
</P>
<P>
Smear Ball is short for Smear the Guy With the Ball, a title that pretty much 
covers the game's rules and intricacies. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl explained: "You'd get as many people as you want, get a football, and 
throw it up, and whoever gets it would . . . well, kill the guy with the ball 
was a little strong . . . we called it smear." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas remembers that the game was not without its time limits. 
</P>
<P>
"My father had a van and he didn't want anybody playing on the front lawn," he 
said. "We'd play until we heard the sound of his van coming around the corner. 
Then you'd see 10, 15 guys scatter." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take much to set the Henley brothers off -- dominoes, basketball, 
horseshoes, Smear. And Thomas didn't mind at all when Darryl was the Guy With 
the Ball! 
</P>
<P>
"We fought all the time," Darryl said. "We still fight -- about anything, 
stupid stuff, regular kid stuff. But with us, it was always longer and a little 
more intense." 
</P>
<P>
Little did they know they'd still be rolling around in the dirt after all these 
years, now as competitors in the same mini-camp for the same National Football 
League team, no less. 
</P>
<P>
But that's the way fate would have it. Darryl is the more famous Henley, a 
former UCLA star defensive back and second-round draft choice of the Rams last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, a year older, is a free-agent wide receiver from Stanford who nearly 
made the Rams' 45-man roster last season before being placed on injured reserve 
and later released. Thomas was good enough that the Rams asked him back this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
So who could have ever imagined they'd meet again like this? 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a once-in-a-lifetime deal," Thomas said. "It's very unique, 
though I think they've had brothers who played here before, Merlin and somebody 
(Phil) Olsen?" 
</P>
<P>
But once again, the Henleys are at each other's throats, so to speak. Thomas is 
a receiver whose chances of making the team are enhanced every time he beats 
his brother on a post pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl, the second-round cornerback, must be able to consistently cover his 
brother -- a free agent, for Pete's sake -- to prove he was worth a top draft 
choice. Also, Thomas' chances of sticking with the team were hurt when the Rams 
drafted Darryl, who figures to be the team's punt returner in 1989. Thomas 
returns punts, too. 
</P>
<P>
It could be heady stuff for some sibling rivals, but the Henleys seem to handle 
it well. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for this thing to work, he has to look at me as a defensive back and 
he's going to read off me like that," Darryl said. "And I'm going to read off 
him as a wideout, not as Thomas Henley." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas says the competition is good and clean, and relatively even. 
</P>
<P>
"We can go on the field and I can beat him deep," he said. "Then we can come 
back and he'll not let me get off the line. And we can talk about it. It's not 
a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Through all the years of youth leagues and high school, Thomas and Darryl 
played on the same team only once before, at Damien High. Thomas was a senior 
and Darryl a junior on a team that reached the 3-A football championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Though Darryl is a cinch to make the team and Thomas a long shot, Thomas 
insists there's more pressure on Darryl. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel pressure, because I've been through this before," Thomas said. "I 
know what to do, so I don't feel pressure. I think there's more pressure on him 
because he's a top-round draft choice and they expect him to perform." 
</P>
<P>
The Henleys say being in the same locker room is no problem, either. They hang 
out together anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"He's my brother, but when we come in the locker room, what can we talk about 
that I can't talk to the next guy about?" Darryl asked. "If it's something like 
family business, we'll wait and talk about it. I'm the same with him as I am to 
anybody else. But I do feel like I have to perform. If you're drafted high, you 
have to meet everyone's expectations. It's been a little difficult in the 
beginning. I'm just starting to feel more comfortable in learning the offense."

The Henleys agree that whatever happens this summer, there will be no hard 
feelings. Think of it as just another game of Smear -- with a few more rules.

Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams made it official Monday and announced the retirements of veteran 
fullback Mike Guman and linebacker Carl Ekern. Both players spent their entire 
careers with the Rams. Ekern was a 13-year veteran who had started at inside 
linebacker since 1981. He led the team in tackles three times and was named to 
the Pro Bowl in 1986. He ranks 10th on the team's all-time list for games 
played with 166. Guman gained 1,286 yards and scored 15 touchdowns in his 
nine-year career with the Rams, during which time he became a valuable and 
versatile player. Guman spent most of last season on injured reserve with a 
knee injury, though he appeared in the Rams' regular-season finale against San 
Francisco. . . . Eighty-two players attended the opening of mini-camp Monday. 
The only no-shows were quarterback Jim Everett, who was attending Dan Marino's 
golf tournament in Pittsburgh, punter Dale Hatcher and tailback Greg Bell. 
Bell, who is apparently headed for a long summer holdout, was summoned to a 
closed-door meeting with Coach John Robinson Monday morning. In Monday's 
edition of The Times, Bell was critical of Rams management and the handling of 
his contract negotiations.

FOR BUCKLES, IT'S PITCHER PERFECT; 
</P>
<P>
ANGEL PROSPECT HAS 'EM KNUCKING UNDER TO 'BUCKLE-BALL' 
</P>

<P>
Things have been going so well for Gary Buckels this season that it figured he 
would experience some kind of slump along the way. It happened last week. 
That's right, Buckels did something he hadn't done most of the season. He 
walked a batter. That makes two this year. 
</P>
<P>
Buckels, one of the Angels' top pitching prospects who plays with the club's 
double-A team in Midland, Tex., has appeared in 19 games as a reliever this 
year and has yet to allow an earned run in 22 1/3 innings. He has struck out 22 
and has a 2-0 record with nine saves. 
</P>
<P>
Control is one of his biggest strengths. Buckels spent the 1988 season with the 
Angels' Class-A Quad Cities team, where he struck out 109 while walking just 29 
in 79 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"For a reliever, it's especially important that you don't put guys on base," 
Buckels said. "You're usually coming in in tight situations. You've got to get 
an out." 
</P>
<P>
Buckels came into so many tight situations last year that he actually won 14 
games in just 79 innings as a reliever. That works out to a victory in just 
under every six innings he pitched last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed every time I pitched, the team would rally and get a couple runs," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of his more effective tools is the quasi-knuckleball Buckels developed. The 
one he has dubbed the Buckel-ball. 
</P>
<P>
Buckels said the pitch comes at a batter appearing to be a fastball, but takes 
a fierce drop once it reaches the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"With a curve or breaking pitch, a hitter can kind of tell that the pitch is 
going to break," Buckels said. "But mine just comes straight at them." 
</P>
<P>
Buckels, who said he used the pitch "about 95% of the time last year," grips 
the ball as a knuckleball, digging his fingernails into the ball, but he 
doesn't use the seams. The pitch came about as he was trying to emulate a 
friend's knuckleball. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept trying to copy his, but I couldn't get it right and I was getting 
pretty mad," Buckels said. "But then I realized that the way I was throwing the 
pitch, mine was dropping and his wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Calvert is enjoying one of his best seasons in the minors with the 
Philadelphia Phillies' double-A team at Reading, Pa. Calvert, a reserve catcher 
and part-time designated hitter, is hitting .400 with 18 hits in 45 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, after last season, not to mention off-season, there was hardly 
anywhere for him to go but up. 
</P>
<P>
Calvert signed with the Minnesota Twins organization out of Chapman College in 
1985 and played three seasons in that organization, enjoying his best season in 
1987 when he hit .290 for the Class-A Visalia Twins and was named to the 
California League all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
But Calvert was traded in 1988 to the Phillies and placed in Reading. He hit 
.180 and had what he generously calls "the worst possible season I could have." 
</P>
<P>
Calvert believes he was pushing a bit too hard to impress his new employers. 
</P>
<P>
"The harder I tried, the worse it got," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And it got even worse when Calvert came down with a virus that shot his 
temperature up to 104 degrees, gave him severe chest pains and left his left 
arm numb. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom had had a heart attack a couple years ago and she was pretty 
concerned," Calvert said. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out Calvert didn't have a heart attack, but the virus did do some 
damage to the sack around his heart. Enough damage that his doctor told Calvert 
to stay away from baseball for most of the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't give me the OK until about a week before spring training," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Calvert said the bad statistics of 1988 and the illness helped him put baseball 
in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to have fun and relax," he said. "In baseball, you never know 
what's going to happen, so why press?" 
</P>
<P>
The Buice-man cometh, again? 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Monday, DeWayne Buice, former Angel relief pitcher, claimed he had 
been called up by the Toronto Blue Jays. Buice, who saved 17 games for the 
Angels in 1987, was pitching for the triple-A Syracuse Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
His claim caught a few club officials off guard. 
</P>
<P>
"DeWayne Buice? Who's he?" said one Blue Jays official, who asked to remain 
anonymous. "We just fired our manager (Jimy Williams) and that's enough for one 
day." 
</P>
<P>
But Buice insisted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going there tomorrow (Tuesday)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said director of public relations Howard Starkman: "He must be dreaming. I 
haven't heard anything about this." 
</P>
<P>
Buice probably hopes he never wakes up. Tuesday, he was called up by the Blue 
Jays. Buice has pitched five shutout innings so far, allowing just one hit. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Nelson, formerly of Chapman College, was released by the Angels' Class-A 
team at Quad Cities, Iowa. Nelson was hitting .197 as of last week. Quad Cities 
officials said Nelson has been told to report in June to the Angels rookie club 
in Bend, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Cochrane, former Troy High School standout, was called up by the Seattle 
Mariners last week. In his first week, Cochrane is hitting .238, going five for 
21, with a triple, a home run, an RBI and five runs scored.

Active Memory Technology Inc., an Irvine manufacturer of high-speed computers 
known as parallel processors, said the U.S. Army has purchased one of its 
computers for use in an experimental project that involves detecting mine 
fields from an aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
AMT said the order with the Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment 
Station in Vicksburg, Miss., is valued at about $360,000. 
</P>
<P>
AMT said the Army is studying how well mine fields can be detected from the 
air. Under the contract, one of AMT's DAP 610 computers will be mounted in a 
helicopter and used to process data received from an airborne scanner. 
</P>
<P>
If the experiment is successful, AMT is hopeful that the Army will go ahead 
with full development of a mine detection system using AMT equipment, a company 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine firm manufactures parallel computers that use hundreds or thousands 
of small processors to perform computer tasks at very high speed.

FRAUD TRIAL SET TODAY FOR KARCHER ACCOUNTING DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The accounting director of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain is scheduled to go on 
trial today in Los Angeles on criminal charges of securities fraud through 
insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin DeShano of Orange, 54, has been accused in a one-count indictment of 
avoiding $7,107 in potential losses by selling Carl Karcher Enterprises stock 
based on confidential corporate information. The sale occurred on Oct. 15, 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, DeShano could be sentenced to 5 years in prison and fined as much 
as $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only Criminal Charge 
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 people accused by the government last year of illegally trading in 
securities of Anaheim-based Karcher Enterprises, DeShano is the only one to be 
charged criminally so far. 
</P>
<P>
Described by acquaintances as a soft-spoken family man, DeShano is director of 
general accounting at Karcher Enterprises. He has been an employee of the 
company for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
After the trial before U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima, a jury will be 
asked to decide whether DeShano knowingly sold Karcher securities on the basis 
of information not available to the general public. Federal law prohibits any 
trading based on such knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charge is an outgrowth of a civil lawsuit filed in federal court 
last April by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused Carl 
N. Karcher, chairman and chief executive of the firm, 14 family members and 
DeShano of avoiding market losses of at least $310,000 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The civil charges are still pending against Karcher, six of his relatives and 
DeShano. Karcher and his six immediate family members are scheduled to go to 
trial on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pure' Insider Trading 
</P>
<P>
DeShano's trial will be the first in recent memory in Los Angeles dealing with 
"pure" insider trading in which an employee with access to corporate 
information has been accused of using it to his advantage, according to legal 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
More typically, insider trading cases involve so-called "tippees" -- 
non-employees who were told confidential information by insiders, then used it 
to buy or sell stock. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. James L. Sanders has declined to comment on why DeShano is 
the only civil defendant who faces criminal charges or whether anyone else will 
be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
But according to court papers filed by the government, DeShano "worked on 
making corrections" to the company's quarterly financial report on Oct. 15, 
1984. Those corrections, the government alleges, had the effect of reducing the 
company's profits for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"At approximately 12:15 p.m. on Oct. 15, DeShano contacted his stockbroker and 
sold all of his available (Karcher) shares. . . . As a result, prior to the 
public announcement of (Karcher's) lowered earnings, DeShano avoided losses of 
approximately $7,107," court documents state. 
</P>
<P>
Defense documents, on the other hand, portray DeShano as an unsophisticated, 
hard-working employee who rarely traded stocks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legitimate Reasons Cited 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't trade based on inside information," said defense attorney David 
Wiechert of Irvine. Instead, DeShano "had totally legitimate reasons for the 
sale," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wiechert's trial brief, those reasons included financial need. 
DeShano's son had asked his parents for a $5,000 loan, the papers state. And 
DeShano and his wife, Paula, were considering buying a mountain cabin in Lake 
Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, defense documents say DeShano was advised by a Karcher executive, 
Steve Kishi, to diversify his investments. And his supervisor, Karcher 
controller George Cloward, told DeShano that he could properly sell his stock 
when he did, according to the trial brief. 
</P>
<P>
"Cloward, as Al's supervisor, was responsible for instructing Al regarding the 
trading rules of the company," defense papers state. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last 4 to 8 days.

FIRST OUTLET FOR ANAHEIM FIRM NEAR OSAKA; 
</P>
<P>
THE SUN RISES AND SHINES ON CARL'S JR. IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Famous Star has met the Rising Sun, and the latter seems to be smiling. 
</P>
<P>
According to officials with Carl Karcher Enterprises in Anaheim, Japanese 
customers have been wolfing down Famous Stars and fries since the opening of 
the first Carl's Jr. restaurant in the Far East last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The launch of the Carl's Jr. outlet in Minoo, a suburb north of Osaka, "was one 
of our highest opening-day sales volumes ever," said Patty Beckman, a 
spokeswoman for Karcher Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't release the actual figures, but sales were in five digits," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant was built by Friendly Corp. of Osaka, which became the first 
Carl's Jr. international licensee last year when Carl N. Karcher, founder of 
the hamburger chain, and Zenshiro Shigesato, Friendly's president, signed a 
25-year deal for an exclusive franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Friendly, which operates more than 100 Western-style coffee shops in the Osaka 
area, plans to open at least 30 more Carl's Jr. outlets in Japan by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher's international franchising staff is reportedly negotiating similar 
deals in several other Pacific Rim nations. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the Japanese characters on the menu boards and a melon-flavored soda 
in the soft-drink dispenser, the Minoo restaurant is no different from the 
Carl's in Broadway Plaza, downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking procedures in the Japanese Carl's Jr. are also the same, and the menu 
is limited to such Carl's Jr. specialties as the Famous Star Hamburger, 
Charbroiler BBQ Chicken Sandwich and Western Bacon Cheeseburger. There is no 
salad bar, but Carl's Jr. Salads-To-Go are sold. 
</P>
<P>
The landlord of the site demolished a profitable Friendly restaurant to make 
way for the Carl's Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of visitation from Japan in California," said Steve Kishi, 
Carl's Jr.'s director of international development, "so many people from there 
have visited a Carl's Jr. We believe the Carl's Jr. concept will be well 
accepted."

Codercard Inc., a small Santa Ana company that makes computer security devices, 
has signed a contract valued at about $750,000 to supply its products to the 
Australian government. 
</P>
<P>
Codercard said it received an export license from the State Department to 
supply the products to Telecom Australia, the Australian national telephone 
company. The order was placed through Codercard's Australian distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Australia plans to use the Codercard product to verify the authentication of 
telephone messages, according to Codercard President Willis Marsing. 
</P>
<P>
Marsing said the Australian deal is important for Codercard because it "opens 
the door to the rest of the (Australian) government market." 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1988, Codercard received a $4.8-million order to supply its products 
to Australian financial services companies. 
</P>
<P>
Codercard makes electronic cards and machines that "read" them. The security 
systems are designed to prevent unauthorized access to computer files.

SANTA ANA SHOWS INTEREST IN FIRST-TIME BUYERS; 
</P>
<P>
PLANS TO LOAN UP TO $30,000 AT 5% FOR HOME PURCHASES IN CITY'S OLDER SECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The city of Santa Ana said Monday that it will begin making low-interest loans 
of up to $30,000 to first-time home buyers who agree to purchase houses in 
older sections of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The program, believed to be the only one of its kind in the county, is aimed at 
encouraging owner-occupied housing in the central part of the city to help 
preserve existing dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
The city believes that owner-occupants generally do more to maintain and 
upgrade their properties than absentee landlords, said Patricia Whitaker, 
housing manager for the city's Community Development Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The program, financed with $500,000 in city redevelopment funds, "is an attempt 
to help people who live or work in Santa Ana benefit directly from all the 
commercial development going on here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It also is an effort to enable families, including people who are now renting 
in the older downtown areas, to buy homes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the homes in the target areas were built between 1890 and 1940. The 
areas include the historic French Park and Washington Square sections of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
While the program is open to all qualified home buyers within the target areas, 
preference will be given to current city residents and employees of businesses 
located in Santa Ana, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, qualified applicants must provide at least 5% of the 
purchase price and can borrow up to an additional 15% -- or a maximum of 
$30,000 -- from the city. The city loan carries a 5% interest rate and is 
amortized over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants cannot have annual incomes that exceed the federal Housing and Urban 
Development Department median income for the county by more than 20%.

<P>
That means that a family of four could qualify for the program this year with a 
household income of as much as $56,280. That maximum would be $45,000 for a 
family of two and $65,280 for a family of six. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker said the city ran a pilot program last year with $120,000 in 
redevelopment funds and a $12,000 cap on an individual loan. She said the 
average loan was $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city is required under state law to set aside for low-cost housing 
assistance a portion of the funds it draws from increased tax revenues in its 
redevelopment areas. The loan program is one of several housing assistance 
programs that Santa Ana offers, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Applications for the loan program will be available from the Community 
Development Agency's housing division at 500 W. Santa Ana Blvd. beginning May 
30. A public information seminar will be held June 5 at 7 p.m. at Lowell 
Elementary School, 915 W. Richland Ave.

SINGER MARCIA BALL FINDS HER TRUE VOICE IN AUSTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.D. CONSIDINE, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are not many places in America where a singer could start off as a 
country act and end up as a piano-playing R&amp;B shouter, as Marcia Ball did, 
but there is one city where that would seem a natural course of events: Austin, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Listen to her today, and her sound is pure New Orleans R&amp;B, from her bluesy 
vocals, which recall the likes of Irma Thomas, to her two-fisted, Professor 
Longhair-style piano playing. A dozen years ago, though, she sang straight 
country, even releasing an album of traditional country songs in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
That may seem quite a pendulum swing, but in truth, it simply reflects shifts 
in Austin's musical history. Back in the '70s, Austin was the home of Willie 
Nelson, Waylon Jennings and a host of outlaw country singers. Ten years later, 
though, the big noise was from blues, and acts like Stevie Ray Vaughan, the 
Fabulous Thunderbirds and Lou Ann Barton were the ones getting the "Austin 
sound" ink. 
</P>
<P>
And through it all, Ball was in the process of finding her own sound. After 
growing up in Louisiana, she ended up in Austin pretty much by accident -- "We 
were actually on our way to San Francisco," she said in a telephone interview 
from her Austin home, "but we just stopped here and never left" -- and made her 
recording debut as a country singer through a similar set of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"My first band that got any attention, got popular at all, was a country band 
here in Austin," she said. "That's what led us to shop Nashville (for a 
recording contract) in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, she says, Austin's music scene was not quite as pure country as 
outsiders imagined it. "People would always ask about that," she said. "But 
even at the time -- this would be in the late '70s -- the Thunderbirds and 
Stevie (Ray Vaughan) were emerging hard. In interviews, if people asked me 
about the country scene, I'd say, 'It's great and everything's happening, but 
what is about to happen is really something else.' While progressive country 
music was getting all the press, they were playing the clubs, honing their 
style." 
</P>
<P>
It was not long before Ball was joining them. "After that one country band I 
was in ran its course, I started my own band and that was more influenced by my 
roots, rhythm and blues," she said. "I grew up with that, with soul music and 
R&amp;B and Fats Domino and Professor Longhair and Irma Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"By '78 . . . I had already moved in this direction. The show I was doing had 
moved definitely into the R&amp;B thing. But in 1980, I just decided that I was 
going to write R&amp;B and I was going to find some of those guys who were 
playing R&amp;B all that time, and learn from them." 
</P>
<P>
Part of what led Ball to make the switch was her interest in piano. "I started 
playing piano in the country band I was in when I first moved to Austin," she 
said. "There are not a lot of renowned pianists in country music, once you get 
past Floyd Cramer and Ronnie Milsap. That about said it. But New Orleans blues, 
and rhythm and blues, is full of piano players." 
</P>
<P>
Still, mastering that piano style was not easy, particularly for such an 
autodidact as Ball. "It's not a matter of basic ability," she said. "When you 
listen to 'Fess (Professor Longhair), so much of what he does is so simple. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's the syncopation of what he does. When I was learning how to play 'Big 
Chief,' the left hand and right hand are completely disconnected. I got so I 
could play it pretty well, and someone said, 'I heard he recorded it one hand 
at a time.' 
</P>
<P>
"Don't tell me now!" she said, laughing. She added, "Of course, it wasn't 
true."

CABLE SYSTEM LETS PAIR OF FILM BUFFS REVIEW THE CLASSICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two local film buffs are bidding to become the Siskel and Ebert of the Tustin 
scene, reviewing movie classics that appear on the basic cable package offered 
by American Cablesystems. 
</P>
<P>
William Gray and Bruce Potter, who have regular jobs outside the entertainment 
business, have begun a twice-monthly show on Cablesystems' public-access 
Channel 33 in Tustin. The system has 8,500 subscribers, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The half-hour shows are repeated at 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday for 2 
weeks. Each segment reviews six movie classics scheduled to appear on the 
system's basic services, along with promotional clips from each one. Another 
six upcoming films are mentioned briefly. 
</P>
<P>
A "movie map," displaying where and when the movies are shown, is also 
provided. This enables viewers to set their videocassette recorders to tape 
such movies as "King Kong," "Mutiny on the Bounty" and "On the Waterfront." 
</P>
<P>
The main problem, Gray said, is that "there are lots of great films that we 
can't find enough time to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who has reviewed movies on a campus PBS television outlet in Utah, said 
he hopes that the program will be picked up by other systems owned by American 
Cablesystems, which is a subsidiary of Continental Cablevision, the 
third-largest operator in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is make it generic" by identifying movies according to 
the cable network rather than the channel numbers assigned on the Tustin 
system, Gray said. MARK I. PINSKY

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
1990 Budget 
</P>
<P>
The House passed, 241 to 185, the conference report on HR 106 giving Congress 
spending, revenue and deficit targets for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The 
Senate followed suit, and HR 106 is now in effect. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal plan was developed by the Republican White House and Democratic 
Congress. It formalizes President Bush's pledge of no new taxes but projects 
$5.3 billion in largely unspecified new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The plan assumes spending of $1.17 trillion, revenue of $1.07 trillion and a 
deficit within the Gramm-Rudman law's $100-million target. All sides conceded 
it avoids tough fiscal decisions and that its goal of a $100-million deficit is 
wishful thinking. Members looking for a bright spot said the agreement shows 
the President and Congress can work harmoniously toward fiscal goals. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the fiscal 1990 budget.

The American erotic comedy "Sex, Lies and Videotape" won the coveted Golden 
Palm award for best movie at the 42nd Cannes Film Festival today. 
</P>
<P>
The film won two major prizes, with American James Spader winning the best 
actor award for his part as a mixed-up seducer in 26-year-old director Steven 
Soderbergh's first full-length film. 
</P>
<P>
Meryl Streep received best actress award for her portrayal of Australian Lindy 
Chamberlain, falsely accused in 1980 of murdering her baby, in the film "A Cry 
in the Dark." 
</P>
<P>
"Sex, Lies and Videotape" centers on the relationship between a husband, wife, 
the wife's sexy young sister and an old friend of the husband, played by 
Spader. 
</P>
<P>
Spader's character seduces both his friend's wife and her sister as he attempts 
to cure his impotence. His only means of attaining sexual fulfillment is by 
watching women interviewees describe their sex lives on camera. 
</P>
<P>
Streep's best actress award, which topped an all-American evening at one of the 
film industry's most prestigious events, added another crown to the 40-year-old 
star's growing list of achievements.

A massive earthquake with a magnitude of 8.2 -- the world's strongest quake in 
more than two years -- occurred in the South Pacific about 850 miles southwest 
of New Zealand today. There was no immediate report of damage or injuries and 
no tsunami waves resulted. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand said the quake was picked up by seismological monitors in the 
capital of Wellington, but there were no reports that the tremor was felt in 
New Zealand. A spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey in Washington said the 
quake struck the sparsely populated Macquarie Islands region of the South 
Pacific.

Polish students fought police with bare fists in central Warsaw today after a 
court refused to legalize their independent pro-Solidarity NZS union. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 protesters were detained and some were seen being beaten with batons 
and kicked in the stomach inside police vans. 
</P>
<P>
Students packing the biggest hall in the Warsaw regional court chanted "Down 
with communism" after Judge Danuta Widawska announced her refusal to accept the 
NZS statutes and register the union as a legal association because of a clause 
stating that students have the right to strike. 
</P>
<P>
The NZS was banned with the Solidarity free trade union and Rural Solidarity 
under martial law in 1981. The government promised their re-legalization last 
month and has already registered Solidarity and Rural Solidarity.

'LYNCH MOB' IS AFTER WRIGHT, LAWYER SAYS;

<P>
ETHICS PANEL ASKED TO DROP KEY CHARGES AS HOUSE SPEAKER'S TELEVISED HEARING

<P>
Jim Wright's defense opened before a national television audience today with 
his lawyer urging the House Ethics Committee to "stand in the way of the lynch 
mob" seeking the House Speaker's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the press, Jim Wright's through. He's got to resign his 
speakership. Maybe even his seat in Congress," said Stephen Susman, attorney 
for the Texas Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
"Why worry about due process for a dead man?" he asked rhetorically. "Why 
should this committee stand in the way of a lynch mob or a conviction based 
upon guilt by association?" 
</P>
<P>
Because "if a member of Congress cannot get a fair trial . . . no American 
can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trial-Like Setting 
</P>
<P>
The arguments were made in a trial-like setting, with Susman and his team at a 
"defense" table and the Ethics Committee investigators poised behind an 
identical table across the room. A central lectern allowed the lawyers to speak 
while standing before the committee, which sat behind a raised, wood-paneled 
dais. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's wife, Betty, arrived during Susman's arguments and took a seat in the 
front row of the audience. One of the Speaker's daughters also attended, but 
Wright did not. 
</P>
<P>
Susman was asking the Ethics Committee today to dismiss key charges against 
Wright based on different interpretations of the House rules. Supporters hope 
for a narrow legal victory that the Speaker could parlay into political 
salvation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Richard Phelan, the outside counsel who investigated Wright for the 
committee, argued that the panel should not look narrowly at the legal 
arguments. The House code of conduct was designed to be comprehensive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This case and this discussion is not about loopholes in tax codes," Phelan 
said. "It's not about carefully crafting legislation to permit persons to evade 
or to circumvent or to look askance." 
</P>
<P>
Wright's lawyers contend that he is being judged by a new, harsher standard 
that goes far beyond the letter of House rules. In advance of today's hearing, 
they gave themselves no better than an even chance of winning dismissal of at 
least some of the 69 counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Eroding 
</P>
<P>
But with Wright's political support eroding under the weight of serious ethics 
charges, even the Speaker's supporters emphasize the importance of persuading 
the Ethics Committee to drop at least one of the two main charges. 
</P>
<P>
In the month since the panel formally made its charges against Wright, his 
support has eroded. Members of his own party have begun holding meetings to 
discuss his case and its possible harmful effect on their own political 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes in today's arguments were heightened by the Ethics Committee's 
decision to allow television coverage of the hearing. Rarely does the panel 
allow such open coverage, but Wright said he welcomed the chance to have his 
side of the story presented.

Swedish physicists said today that they produced a burst of neutron radiation 
in a room-temperature experiment, repeating the work of two chemists who 
claimed to have achieved cold fusion in a jar. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists at Manne Siegbahn Institute for Physics said their method was 
similar to the experiment that chemists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann 
said they conducted at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the two claimed to have produced sustained fusion in a jar at much 
colder temperatures than previously thought possible. Repeated attempts by 
other scientists to duplicate the Fleischmann-Pons experiments have had mixed 
results.

LIGHT-SKINNED BLACK SAYS LIGHTNESS LED TO HER FIRING

<P>
Friction between light- and dark-skinned blacks underlies an unusual federal 
lawsuit in which a black woman says she lost her job because of her light 
complexion. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Lynn Morrow said she sued to get her Internal Revenue Service job back 
and to fight prejudice within her race. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is this problem within our black society, then I think we have to 
correct it," Morrow said. "That would make us stronger, too. I feel it would 
help us as a race." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a federal judge denied a motion to dismiss the case, ruling 
that Morrow could claim job discrimination if she could prove that her 
supervisor, also black, harassed and ultimately fired her over skin tone. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow, who turns 27 Wednesday, was fired as a clerk-typist in March, 1986. 
Last July, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission allowed her to sue. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow contends that her supervisor, Ruby Lewis, harassed her soon after Lewis 
was promoted in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"She tortured me mentally," Morrow said. "I heard it said that the only reason 
I got the job was because I had light skin." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis replied in court documents that Morrow was fired because of incompetence 
and job attitude, not skin color. 
</P>
<P>
"Since hues of skin have never been a consideration with me, and I never even 
thought about it until Tracy presented it as an issue in this case, it's 
impossible for me to have discriminated against her on that basis," Lewis said 
in court documents.

A record 8.43 million Japanese traveled abroad last year, up 23% from 6.83 
million in 1987, due to the strong yen and a continued boom in tourism, a 
government report said today. 
</P>
<P>
The top destination was Hawaii, which drew 1.37 million Japanese, followed by 
Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. The overseas travelers chalked up a 
$15.8-billion deficit in the 1988 balance of travel payments, against Japan's 
overall trade surplus of $95 billion.

A developer wants to turn the Sears Tower into the world's second-tallest 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Miglin-Beitler Developments Inc. announced plans Monday for a slender, 
125-story skyscraper resembling a rocket emerging from the Loop. The 1,914-foot 
structure would eclipse by 400 feet the Sears Tower. 
</P>
<P>
The developer did not say how much the concrete and steel-reinforced skyscraper 
would cost. Plans have been submitted to the Chicago Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Construction could begin by December and could be completed by mid-1992, the 
developer said. 
</P>
<P>
The building, being designed by architect Cesar Pelli, of New Haven, Conn., 
would contain 1.2 million square feet of office space, only about one-third the 
rentable space of the Sears Tower.

Rick Pitino told reporters today that he is not committed to leaving the New 
York Knicks to take the head coaching job at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not leaning to take this job," he said. "You've got a lot of problems 
here, and I've got very few problems in New York." 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky was slapped by the NCAA last Friday with a three-year probation, 
including two seasons without postseason play and one without live television 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a dilemma here at Kentucky, a big dilemma," he said in a news 
conference in Wildcat Lodge. "This program is about as rich in tradition as 
there is in all college basketball. You've been brought to your knees with a 
tremendous scandal and then sanctions came about. 
</P>
<P>
"But you now have C. M. Newton as your athletic director and you have a 
president (David P. Roselle) with a tremendous amount of integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Pitino said he hopes to find a position where he can provide a long-lasting and 
stable environment for his family.

Four Florida sports agents have been indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges 
after allegedly paying athletes at the University of Florida to sign 
professional contracts and then lie about it. 
</P>
<P>
The four, all officers of Professional Athletes Financial Advisors Inc. in 
Hollywood, Fla., surrendered Monday after being charged in a 90-page federal 
grand jury indictment with 20 counts of conspiracy, racketeering, mail fraud 
and wire fraud. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration began investigating 
the agents during a yearlong probe into possible cocaine use by Florida 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment accuses the agents of giving seven players "large amounts of 
cash, monthly wire transfers of funds, interest-free loans, hotel 
accommodations, airline tickets, payments to family members" and other gifts to 
induce them to break NCAA rules by signing contracts before their eligibility 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
The indicted agents are the firm's president, Gerald Gratenstein, vice 
presidents Greg Latimer and John Kasbar, and secretary Glenn Haft.
