ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENT CREATION AT UCSD BACKED 
</P>

<P>
The establishment of a department of ethnic studies, long debated at UC San 
Diego, took a critical step forward Tuesday when the campus Academic Senate 
voted overwhelmingly to recommend its approval. 
</P>
<P>
At one of the largest faculty meetings in years, professors voted 94 to 14, 
with 9 abstentions, to ask Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson to move forward with 
the proposal. Veteran sociology professor Joseph Gusfield spoke for many during 
a spirited, sometimes contentious discussion in describing the issue as a 
"moral as much as an intellectual question." 
</P>
<P>
While Atkinson must agree with the recommendation and send it to the University 
of California Board of Regents for final approval, acting Chancellor Harold 
Ticho said after the vote that a dissent by Atkinson would be "pretty unusual" 
given the strong advisory role of the Academic Senate. (Atkinson is on leave 
through June to discuss science-related issues in Washington.) 
</P>
<P>
A new department, offering both an undergraduate major and a master's degree in 
ethnic studies, could be functioning as early as September with a small nucleus 
of professors, said Ramon Gutierrez, a professor of history who will join the 
new department. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal approved Tuesday brings to a close more than two years of debate 
over whether existing programs in Chicano and contemporary black studies should 
be consolidated in a department to include other ethnic groups in America and 
be studied in a comparative, interdisciplinary manner. 
</P>
<P>
Students would take a one-year introductory course in American immigration 
history and in race and ethnic relations, as well as courses in theory, 
history, language and literature of at least two ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
The committee set up by Atkinson to explore the issue, chaired by Gutierrez, 
said in its report Tuesday that ethnic studies is a legitimate discipline with 
an interdisciplinary nature that at times encompasses history, anthropology, 
political science and sociology. 
</P>
<P>
The report deliberately recommends a department of ethnic studies, rather than 
elevating black or Chicano or Asian studies to department status, in order to 
avoid what Gutierrez said were both academic and political problems associated 
with individual ethnic studies departments at campuses such as UCLA and UC 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Even at UC Berkeley, with one of the nation's best-known ethnic studies 
departments, students in the black, Chicano and Asian units that make up the 
department tend to do limited studies outside of each unit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The report says: "The perspectives that ethnic studies scholars bring to the 
debate on the meaning of America's past, and which uniquely define the method 
and discipline, look at social tensions from the bottom up, from the vantage 
point of those who are powerless . . . and are rooted in the lived historical 
memories of slavery, racism, victimization and physical and psychological 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
Well-known political science professor Sanford Lakoff spoke strongly and 
caustically for those against the proposal, calling the concept "political 
mush" that contends that all study of ethnicity until now has been "nothing but 
the biased observations of middle-class Eurocentric white males." He said 
minority students will not want to study in such a department because it will 
offer no skills to prepare them for careers to raise them "and their families 
out of poverty." 
</P>
<P>
But history professor Edward Reynolds, "speaking from the heart," recounted 
being told when he began to teach African history at Yale University that 
"there was nothing to teach before the coming of the Europeans. . . . There is 
a lot of silent suffering by minorities on this campus. . . . This is a great 
opportunity to do something that is lacking and recognize diversity." 
</P>
<P>
The planning and budget committee, chaired by biology professor Douglas Smith, 
said ethnic studies must be set apart from the need for more ethnic and racial 
diversity at UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a disaster for UCSD if a department of ethnic studies were viewed 
as the 'home' for achieving affirmative action goals. We are decidely against 
any implication that faculty members of a (department) must also be of minority 
background," Smith wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said he is aware of those views. "It's not going to be the department 
of affirmative action," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said he and music professor Cecil Lytle, the provost of UCSD's Third 
College, will join the department. In addition, a well-known scholar of 
Asian-American studies, Yen Espiritu, as well as George Lipset, an expert on 
European ethnic experiences in America from the University of Minnesota, have 
been recommended for appointment. 
</P>
<P>
The ability to attract top professors in a relatively new field with few 
experts was at the heart of the committee's argument not to leave ethnic 
studies as a program, dependent on the good will of departments to provide 
professors for ethnic studies courses. 
</P>
<P>
Some opponents asked that the ethnic studies begin as a program and only 
gradually move to department status, even though they conceded that most 
interdisciplinary programs at UCSD have suffered from a lack of resources and 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
History professor Ramon Ruiz said all new academic departments have faced 
similar questions of legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he asked his colleagues to "remember that we are living in a state 
where the majority of the population" will soon be nonwhite.

EL CAJON QUICK TO SCRUB UP AFTER SPRAYING 
</P>

EL CAJON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg and Vicki Miles stood under their carport in El Cajon and took a quick 
inventory. Cars? Covered. Pets? In the house. Kids? In front of the television, 
watching "Apocalypse Now." 
</P>
<P>
The Miles family was as ready as it would ever be for what came next on Monday 
night: six helicopters, flying low and fast, dribbling poison into the night. 
The odd, sweet smell of malathion-and-corn syrup filled the air. But the roar 
of the six huge propellers soon faded. It was over. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you see it?" Vicki Miles asked, venturing out to study her shrubs. She 
bent down and ran her fingers over her cement driveway. "I can't see it." 
</P>
<P>
That, according to state officials, is just how they were hoping El Cajon 
residents would react to San Diego County's first-ever aerial malathion 
spraying. The 90-minute mission that dumped pesticide over 16 square miles went 
swimmingly, they say, boding well for the two more applications scheduled for 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
"It went perfectly. We don't foresee any changes when we do it again," said 
Veda Federighi, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Food and Agriculture, 
which is spraying to eradicate a suspected infestation of Mexican fruit flies, 
or Mexflies. 
</P>
<P>
Despite people's fears of a "big cloud that they can see and touch," Federighi 
said, spot-checks showed that the pesticide was concentrated and distributed 
correctly -- about 12.5 ounces of bait per acre -- meaning the dreaded spray 
was nearly invisible as it fell. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the tiny sticky droplets began to bead up on El Cajon's 
windshields, however, another side-effect of the spraying was plain to see: a 
surge in the entrepreneurial spirit. "Open at 12 a.m. AFTER SPRAY!" said a sign 
outside Romeo Car Wash on Jamacha Road. "Cover Up From the Fly!" read one 
makeshift stand, where two out-of-town residents sold car covers. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, other El Cajon residents stood 10 deep at Mike Roach's Chevron station, 
hoping to get one of his last disposable plastic car covers ($5.99 for 
mid-size, $6.99 for Cadillacs or small boats). Roach had been selling the 
covers since Saturday. But suddenly on Monday, after the state Court of Appeal 
declined to stay the spraying, business picked up. 
</P>
<P>
He sold 500 in four hours, returning twice for more to his supplier, a Seal 
Beach-based merchant who had set up shop temporarily at a Shell station down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea it would go like it did. It caught me completely off-guard," 
said Roach, who was almost out of stock by 6:15 p.m. He looked relieved. "I'm 
going home." 
</P>
<P>
The anti-fly maneuvers lured the news media as well as vendors -- a slew of 
scribblers, cameramen and on-air personalities who had not congregated in such 
numbers in El Cajon since 1988, when a Navy F-14A fighter jet crashed at 
Gillespie Field. 
</P>
<P>
But journalists found that after the malathion-laden helicopters took off and 
the hundreds of protesters went home to take cover, there was little to do but 
prowl around El Cajon, looking for something -- anything -- out of the 
ordinary. At one deserted street corner, a police car's flashing lights drew 
reporters like, well, flies. What was happening? they wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"We're impounding a car," an officer replied flatly, without trying to hide her 
disdain. "God, they're everywhere," another officer muttered, eyeing the 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
A better strategy was to follow the helicopters' zig-zag passes, moving 
gradually east as they swerved north, then south, then north again. As they 
passed, people opened their curtains, pressing faces to windows, eager to see 
the aircraft delivering what so many residents had begged Gov. George 
Deukmejian to prevent: a potent poison that kills Mexflies by inducing 
paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin C. Greene, the general manager of the East Valley Classic Carwash on Main 
Street, only had to look up. As he sat outdoors, waiting for the customers he 
knew would soon fill his six self-serve stalls ($1.25 with "Hot Rinse Water"), 
he watched the copters fly right over. With their red and green lights 
flashing, they resembled mechanical reindeer pulling a surreal sleigh. 
</P>
<P>
"Their first pass, they came right across," said Greene, who kept the carwash 
open all night Monday instead of closing at 11 p.m. "It was a beautiful 
picture." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gustafson, a retired businessman from Alpine, pulled into the Classic soon 
after the helicopters disappeared. "The funny thing is, we never come to El 
Cajon," he said, explaining how he and his girlfriend unwittingly ate at a 
restaurant in the spray area. "So we come down here and (my girlfriend) said, 
what the heck is that? Six helicopters -- what a crackup!" 
</P>
<P>
He scrubbed the top of his maroon Jaguar XJ6 and shook his head. "We just came 
down to have something to eat and we get bombed." 
</P>
<P>
One stall over, Shelley Adams, 19, was energetically sudsing her Honda Civic. 
Just one month ago, she explained, she had paid about $200 for a bright red 
paint job. "It used to be brown," she said -- about the color of the tiny spots 
that dotted her windshield. She rinsed the car and looked nervously at the 
finish. "I'm going to soap it up again." 
</P>
<P>
At the 24-hour Ralphs Superstore on Second Street, a hush fell over the 14 
aisles. Even an hour after the spraying, Ralph's bore more resemblance to a 
museum than a market. "We had a big rush right before 9," said Scott Guthrie, 
the service manager, who had crammed all the shopping carts inside the store to 
keep them malathion-free. But since then, "It's been dead. You can hear your 
own voice echoing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The same was true in the cavernous gymnasium of El Cajon Valley High School, 
where a last-minute plan to shelter the city's homeless from the spray drew 
only five men. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the day, civic leaders had had no plan to protect the homeless from the 
pesticide. State and county officials had declined to open shelters because of 
the state's position that there was no health hazard. And city officials had 
shrugged their shoulders and suggested that the homeless, many of whom 
congregate in an area near the western boundary of the spraying site, should 
walk a few blocks to get out of range. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at about 4 p.m., state officials agreed that if the high school gym 
could be made available during the spraying hours, state workers would 
supervise it. Hot pink flyers stapled to telephone poles went up just hours 
before the helicopters took off. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Bundy Sr., a 34-year-old unemployed welder, was among the few people who 
showed up -- and he only did so, he said, because he thought he would be 
allowed to stay all night. When told he had to leave the gym after the copters 
passed by, he was good-natured. He and a friend would go back to their usual 
night-time spot, he said, a partially exposed area near the fire station. 
</P>
<P>
Had he heard anything about malathion? "All I know is it kills bugs," he said. 
But spraying or no spraying, he said, "They should have a place for us where we 
can take a shower every day and look halfway decent." 
</P>
<P>
By 10:30, the copters had returned to Gillespie Field to refuel for the trip 
home to the San Joaquin Valley. Dave Maier, a waiter, and Darla Utter, a 
college student, stood near the landing strip, holding hands in the dark. The 
21-year-old sweethearts were determined to get a glimpse of history. They were 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see a bunch of people chaining themselves to the helicopters," 
Maier said. "It doesn't seem as important as everyone made it out to be."

ELECTRICITY AND WORKERS BOTH GO OUT

<P>
Electricity was cut to 4,416 customers Tuesday when an underground conduit plug 
exploded in southeast Ventura, catapulting a manhole cover into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers at Montalvo School dealt with the power outage by taking their 
students into the afternoon sunshine to continue rehearsals for a springtime 
dance festival. 
</P>
<P>
And the Ventura Police Department and California Highway Patrol offices fired 
up generators to power their radios and dispatched officers to direct cars at 
intersections where traffic lights were out of service. 
</P>
<P>
The power failed at 1:59 p.m. across several square miles near the intersection 
of Sperry Avenue and Valentine Road, when the 9,500-volt conduit plug exploded 
in an underground vault, said Mike Montoya, a spokesman for Southern California 
Edison. 
</P>
<P>
The utility restored power to all but 1,700 customers within 17 minutes, and 
the last 10 customers by 5:30 p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
The main impact of the power outage seemed to be a short-circuiting of the 
afternoon for several thousand Ventura workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty outrageous," said Walter Charnow, a dispatcher at a food 
equipment plant near the intersection. "I heard the boom and walked out to see 
what happened. The manhole cover had been flipped from right under the ground." 
</P>
<P>
For some of the dozens of managers, computer operators and blue-collar workers 
left idle by the power outage, the blackout was a welcome break from the daily 
routine, a chance to go outdoors and enjoy the sunny spring afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Can't work," said Eddie Heviz, a technician employed by a nearby computer 
company, as he strolled along Sperry Street. "No computers, no light, no 
electricity -- might as well walk around." 
</P>
<P>
Several office workers sunned themselves on a grassy mound a few yards from the 
blasted vault and watched a five-man Edison crew repair the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Others were not so relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Michael L. Muirhead paced nervously outside the offices of Bleuel, 
Buford and Muirhead, puffing away at his cigarette minutes after the 
electricity and phone service went out. 
</P>
<P>
"The lights went out in the middle of a pretty important call," he said, 
shaking his head in frustration. "I was just about to give out the critical 
part of my advice on an unlawful detainer, and my client has just one day to 
respond. She must be going crazy trying to reach me." 
</P>
<P>
Edison foreman Ed McKern stuck his head into the blasted electrical vault and 
waxed philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what electricity wants to do, it wants to go to ground," he said. 
"You've got 9,500 volts going from phase to ground and that's what happens."

REPORT CITES MARIJUANA, ALCOHOL IN PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plane that crashed early this year at Burbank Airport, killing all four 
occupants, was carrying too much weight and the Thousand Oaks flight instructor 
who may have been piloting the craft had traces of alcohol and marijuana in his 
blood, the National Transportation Safety Board reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The findings were not a ruling on the cause of the fiery crash on Jan. 18. They 
were contained in an investigator's analysis of the crash that will be used by 
the safety board to determine a probable cause, a finding not expected for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
NTSB Air Safety Investigator Thomas H. Wilcox said it was unclear whether the 
amounts of alcohol and marijuana discovered were sufficient to have impaired a 
pilot's judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"Was his judgment impaired? Was his reaction time slow? I don't know. But he 
crashed the plane," Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
The single-engine Piper Cherokee crashed shortly after taking off on a training 
flight to Santa Barbara with four certified pilots aboard. The victims were 
identified as Lawrence W. Anderson Jr., 30, of Thousand Oaks, who was also a 
flight instructor; Jeffrey Fader, 28, of Canyon Country; Ingvar H. Gronberg, 
27, of Burbank, and George E. Kraft, 33, of Marina Del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found no engine malfunctions or other mechanical failure after 
examining the wreckage, officials said in January. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox said Tuesday that the total safe weight limit for the plane and its 
contents was 2,325 pounds, but the estimated weight with the four occupants, 
fuel and baggage was 110 pounds more than that. 
</P>
<P>
He said the plane would have been able to take off at that weight, but the 
pilot also apparently attempted a steep banking turn, which doubled the 
"G-load" or gravity force on the plane, requiring an extreme amount of power to 
overcome the weight. It was unknown why the pilot attempted the 180-degree 
turn, which required the plane to bank at a 70-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
"The effect of the weight was compounded by the steep turn," Wilcox said. "They 
hit a power limitation." 
</P>
<P>
Because the engine "just was not producing" enough power to cope with both the 
weight and the turn, the plane dropped almost vertically, its left wing 
striking the ground first, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fader was in the pilot's seat and Anderson, the flight instructor, was in the 
co-pilot's seat at the time of the crash. But only the steering yoke in front 
of Anderson was broken, indicating that he was gripping it -- flying the plane 
-- on impact, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally during an emergency situation, the flight instructor will take 
control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moments before the crash, one of the men in the plane radioed the Burbank tower 
that there was an emergency and that they needed to land immediately, but did 
not describe the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox said that toxicological tests performed on Anderson's body were positive 
for cannabinoids and ethanol, chemicals found in marijuana and alcohol. Wilcox 
declined to say how much of the chemicals were found. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was not known if there was enough of either chemical to impair 
Anderson's judgment, Wilcox said, it is a violation of federal rules for a 
pilot to fly a plane with any amount of those chemicals in the blood. "You 
can't have a pilot's license if those things come up positive on your medical 
tests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tests on the other victims found no alcohol or drugs, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane had been leased to the Burbank-based Pilots Co-Op, a flying club. 
Club officials said the four men had used the plane on prior occasions for 
training flights.

KINKAID SKIPPER CITES MEMORY LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cmdr. John Cochrane, skipper of the destroyer Kinkaid, which crashed into a 
merchant ship by the Strait of Malacca, testified Tuesday that he suffered a 
memory loss in the days after the collision and provided an erroneous account 
of the accident to an investigating admiral. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane told an admiral in a written statement immediately after the crash -- 
which killed the navigation officer and injured 17 sailors -- that he knew the 
Kinkaid would reach the busy channel at 5 on the morning of the crash. But the 
Navy has presented evidence during the court-martial proceedings that Cochrane 
requested a wake-up call an hour later, which the Navy says shows Cochrane was 
ill-prepared and criminally negligent. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the seventh day of hearings, Cochrane, 44, took the stand and said 
he had made his statement to the admiral because he could not remember the 
actual events leading up to the crash and did not want to admit to this memory 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
When he regained his memory days after making the statement, he realized the 
ship's navigator had told him the Kinkaid would reach the busy channel at 10 
a.m., testified Cochrane, who joined the Navy nearly 21 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of his conversation with the navigator, Lt. Sean McPhee, 24, of 
Santa Rosa, Cochrane said, he had not ordered the customary procedures for 
entering the straits, thinking he had time to do them later in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
A neuropsychologist testifying on Cochrane's behalf said Cochrane's memory loss 
was reasonable in light of his trauma. Lt. Cmdr. David Spaulding, a 
neuropsychologist at San Diego's Naval Hospital, testified that Cochrane had 
symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome during the month after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
But the Navy's prosecutor disputed the expert's finding. "You have had what can 
best be described as a memory loss of convenience, sir," said Lt. Cmdr. Leroy 
Dickens, the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane is the first Navy skipper in more than a decade to face a 
court-martial for the collision of a vessel. To prove that Cochrane was 
derelict in his duties, Dickens must show Cochrane's actions or inactions led 
to the crash of the San Diego-based vessel. 
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, he faces a maximum penalty of two years in the brig, dismissal 
from the Navy, and forfeiture of all future pay -- including his pension. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials are carefully watching the case, as it explores a longtime Navy 
doctrine that has maintained a captain is always responsible for his ship. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane, like every captain, had issued orders to be awakened should the duty 
officer sight a close-passing vessel or choose a change in course, including 
altering speed or direction. 
</P>
<P>
But on the night of the crash, Lt. (j.g.) Steven Williams, the duty officer, 
testified that he had misidentified navigational lights and was confused about 
the ship's location. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered more than four changes of course, including one involving a 
45-degree change in direction that put the ship on the wrong side of the 
channel, going against traffic in what has been called one of the world's 
busiest shipping lanes. Overwhelmed, he did not summon the captain, Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He also ignored the warnings of a junior officer who pointed out the merchant 
vessel twice -- 50 minutes and 15 minutes before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor maintained that a good captain stays informed about his vessel 
and that Cochrane's sloppy management allowed the crew's performance to 
deteriorate. To buttress his point, Dickens has summoned witnesses who said 
only 3 of the ship's 13 binoculars were fully functioning, the combat 
information center had 6 instead of 12 sailors manning it, and that many of 
those on watch were ill-qualified. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane's attorneys, however, have argued that the skipper is shirking neither 
his accountability nor his responsibility for the crash. But they say Cochrane 
was not negligent because he did not know what was occurring on his ship that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"There but for the grace of God goes any ship's captain," said retired Adm. Lee 
Baggett, a former commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Forces and supreme allied 
commander of the Atlantic Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you ever go the wrong way on a one-way street?" said Baggett, in an 
interview after testifying. "It was John Cochrane, but it could have been me. 
Or any captain." 
</P>
<P>
In his court testimony, Baggett called Cochrane's actions "reasonable" in view 
of the information the skipper had received. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane's attorneys rested their defense Tuesday. The prosecutor is expected 
to call one rebuttal witness and officials say a decision in the case could 
come as early as today.

GALLEGLY BUYS TIME ON TV TO COUNTER KORMAN ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual switch in campaign tactics, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) 
is planning an 11th-hour barrage of cable television commercials intended to 
rebut TV ads he says are vicious run by his primary-election opponent, Sang R. 
Korman. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly declined Tuesday to disclose most details of the commercials, 
including how much they will cost. But station officials said he has paid at 
least $14,800 for time on four cable systems in the 21st Congressional 
District, which spreads from northern and western portions of the San Fernando 
Valley into southern and central Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Korman, a wealthy Korean-American developer, recently began airing a $120,000 
series of three commercials -- on cable and local network TV channels -- that 
attack Gallegly's voting record. Korman plans two more spots before the June 5 
election, including one that criticizes Gallegly for his role in an internal 
FBI investigation of four Los Angeles-based agents, a campaign spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Television ads are a new tactic for both candidates, neither of whom used them 
when they faced each other in the 1988 primary. Korman captured less than 14% 
of the vote in that race, despite spending $350,000, including $245,000 of his 
own money. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-area congressional candidates typically frown on commercials, 
especially on network TV channels, because of their high cost and scattershot 
impact. They normally prefer cheaper methods, such as direct-mail brochures, 
that can be targeted at individual voters. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said his commercials will be financed primarily from donations brought 
in by an urgent fund-raising letter his campaign mailed to supporters last 
week. He has purchased enough air time between Tuesday and the primary for more 
than 800 spots. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone is doing a vicious attack on you, the idea is to try to mitigate 
those untruths with some truths," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Korman angrily responded that his spots "totally disclose the truth of his 
voting record." 
</P>
<P>
In one Korman ad, Gallegly is criticized for voting to "give savings and loan 
associations free hand in their junk bond schemes" -- a reference to Gallegly's 
1989 vote against legislation that would have prohibited federally insured 
S&amp;Ls from investing in bonds rated below investment grade. 
</P>
<P>
A Gallegly spokesman said the congressman voted against the bill because he 
believed it "unfairly penalized solvent S&amp;Ls for making investments." 
</P>
<P>
Korman said he plans to begin airing another commercial attacking Gallegly for 
his role in an internal FBI investigation of four Los Angeles-based agents in 
1987 and 1988. Korman has accused Gallegly of filing complaints against the 
agents that sparked the inquiry and lying to cover up his instigation of it. 
Gallegly denies filing any complaints. 
</P>
<P>
GOP political consultant Paul Clarke said that although Korman's attacks have 
hurt Gallegly politically, the damage isn't severe enough for Korman to win. 
Clarke said Gallegly's commercials were a prudent response to Korman's attacks 
and may actually help him raise more money than he would have been able to had 
the race been less heated. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sound cynical and say it's manna from heaven, but from a 
fund-raising perspective, it gives Elton a reason to raise funds," Clarke said.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FIREFIGHTERS PRACTICE AT STAGED CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Fire Department staged a head-on collision at Camarillo 
Airport Tuesday so firefighters could practice freeing victims trapped in their 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main objective in staging the accident is to prepare us to care for 
victims," said Norman Plott, public information officer for the Ventura County 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Department clerical workers and dispatchers acted as passengers, and dummies 
were used to portray the two drivers. The cars were donated by a school. The 
blood was merely makeup. 
</P>
<P>
According to the scenario, five people traveling east in a white Dodge van 
collided head-on with four people in a 1967 Dodge Aspen that veered from its 
course. 
</P>
<P>
After the collision, the van tossed the dummy driver out the window and toppled 
into a ditch. It came to rest on its side, on top of the driver, who was later 
determined to be dead from massive chest trauma. 
</P>
<P>
Another passenger lay in the ditch where she had fallen from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Four people, including a drunk driver blamed for the accident and a woman six 
weeks pregnant, were trapped in the Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 firefighters who responded treated the situation as a real emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour they had freed all four victims from the Aspen, using a tool 
called the "jaws of life" to peel open the steel doors and fold back the car 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
Some firefighters worked to lift the van so they could free the man trapped 
beneath it. Others treated victims who had been released from the vehicles and 
determined who should be taken to the hospital first. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most difficult job, though, fell to the firefighters trying to calm 
Paula Aliano, a dispatcher told to play the part of a belligerent woman 
distraught that her husband was pinned under the van. CAROL WATSON

TEACHER ADMITS 4 MOLESTATION CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Camarillo High School drama teacher who hugged his female students and made 
sexual comments to them pleaded guilty Tuesday to misdemeanor child molestation 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
William H. Fisher, 42, who previously quit a job in Orange County after 
allegedly having an affair with a student, admitted guilt in Ventura County 
Municipal Court on four of nine charges, each of which could bring a year in 
jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
He was released on his own recognizance pending sentencing on June 25. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen O'Brien said she will drop the five remaining 
charges and recommend probation instead of jail time if Fisher does not change 
his plea. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo High School hired Fisher in 1987, but suspended him after his arrest 
on Nov. 17. The arrest came after nine girls complained to investigators about 
sexual remarks made by Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
"He did hug them, but he did hug both male and female students," O'Brien said. 
She said he never touched the women in sensitive areas, but made insinuating 
remarks about them. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said Fisher quit a teaching job in Irvine in 1983 after he had an 
affair with a 14-year-old student, and then paid for her abortion after she 
became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said Fisher left Irvine after the girl's father caught them together. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine school district officials agreed not to press charges on the condition 
that Fisher resign. CAROL WATSON

BOARD SEEKS WAYS TO RID WELLS OF NITRATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to spend $25,000 for a study of how 
to purify nitrate-laden well water in El Rio and Nyeland Acres. About 10,000 
residents in the area north of Oxnard use the eight wells, which have been 
found to contain as much as three times the acceptable levels of nitrate. 
</P>
<P>
The study, to be conducted by the county's Public Works Agency and various 
water and health offices, will be overseen by Supervisor Susan K. Lacey, whose 
district includes the affected area. 
</P>
<P>
Excessive consumption of nitrate, which reduces blood oxygen and can cause 
asphyxiation, can prove fatal to infants 6 months and younger. Some medical 
researchers believe fetuses and children up to age 2 are at risk from excessive 
nitrate, which is suspected of being linked to cancer and birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials suspect three possible culprits for the excessive nitrate: 
fertilizer used for many years by the area's farmers, septic tanks and manure 
from a dairy. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Koepp, county director of environmental health, told the supervisors 
that the small water companies whose wells are contaminated have been ordered 
to provide plans to remove the impurities. "In case of non-compliance, we could 
get an injunction and take them over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey said residents of the affected area are being warned of potential dangers 
in their drinking water. She added that a Neighborhood Watch program has been 
formed to warn residents against buying purification devices "that are 
absolutely worthless" against nitrate. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gallagher, manager of the Environmental Health Department's resources 
section, said all water wells that have from five to 200 connections are 
monitored by the county. JACK SEARLES

LEGAL STAFF OPPOSES RENT CONTROL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City attorneys are expected to urge the City Council today to turn down a 
request for rent control sought by area mobile home park tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Kranitz said Tuesday that such an ordinance could result in expensive 
litigation. "There are probably 50 lawsuits up and down the state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent Santa Barbara case, rent control was found to unlawfully deprive a 
mobile home park owner of the right to income. 
</P>
<P>
Park owners complained that they lose under rent control because mobile home 
owners can sell their coaches for higher prices when they are in 
rent-controlled parks, Kranitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of The Lamplighter Mobile Home Park on Pleasant Valley Road, one of 
four mobile home parks in the city, recently petitioned the city for an 
ordinance to prevent park owner Ed Delaplane from raising rents when coaches 
are sold. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents of the Lamplighter Mobile Home Park are currently unable to sell 
their homes," park association representative Michael Matthews wrote to the 
city. "The reason is that the owner, Mr. Delaplane, has raised space rents 
approximately 25% to the range of $475 to $500 per month for those people 
selling their homes." 
</P>
<P>
Delaplane could not be reached for comment, but a man who identified himself as 
the mobile home park manager verified Matthews' figures. 
</P>
<P>
Kranitz said city attorneys would not oppose an ordinance that prohibits 
increases on mobile home space rental when ownership is transferred between 
spouses or through estates. 
</P>
<P>
"Western Mobile Home Assn. has agreed to those transfers," she said, referring 
to the powerful statewide lobby for mobile home park owners. JOANNA MILLER

NORTH CITY WEST PLANS PETITION DRIVE TO DETOUR ROUTE 56 TO THE SOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North City West homeowners are making down payments of $100 and more on a plan 
to keep a major east-west freeway from bisecting their community. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting earlier this week, Jerry Mailhot, leader of the Carmel Valley 
Coalition, unveiled plans for a referendum petition drive designed to force the 
San Diego City Council to rescind its approval of the western State Route 56 
alignment through Carmel Valley or to put the issue to a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
Route 56, which has been in state Department of Transportation construction 
plans for more than two decades, is proposed to link with coastal Interstate 5 
at Carmel Valley Road east of Del Mar. The City Council adopted the westerly 
end of the freeway alignment May 8 after heated opposition from residents of 
surrounding upscale communities in North City West, Carmel Valley and Del Mar 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council was scheduled Monday to give final approval to the ordinance 
setting the Route 56 alignment through Carmel Valley but Mailhot protested that 
the two conditions of approval ordered by the council had not been included in 
the action. So the ordinance passage was postponed for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"That buys us time," Mailhot told a group of concerned North City West 
homeowners Monday night. The referendum petition drive cannot begin until the 
ordinance is adopted by the council, probably on June 4, he said. After that, 
the coalition has 30 days in which to gather at least 35,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The coastal suburbs near Del Mar have been fighting the freeway alignment for 
several years, arguing that the alignment should be moved to the south along 
the Carmel Mountain Road alignment. Such a route would be shorter, less 
expensive and would not disrupt residential neighborhoods along Carmel Valley, 
the coalition leaders claim. 
</P>
<P>
Mailhot, who is also a member of the North City West Planning Board, told 
residents that they must ante up donations to the Carmel Valley Coalition to 
finance the hiring of a professional signature-gathering firm which would 
supplement volunteer petition circulators to reach the petition goal. 
</P>
<P>
"We are bringing in donations at the rate of $1,000 a day," Mailhot said. He 
estimated that the group needed $35,000 to $45,000 to mount the referendum 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
If the coalition succeeds in gaining the required number of signatures on its 
referendum petitions, the San Diego City Council will be forced to rescind the 
ordinance setting the Route 56 alignment or order the issue placed on the 
ballot for a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem with the referendum, coalition leader Jan Fuchs said, "is 
that it will be perceived as a NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) issue." 
</P>
<P>
The new freeway, which will link inland I-15 with coastal I-5 and I-805 to San 
Diego, "will have ripple effects all up and down the coast" on traffic volumes, 
Fuchs said. Additional traffic on the already crowded coastal freeways would 
result from construction of the cross-county freeway, Fuchs said. 
</P>
<P>
Mailhot said that a route over Del Mar Mesa to the south of Carmel Valley would 
avoid the sensitive wetlands in the valley and the lagoon and would avoid the 
noise and pollution that a major roadway would bring to developed sections of 
North City West.

SCHOOL BOARD CUTS 2 ADMINISTRATIVE JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMELIA CHAFFEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura Unified School District governing board decided Tuesday night to 
eliminate two administrative positions. 
</P>
<P>
At its last meeting, due to pressure by parents and students, the board voted 
to cut 12 positions but to temporarily hold off cutting three others. 
</P>
<P>
Those were an assistant vice principal at each of the district's two high 
schools and the director of pupil personnel services. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening two weeks, parents recommended reducing the number of days 
administrators work and cutting other positions that they consider to be less 
crucial to students. Other suggestions included smaller travel, conference and 
car allowances. 
</P>
<P>
However, the board voted unanimously to stick to its original plan to eliminate 
the vice principal positions, saying the parent suggestions didn't save them 
enough money. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of an unidentified administrator, however, allowed the board to 
save the third position Tuesday. The board added new responsibilities to the 
job, redefining the position as director of pupil personnel and health 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts are being made by the district to balance the $58-million 1990-91 
budget. Until the governor signs the final state budget this summer, it is not 
known how large a cost-of-living adjustment will be granted to employees. 
</P>
<P>
The district has been estimating an increase of 4.2%, which would amount to a 
budget deficit of $1.2 million. If the state allocates less, which, according 
to preliminary remarks by the governor's office, seems likely, the district 
will have to make deeper cuts. AMELIA CHAFFEE

$950,000 LOSS CALLED INEVITABLE FOR SIX SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Unified School District is helpless to prevent six of its schools 
from losing a total of $950,000 in federal funds meant for schools with large 
numbers of low-income students, the board told an audience of about 200 at 
Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A federal audit of the distribution of the entitlement program, called Chapter 
1, was conducted in February and used San Diego Unified as a representative of 
all the districts in California. That audit found that the district had used 
improper criteria to distribute part of the $23 million the district receives 
under the program, said Supt. Tom Payzant. 
</P>
<P>
In order for the state to continue to receive money under the program, the 
state must satisfy the federal Department of Education that San Diego is in 
compliance with the program, Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
Five elementary schools and a junior high school, all in Paradise Hills, stand 
to lose the $950,000 beginning with the 1990-91 school year. An appeal of the 
audit's findings could freeze all the money the district is entitled to under 
Chapter 1, according to a staff report. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, a school being taken off the Chapter 1 program is given a 
one-year grace period to prepare itself for the funding cuts. The audit, 
however, found that the Paradise Hills schools were ineligible for the program 
this year, and thus have lost their grace period. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not going to be any grace period, and we don't have any choice but to 
comply," Payzant said. "We are literally talking about putting millions of 
dollars at stake for all the city schools." 
</P>
<P>
The federal government requires school districts distribute the funds based on 
poverty levels, with the schools with the highest poverty levels receiving 
money, while those that fall below a certain level do not. The San Diego 
district added an additional criterion based on academic achievement, the only 
district in the state to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"The district has used that criteria since the mid-1970s, and it was reviewed 
and approved by the state," said Noble Shade, director of external funding for 
the district, who said the federal ruling had not come as a surprise. "I had 
always felt wary about the district's criteria." 
</P>
<P>
Shade said that regulations and interpretations of the law have changed in the 
last year, bringing the district out of step. 
</P>
<P>
The schools that stand to lose their funding are: Boone, Field, Lee, Paradise 
Hills and Penn elementary schools and Bell Junior High School.

GREYSTONE MANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Ferrell's otherwise excellent piece on Beverly Hill's Greystone Mansion 
(Part A, May 8) credits me with having saved the historic house from demolition 
by removing a file from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
While the quote used was accurate, I had also explained to Ferrell that a 
sympathetic staff obviously wanted me to make sure the file was misplaced so 
that demolition permits would be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
I did "rush" to City Hall a few days before the council meeting, but not 
because I wanted to lose a file. I went at the request of then-Fire Chief 
Charles Benford and Mayor Leroy Watson to see if there were some means of 
preventing demolition. I did put the file in my brief case, but I then took it 
to the city attorney's office. They simply failed to send it back immediately. 
</P>
<P>
But the real credit for saving Greystone belongs to Benford. He took me on 
first tour of the grounds and the Doheny home and pleaded with me and others in 
the community to help prevent what would have been a tragic loss. All this 
happened in the early 1960s and even though no permanent use has yet been 
found, every City Council since then has continued the effort to prevent 
demolition. The Greystone Foundation, simply by existing, has also been 
responsible for preservation. 
</P>
<P>
I needed to clear the record so that city staff doesn't hide files when I walk 
in the door.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
WHY BUCK THE WATER-RATIONING TIDE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the dominant local water consumers, residents and businesses in the city of 
San Diego can make or break the County Water Authority's urgent call for 
conservation this summer. San Diego uses about 40% of the county's water 
supply; without its participation, the countywide goal of a 10% water savings 
between June and September would be difficult to meet. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, instead of adopting the modest mandatory water-use restrictions 
recommended by the Water Authority, San Diego has decided on a 60-day program 
of voluntary conservation. In addition to undermining the effort for a uniform 
countywide conservation program, the city's initiative, drawn up by Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor, is the kind of gamble that the county can ill afford this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Before Monday's San Diego City Council vote, 16 of the Water Authority's 24 
member agencies had adopted its call for mandatory restrictions on washing 
cars, watering lawns and hosing sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Customers of those agencies now can reasonably argue that mandatory 
restrictions unfairly target them, while the county's major users are free to 
water their lawns at mid-day. And what are San Francisco Bay Area communities, 
some of which have rationed water, to think of the cooperative spirit of the 
city at the end of the state's pipeline? 
</P>
<P>
Under the 60-day test, O'Connor will ask some of the city's biggest water users 
to find methods of conserving water. If the plan fails, O'Connor argues, the 
council can switch to a mandatory system. But by then, we will be two months 
into the four-month summer season, with little time left for a strategy change. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of O'Connor's gambit is that San Diegans are somehow different, that 
they are more than willing to sacrifice if government embraces them as partners 
instead of mandating behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. In 1977, during a bad drought, county residents racked up a 16% 
savings under a voluntary program. But in 1988, when the city and county called 
for voluntary conservation, only 4% was saved. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor also claims that her plan is more equitable than the Water Authority 
program, which largely targets external irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
The program is just the kind of against-conventional-wisdom venture that 
Maureen O'Connor loves -- and that she has pulled off in the past: Witness the 
success of last year's arts festival. This time, however, it would have been 
wiser to follow expert advice and set an example for the rest of the county.

SEN. CRANSTON ON USING PEACE DIVIDEND FOR NATIONAL NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was pleased to see Cranston's thoughtful analysis of the peace dividend. He 
clearly has recognized that the real danger to our security comes from wasted 
lives and crumbling infrastructure and not from Soviet missiles. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to have seen him allocate a small fraction of the peace dividend 
toward helping developing nations overcome hunger and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvest of Peace Resolution, introduced in the Senate by Sen. Mark Hatfield 
(R-Ore.), sets forth a vision of a world in which money spent on arms is 
directed instead toward human needs, and in which the U.S. provides leadership 
in reducing arms sales and resolving conflicts by negotiation. I hope that now 
that Cranston has completed his study of the peace dividend, he will join in 
co-sponsoring this resolution.

A GIVEAWAY OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY; 
</P>
<P>
U. S. AID: WITHOUT STRUCTURAL REFORMS, OUR TAX DOLLARS WILL DO LITTLE FOR 
EASTERN EUROPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID DREIER, David Dreier (R-La Verne) is the chairman of the House 
Republican Task Force on Foreign Policy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thought you had seen the last of inefficient, centralized economies in Eastern 
Europe? Think again. Congress is plodding forward with a multibillion-dollar 
aid package designed to reward even the most committed centralized planner. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, what started out as a legitimate effort to assist the emerging 
democracies has become a contest to see who can spend the most tax dollars in 
the shortest period of time. These efforts ignore past experience with our 
foreign aid budgets, as well as current fiscal and political realities. 
</P>
<P>
While direct U.S. aid will certainly play a valuable role in the developing 
economies of Eastern Europe, aid without structural reform will be ineffective. 
Britain, the largest recipient of U.S. aid from the Marshall Plan, continued to 
rely on socialist economic policies during the postwar era. As a result, it 
remained economically stagnant throughout much of the 1950s. West Germany, 
which adopted more aggressive market-oriented policies in 1948, received far 
less U.S. financial aid but recovered in a matter of a few years. 
</P>
<P>
The United States cut off economic assistance to South Korea in the early 
1960s, believing its economy to be hopeless. Today, as a result of structural 
reforms, South Korea has one of the strongest economies in Asia. The lesson is 
that money is no substitute for sound market-driven economy policy. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have 
already committed more than $2.1 billion to Poland alone. Japan and other Asian 
and European countries have pledged billions more. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, legislation for the multibillion-dollar giveaway moves along. Some 
experts are now concerned that the economies of the region may have difficulty 
absorbing these vast resources. Asst. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger 
told the House Budget Committee in March: "We may get more out of spending less 
each year for the next several years." 
</P>
<P>
President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia expressed similar concerns. "We do not 
want direct aid," he said during his visit to Congress. Another Czech official 
was even more blunt. "Foreign aid," he said, "is for Third World countries." 
</P>
<P>
So why isn't Congress listening? Unlike the new leaders of Eastern Europe, many 
still fail to grasp the benefits of private enterprise and free markets. The 
cure for any ailing economy is free trade, not aid. We need creative, private 
sector means of helping our friends in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
To spur U.S. investment, Congress should provide tax incentives for American 
businesses who hold business management conferences in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
To improve human capital, a fellowship training program should be established 
to bring young leaders from Eastern Europe to the United States to work with 
Congress, businesses and the media. 
</P>
<P>
Small business development is the engine that drives any free-market economy. 
Retired American business executives are a valuable resource. The Small 
Business Administration's Senior Corps of Retired Executives program, which 
consists of volunteers willing to share their talents and expertise, could be 
expanded to provide management assistance for emerging entrepreneurs in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. government should practice what it preaches. If the goal is to 
encourage private sector development in Eastern Europe, it makes no sense to 
expand our own bureaucracy to do it. American aid should be funneled through 
private organizations whenever possible. Last November's aid bill contained 
more than $938 million for Eastern Europe, but much of it was sent through the 
already overworked U.S. embassy system. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has a critical role to play in Eastern Europe's transition 
from centrally planned economies to free markets and private enterprise. In our 
zeal to pass along America's secrets to success, great pains must be taken to 
ensure that we don't also pass along our mistakes. International welfare 
programs only increase dependence and remove incentives for individual 
initiative. As the old Chinese proverb says, "Give a man a fish, and he will 
eat for a day. Teach him to fish, and he will eat for a lifetime."

'THE PEOPLE' AS EXECUTIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERRILL M. MITLER, Dr. Merrill M. Mitler is a clinical professor of 
psychiatry at UC San Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clearly, our society has not arrived at a consensus on the death penalty. Some 
states have it, others do not. But state laws calling for executions are not 
indicative of even geographically limited consensus. Passing a law requires 
only a simple majority of votes in a legislature or referendum, which is not a 
true consensus. Long stays on Death Row and numerous appeal proceedings may 
actually be symptomatic of this lack of consensus. 
</P>
<P>
We might come closer to consensus if a different method of execution were used, 
one that clarified certain moral issues involved in the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose, instead of the present execution system conducted by employees of the 
state, out of public sight, we select execution committees from the communities 
in which the capital crimes were committed. 
</P>
<P>
These committees would be selected on a case-by-case basis, as juries are. Once 
notified, the citizen would have to report to a court-supervised proceeding to 
select the 12-person execution committee. 
</P>
<P>
An execution could not take place until the community produced a duly selected 
committee. At the execution site, each of the committee would see the prisoner 
in the execution chamber. At the appointed time, each would press a button that 
could trigger the lethal event. The gas pellet would not drop or the 
electricity would not flow until all buttons were pressed at essentially the 
same time. Like a military firing squad, only one person would actually kill 
the prisoner, but everyone would know that he or she might have been the one to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
I submit that such a system is closer to the real intent of capital punishment. 
At present, we arrest, try and sentence capital offenders in the name of "the 
People," but assign our governmental and judicial officials the burden of 
carrying out the wishes of "the People." Many such officials are uncomfortable 
with this responsibility, which undoubtedly contributes to the delay. By 
contrast, with the execution committee system, those who represent the segment 
of society injured by the criminal would carry out the execution. 
</P>
<P>
Society could learn from this hands-on execution process. By examining how 
people are selected, or excused, from serving on an execution committee, we 
could assess the willingness of a community to execute a prisoner. By studying 
committee members before and after the execution, we could examine both good 
and bad effects of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
I have tried to imagine myself as a member of an execution committee. What 
would I do the night before the execution? Go to church? Read a book? Go to a 
movie? And what would I do after I pressed the button? Have breakfast? Go to 
work? 
</P>
<P>
Then, would my community treat me as if I'd done an honorable service? Or would 
I be an outcast? 
</P>
<P>
In any event, society would have the compensation it demanded, obtained by 
someone from the community that suffered the crime. And no one could ever again 
avoid thinking carefully about which criminals, if any, should be killed.

CAN WE SOAR WITHOUT AEROSPACE?; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE CUTBACKS COULD BE THE TRIGGER FOR A SLOWDOWN THAT THE GOLDEN STATE IS 
ILL-EQUIPPED TO HANDLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HENSLEY, David Hensley is director of California forecasting for the 
UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's economy is more vulnerable than is commonly acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
A host of problems -- ranging from high home prices to severe traffic 
congestion -- is causing a palpable rise in dissatisfaction with life in the 
Golden State and making business increasingly reluctant to locate or expand 
here. The failure to effectively deal with these problems, coupled with the 
rise in environmentalism, makes it appear that the state is headed for a 
protracted period of slower growth. Deep reductions in U.S. military spending 
could trigger such a slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
Should a major rollback in military spending occur, the one reassuring fact is 
that nowadays defense constitutes a considerably smaller component of the 
California economy. For example, the two most defense-dependent industries, 
aircraft and missiles, currently account for 2% of total employment in 
California. In the late 1960s, that figure was 4.5%. Similarly, the California 
Commission on State Finance estimates that U.S. military spending in California 
currently equals 8% of California's gross state product, down from 14% at the 
height of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, an examination of the states that have experienced regional 
downturns in the midst of this 7-year-plus national economic expansion 
indicates that 8% is still a considerable share of California's output. For 
example, energy-related industries accounted for 10% of Texas' gross product 
before oil prices collapsed and the economy there went into a severe recession. 
More disturbingly, the securities industry accounted for just 5% ofNew York 
state's gross product when the stockmarket collapsed in October, 1987. Yet 
thecrash apparently is the catalyst of the current downturn in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, while California has moved away from defense over the past 20 years 
-- an advantage if defense spending is going into a prolonged contraction -- 
the combination of rapid growth and stringent fiscal policy has produced a host 
of new problems -- concerns over infrastructure, especially transportation; 
fears that the quality of education has declined; a perception that progress on 
cleaning up the environment has stalled; the spreading of crime and gang 
violence, and home prices that are nearly double the national average. 
</P>
<P>
If defense employment begins to shrink, what industries might pick up the 
slack? In the 1970s, it was computers and semiconductors. Between them, these 
industries added 170,000 jobs from 1972 through 1984. But they have been 
shedding jobs ever since. Fierce international competition has forced these 
industries to invest in capital and raise labor productivity, eliminating them 
as important sources of job growth. 
</P>
<P>
Many had hoped that the demand for commercial aircraft would offset any decline 
in military contracts since McDonnell Douglas (and Boeing in Seattle) have 
enormous order backlogs. However, these hopes were dashed by recent 
announcements that Douglas will lay off 4,000 workers by summertime. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that California's booming rate of population growth ensures a 
robust economy. However, the recessions in Texas and Arizona in the 1980s are 
poignant testimony that continued high rates of population growth are not 
inevitable, nor do they provide insurance against future economic troubles. 
California itself learned this lesson in the early 1970s, when net in-migration 
plummeted to record lows as the state's economy, punished by consecutive 10% 
declines in real military spending, ground to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
Should deep defense cuts occur, there will inevitably be some shrinkage in 
defense employment in California. What has not been considered is a possible 
exodus of businesses and individuals, dislodged by the spending rollback. Both 
McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed recently announced plans to transfer defense 
work to out-of-state sites in pursuit of increased efficiency; an alternative 
explanation is that they are attempting to reduce their presence in high-cost 
Southern California. The loss of defense contracts provides a convenient time 
to do so. Similarly, individuals who lose their jobs either directly or as an 
indirect result of defense cuts might take the opportunity to leave the state. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus view is that California is much better positioned to absorb 
defense cuts than before. Yet the arguments behind this view bear an eerie 
correspondence to the late 1960s. Then analysts cited the state's industrial 
diversification, commercial aircraft backlogs and robust population growth as 
reasons why California would weather defense cuts in good shape. In truth, the 
cutbacks took a terrible toll on the California economy, although the state 
bounced back after several years. Moreover, this view ignores the other changes 
that have occurred over the past 20 years, many of them for the worse. These 
countervailing forces mean that major defense cuts could have a much bigger 
impact on the state's economy than we realize.

emperor. Dissolution of a federal union is equally difficult. Nevertheless, 
those are the tasks that face Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Some American commentators have drawn analogies to Abraham Lincoln and the 
secession movement that led to the Civil War, but the situations are not 
parallel. The Soviet Union is not a historically unified nation; neither is it 
composed of constituent parts that voluntarily accepted central leadership. 
Today's Soviet state is composed of Slavic Great Russia, two additional Slavic 
"republics" and a cobbled-together assortment of provinces largely inhabited by 
non-Russian, non-Slavic, and in many cases, nonwhite and non-Christian, 
peoples. Nearly all of the Soviet republics in which nationalism now threatens 
adhesion to Moscow were once sovereign states. In most of them, Russian is 
still a foreign tongue. 
</P>
<P>
There is no good reason to cast Gorbachev in the role of Lincoln. Preservation 
of the Great Russian Empire, handed down from the czars to the commissars, need 
not be central to his goals and strategy. Indeed, unless the Russian officers 
of the Soviet Army are capable of ordering the same lethal force against 
citizens of the Baltic republics, Georgia and the Ukraine as they did against 
Muslim Azerbaijanis and Christian Armenians, and unless Russian soldiers will 
shoot their Slavic kin, it is unlikely that the empire can be preserved in its 
present form. There are, however, two ways to lose an empire. 
</P>
<P>
After World War II, the French fought a bloody but futile campaign to hang on 
to their holdings in Indochina and North Africa, at an enormous cost in money, 
lives and international standing. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the British looked at the map, at the resources available to 
sustain an imperial renaissance and at their probable lack of success. 
Pretending that Britain made no attempts to postpone the inevitable would be 
unfair to those who fought to liberate their nations. Nevertheless, from the 
emancipation of India and Pakistan onward, the world witnessed a series of 
midnight ceremonies in which the Union Jack was slowly lowered and given into 
the hands of a representative of the royal family and the flag of a new nation 
snappily unfurled in the spotlight. In place of a global empire, Great Britain 
engineered a successful but loose commonwealth based on commercial ties and a 
certain amount of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
This is an option worth President Gorbachev's careful attention. A Soviet 
commonwealth could incorporate a free trade area, perhaps including Estonia, 
Latvia and Lithuania and extending to the Muslim crescent on the Asian border. 
While members of the Soviet commonwealth would be independent and sovereign, 
they might adopt a convertible ruble as a common currency. Most members of the 
British Commonwealth acknowledge the Queen as their own head of state; that is 
unlikely to work for a Soviet commonwealth, but neither has it proved necessary 
in the British one. Nations of the British Commonwealth do not share a common 
policy toward the rest of the world, but they do meet annually to discuss their 
differences with civility; a Soviet commonwealth could function similarly. 
</P>
<P>
There is little alternative: In the shortest of terms -- the end of 1990, or 
the end of next week -- the network of buffer states known as the Warsaw Pact 
will cease to function. The two Germanys will merge; Hungary, Poland and 
Czechoslovakia will all have non-socialist governments inclined to look 
westward for industrial markets and supplies, and perhaps eastward to sell 
agricultural products. In the only slightly longer term, the Baltic republics 
will cease to function as provinces of the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, all three 
will keep their historic and commercial ties to Russia, and Lithuania was a 
Russian province for more than five centuries before achieving independence 
after World War I. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the decade, the centrifugal force of nationalism will likely rip 
Transcaucasia -- Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia -- from the Russian empire. A 
commonwealth should benefit the new states and the old empire. It is difficult, 
however, to envision these regions being economically self-sufficient, except 
at the level of 18th-Century agriculture and 19th-Century industry. Their 
natural markets and natural sources of raw materials are clearly in Russia, not 
in the West. 
</P>
<P>
More important to the survival of Russia (as opposed to the Soviet Union) is a 
continuing association with the Ukraine, which provides about half of the 
Soviet grain harvest, with Georgia and its mineral wealth and warmer-weather 
agriculture and with Slavic Byelorussia. Unfortunately for 
Gorbachev-as-Lincoln, the forces pulling these three republics away from Moscow 
are rooted in language, history and religion, emotional forces far stronger 
than the need for a joint economy. Barring civil war, the Slavic parts of 
today's Soviet Union are likely to spin apart someday. The less tangible but 
more profitable ties of a commonwealth are, however, apt to prove more enduring 
than bonds imposed by force. Choosing commonwealth instead of union may be 
Gorbachev's last option.

Former Chicago Cub star Ron Santo, now a radio announcer for the club, was 
saying, "In my day we didn't have all these fancy training aids, like magnetic 
resonance imaging." 
</P>
<P>
Said his broadcast partner, former San Francisco Giant catcher Bob Brenly: "In 
your day they were still using leeches." 
</P>

Nothing to fear: St. Louis Cardinal pitcher Joe Magrane, who finally won his 
first game since last August, wears a T-shirt that says: "Throw strikes. Babe

He called it: Chicago Bull Coach Phil Jackson, who majored in psychology and 
religion in college, told the Washington Post: "I never thought I would be a

GWYNN: CRITICISM 'TOUGH TO SWALLOW'; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES: HIS REACTION TO PUBLISHED COMMENTS BY TEAMMATE MIKE PAGLIARULO 
OVERSHADOWS ANOTHER LOSS, 6-1 IN MONTREAL.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Gwynn, the Padre right fielder, kept saying over and over Tuesday how the 
clubhouse talk doesn't bother him. He talked about how he'll shrug off the 
remarks of teammate Mike Pagliarulo. He even snickered at any thought of 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to be convincing, but his words lost all credibility when he looked up 
and his face was contorted with pain. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I thought I got along with everybody," he said. "I've always tried 
to do my very best. And God only knows how much I love to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought any of my teammates would ever think of me this way." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn stopped, shut his eyes and buried his head in his hands, hiding his hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn has listened to the criticism of the front office in recent months 
because of his public dissatisfaction over his contract. 
</P>
<P>
He has listened to the criticism of his playing weight. 
</P>
<P>
He has listened to the criticism of his low RBI production. 
</P>
<P>
Even when you're a four-time batting champion and a three-time Gold Glove 
winner, when your team is 18-20 -- it lost again, 6-1, to the Montreal Expos 
Tuesday night -- you share the blame. 
</P>
<P>
But in Gwynn's illustrious seven-year career, never has anyone said anything so 
ugly about him. 
</P>
<P>
And what could be more vicious in a team sport as baseball to be called a 
selfish player, not caring if your team wins or loses? 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo, in an interview published in the New York Daily News, talked about 
life as an ex-Yankee and was quoted as saying, "He cares only about his hits. 
If we win, and he goes zero for four, forget it, he's ticked. If he gets his 
hits, and we lose, that's fine with him. He doesn't give a . . . about this 
team, and that's weak. Donnie (Mattingly) would've kicked that guy's ass the 
first day." 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo never mentioned Gwynn by name in the interview, but the implication 
was clear. He was referring to Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
"My gut feeling is that they were directed toward me," Gwynn said, "and that a 
lot of guys here think that way. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're going through a tough time right now," Gwynn said. "If we 
were all doing our job, we'd be winning, wouldn't we? 
</P>
<P>
"But this, this is tough to swallow. I've never been through anything like this 
before. I've never been criticized by one of my teammates in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
"And to have someone say you don't care about your team, to say I don't care 
about winning, is awfully hard to take. 
</P>
<P>
"To have someone actually say I'm selfish, that I think only about myself and 
not worry about winning, I have to speak out. I have to stand up for my 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo is not the first Padre player to accuse Gwynn of being selfish. In 
fact, just two months ago in spring training, one of his teammates anonymously 
incriminated Gwynn for the same offense. 
</P>
<P>
But this was the first time any player has publicly criticized Gwynn, a 
lifetime .332 hitter who just so happens to be batting .336 this season after 
going two for four Tuesday with a single and run-scoring triple. 
</P>
<P>
"How can people criticize me for the way I play?" Gwynn said. "Obviously, I 
must be doing something right to be hitting .300 every year, right?" 
</P>
<P>
"What are these people basing this it on, that when I have a bad game, I get 
mad at myself? Hey, I'm sure he (Pagliarulo) was real happy when he was 
struggling, wasn't he? 
</P>
<P>
"This guy doesn't even know me, and he's saying this." 
</P>
<P>
When asked to elaborate on his comments Tuesday, Pagliarulo declined. Nor would 
he confirm that he was speaking of Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
"Let them assume what they want," Pagliarulo said. "If you're a team player, 
you don't worry about it, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn's critics say there's a basis for their accusations and, speaking 
anonymously, they listed them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He's happy after games in which the Padres lose if has a good game, and 
upset after games in which the Padres win if he has a poor game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He refuses to blemish his batting average by moving a runner over with a 
ground ball to the right side of the infield, and instead bunts runners over to 
protect his average. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When a runner on base attempts to steal second, Gwynn will always swing, 
knowing there's a bigger gap in the infield defense, even though the base 
runner might have a great jump for a stolen base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just watch him closely, you'll see what I'm talking about," said a teammate 
who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gwynn: "I guess it gives you an indication of what people perceive of you, 
doesn't it? Why don't they say that stuff to my face instead of going through 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
"You know why I bunt so much, because I don't pull the ball very well. I hit 
the other way, that's what I do best. So to assure the runner of moving over, I 
bunt. 
</P>
<P>
"What am I supposed to do, go out and play the way they want me to play, just 
to make them happy. (Pause). Listen to what I just said. It doesn't make sense. 
I'm going to play my game just for them? Right. 
</P>
<P>
"What Pags said is so completely wrong. If they feel that way, fine. I'm not 
going to change the way I'm playing. You know, I feel like saying, 'You do your 
job, do your own damn job. And I'll do mine.' 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if the Padres don't like the way I'm playing, then I've got problems. No 
one ever said anything to me about it. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is so distressing. You know, I've heard whispers and other 
things in the clubhouse about me, but never something like this. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Tempy (Garry Templeton) once told me that I'm not a team guy 
because I don't hang out with the guys after games. Hey, I just like going to 
my room after games, and watching TV or videos. If they want to go out and have 
drinks and stuff, that's fine. That's them. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is the way I choose to live my life." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn says he won't approach Pagliarulo about his comments until he tells him 
to his face. Then, he vowed, he'll listen. He won't even yell, just listen. 
</P>
<P>
"What a year it's been already, huh? Unbelievable. You know, before this, the 
only time I've been criticized in the newspapers by my teammates is for 
stealing time in the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, well, what do they say? Only the strong survive? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that's me "I know when it's over, I'll be able to hold my head high." 
</P>
<P>
"I just know it." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Major League Baseball ownership committee, which must approve the sale of 
the Padres, has not yet begun to examine Tom Werner's ownership group, which 
could delay the finalization of the deal until at least mid-June. "They haven't 
even signed a contract yet," said Jerry Reinsdorf, Chicago White Sox owner, "so 
we haven't started looking into them. We won't do anything until they have a 
binding contract. Once we get the paper work, we have 90 days to make a 
decision. I'm not saying it'll take the full 90 days, but it could delay our 
action until the owners' meetings (June 13-15) in Cleveland, or even after." 
Attorney Scott Wolfe, a partner in Werner's 10-man ownership group, said that 
the deal is not expected to be finalized between owner Joan Kroc and Werner 
until the middle of next week. "We're still plugging away," Wolfe said, "but 
everything's going fine. We're on schedule. Our hope still is that it'll be 
approved in Cleveland, at the latest." . . . Expo third baseman Tim Wallach, 
who hit a three-run homer in the first inning off loser Ed Whitson (3-3), is 
seven for 10 against the Padres in his past two games with 12 RBIs, five runs 
and three three-run homers. . . . Eric Show made his first relief appearance 
since Aug. 11, 1986, when he pitched the fifth and six innings. He allowed two 
hits and one earned run. . . . The Padres still are talking to two teams about 
Padre reserve outfielder Jerald Clark. The New York Yankees are one of the 
teams, McKeon confirmed, but would not say which National League is involved. 
There has been no interest in Show, sources said. . . . Padre left fielder Bip 
Roberts was kept out of the lineup with a strained left hamstring but could 
play tonight. "The way he hobbled off the field the other day," McKeon said, "I 
thought he was going to die. We'll see how he is." The move provided first 
baseman Phil Stephenson his first start since May 6 and moved Joe Carter back 
to center field. . . . Padre first baseman Jack Clark, who has been out since 
May 6 with a strained lower back, now might miss the entire nine games in this 
trip. "It's going to take some time," he said. . . . Clark, on Mike 
Pagliarulo's comments about Tony Gwynn: "The timing is different. We're 
struggling. We don't need to get into that. But, hey, Pags is a good guy. He 
just wants to win."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
CANSECO'S GRAND SLAM IS ONLY SECOND FAVORITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics' Jose Canseco hit his first regular-season grand slam 
with authority. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco's home run at the SkyDome Tuesday landed on the roof of the stadium 
club overlooking the center-field seats and led the Athletics to a 5-4 victory 
over the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco's only other major league grand slam came against the Dodgers in the 
first game of the 1988 World Series. It was his only hit of the series. 
</P>
<P>
"It ranks as my second favorite home run simply because it was a grand slam," 
said Canseco, who has 15 home runs in 38 games. "The No. 1 was the one in the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some trouble hitting with the bases loaded. Maybe that will end it." 
</P>
<P>
The SkyDome is rapidly becoming Canseco's favorite home run park. He hit his 
first there after coming back from injury last season, then hit a long home run 
in the championship series there. 
</P>
<P>
"Jose does it again," Curt Young (2-1) said. "I'm glad he's on our team." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Eckersley got his 11th save by striking out two in a scoreless ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays, who lost pitcher Jimmy Key in the fourth inning because of a 
hamstring injury, got home runs from Manny Lee, Junior Felix and Kelly Gruber 
in the sixth inning. Gruber also had homered in the fourth and has 12 for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 3, Seattle 2 -- Bill Spiers, batting .077, bounced a single through a 
drawn-in infield with the bases loaded and one out in the ninth inning for the 
victory at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer Manager Tom Trebelhorn had a ready explanation for using the youngster 
despite his poor start this season. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a big league hitter last year and he'll be a big league hitter this 
year," Trebelhorn said. "So I decided this was the spot for him to get 
started." 
</P>
<P>
The hit made a winner of Mark Knudson (3-1), who gave up seven hits, including 
Ken Griffey Jr.'s 10th home run, and pitched his first complete game of the 
season. He is 3-0 lifetime against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 10, Minnesota 2 -- Joe Orsulak hit two home runs and drove in four 
runs at Baltimore and the Twins lost for only the fifth time in their last 19 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Orsulak's second homer capped a six-run rally in the fifth inning. It came too 
late for Jeff Ballard, who hasn't won this season. Ballard led the league's 
left-handers with 18 victories last season. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Orioles' 10th victory in their last 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Chicago 2 -- Bob Geren ended a two-for-29 slump with a three-run 
home run at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Both dugouts emptied during an argument between the Yankees' Deion Sanders and 
White Sox catcher Carlton Fisk. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk, 42, is outspoken in his criticism of the failure of young players to 
hustle. In the third inning, Sanders merely stood at the plate after hitting a 
pop-up with a runner on third and one out. 
</P>
<P>
When he came up in the sixth, Fisk told the youngster what he thought about 
Sanders' lack of hustle in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 9, Detroit 8 -- The Royals ended their 14-game Tiger Stadium losing 
streak, but only after relief pitcher Jeff Montgomery got the final out with 
the bases loaded in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 5, Boston 4 -- Rookie Jack Daugherty had four consecutive singles at 
Boston and the Rangers won for only the third time in their last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Russell earned a save by striking out Tony Pena to end the game with 
runners on second and third. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
REDS WALK DAWSON INTENTIONALLY FIVE TIMES IN 2-1 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds paid the ultimate compliment to hot-hitting Andre Dawson 
Tuesday at Chicago, but in the end, it cost them. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs' slugging right fielder, who leads the National League in home runs 
and runs batted in, was given a major league record five intentional walks. 
</P>
<P>
The record-breaking fifth walk loaded the bases in the 16th inning, and Dave 
Clark followed with a single to give the Cubs a 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record of four was set by Roger Maris of the New York Yankees 
against the Angels May 22, 1962 and tied by Garry Templeton of San Diego 
against Pittsburgh July 5, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In the 12th inning the Reds gave an intentional walk to Dawson with runners on 
first and second and two out. With the potential winning run on third, Lloyd 
McClendon grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
In the 14th Dawson was walked and Clark, as a pinch-hitter, struck out. 
</P>
<P>
"How many times did we do it?" asked Red Manager Lou Piniella. "Five? Oh, my 
God. But the situations warranted it." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sabo homered in the 13th, but Randy Myers was tagged for a home run by 
Luis Salazar to start the bottom of the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, San Francisco 2 -- Len Dykstra hit a pair of doubles and drove 
in a run at San Francisco to help Ken Howell (5-3) hand the Giants their fourth 
loss in a row. The Giants are 6-15 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Howell and three relievers held the faltering Giants to four hits. The only 
damage was Will Clark's two-run home run off Howell in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra leads the majors with a .405 average. The fleet center fielder is a big 
reason the Phillies, with a 22-16 record, have reversed last season's start. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Atlanta 3 -- With the Cardinals having trouble scoring runs, a 
pitcher who can hit is a valuable asset. 
</P>
<P>
Jose DeLeon pitched eight strong innings, giving up four hits and striking out

MARTINEZ NEARLY PERFECT AS CHULA VISTA WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jennifer Martinez glared at the catcher's mitt, went into her windmill delivery 
and . . . pop! 
</P>
<P>
An instant later, ball struck mitt perfectly. Remember that word, for this was 
only warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
A little over an hour and eight innings later, Martinez and Chula Vista High 
were 1-0 winners over Mt. Carmel in the quarterfinal round of the San Diego 
Section 3-A softball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first 23 batters (7 2/3 innings), Martinez was indeed perfect. The 
24th -- Trish Maumausolo -- grounded into the hole to the right of shortstop 
Kathy Slatinsky, who made a fine play, only to see her throw tip off first 
baseman Monica Medina's mitt. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Catcher Lisa Wilson quickly eliminated Maumausolo on an attempted 
steal. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom half of the eighth, Wilson (two for four) lined a single up the 
middle that scored Slatinsky from second, and the Spartans (20-8) advanced to 
Thursday's semifinal against Orange Glen at Kit Carson Park in Escondido. Mt. 
Carmel finished 20-5. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez (12-3) finished with her second no-hitter, 13 strikeouts and endless 
praise from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew in the first inning it was going to be tough to hit her," said 
Jennifer Ortiz, Mt. Carmel's freshman pitcher, who worked a three-hitter 
heading into the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"To throw a no-hitter against a team like that was something," Chula Vista 
Coach Debi Daenzer said. "(Martinez) pitched an awesome game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Martinez, just a sophomore, "Even when I was warming up, I could feel I 
was going to have a good game. I could pick out a spot and hit it. My spin, my 
rise, everything was on." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was on between the foul lines, too. She didn't come close to walking a 
batter and started the game by striking out seven of the first nine. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista loaded the bases in the bottom of the first and had runners on in 
five of the regulation seven innings, but each time was denied by Ortiz (17-3). 
She struck out Medina to end the first, and in the seventh got a nice double 
play when first baseman Stacy Thimjon dove and caught in the air a bunt 
attempt, got up and threw to first for the force. JIM LINDGREN

In other 3-A games: 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista 5, Sweetwater 4 -- Rancho Buena Vista scored the eventual 
winning run on a balk -- a call that Sweetwater (20-9) protested. Sweetwater's 
Larry Meza, a right-hander, had just taken the mound -- after Rancho Buena 
Vista scored two runs -- when he stepped backwards off the mound with his left 
foot. The umpire called a balk, and the Longhorns (16-11-1) went ahead, 5-4. 
Steve Valencia was two for four, and George Hadden (7-4) was the winner for 
Rancho Buena Vista, which will play host to Mira Mesa if the protest -- to be 
decided today -- is denied. 
</P>
<P>
Poway 3, Southwest 2 -- After fouling off a 3-1 squeeze attempt, Phil Portiera 
doubled in the winning run in the bottom of the seventh for top-seeded Poway 
(20-6-1). Catcher Matt Schwenke hit a two-run home run in the fifth, and Danny 
Miller (12-1) won in relief for Poway, which will play host to Monte Vista in 
Thursday's quarterfinals. Southwest finished 13-14. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista 1, Hilltop 0 -- Hilltop's Jose Silva had 13 strikeouts and allowed 
just two hits, but one was a home run in the top of the sixth by Ernie Reyes. 
Silva's counterpart, Robbie Stone, allowed just three hits and struck out seven 
to improve to 9-4. Monte Vista improved to 18-11-1. Hilltop, which forfeited 17 
victories, wound up 2-25. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen 4, El Capitan 3 -- Brian Kooiman was three for four with two 
doubles and a run to lead Orange Glen (17-12) over No. 5 El Capitan (18-11). 
Orange Glen will play at Patrick Henry in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry 6, Castle Park 2 -- The Patriots (15-12) chased Castle Park 
(19-11) starter Bob Cardenas in the first as the scored four runs. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Waushek (6-0) went the distance and struck out four. 
</P>
<P>

(21-8) its only runs. David Silvas (9-2) threw a six-hitter. Point Loma 
finished 14-13.

<P>
Mt. Carmel 3, Granite Hills 2 -- Mt. Carmel (21-7) won at home and will play at

Judge to View Mapplethorpe Photos: A judge said Tuesday he will view the 
controversial Robert Mapplethorpe photo exhibition before it closes at 
Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center this weekend. Hamilton County Municipal 
Judge David Albanese, scheduled to be the trial judge in an obscenity case 
concerning the photos, said he will keep the date and time of his visit a 
secret in order to prevent his tour from becoming a media circus. Attorneys for 
both the prosecution and defense had requested that the judge look at the 
exhibit before it leaves Cincinnati for Boston. GREG BRAXTON

RALLY WILL CALL FOR ARTS FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego arts community has put out a spirited call to "show your heart 
for the arts" on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 12:30 p.m. rally at the Civic Theatre concourse is billed as a protest 
against a proposed city budget that would cut the heart out of arts funding. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a looming $60-million budget shortfall, San Diego City Manager John 
Lockwood has proposed eliminating funding to arts organizations from next 
year's $1.2-billion municipal budget. Such groups as The Old Globe Theatre, the 
La Jolla Playhouse, the San Diego Repertory Theatre, and the San Diego Symphony 
would receive nothing if the City Council adopts the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than hold a wake, rally organizers are planning a protest to 
demonstrate what the arts do best, according to Adrian Stewart, founder and 
president of the San Diego Arts and Cultural Coalition which is coordinating 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
The Starlight Musical Theatre Company will perform numbers from the Follies and 
the O'Farrell School performing arts troupe will also provide dance and music, 
said Stewart. "We know how to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of art patrons are expected to attend the rally, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need people who care to come. The rally is for everybody who's ever 
listened to a symphony, watched a ballet dancer or looked at a painting and 
been inspired." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that 560,000 school children attended arts performances last year, 
Stewart said the rally is for "anyone who cares about the quality of life for 
their children." 
</P>
<P>
The arts organizations are not a frill, Stewart said. "We're an essential part 
of the quality of life in this city. America's finest city is America's finest 
city because of its arts and cultural scene."

42ND 'TORA-SAN' EXAMINES FIRST LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With "Tora-san, My Uncle" (at the Little Tokyo Cinemas), writer-director Yoji 
Yamada makes something of a departure in No. 42 in the world's longest-running 
film series. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, Tora (Kiyoshi Atsumi), that short-tempered but kindly and lovable 
itinerant peddler, plays Mary Worth to an individual or a couple he meets on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
This time, his advice to the lovelorn is directed toward his nephew Mitsuo 
(Hidetaka Yoshioka), a recent high school graduate whose all-important 
preparation for Japan's stiff college entrance exam is threatened by the throes 
of first love. 
</P>
<P>
This Tora-san, like all the others, in its depiction of warm family life and 
natural beauty, exudes a strong nostalgic pull for a Japan that was more 
spacious, beautiful and personal than it is today. 
</P>
<P>
Also at Little Tokyo is a revival of the near-three-hour version of Kon 
Ichikawa's splendid "Tokyo Olympiad."KEVIN THOMAS

THREE GLIMPSES OF SCORSESE'S ROOTS AS A MAN AND A FILMMAKER

Two early, vivid documentary portraits by Martin Scorsese are here briefly (at 
the Nuart today and Thursday): the homey and revealing "Italianamerican," made 
at Scorsese's parents' apartment on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, and the 
serio-hilarious "American Boy," the best, worst and funniest highlights of the 
drug-drenched '70s, recounted masterfully by techie/roadie/sometime actor 
Steven Prince. 
</P>
<P>
In "Italianamerican," Catherine and Charles Scorsese, perched together on their 
living room sofa, are at first as stiff as the protective plastic that covers 
it, but their son has a nice way of coaxing out the stories that obviously 
filled his and his brother's childhood. What emerges -- through disputes about 
whose father's homemade wine was better and Mrs. Scorsese's bustling trips to 
the kitchen to tend to her spaghetti and meatballs -- is a sense of family, of 
history, of neighborhood and of Italian-American culture sturdy as a grape vine 
and as tough. (Sauce recipe given before the credits and clearly worth jotting 
down.) 
</P>
<P>
Rich and affectionate, this short film works like the back story to Scorsese's 
"Mean Streets" or to the Little Italy sequences of "Godfather II": Charley 
Scorsese explaining that all the families in the building were virtually one; 
if his mother's dinner didn't sound promising, he could always scramble 
downstairs to another that suited him better. His family of seven took in two 
boarders for whom his mother also cooked and washed; Catherine's nine-member 
family was self-contained -- "We had more money" she teases -- with a generous 
supply of older kids to look after the younger ones. 
</P>
<P>
Scanning these faces, watching the connections between son and mother, between 
husband and wife and back to their own parents, is like seeing a Jacob Riis 
photograph pop to life. And with the stories of one wave of immigrants elbowing 
out the wave before them comes a sense of continuity that's almost mythic. 
There's drama of a different sort over at "American Boy," as Scorsese, no 
slouch as a storyteller himself, surrenders the floor at a fellow actor's house 
in Hollywood to Steven Prince, whose life has barely known a quiet moment and 
apparently never a dull one. The vastly likable Prince, who played the 
speed-talking gun dealer in "Taxi Driver," has a little of the qualities of 
"Parting Glances" actor Steve Buscemi: same huge lemur eyes, same frail frame, 
same nice flair for irony. 
</P>
<P>
As he did in "Raging Bull," Scorsese uses home movies of Prince and his family 
as a sort of visual counterpoint to Prince's wild, collectable stories. Prince 
was an Army brat in Great Neck, Long Island, with serious Hollywood relations 
-- his uncle was Abe Lastfogel, who ran the William Morris Agency for 60 years. 
He was a backstage techie on the New York theater scene when he was 18 and Neil 
Diamond's road manager when he was 21 years old. About that time, there was his 
period of serious heroin addiction, later kicked. Filter this through a 
dangerously wry sensibility, add Neil Young's "Time Fades Away" on the sound 
track, with Scorsese as the guiding hand behind it all, and you have a fair 
idea of the ineffably tacky pleasures of "American Boy. 
</P>
<P>
In answer to the obvious question that arises, Prince is reportedly alive and 
well today in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
A third relatively unavailable film on the bill is Scorsese's 1967 "The Big 
Shave," a black and bloody six-minute comedy about a morning shave that is 
enough to make one reach for a stypic pencil -- fast.

'BROADWAY' AND MADONNA A FEAST TO LOOK AT ON PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madonna, playing a showgirl flapper and coiffed like a Louise Brooks 
Kewpie-doll, briefly enlivens the Damon Runyon-inspired "Bloodhounds of 
Broadway" on "American Playhouse" at 9 tonight (Channels 28 and 15). 
</P>
<P>
There's little else to trumpet in this movie, which Columbia released 
theatrically in only five markets last November and pulled after two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But the production, which mangles four short stories by Runyon, is a feast to 
look at in its depiction of Gotham mad hatters in a Roaring '20s New Year's Eve 
blowout. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a chance to visit an unexpectedly endearing Madonna when she was a 
brunette in a role that, at least short of the upcoming "Dick Tracy," is 
arguably her most vivacious look on film. 
</P>
<P>
The gaggle of guys and dolls include Matt Dillon's pony player, Jennifer Grey's 
Lovey Lou songbird, Rutger Hauer's expiring gangster, Julie Hagerty's society 
maven, Esai Morales' bootlegger, Josef Sommer's Walter Winchell-like columnist, 
Madeline Potter's angelic flower girl and Randy Quaid as Madonna's hick of a 
goofy heartthrob. 
</P>
<P>
Plots topple like crashing trays. The film is so scatter-gunned that you can 
get up and come back 10 or 15 minutes later and not miss a thing. But don't 
miss that Art Deco blue-tiled bathroom or those costumes and the faces of the 
supporting players. The casting by the team of Richard Pagano and Sharon Bialy 
is rich. 
</P>
<P>
The movie was the feature debut of the late Howard Brookner, who produced, 
directed and co-wrote (with Colman deKay). Brookner died a year ago of AIDS.

CREWS PRACTICE ROUTINES FOR BRUSH FIRE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire races up a canyon on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, gobbling up bone-dry 
brush on its way to a row of expensive houses perched on higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
But a helicopter appears, dropping off a work crew to clear a fire line ahead 
of the flames, then flies off to fill its tanks with water to use to help knock 
down the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
That, on paper at least, is the way helicopter firefighting works. To help 
ensure that does occur when fires strike, firefighters and a helicopter crew 
from the Los Angeles County Fire Department converged on Rancho Palos Verdes 
late last week for practice. 
</P>
<P>
"The helicopter is probably the most effective tool for keeping brush-fires 
from getting out of control," Battalion Chief Gordon Pearson said during the 
exercise, held on a coastal bluff near Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall. "They can 
make a 300-gallon water drop while we're still pulling hoses to the fire. That 
can make the difference between saving houses and not saving them." 
</P>
<P>
The drill was part of a routine program aimed at training the county's local 
fire units to cooperate with the department's helicopter crews. But fire 
officials say they have placed more emphasis on the program in recent years as 
drought conditions in the area have worsened. 
</P>
<P>
The peninsula's tinder-dry canyons are now brush-fires waiting to happen, the 
officials say. With the fire season under way as of May 15, they are urging 
peninsula residents to take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: clear away brush and dry grasses within 100 to 200 feet of homes, 
prune dead branches from trees and shrubs, and clean debris from roofs. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a fire here in many years, and with all this growth, deadwood 
and drought, the fire potential is just tremendous," said Tim O'Neill, a county 
fire captain at last Thursday's drill. 
</P>
<P>
The last big brush-fire to hit the Palos Verdes Peninsula occurred in 1973, 
when a blaze fanned by sea breezes charred 900 acres and destroyed 11 houses, 
causing an estimated $2 million in property damage. 
</P>
<P>
Though no blaze of that dimension has occurred since, there have been scares. 
The most recent came on April 29, when a brush-fire started in a canyon between 
two fairways in the Palos Verdes Golf Course in Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters soon doused the blaze, but not before it had deposited burning 
embers on the roof of a house on Paseo del Campo, about 600 feet away. 
Authorities say they do not know what caused the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Rene Rigaud said the fire was particularly worrisome in light 
of a recent forestry report predicting that brush and deadwood on the peninsula 
could fuel flames capable of breaching a 79-foot gap. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rigaud grimly of the April 29 blaze: "It was a harbinger of what's to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
It is to prevent such predictions from coming true that the Fire Department is 
staging exercises like the one held last week. Before the program concludes 
this Thursday, personnel at seven of the county's South Bay fire stations will 
receive the training. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's session was the first in this year's program on the peninsula and 
included instruction on points ranging from ground-to-air communications to the 
preparation of safe helicopter landing sites.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHURCH TO GIVE $500,000 TO NEHEMIAH WEST 
PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Frederick H. Borsch, bishop of the Los Angeles diocese of the 
Episcopal Church, on Tuesday announced a pledge of more than $500,000 in loans 
by the church to help construct Nehemiah West, a townhouse-style development of 
316 low-priced homes in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Borsch said the five-year, no-interest loan is one of several he expects to be 
made by Los Angeles-area churches to the project's nonprofit developers. 
</P>
<P>
The developers hope that Nehemiah West will help turn around one of the city's 
most rundown neighborhoods. The church also will give the project developers 
$2,000 a month in support funds. 
</P>
<P>
"One would like to believe the church has always been involved," in affordable 
housing, Borsch said. "What is needed oftentimes is seed money and the people 
to get these projects off the ground."

GALLEGLY TAKES TO THE AIR TO REBUT TV ADS; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGNS: NEITHER THE CONGRESSMAN NOR HIS OPPONENT, SANG KORMAN, ADVERTISED ON 
TELEVISION WHEN THEY FACED EACH OTHER IN 1988. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual switch in campaign tactics, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) 
is planning an 11th-hour barrage of cable television commercials intended to 
rebut TV ads he says are vicious run by his primary-election opponent, Sang R. 
Korman. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly declined Tuesday to disclose most details of the commercials, 
including how much they will cost. But station officials said he has paid at 
least $14,800 for time on four cable systems in the 21st Congressional 
District, which spreads from northern and western portions of the San Fernando 
Valley into southern and central Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Korman, a wealthy Korean-American developer, recently began airing a $120,000 
series of three commercials -- on cable and local network TV channels -- that 
attack Gallegly's voting record. Korman plans two more spots before the June 5 
election, including one that criticizes Gallegly for his role in an internal 
FBI investigation of four Los Angeles-based agents, a campaign spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Television ads are a new tactic for both candidates, neither of whom used them 
when they faced each other in the 1988 primary. Korman captured less than 14% 
of the vote in that race, despite spending $350,000, including $245,000 of his 
own money. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-area congressional candidates typically frown on commercials, 
especially on network TV channels, because of their high cost and scattershot 
impact. They normally prefer cheaper methods, such as direct-mail brochures, 
that can be targeted at individual voters. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said his commercials will be financed primarily from donations brought 
in by an urgent fund-raising letter his campaign mailed to supporters last 
week. He has purchased enough air time between Tuesday and the primary for more 
than 800 spots. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone is doing a vicious attack on you, the idea is to try to mitigate 
those untruths with some truths," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Korman angrily responded that his spots "totally disclose the truth of his 
voting record." 
</P>
<P>
In one Korman ad, Gallegly is criticized for voting to "give savings and loan 
associations free hand in their junk bond schemes" -- a reference to Gallegly's 
1989 vote against legislation that would have prohibited federally insured 
S&amp;Ls from investing in bonds rated below investment grade. 
</P>
<P>
A Gallegly spokesman said the congressman voted against the bill because he 
believed it "unfairly penalized solvent S&amp;Ls for making investments." 
</P>
<P>
Korman said he plans to begin airing another commercial attacking Gallegly for 
his role in an internal FBI investigation of four Los Angeles-based agents in 
1987 and 1988. Korman has accused Gallegly of filing complaints against the 
agents that sparked the probe and lying to cover up his instigation of it. 
Gallegly denies filing any complaints. 
</P>
<P>
GOP political consultant Paul Clarke said that although Korman's attacks have 
hurt Gallegly politically, the damage isn't severe enough for Korman to win. 
Clarke said Gallegly's commercials were a prudent response to Korman's attacks 
and may actually help him raise more money than he would have been able to had 
the race been less heated. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sound cynical and say it's manna from heaven, but from a 
fund-raising perspective, it gives Elton a reason to raise funds," Clarke said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MISSION HILLS MAN, 24, ARRESTED IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asuspected gang member was arrested on charges he shot and critically wounded a 
UCLA premed student outside a Pacoima convenience store where he and friends 
had stopped for gas and snacks, Los Angeles police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Muro, 24, of Mission Hills was arrested at 10 p.m. Monday after San 
Fernando police who had stopped him for a traffic violation realized that he 
was wanted by Los Angeles police for the shooting of 18-year-old Ricardo 
Olivares. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares was shot at 12:45 a.m. Saturday, after he stopped with several friends 
at a store at Laurel Canyon and Brand boulevards. Police said Olivares walked 
to a nearby pay phone to make a call when he was confronted by two suspected 
gang members and shot in the head during a struggle. Police said the victim and 
his friends are not gang members and had done nothing to provoke the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just routine gang motivation" for the shooting, Los Angeles Police 
Detective Al Ferrand said. "The victim and his friends were just normal kids 
and weren't doing anything when they were confronted." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares remained in critical condition Tuesday at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrand said Muro was identified as a suspect through anonymous calls to police 
and other undisclosed evidence. He was being held without bail on suspicion of 
attempted murder at the Foothill Station Jail. A second suspect is being sought 
by police.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO SLAYING, ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Arleta man who went on a rampage that left one man dead last October pleaded 
guilty Tuesday to voluntary manslaughter and robbery charges. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Alan Graham, 35, is expected to be sentenced to 17 years in prison 
under an agreement between his lawyer and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is scheduled for June 20 in San Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Graham faced up to 37 years in prison had he been convicted of the murder 
charge originally filed against him, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jacquelyn P. 
Lacey. Prosecutors agreed to drop the charge as well as an additional count of 
robbery if Graham agreed to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter Tuesday, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Graham shot Freddie Fausto, 22, to death in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven store 
in Panorama City, where the two had arranged to meet to make a drug deal, Lacey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Graham shot Fausto while attempting to steal the man's drugs. 
But Graham told police that Fausto pulled the gun, which discharged and hit 
Fausto while the two struggled over it, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
Graham drove to an acquaintance's house in Sun Valley, where he fired the gun 
into the ground and pointed it at the acquaintance during an argument, Lacey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Graham sped off in his truck and went to a Sun Valley market, where he robbed 
the cashier of $500 and took jewelry from the store's bookkeeper, Lacey said. 
He was arrested the next day after police saw him leave a Sun Valley bar, 
authorities said.

FERRARO SEEKS MORE MUSCLE FOR COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT; 
</P>
<P>
NORTH HOLLYWOOD: THE COUNCILMAN WANTS THE AGENCY INVOLVED TO HAVE A BIGGER 
SHARE OF PROPERTY TAXES AND AN EXTENSION ON EMINENT DOMAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman John Ferraro on Tuesday urged the council to 
increase the taxing powers of the Community Redevelopment Agency in North 
Hollywood and extend the agency's authority to seize land. 
</P>
<P>
With the support of the agency's officials, Ferraro introduced a motion that 
was referred to the community development committee. 
</P>
<P>
He said the CRA needs more power because it has not finished its work in North 
Hollywood. "There remains blight and the need for new housing, continued 
economic development and additional public improvements," said Ferraro, who 
represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
Since it began operating in North Hollywood in 1979, the CRA has sponsored such 
developments as the 10-story Academy and the 200-unit Magnolia Towers senior 
citizens projects. 
</P>
<P>
But the CRA faces a sharp slowdown and eventual collapse of its North Hollywood 
activities if its powers are not extended, said Robert Tague, CRA chief of 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent this, the agency and Ferraro want to raise the existing $89-million 
cap on the CRA's share of property taxes paid on improved properties within the 
750-acre North Hollywood project. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we have no money for new programs with the exception of some 
housing trust money, and that's only a small amount of $750,000," Tague said. 
"All the rest of the money is designated to complete existing projects or to 
retire debt." 
</P>
<P>
The agency also wants to extend its eminent domain powers, which are scheduled 
to expire in North Hollywood next February. The CRA's ability to seize property 
-- although it must pay market value -- is one of its most powerful and 
controversial tools. 
</P>
<P>
Tague said that the CRA won't know by how much the tax cap should be raised, or 
how long the power to condemn should be extended, until these questions have 
been studied by experts. 
</P>
<P>
Norton Halper, a critic of CRA projects throughout the city, said in an 
interview that he hopes to block extension of the project by getting activists 
like himself elected to the North Hollywood citizens advisory group. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory group -- called the Project Area Committee -- can create obstacles 
to the Ferraro-CRA extension plan. If the group refuses to approve it, the 
proposal will require a two-thirds vote of the council, not a simple majority 
as it would now.

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Greenwood of Encino led all players with an even-par 144 for 36 holes 
in a U. S. Open qualifying tournament held Monday and Tuesday at Industry 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood fired rounds of 74 and 70 and was one of 15 players in the 182-man 
field to advance to the sectional tournament next month. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Case of Thousand Oaks, who shot 75-74 -- 149, also advanced. Craig 
Steinberg, an amateur from Van Nuys, advanced at 72-78 -- 150. The sectional 
qualifying tournament is June 5 at San Francisco Golf Course. The U. S. Open is 
June 14-17 at Medinah Country Club in Medinah, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Heavyweight John Bray of Van Nuys was among 48 boxers named by the U. S. 
Amateur Boxing Federation to compete for one of 24 berths on the U. S. boxing 
team for the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
Bray will fight either June 8 or June 9 in the Goodwill Games Boxing Challenge 
at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. A win would qualify Bray for the Goodwill 
Games; a loss would send him to the U. S. Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Mara Phillips, a shortstop at Chatsworth High, has signed a letter of intent to 
play softball at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who has led the Chancellors to the City Section 4-A Division 
semifinals, is batting .446. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section softball playoff game between Simi Valley and Mater Dei 
has been rescheduled for today at 3 p.m. at Rancho Simi Community Park. The 
quarterfinal-round game originally was scheduled for Thursday but was moved at 
the request of Mater Dei because of a conflict with the school prom.

SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PLAYOFF ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
RALLIES RESCUE THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks High baseball team had made so many errors and played so 
badly at home this season that after defeating Culver City on the road in the 
first round of the Southern Section 5-A Division playoffs last week, members of 
the team actually requested another road game. 
</P>
<P>
No deal. Tuesday's second-round game against Rolling Hills would be played at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
But to give the illusion of a road contest, the Thousand Oaks coaching staff 
ordered the team to pack its gear on a bus, which was driven to the baseball 
field on the other side of the campus and unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks unloaded again in the bottom of the seventh, rallying from a 
nine-run deficit to defeat Rolling Hills, 12-11, in eight innings. Thousand 
Oaks will play West Covina, a 9-8 winner over Ocean View, in the quarterfinals 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 10-1, in the bottom of the seventh, Thousand Oaks (11-8) scored nine 
times to send the game into extra innings. After the Lancers received five 
consecutive walks to open the inning, Brent Christenson bashed a grand slam to 
make it 10-6. It was Christenson's fourth homer of the season and second slam. 
</P>
<P>
After a pitching change, Lance Martin walked. One out later, Jason Goldstein 
walked. David Skeels then lined a two-run double down the line in left to bring 
the Lancers to within 10-8. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Barkman (8-4), who relieved in the eighth, walked and moved up a base on 
a sacrifice bunt to put runners at second and third. Ryan Kritscher singled to 
drive in Skeels and Billy Hall tied the score with another single. After 
another pitching change, Christenson struck out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills took an 11-10 lead off Barkman, but the Lancers won it with two 
in the bottom of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Martin led off with a single on an 0-2 pitch and stole second. One out later, 
Goldstein singled, Martin taking third. Skeels was hit in the head by a pitch 
to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Barkman drove in the winning run with a single to left as Goldstein scored from 
second with a headfirst dive over the catcher at home. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second playoff win in a row for Thousand Oaks, which before this 
season had not won a postseason game since Chuck Crim (Milwaukee Brewers) was 
playing in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks was 0-6 in first-round games in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In other second-round games: 
</P>
<P>
4-A DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo 4, Hart 3 -- San Luis Obispo scored twice in the bottom of the 
seventh to knock off top-seeded Hart. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the seventh and Josh Simmons on second base, a passed ball 
allowed Simmons to advance to third base. Hart then elected to intentionally 
walk Grant Munger, who led San Luis Obispo (21-4) this season with a .386 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Halcovich (5-2), who relieved starter Andrew Lorraine in the sixth, then 
uncorked a wild pitch to score Simmons and tie the game. With Munger on second, 
winning pitcher Tim Kubinski (11-0) singled to left field, scoring Munger. 
</P>
<P>
Kubinski struck out eight and walked seven. He allowed just seven hits in 
snapping Hart's 20-game win streak. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, The Times' second-ranked area team, finished 23-2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora 11, Notre Dame 4 -- Glendora banged around three Notre Dame pitchers 
en route to 11 first-inning runs at Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Vellozzi started and was relieved in the first by Cary Wichmann and 
freshman Chris Leveque. Notre Dame pitchers walked seven and hit three in the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
J. J. O'Laughlin, an Illinois-bound quarterback who plays the outfield, belted 
one of Glendora's two homers. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Colella and Lou Tapia homered for Notre Dame (18-11-1), which had a 
six-game win streak snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Canyon 16, Buena 5 -- Sophomore pitcher Jeff Brunswig went three for 
four with three runs batted in to pace Canyon at home. 
</P>
<P>
Brunswig helped break the game open with a run-scoring single in Canyon's 
five-run third. Junior Greg Tippin led off the inning with a home run to 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (14-12-1) had 16 hits and benefited from 10 walks by four Buena 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat 5, Glendale 3 -- Eric White hit a two-run home run and a two-run 
triple to push host Bishop Amat (18-9) into the quarterfinals against Westlake, 
which defeated Torrance, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
White finished three for three with four runs batted in to support the 
complete-game pitching of J.D. Romero, who allowed seven hits and struck out 
four. 
</P>
<P>
White even earned an intentional pass from Glendale in the sixth inning with 
runners at first and second. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't gonna pitch to that sucker again," Glendale Coach Chris Axelgard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For Glendale (17-7-2), catcher Jon Strauss went two for two with a two-run 
single in the fourth inning to close a 5-1 deficit to 5-3. Earlier, Glendale 
had scored on an RBI single by Lance Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Overfelt (6-2) took the loss for Glendale, surrendering 11 hits. 
</P>
<P>
2-A DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo 9, Santa Clara 5 -- The top-seeded team in the division scored six 
runs in the bottom of the sixth to erase a 5-3 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The host Eagles pounded out 10 hits, including three home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Tim Gutierrez took the loss for Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
SMALL SCHOOLS DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
Queen of Angels 4, Pilgrim 2 -- Steve Steger struck out eight in three innings 
of no-hit relief and visiting Queen of Angels (14-4) came back from a 2-0 
deficit to advance to a Friday quarterfinal game against Rosamond. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Danny Herold (9-2) struck out five in four innings and earned the win. 
Rolando Natareno, Chris Wilson and Merced Marin each had two hits and an RBI 
for Queen of Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Leffingwell Christian 7, Highland Hall 5 -- All but one of Leffingwell 
Christian's runs was unearned, and visiting Highland Hall fell behind, 5-1, 
after one inning. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Highland Hall closed the gap to 5-3 after three and to 7-5 after 
six but left the tying run on second in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Hall starter Robert Ramirez (12-3) struck out nine and walked one in a 
complete-game loss. Jakob Jensen was two for four with two RBI for Highland 
Hall (24-3). 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Leffingwell Christian is 13-7.

REGULATORS SAY BUSH'S SON HID TIES TO S&amp;L BORROWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's son, Neil, serving as a director of a Colorado savings and 
loan association that later failed, voted to approve $106 million in loans to 
one of his business partners, federal regulators told the House Banking 
Committee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also actively sought approval of a $900,000 line of credit for another 
partner in his oil exploration business. In both cases, Bush violated conflict 
of interest regulations, officials of the Office of Thrift Supervision said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush staunchly denied any wrongdoing after federal regulators filed an 
administrative complaint in January, accusing him of violating conflict of 
interest regulations. He refused to accept a settlement with the government, 
saying "a settlement agreement would leave an implication that I misbehaved as 
a director of Silverado (Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn.). I have done 
nothing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's revelations of the large sums of money involved will focus a new 
political spotlight on the President's 34-year-old son. He was not available 
for comment Tuesday but is scheduled to testify before the committee today. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of hundreds of S&amp;Ls has become the biggest financial disaster 
in recent history. Each political party would like to persuade the public to 
blame the other for costing the taxpayers $400 billion or more over the next 30 
years to close S&amp;Ls and pay off depositors. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's business partners, Bill Walters and Kenneth M. Good, were major 
borrowers at Silverado Saving &amp; Loan, where Bush was a director from 1985 
to 1988. All of Walters' $106 million in loans eventually went into default. 
The Denver-based Silverado collapsed into insolvency and was seized by the 
federal government in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Paying off Silverado depositors will cost taxpayers an estimated $1 billion, 
since accounts of up to $100,000 are federally insured. 
</P>
<P>
Under intense questioning from committee Democrats on Tuesday, federal 
regulators provided the first detailed look at Neil Bush's activities in 
connection with loans to Walters and Good, Denver business executives who 
furnished the capital for Bush's oil exploration company, JNB. 
</P>
<P>
As a Silverado board member, Bush approved $106 million in loans to Walters 
during 1986, either voting direct approval or ratifying the decision to make 
loans by the S&amp;L investment committee, according to Stephen P. Hershkowitz, 
deputy director of enforcement for the Office of Thrift Supervision. Bush 
should have filed a statement with the S&amp;L detailing his business ties with 
Walters, according to the regulator. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had information that was "relevant and did not disclose it," Hershkowitz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The $900,000 line of credit for Good was intended to help one of Good's 
companies develop business in Argentina. Although the board approved the credit 
line, the money was never used. 
</P>
<P>
It was a conflict of interest for Bush to promote the Good transaction while 
serving as a director, according to the regulators. They said he violated the 
"duty of loyalty" that requires directors to put first the interests of the 
financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations against Bush still face review by an administrative law judge, 
which could result in a cease-and-desist order barring him from similar 
conflicts if he ever works for a federally regulated financial institution in 
the future. The charges also could be referred to the Justice Department for 
possible further action, either civil or criminal. 
</P>
<P>
Bush resigned his seat on the board in August, 1988, after his father, then 
vice president, was nominated as the Republican candidate for President. 
</P>
<P>
Silverado was taken over later that year because "its management developed an 
excessive concentration of commercial real estate loans and investments," David 
L. Paul, Colorado commissioner of financial services, told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The officers and directors of Silverado "used the institution for their own 
greedy purposes," said Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), a committee member. 
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for the tragic consequences to the taxpayers, Silverado would 
make a wonderful prime-time television soap opera," he said. "It would rank 
right up there with 'Dallas' and 'Falcon Crest.' " 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators have made 11 referrals for prosecution in connection with 
Silverado, including five recommendations for criminal prosecutions, details of 
which have not been disclosed. Referrals for prosecution in the case began in 
1986 and have continued until this year, regulators told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members bristled angrily when Hershkowitz said he had been forbidden 
to tell them the specific dates when the recommendations for criminal 
prosecutions had been sent to the Justice Department. An OTS official said that 
following a call from the Justice Department Tuesday morning, T. Timothy Ryan 
Jr., the head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, instructed his staff to 
refuse to provide information about the timing of criminal referrals. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski (D-Pa.) charged the Justice Department didn't want the 
committee or "the American people to know how slow" the department has been in 
going after S&amp;L wrongdoers. 
</P>
<P>
The committee chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Ohio), noted that the 
committee would seek to subpoena former regulators who refused to testify about 
Silverado. But he emphasized that Neil Bush has announced his "complete 
cooperation with the committee. He has been forthright." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), a committee member, defended Bush as an innocent 
victim of scheming executives connected with Silverado. "I know Neil Bush is a 
thoughtful young man" who may have been "lured into being an outside director," 
said Leach. 
</P>
<P>
It is "inconceivable Neil Bush wittingly did anything wrong," Leach said. "He 
is a fine young man."

SANTA BARBARA'S POOR FEEL STING OF ONGOING DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILES CORWIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luis Lopez pulled a handful of crumpled business cards from his pocket, all 
from landscape firms that had turned him down for gardening jobs this week. 
</P>
<P>
The landscapers, Lopez said, all told him the same thing: "Come back when it 
rains." 
</P>
<P>
When Santa Barbara declared a drought emergency in late February, banning lawn 
watering and ordering other conservation methods, the city's landscape industry 
was devastated. Lopez lost his job and apartment, and now he and his family 
live in a homeless shelter in downtown Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people in Santa Barbara think the drought is a hardship because their 
lawns are dying," said Rogelio Trujillo, a board member of the Legal Defense 
Center. "But to low-income people in Santa Barbara, the drought is an economic 
crisis. People are fighting for survival." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the loss of jobs among gardeners, farmhands and orchard workers, 
the water shortage has caused tremendous housing problems for the poor and new 
financial woes for other residents. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the city began mailing water bills that reflect sharply higher 
rates, and some landlords have responded by rewriting rental contracts and 
making tenants -- many of whom already are struggling -- responsible for water 
bills. Others simply have raised rents or evicted tenants who use too much 
water. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, the billing office has been deluged with calls from angry 
residents from all economic strata. 
</P>
<P>
One man with a fast leak in his toilet had a water bill of $2,725, said Lew 
Lewis, billing manager for the city. Several apartment complexes and laundries 
have had bills of more than $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen so many $400 and $500 water bills I'm not shocked anymore," said 
Damian Martinez, who works in the billing office. "People call the office and 
can't believe it. They think it's some kind of mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Said Catholic Charities worker Josie Mendoza: "People who've had their rents 
raised by $100 and $200 a month or who need help paying their water bills have 
been coming in all week." 
</P>
<P>
"These are people who are already paying more than half of their income on 
rent. . . . If it goes much higher, they won't have any money left for food." 
</P>
<P>
Water has become such a valuable commodity in Santa Barbara that some residents 
are hooking up hoses to neighbors' faucets and stealing water. After Lewis 
received a number of calls recently from residents complaining about water 
theft, he decided to protect his own water supply. He plans to put locks on all 
his outdoor faucets. 
</P>
<P>
While some residents still haven't cut their water use to cope with the 
drought, most have conserved, Lewis said. During the last three months, water 
use in the city has decreased by about 40%. 
</P>
<P>
But poor families have a harder time keeping their water bills low because many 
have to share apartments with two and three other families in order to afford 
the rent, said Mendoza of Catholic Charities. And now, because water costs are 
so high, some landlords are evicting families to limit the number of people per 
apartment. As a result, many families are now homeless for the first time, 
Mendoza said. The Latino community, which has relied on the landscape industry 
and local ranches for jobs, has been particularly hard hit. 
</P>
<P>
Transition House, a local homeless shelter that used to house many white, 
single people, is now filled entirely with Latino families. So many people need 
help now that for the first time since its inception six years ago, the shelter 
had to turn families away. 
</P>
<P>
People can't afford to leave the shelter now, said Pat Henningsen, an 
administrator at Transition House. In the past, the shelter would match two 
families who could pool their incomes and then rent an apartment. But since 
most landlords now won't rent to more than one family per unit, many are 
marooned at area shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg," Henningsen said. "This 
summer, when people are late paying their water bills, there's going to be 
major problems. A $100 water bill is a tremendous amount of money for someone 
making $7 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Food banks and soup lines have been inundated by the newly unemployed or 
homeless, said Christina Cruz, a minister for Christ Lutheran Church. The 
number of people who line up for the church's food bank on Saturday mornings -- 
about 700 -- has tripled in the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has been exacerbated by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service crackdown on employers who hired undocumented workers. Many families 
are now leaving the area in order to survive, Cruz said. Some have moved to 
Northern California to pick fruit; others have moved back to Mexico. Some 
families have split up, with the men staying, looking for temporary housing, 
and the women and children returning to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I recently talked to a guy who has to move because his landlord raised the 
rent from $625 to $725 because of the water bills," said Don Combs of the Santa 
Barbara Tenants Union. "The tenant just can't afford it. Other people are 
complaining that their landlords are shutting down all laundry facilities in 
the apartments because they don't want to pay for the water. This may not sound 
like a big deal, but if you're elderly or disabled and don't have a car, it can 
be a real hardship." 
</P>
<P>
Bartlein &amp; Co. Inc., the largest property management firm in Santa Barbara, 
recently sent notices to all tenants informing them they are now "responsible 
for 100% of water usage," said Robert Bartlein, the company's owner. But, 
Bartlein said, if all tenants in a building conserve and keep their overall 
water use below a specified level his company will then pay all water costs. 
</P>
<P>
Because tenants do not want to be stuck with the water bill, Bartlein said, 
some have turned in neighbors who have jammed numerous people into apartments. 
In the past few weeks the company has served about 15 tenants -- who have 
unauthorized people living in their apartments -- with eviction notices. 
</P>
<P>
If residents use moderate amounts of water, their bills will not be exorbitant, 
said Lewis of the city's billing department. But the new price structure is 
designed to charge much higher rates once residents exceed a basic water 
allotment. For example, Lewis said, the average single family dwelling in the 
city uses about 6,000 gallons of water a month. Last month that would cost 
residents about $8; under the new rates the cost would be $17. But if residents 
used double that amount of water, this month's bill would be $135, compared to 
$22 under the old rate structure. 
</P>
<P>
City officials realize the higher water bills will be a hardship for the poor, 
and they have proposed creating a long-term payment plan, so residents will not 
be faced with water shut-offs at the end of the month, Lewis said. Also, the 
city has advised landlords not to raise rents but instead divide excessive 
water costs in apartment buildings among tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people couldn't pay their water bills before this drought, so with 
these new rates I know we're going to be having a lot of problems," Lewis said. 
"I really feel for these people. But all we can really do to help is work out a 
payment schedule, so they won't have to come up with the whole bill at once." 
</P>
<P>
More than 75 people a day have been calling the city's water billing office, 
complaining about the high water rates, said Frances Arellano, a billing clerk. 
Some residents call because they can't afford to pay their bills; others simply 
are offended that water, which they once took for granted, should be so 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Zahra Kesharvaz marched into City Hall recently, clutching her $1,021.08 water 
bill. "This is outrageous. . . . This isn't a water bill, this is house 
payment," she said, waving the bill angrily. 
</P>
<P>
Kesharvaz said she has cut her water use during the last few months and even 
takes all her showers at a health club. But her family has a two-acre estate 
with 43 fruit trees and they recently spent $200,000 in landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent all that money on the grounds. . . . There's no way I'm going to let 
it all die," she said. "That much landscaping requires a lot of water." 
</P>
<P>
Kesharvaz appealed the water bill to officials at City Hall, who told her that 
because there are eight people living at her house, she is eligible for a 
"large household exemption." She could obtain a larger water allotment if she 
installed low-flow toilets and shower heads that use less water. 
</P>
<P>
But Kesharvaz told them she was not interested. She has a designer house, she 
said, and the low-flow toilets are not available in colors that match the decor 
of her bathroom.

REPORT TO BUSH URGES DRILLING DECISION DELAY 
</P>

<P>
President Bush's top-level task force has recommended that he indefinitely 
delay decisions on whether to allow oil drilling off the Southern and Northern 
California coasts until more scientific studies are completed, according to a 
copy of the task force report made available to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that Bush either defer or cancel plans to permit drilling 
off the shores of California and Florida, but stopped short of recommending 
that it be banned forever, as some environmentalists and California public 
officials have advocated. 
</P>
<P>
It also concludes that drilling off California and Florida might provide as 
much as 2.1 million barrels of oil a day and replace as much as $40 billion in 
imported oil over a 30-year period. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who met with opponents of drilling from the California 
congressional delegation last week, has promised to announce his long-awaited 
and politically sensitive decision shortly. 
</P>
<P>
The report, presented to Bush last January but never made public by the White 
House, said existing information on potential sales of oil-gas leases off 
California and Florida was too inadequate to justify a federal government 
go-ahead for exploration and development. 
</P>
<P>
In a finding sure to be welcomed by opponents of drilling, the report said: 
"The Task Force concludes that although many of the environmental effects of 
oil and gas activities, taken individually, are acceptable, collectively they 
could result in unacceptable changes to the local environment in or near the 
(proposed drilling sites) unless new measures are taken to control or mitigate 
such effects." 
</P>
<P>
Discussing the conflict between protecting the environment and promoting energy 
development, the report said: "Based on its review of available information, 
the Task Force concludes that additional time and effort are needed before 
environmental concerns can be resolved in a manner that provides an acceptable 
balance between these two goals." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), who made a copy of the report available to 
The Times, said it was great news for opponents of offshore drilling since it 
amounted to an "environmental indictment" of this form of oil and gas 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the President will read this report and decide to grant permanent 
protection to the magnificent coastal areas that are threatened with drilling," 
she said. "If he proceeds with any lease sales off California after this 
report, he will be completely missing its point." 
</P>
<P>
The task force was chaired by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and included 
Energy Secretary James Watkins as well as William Reilly, administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency; John Knauss, head of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, and Richard Darman, director of the Office of 
Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
They reported to the President on potential Lease Sale 91, ranging from north 
of Sonoma County to the Oregon border; Lease Sale 95, from San Luis Obispo to 
the Mexican border, and Lease Sale 116, off the southwest coast of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Boxer said the recommendations also should apply to Lease Sale 119 -- off the 
Central California coast from San Luis Obispo to the north end of Sonoma County 
-- but the task force report did not cover that area. 
</P>
<P>
In the report, task force members said the Minerals Management Service of the 
Department of Interior had spent more than $41 million on environmental studies 
for these three areas during the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the Task Force finds that some additional studies . . . are 
needed before the Secretary of Interior makes leasing decisions in the three 
areas," the report concluded. It said a special inquiry conducted by the 
National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council found shortcomings in 
the amount of oceanographic, socioeconomic and ecological information available 
regarding the California and Florida coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the report noted, more information about possible effects of 
offshore drilling will help to resolve public concerns about the practice. 
</P>
<P>
"In other cases, additional environmental protection measures need to be 
developed, perhaps even tested, before leasing decisions proceed," the report 
said. "New working relationships and institutional arrangements may be needed 
so that affected local communities have more influence on leasing, exploration 
and development decisions." 
</P>
<P>
In spelling out other measures that could be taken, the task force recommended 
a requirement that offshore oil be transported in pipelines instead of tankers 
"where feasible and environmentally preferable." 
</P>
<P>
It also said contingency planning, risk assessment and response capability for 
oil spills should be improved. And it urged stronger protection of sensitive 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Because some of these measures could be instituted only at considerable cost 
to lessees (oil and gas producers), taken together they could substantially 
reduce the benefits of developing oil and gas and could discourage the industry 
from bidding for the right to Outer Continental Shelf resources," the report 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The task force also recommended that air emissions from drilling facilities off 
the California coast be subject to more stringent controls -- roughly 
equivalent to standards applicable to onshore installations. 
</P>
<P>
The report presented Bush with several options for each of the two California 
coastal areas. For Southern California, it said the government could proceed 
with preparations for a lease sale, but defer a final decision until additional 
scientific studies are available. 
</P>
<P>
Another option would be to cancel the proposed sale and defer future leasing 
decisions until the studies are finished, while establishing more stringent air 
quality controls and toughen oil spill contingency plans for offshore 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Or, the task force said, Bush could put off leasing decisions until a new 
five-year leasing program begins in 1992 and offer tracts only in the Santa 
Maria Basin and San Diego Outer Basin in the next sale off Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another option would exclude the Southern California area from 
consideration in the new 1992-97 leasing period after cancellation of sale 95, 
putting off drilling until late 1997 at least. 
</P>
<P>
For Northern California, similar options were proposed to defer or cancel the 
sale of leases. Under one plan, tracts in the Eel River Basin would be offered 
in 1992-97. Another option would exclude the Northern California area from the 
next five-year leasing period.

HARVESTING LIMITS ON CHEMICALS;

<P>
FARMERS ARE LIMITING THEIR USE OF PESTICIDES AND FERTILIZERS TO PROTECT THE 
ENVIRONMENT -- AND THEIR HEALTH.

BRISTOW, Iowa.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's planting time again in the grain belt, but this season, many farmers like 
Ron Salge are sowing a revolution of sorts into the soil along with the seed 
corn and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
Salge has reduced his use of commercial fertilizer by about 25%. He's also 
gotten stingy with weed-killers, laying them out in narrow strips rather than 
in broad mists that often blew up his nose and made him nauseous with what 
folks in Butler County sarcastically call "springtime flu." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby in Shell Rock, Jeff Reints has decided not to pre-treat any of his corn 
fields with man-made fertilizer this year. Up the road in Greene, Mike Ruby 
plans to limit herbicide use to 20 of the 360 acres he's planting. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in this county 18 years and I'm amazed at how much more conservation 
concerns there are today," said Dale Thoreson, the state's agricultural 
extension agent for Butler County. "These people have to make a living off the 
land and they have to drink the water that's under it. They don't want to screw 
it up any more." 
</P>
<P>
In growing numbers, farmers are struggling to wean themselves of a slavish 
reliance on the very miracle chemicals and synthetic nutrients that made 
post-war American agriculture the envy of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Farmers are increasingly aware of the health risk," said Marty Strange, 
director of the Center for Rural Affairs, a Nebraska think tank. ". . . there 
are a lot of farmers out there that know they're on the front line in terms of 
exposure, and the more we learn about these things the less we like them." 
</P>
<P>
Urged on by some of the same experts and officials who for decades championed 
the use of chemicals as a panacea, many growers are rediscovering the promise 
of largely abandoned practices, such as crop rotation and manure spreading, 
that once were as basic to farm life as rain and sunlight. At the same time, 
sophisticated new soil testing and pest control techniques have helped to 
refine low-chemical farming. 
</P>
<P>
It is a movement that should not be confused with organic farming, although 
advocates of both practices share concerns. Few growers in these parts are 
likely to go cold turkey, but many of them are beginning to tinker with ways of 
reducing their heavy dependence on chemicals without seriously jeopardizing 
yields. 
</P>
<P>
An example: Laying a precautionary "plow-down" of nitrogen fertilizer before 
planting has been a springtime ritual for Ruby and most other farmers. This 
year, Ruby skipped the plow-down on all but a handful of acres. Instead, he 
will periodically test his soil. When tests show that a particular field needs 
a shot of nutrient, it will be fed on an "as-needed" basis. That should slice 
about $2,500 off Ruby's usual fertilizer bill, he estimates. 
</P>
<P>
To outsiders, such a notion might seem prudent and obvious, but for years it 
has been a tough sell. "A lot of guys figured that if 100 pounds of fertilizer 
was good, then 200 pounds was better," said Salge. "That's why we've got the 
ground water problems we have." 
</P>
<P>
Here in Iowa, the concept of "sustainable" or "low-input" agriculture is 
strongly backed by both the state agriculture department and Iowa State 
University, which has one of the nation's most respected agriculture schools. 
Both have poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into experiments and 
demonstration projects. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also has a program. 
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture has been sold a bill of goods by science and those who produce and 
sell these products," state Agriculture Secretary Dale Cochran said. "You don't 
see resistance to this any more. You don't see people saying you're crazy. Over 
a period of four or five years, I think we're going to see most all Iowa 
farmers practicing some form of sustainable agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, not too many years ago, the farm establishment by and large considered 
followers of such unconventional practices to be kooks or radicals. No more. 
</P>
<P>
At Iowa State, in Ames, a recent opinion survey found that 78% of Iowa farmers 
questioned said they believed that modern agriculture was too dependent on 
insecticides and herbicides; 60% of them said they had refrained from using a 
farm chemical they believed was too dangerous, and nearly as many said they had 
used chemicals that they thought had somehow affected their health. 
</P>
<P>
The wariness has filtered into the political arena. One Democrat running for 
governor of Iowa recently called for a special tax on farm chemicals to 
discourage their use. And one of his opponents urged an outright ban. Not long 
ago, voicing such ideas in a Midwestern farm state would have been political 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether chemicals are safe or not may still be an open question," said Paul 
Lasley, a rural sociologist at Iowa State University. "But a significant number 
of producers perceive them to be dangerous, and they're acting on their 
perception." 
</P>
<P>
In the rural Midwest, where fads and social causes have always taken a back 
seat to hard-nosed pragmatism, the movement seems to be accelerating for two 
reasons: 
</P>
<P>
Some producers have discovered that they can earn more money even with slightly 
smaller crops if they spend less for pesticides and fertilizers. And there is a 
gnawing fear among farmers that the products used to poison bugs and weeds may 
inadvertently wind up poisoning their families as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Down at the elevator in Allison the other day, a guy said he spilled just a 
little insecticide on his skin and started getting the shakes," said Salge, who 
raises hogs along with corn and soybeans on his 720-acre spread. "That's 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
Due to sudden demand, operators of that grain elevator in Allison, the Butler 
County seat, have for the first time this year begun to stock protective 
clothing, hats, goggles and gloves. 
</P>
<P>
More worrisome than accidents, however, are the long-term dangers posed by such 
products as they leach through the soil and into wells, creeks and streams that 
are tapped both for farm use and city drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies have raised serious questions. Near Madison, Wis., half the 
wells tested last year in rural Dane County contained low levels of atrazine, 
the most widely used corn herbicide in the country. It is suspected of causing 
cancer in sufficient concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Army Corps of Engineers found atrazine contamination approaching 
the recommended maximum safe levels in three major reservoirs in Kansas that 
supply drinking water to as many as 500,000 people. Iowa state tests have found 
detectable, although not necessarily dangerous, levels of farm chemicals in 
wells and streams that provide drinking water to perhaps 40% of the state's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to surface water, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
regards agriculture as the most broad-based source of pollution. Tests 
conducted last year by the U.S. Geological Survey served only to reinforce that 
indictment. The agency sampled water from 150 rivers and streams in 10 
Midwestern states over several months. Low, but detectable, levels of atrazine 
were found in 90% of the samples taken in March and April, before planting 
began. Other farm chemicals also were present in many samples. 
</P>
<P>
By late spring, after most fields had been planted, treated with chemicals and 
flushed by rains, the proportion of tainted samples had risen to 98%. Median 
concentrations of atrazine were measured at three times the federally 
recommended safe limit for drinking water. In the fall, about 76% of the water 
samples contained atrazine, although in less threatening amounts. 
</P>
<P>
"Until recently, people thought these compounds just degraded," said Dan 
Goolsby, a USGS water quality specialist based in Denver. "We're finding some 
of them don't degrade, or are degrading far slower than we thought." 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by such discoveries, both the state of Iowa and, later, the federal 
government, clamped restrictions on the use of atrazine earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the farm chemical industry acknowledge that it has a growing image 
problem. Still, they insist that many of the doubts about safety are overblown, 
and they say that an anti-chemical fad could endanger the nation's food supply. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, said Ron Phillips of the Washington-based Fertilizer Institute, 
chemicals have enabled agriculture to maintain high production levels even as 
the number of farmers has dropped precipitously. Many of today's farmers 
supplement their incomes by holding down jobs off the land. Since low-chemical 
agriculture is more time-consuming, there simply may not be enough manpower in 
rural areas to make it work on a large scale, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
"This idea that farmers can reduce their use of commercial fertilizers and 
still remain profitable and productive is ridiculous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Fawcett, a private soil consultant in Iowa, said the methodology used for 
testing the quality of well water in Iowa may have exaggerated the 
contamination problem. Many wells appeared to be tainted by pesticides 
primarily because they were adjacent to spots where farmers had mixed chemicals 
or washed out spraying equipment, Fawcett said. Simply moving the sampling 
sites would lower the readings, he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Switching from chemical fertilizers to manure and other so-called natural ones 
also could have its drawbacks, Fawcett warned. If not properly managed, manure 
can leave even higher levels of potentially carcinogenic nitrates in the soil 
than artificial fertilizers do, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great that farmers are coming around to using the least (chemicals) that 
they have to," Fawcett said. "The only concern I have is that we don't start 
substituting other technologies that are worse than what we have." 
</P>
<P>
With some reservations, leading farm chemical dealers in Iowa agreed that their 
business is due for an upheaval, and they said they are preparing to adjust 
rather than fight it. Dan Frieberg, executive vice president of the Iowa 
Fertilizer and Chemical Assn., a retailer's group, said sales of nitrogen 
fertilizer dropped 10% to 12% in Iowa last year, even while the acreage planted 
in corn was increased 10%. 
</P>
<P>
To compensate for a continuing decline in sales, many dealers said they will 
begin marketing services, such as soil fertility testing and scouting for pest 
infestations, Frieberg said. "If service is 15% of our business now, it'll be 
possibly 40% by the turn of the century," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
If such trends continued they would mark a dramatic turnabout in the history of 
American agriculture. In simpler times, the typical Midwestern farm may have 
raised corn, oats, milo, soybeans, wheat and several other crops. Many farmers 
also raised cows, pigs and chickens in the barnyard. Animal droppings were used 
to fertilize the fields. Rotating crops and letting fields lie fallow every few 
years were tried and true natural methods of recharging the soil and keeping 
pests to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after World War II, came the "green revolution" that ushered in an era of 
specialized farming. New, man-made fertilizers and pesticides, as well as 
improved crop strains, made possible huge increases in yields. Pesticide use 
soared 170% between 1964 and 1982, and the amount of nitrogen fertilizer spread 
on fields quadrupled between 1960 and 1981, according to the USDA. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to chemicals, farmers no longer had to rotate crops or haul manure. Many 
of them began to plant the same crops in the same fields year after year. Some 
dropped out of livestock production altogether. Government policies encouraged 
these developments. 
</P>
<P>
According to a lengthy report released last year by the National Research 
Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, federal policies actually 
penalize farmers who adopt conservation methods or try to reduce pesticide 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the council explained, crop rotation is a good way to fix nitrogen 
in the soil naturally, curb erosion and reduce the need for chemical 
safeguards. Yet price support formulas are written so that farmers who do 
rotate crops get smaller subsidies than those who don't, the council charged. 
</P>
<P>
Several measures designed to correct this pro-chemical bias are being 
considered in Congress as legislation that will dictate federal agriculture 
policy through 1995 is debated. Under consideration are proposals to grant more 
money for research into low-input agriculture as well as training in 
chemical-free farming methods for all county extension agents in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
While the move away from chemicals is only beginning to catch on in a big way, 
it has long had a small corps of pioneers. Gary Young, president of the 
Sustainable Agriculture Society of Nebraska, gave up on chemicals 20 years ago, 
after he sprayed a corn field to kill cut worms and ended up in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I was planting one day and I started getting stomach cramps and felt dizzy and 
I didn't know if I was going to make it back to the house," said Young, who 
lives in McLean, Neb. "Since I quit, I've never gotten sick like that again. I 
just walked away from using all chemicals. I just figured it was either that or 
die." Young insists that his production and profits over the years have been as 
good or better than his neighbors'. 
</P>
<P>
Few farmers are willing to go as far as Young did, however, and there remains 
considerable resistance to sweeping change. Tom Smidt, who coordinates a pilot 
crop management program in Butler County, said that most of the farmers he sees 
are merely experimenting with reducing their applications of fertilizers and 
pesticides, trying to determine the most efficient levels. 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of cases you can have your cake and eat it too," Smidt said. "If you 
can get the same yields with less fertilizer, you're making more profit and 
there's less pressure on the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Ruby, the Butler County farmer, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all got to come to the realization that we couldn't work without 
chemicals and fertilizers and still farm. . .but it's something we can't abuse 
or overuse."

<P>
Two countries on the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen and South Yemen, joined Tuesday 
to become one nation, the Republic of Yemen, an impoverished land sitting on 
newly discovered oil reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh, the president of the unified state, raised the new 
country's red, white and black flag at noon atop the Presidential Council 
building at port side. 
</P>
<P>
The republic is poor but has recently located oil reserves unofficially put at 
2 billion barrels. The nation is on the strategically located Bab al Mandab, a 
strait at the southern outlet of the Red Sea into the Indian Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Saleh said at a rally that the republic will honor all treaties either of the 
former countries signed. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 people attended and interrupted Saleh's address several times with 
loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
"The Republic of Yemen will be a factor for stability and security in the 
Arabian Peninsula and the gulf (of Aden) region and a strong bastion for the 
Arab nations, the Arab League and joint Arab action," Saleh said. 
</P>
<P>
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat was the only Arab 
leader who attended the ceremony. He delivered a brief congratulatory message. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the United States on Tuesday welcomed the union of the Yemens, 
saying it will review the status of the new state on the U.S. list of terrorist 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
The United States last month re-established diplomatic relations with South 
Yemen after a 30-year break. But South Yemen remained on the U.S. list of 
nations that sponsor terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers meeting in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad to prepare for 
an Arab summit hailed the unification. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al 
Faisal said it will improve "the stability of the region." 
</P>
<P>
The merger was approved Monday by the parliaments of the former countries. It 
was pushed through several days earlier than planned so the Yemenis could 
attend the Arab summit as one nation. 
</P>
<P>
The new nation has 11 million people -- 9 million from the north and 2 million 
from the south -- and is one of the poorest countries in the world. 
</P>
<P>
South Yemen became the Arab world's only Marxist state after it gained 
independence from Britain in 1967. Although it received aid from the Soviet 
Union, the south's economy has languished for 20 years, and there has been 
widespread labor unrest in recent months. Some Arab diplomatic sources said the 
south endorsed unity mainly because of the democratic reforms sweeping Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of Cuban and East German military experts are said to have left the 
south in recent months. A friendship pact entitles the Soviets to maintain as 
many as 18,000 troops in South Yemen, but the extent of the actual deployment 
is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Sana will be the capital of the new state, with Aden the main commercial 
center. Sana was formerly the capital of the north and Aden the capital of the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
Saleh was elected president of the five-man Presidential Council that will rule 
Yemen. The 48-year-old army officer, who has served as president of the north 
since 1978, was promoted from colonel to general on Monday by the north's 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Ali Salem Bidh, the secretary general of the Socialist Party that ruled the 
south, was elected vice president.

THE LAND -- Yemen spans 203,645 square miles on the southwestern edge of the 
Arabian Peninsula and has borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman. The country 
controls the Bab al Mandab strait, strategic gateway to the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
THE PEOPLE -- Yemen has 11 million people. They are mainly tribal, and the main 
religion is Sunni Islam. 
</P>
<P>
THE ECONOMY -- Yemen is among the poorest nations in the world, but newly 
discovered oil reserves could change that. Unofficial estimates say the 
reserves could amount to as much as 2 billion barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Money from millions of Yemenis working outside their country, mainly in the 
oil-rich Persian Gulf, and from foreign aid helped prop up the economy of the 
pro-Western north for years. Farming is the main activity and crops include 
wheat, sorghum, coffee, tobacco and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
HISTORY -- By merging, the north and south regained their former status as part 
of ancient Arabia and the kingdom of Sheba that lasted for 800 years until the 
2nd Century BC. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 800 years it was ruled by the Himyarites, one of the earliest Arab 
tribes, then by Ethiopians and Persians until Islam arrived in the 7th Century. 
</P>
<P>
In 1517 South Yemen became part of the Ottoman Empire. Britain seized Aden in 
1839, and the surrounding territory later became a British protectorate. 
</P>
<P>
Aden won independence in 1967 after a terrorist campaign, and South Yemen 
became the Arab world's only Marxist state. 
</P>
<P>
The northern country was established in 1962 after an Egyptian-backed 
revolution ousted the Saudi Arabian-backed imam.

MULRONEY FACING CRISIS OVER QUEBEC, AIDE'S RESIGNATION

Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was embroiled in the worst crisis of his six 
years in power Tuesday after his top Quebec minister resigned in a dispute over 
French-speaking Quebec's future in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard, who was the leader of Mulroney's pivotal 
Quebec caucus, quit the Cabinet on Monday after sending a telegram hailing this 
week's 10th anniversary of Quebec's separatist referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Bouchard said he quit because attempts to re-negotiate the Meech Lake Accord 
bringing Quebec into the constitution were an insult and humiliating to his 
province. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Francois Gerin resigned in protest over the constitutional impasse 
and predicted that others in the 61-member Quebec caucus would follow. 
Mulroney's Conservatives now hold 164 seats in the 295-seat House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
Bouchard, along with other Quebec members, are angry over the process to bring 
their province into Canada's 1982 constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney forged the so-called Meech Lake accord in 1987 to amend the 
constitution and recognize Quebec as a "distinct society." However, the deal 
appears to be dying as three of the 10 provinces refuse to ratify it by the 
June 23 deadline unless there are changes. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, they are worried that Quebec is being given too much power 
at the expense of other regions. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney now has to contain a potential rebellion within his government that 
threatens not only to derail his constitutional plans but also to seriously 
destabilize his government.

GAZA, Israeli-Occupied Gaza Strip 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The colonel gave his press conference at an isolated intersection flanked by an 
orange grove and an empty warehouse. The nearest residences stood 300 yards 
away and over a hill. 
</P>
<P>
On a busy day, there probably wouldn't be much traffic anyway, but the colonel 
chose the spot to illustrate the success of Israeli efforts to quiet three days 
of Palestinian disturbances in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"As you can see," he said to the television cameras as he turned to point at 
the empty expanse of road, "everything here is completely normal." 
</P>
<P>
It was a message undermined by the fact that a few moments earlier, a convoy of 
reporters was forced to change course in downtown Gaza because rampaging youths 
had blocked the way with burning tires and stones at the ready. During the day, 
two youths were shot to death by Israeli troops in Gaza and more than 20 were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
But in its own way, the colonel's performance was the epitome of a subtly 
contradictory official reaction to the week's violence. An impression was 
created that, while shocking, the bloodshed was not to be seen as out of the 
ordinary. Neither the unprovoked shooting deaths of seven day-laborers at 
Rishon le Zion nor the subsequent deaths of 11 enraged Palestinian protesters 
at the hands of Israeli troops indicated a wider social condition. 
</P>
<P>
The Rishon le Zion killings were officially designated the act of a madman, the 
kind of thing that can happen anywhere. Palestinian protests were just the 
response of a justifiably angry population. The message: Everything here is 
completely normal. 
</P>
<P>
This seeming attempt to isolate the events from any context alarmed some 
Israeli observers who view it as a poison for the political culture. Was Israel 
being told to ignore an intensifying climate of hate? 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to be saying that when such things happen, it is not us, we Israelis 
-- it is just madness," said Yaron Ezrahi, a political theorist at Hebrew 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Government critics directly charged right-wing politicians with creating, 
through word and action, a climate in which anti-Arab feelings can be -- and 
are -- translated into action. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for violence is always there. It's a question of human nature," 
said Jewish philosopher David Hartman. "But once people are degraded and 
demonized, the madman in us is set in motion. An environment is created that 
inspires brutality." 
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, officials in the rightist government of Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir have worked to deflect accusations that it is somehow 
responsible for the violence both because it has resisted peace talks and 
because it is viewed as anti-Arab. 
</P>
<P>
Top officials are especially sensitive on these points. Shamir is trying to 
build a new coalition government and extend its hold on power. Opponents 
predict that a renewed Shamir term will bring on new waves of conflict with the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Almost from the moment that the news of the Rishon le Zion shootings became 
public, officials insisted that the gunman who shot the Palestinian laborers 
was "deranged," "unbalanced" and "crazy." The army has been releasing details 
of a history of suicide attempts and desertions from his truncated military 
service, from which he was discharged as unsuitable. 
</P>
<P>
The government was quick to point out that all countries harbor demented people 
who at any moment may commit an atrocity; in this, Israel is like any other 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"A man simply went berserk," Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Tuesday. "We've 
seen this happen in other places around the world, but I fear we will see some 
people try to use this to incite additional violence." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian rage over the Rishon le Zion incident was dismissed as 
having no other context but the despair of the moment. Leaders of the uprising 
were trying to "exploit" it, Israeli officials said. The colonel at the Gaza 
intersection said he understood that the Arabs were upset, but he declined to 
link the protests to continuing anti-Israeli violence or the Palestinian quest 
for independence. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Palestinian casualties mounted, Shamir took the approach that Israel is 
the main victim of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Arab-Israeli conflict, it is always the Jews who have had to defend 
themselves from attacks by Arabs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, critics focused on the public atmosphere building up to the Rishon 
le Zion killings. Violence against Arabs was being legitimized by official 
action, they charge. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the Shamir government sponsored the opening of a new settlement 
in the West Bank city of Nablus in which militant settlement leader Moshe 
Levinger was a guest of honor, hoisted aloft on the shoulders of revelers. 
Levinger had just been convicted of negligence in the shooting death of a 
Palestinian in Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, early pardons were granted to soldiers who beat a Palestinian man to 
death near the beginning of the Arab uprising, now almost 2 1/2 years old. 
Amnesty International and the U.S. State Department have criticized Israel for 
treating the military abuse of Palestinians lightly. 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty, the London-based human rights group, Tuesday renewed its criticism of 
the force used by Israelis to quell the Palestinian uprising, and in 
Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler repeated comments 
made Monday that "in the absence of a peace process, continuing violence is 
inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
"(There is) no doubt that (the Rishon le Zion gunman) acted within a society in 
which the norm exists that Arab life is cheap. Light punishments, treating 
Levinger like a hero, have created this norm," said Ephraim Sneh, a former 
general and administrator in the West Bank. "The process whereby Arabs have 
been dehumanized has to be brought to an end." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Hattis Rolef, editor of a magazine for the left-center Labor Party, 
accused Israel's right wing of inspiring acts of madness through nationalist 
ideology. She included in her list the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in 
Haifa last week by two Jews who wanted to "unite the Jewish people around 
hatred of the Arabs." 
</P>
<P>
"What is unacceptable is the spreading of ideologies which mock universal 
values while turning the national rights of the Jews into a supreme value," she 
wrote in the Jerusalem Post. "Unacceptable are statements that can be 
interpreted as permission to harm Arabs because they are Arabs and (criticism 
of) Jews who are perceived as being 'too partial' to Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the food on which 'eccentrics' and madmen thrive." 
</P>
<P>
It is unusual for these issues to be raised by Israelis against Israelis. 
Demonization, for instance, is usually a complaint lodged against the Arab 
world, where the foundation of anti-Israeli hatred is set by Arab governments 
that caricature Jews as bloodthirsty and compare Israel to Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, when a Palestinian shot up a bus of Israeli tourists, Israeli 
officials protested to Cairo about inflammatory anti-Israel rhetoric that often 
fills the Egyptian press. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, while rarely attributing their own anti-Israeli violence to pure 
madness, sometimes defend terror by pointing out that Palestinians are 
suffering too and cannot be expected to control themselves. Last July, a 
Palestinian steered an Israeli passenger bus off a highway and killed 16 
passengers. Palestinian leaders said that such acts are understandable because 
the toll of Arab dead in the uprising is mounting. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Palestinian protests over the Rishon le Zion shooting wound down, 
but incidents persisted not only in Gaza but also Jerusalem, where police used 
tear gas to break up a demonstration by Palestinians who were trying to reach 
the U.S. Consulate in the Arab-dominated half of the city. The protesters were 
led by three Arab members of Parliament plus Lutfi Laham, Greek Catholic 
archbishop of Jerusalem, and Sheik Hamad Jamal, a Muslim leader. 
</P>
<P>
Youths threw stones at police near the walls of the Old City, provoking more 
tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
A curfew over the West Bank held for a third day. 
</P>
<P>
In Jordan, for the second day in a row, Palestinians erupted in protest over 
the killings in Israel. Police killed two demonstrators, including a 
14-year-old boy, according to reports from Amman.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev took a step toward dialogue with the 
Baltics on Tuesday by meeting with the Estonian and Latvian presidents, but he 
stuck to his hard line against independence, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, struggling with an economic blockade the Kremlin imposed to weaken 
its independence campaign, said gasoline sales for private cars will be banned 
as of today. 
</P>
<P>
But a government spokesman said the Lithuanian Cabinet has rejected any idea of 
suspending the republic's independence declaration to placate the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president, who met last week with Lithuania's prime minister, sat 
down for 20 minutes with Presidents Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia and Arnold 
Ruutel of Estonia, the Estonian News Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev reportedly told them the same thing he told Lithuania's Kazimiera 
Prunskiene: The Baltic republics must either suspend or revoke their 
declarations of independence. 
</P>
<P>
The Estonian News Service, an independent information agency, quoted Ruutel as 
saying there was a common understanding of the need for dialogue, but he 
characterized the meeting as "unpleasant" for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are in varying stages of efforts to restore the 
independence they enjoyed before the Soviet Union forcibly annexed them 50 
years ago. The Kremlin has declared the independence declarations illegal. It 
imposed a blockade of oil, gas and other supplies on Lithuania, which led the 
independence movement with its March 11 declaration. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Lithuanian legislators debated measures on holding the economy 
together during the blockade and on adopting an approach toward Moscow, the 
Parliament's information bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting today, gasoline will be sold in Lithuania only for ambulances, police 
cars, fire trucks, food trucks, armored cars, hearses and agricultural 
equipment, Algirdas Brazauskas, head of the government's anti-blockade 
committee, told Parliament. Some gas will be available for limited public 
transport, Brazauskas said. 
</P>
<P>
A strike by pro-Moscow forces in Estonia was in its second day, with workers at 
two more plants joining the protest against the republic's independence drive, 
a strike committee spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tass news agency said the strike has spread to coal mines, shipyards and 
the Krengolmskaya manufacturing mills, the republic's largest light industry 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials said Tuesday that American businesses can help 
rescue the Soviet economy, but they warned that a trade accord could be 
imperiled if Moscow continues to enforce a blockade against Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
"If sanctions are still being applied in Lithuania . . . it is going to be very 
difficult to persuade the American Congress to let the commercial agreement go 
into effect," U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock told a meeting of the 
U.S-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Under a tentative agreement, reached earlier this month, Washington would lift 
the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 Trade Act, extend most-favored-nation 
trade benefits to the Soviet Union and ease restrictions on transfers of 
technology to Eastern Europe.

WARSAW PACT CALLED A THREAT NO LONGER;

<P>
MILITARY: NATO'S SENIOR GENERAL COMMENTS AS DEFENSE MINISTERS CALL FOR A REVIEW 
OF ALLIANCE STRATEGIES.

<P>
The senior general in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization officially 
declared here Tuesday that a military threat from the Warsaw Pact nations "no 
longer exists." 
</P>
<P>
The statement by Norwegian four-star Gen. Vigleik Eide, chairman of NATO's 
military committee, marked the first time a high-ranking general has formally 
repudiated the threat from the seven-nation former Communist alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Eide's declaration came during a two-day meeting of NATO's defense ministers at 
which they followed President Bush's lead in calling for a full-scale review of 
the military and political strategies of the Western alliance. 
</P>
<P>
One major proposal in any new strategy, strongly endorsed by U.S. Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney, is creation of a multinational force, particularly among 
the troops based in West Germany. In a communique to be issued at the end of 
the meeting today, the defense ministers will recommend a detailed study on how 
such forces could take over missions now assigned to single-nation units. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that, if arms control talks lead to lower levels of troops in 
Europe and reduced East-West tensions, "we can contemplate new ways of doing 
business." 
</P>
<P>
However, British Defense Secretary Tom King warned that Soviet "foot-dragging" 
could preclude agreement this year on a treaty limiting conventional forces in 
Europe. NATO members had high hopes for such a treaty, and the United States 
and Britain have indicated that without it, there would be no point in holding 
a summit meeting of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, planned for this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not happy about it; we want to get on with it," King said, referring to 
the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that the delay on cuts in conventional forces is merely a 
"temporary pause," while the Soviet Union works out the pace of troop 
withdrawals from the territories of its former allies in Hungary, 
Czechoslovakia and East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
He and NATO leaders see the proposed multinational units as a device to 
interweave the troops of a newly united Germany with other NATO units, as well 
as a way of easing German resentment over the stationing of large numbers of 
foreign troops in the reunited country. 
</P>
<P>
"NATO has to do something or risk being seen as hopelessly anachronistic," 
explained a senior official. "It's an effort to maintain the political 
relevance of our integrated defense." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a multinational force could also operate outside NATO territory 
in case of emergencies, with German troops as full partners. 
</P>
<P>
NATO officials described the multinational force as one in which an army corps, 
now consisting of three or four divisions from one nation, could be composed of 
one division each from the United States, Germany and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
A German might command one corps with an American deputy, while a British 
general could be in charge of another with a German second in command. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the principle would be extended downward to smaller units, according 
to officials here. 
</P>
<P>
A German Defense Ministry spokesman said that creation of the multinational 
units could "provide a new form of NATO solidarity" while increasing the 
flexibility and mobility of the smaller forces stationed along the NATO 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
While the plan has its supporters, other officials pointed out that in 40 years 
of existence, NATO has not been able to fully integrate the communications, 
logistics and weapons systems of its 16 members. 
</P>
<P>
One senior U.S. military officer observed that such units would be less 
effective militarily than the single-nation units in the field today and that 
they potentially would face a highly standardized and centrally directed Soviet 
army. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy review that is expected to be approved today will examine such 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
At one level, the review will be designed to provide a role for NATO in the 
post-Warsaw Pact era that Gen. Eide was talking about, in a Europe where broad 
reductions in conventional arms have already been implemented and Soviet troops 
have moved out of territories of its former satellites. It would involve 
reduced force structures in Europe, of which the multinational force could be 
an integral part. 
</P>
<P>
These concepts mean re-examining basic NATO defense doctrines, such as 
"flexible response" -- the mix of conventional and nuclear deterrents -- and 
forward defense, the basing of allied troops in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In his presentation to the defense ministers, Eide warned that the Soviet 
military is "continuously modernizing and updating" a wide range of forces, 
including the navy. But his dismissal of the threat from the combined Warsaw 
Pact countries reflected the informed view that the former Communist alliance 
is in a state of collapse, even if not yet defunct. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO foreign ministers did not discuss in any detail Tuesday what could 
well be the next controversial weapon in Europe: the air-to-surface nuclear 
missile, which could be launched from aircraft based in Britain, the Low 
Countries and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
This weapon is expected to be promoted by the United States as it withdraws its 
nuclear artillery and bombs from West Germany, but officials say it will also 
generate controversy in West Germany, where opinion polls show an increasing 
resistance to atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In another key decision reflecting the declining threat from the Warsaw Pact, 
NATO sources indicated that the ministers have effectively dropped the 
alliance's policy of an annual 3% growth in defense budgets after inflation. 
The goal was not achieved by all NATO members anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"The 3% formula will be quietly buried," one defense official commented.

This country formally registered its first opposition party Tuesday, giving it

Senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping blamed poor Communist Party leadership as 
the root cause of last year's pro-democracy demonstrations, West German sources 
said. And the new Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, said he cannot rule out 
more such demonstrations this year, the sources added. They were reporting 
comments made in talks with former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in 
Beijing on Monday.

U.S. RESTRICTIONS ON AIDS-INFECTED VISITORS CHALLENGED; 
</P>
<P>

CONFERENCE ON THE DISEASE IS SET FOR NEXT MONTH IN SAN FRANCISCO.

Challenging the Bush Administration's claim that it cannot remove an 
immigration barrier against AIDS-infected people, two congressmen Tuesday 
released documents that they said showed that the policy can be changed through 
executive action. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the Administration cannot beg the question (of travel restrictions) with 
legalisms any longer," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of 
the House energy and commerce subcommittee. "Any further rationalization and 
delay cannot be explained." 
</P>
<P>
But White House Deputy Press Secretary Alixe Glen said the President does not 
intend to take action because he "continues to believe that the issue of 
amending or reversing the congressional mandate rests with the Congress." She 
said, however, that the President would support congressional legislation 
reversing the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The travel restrictions on people with AIDS have come under mounting global 
criticism during the past year, particularly as June's international AIDS 
conference in San Francisco nears. 
</P>
<P>
The law enacted by Congress in 1987 added the AIDS-inflicted to the list of 
people denied entry because of disease. The Administration, saying it does not 
have the power to change the law, instead has offered to issue special 10-day 
visas to enable travelers to attend certain conferences deemed "in the public 
interest" by the secretary of health and human services. The special visas 
would not require foreigners to declare whether they are infected with the AIDS 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
This solution has been attacked as unsatisfactory by many in the AIDS network, 
who have threatened to boycott the San Francisco conference and other important 
scientific and medical meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman and Rep. J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.), a physician and member of the National 
Commission on AIDS, released a memo Tuesday from the U.S. comptroller general 
concluding the law that added AIDS to the list of "dangerous contagious" 
diseases "does not clearly bar" the President or the HHS secretary from "later 
deciding that (AIDS) infection is not a dangerous contagious disease. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The memo said the measure -- passed as an amendment to a 1987 supplemental 
appropriations bill -- may have been effective only for the fiscal year to 
which the appropriation act applied. 
</P>
<P>
"If that were the case, its effect . . . might be said to have expired with the 
appropriation, at the end of fiscal year 1987," the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mervyn F. Silverman, president of the American Foundation for AIDS 
Research, said the opinion by the comptroller general gives the President "the 
perfect opportunity to take the high road." 
</P>
<P>
The memo further said control of the list of diseases continues to remain with 
the secretary of health and human services. Rowland, seeking to clarify the 
authority, recently introduced legislation that would give the secretary of 
health and human services power to change the list. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also released an internal memo written by Dr. James O. Mason, 
assistant secretary for health, to HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan urging that 
AIDS and six other conditions -- including leprosy and several treatable 
sexually transmitted diseases -- be removed from the list because the policy 
was "outdated." He proposed leaving only tuberculosis on the list. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the other diseases on the list, tuberculosis can be transmitted through 
the air and an infectious person can place others at risk through casual 
contact," Mason wrote. 
</P>
<P>
As to the other conditions, Mason wrote, " . . . there is no public health 
value in continued screening. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He suggested the secretary order the removal of the six conditions other than 
AIDS, and that the Administration offer a legislative proposal to delete AIDS 
from the list.

COAST GUARD DRUG TRAFFIC LINKS PROBED; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: AT LEAST 10 GUARDSMEN ARE SUSPECTED OF HAVING PEDDLED COCAINE OR 
HAVING SOLD SENSITIVE INFORMATION WHILE ON DUTY ON THE FLORIDA KEYS.

At least 10 current or former members of the Coast Guard have been targeted in 
a secret federal investigation of charges that they peddled cocaine or aided 
traffickers while on anti-drug duty in the Florida Keys, the service's 
commandant announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department probe, code-named Operation Tempest, marks the 
continuation of a narcotics corruption investigation that resulted in the 1988 
conviction of four other Coast Guardsmen who had been stationed at the 
Islamorada base, Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest disclosure suggests that federal investigators now believe that 
about half of the Coast Guard personnel at the key South Florida outpost were 
directly or indirectly involved in drug trafficking in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had a few bad apples," conceded Adm. Paul A. Yost, who said he had 
only recently learned of the extent of the federal probe. Yost ordered Coast 
Guard commanders throughout the fleet to warn subordinates about "the need to 
remain above compromise and the tragic consequences of failure." 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials refused to identify those under suspicion in the probe, but 
said four are members of the Coast Guard and six others have left the service 
since the alleged wrongdoing took place. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of the investigation was first reported by NBC News. While 
confirming that it focused on Coast Guard corruption, Yost said he was 
confident that broad-based drug interdiction efforts by the 38,000-member 
service had not been jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a good outfit, we'll stay a good outfit, and we're going to hang in 
there," Yost said. 
</P>
<P>
According to federal sources, the Operation Tempest probe now focuses on 
charges that some of the 10 guardsmen sold sensitive information -- including 
details about Coast Guard call signs and radio channels -- to the traffickers 
they were assigned to thwart. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said indictments in the case, which is being pursued by a federal 
Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force in Miami, were expected to be 
handed up in the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The four other guardsmen already convicted in the investigation had stolen four 
kilos of cocaine from a Coast Guard seizure and attempted to sell it to an 
undercover agent in North Carolina. All four are now serving prison terms for 
their actions, which received little publicity at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The federal sources said the events now being scrutinized took place between 
two and four years ago when all 14 Coast Guardsmen were serving together at the 
30-man Islamorada station, an outpost with responsibility for a principal 
smuggling corridor. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard commandant refused to comment Tuesday about the extent of past 
corruption at Islamorada, but indicated that most if not all of those targeted 
in the probe have since left the Florida Keys outpost. 
</P>
<P>
Yost confirmed that one of those guardsmen had until recently been assigned to 
a Coast Guard vessel in New England that helps provide protection for President 
Bush when he visits his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me. 
</P>
<P>
But the commandant insisted that the vessel had performed no more than a 
"backup role" in the presidential security detail, and said he had ordered the 
guardsman transferred to a less-sensitive post. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three other current Coast Guardsmen under suspicion, Yost said only that 
they were stationed "at some places in the United States" and had not yet been 
disciplined.

Mayor David N. Dinkins proclaimed a "day of solidarity against bigotry" Tuesday 
and called for a color-blind campaign for "respect and unity" to dispel racial 
tensions in the city. 
</P>
<P>
An overflow crowd of more than 5,000 people packed the Episcopal Cathedral of 
St. John the Divine to hear the mayor ask New Yorkers to rededicate themselves 
to "the values of justice, opportunity and caring." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time to come together to create a wave of energy and unity so 
powerful that it can wash away the hate and the hurt," the mayor said. "I'm 
sick of the pain. I've seen too much. I need you to be my companions in this 
campaign for respect and unity."

<P>
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and representatives of black, Irish, Latino, Italian, 
Jewish, Korean and homosexual groups also spoke. 
</P>

The most recent irritant to race relations was a pair of verdicts in the 
Bensonhurst case. One white teen-ager was convicted of killing a black youth 
during a gang attack in a predominantly white section of Brooklyn in August. A 
co-defendant was acquitted of murder but convicted of lesser charges.

</P>
<P>
GUN CONTROL: HE HAD SOUGHT A 15-ROUND LIMIT ON CLIPS. NOW WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS 
SAY THEY WILL SUPPORT STIFF PENALTIES FOR CRIMES RELATED TO FIREARMS.

<P>
The Bush Administration on Tuesday quietly backed away from its earlier 
proposal to curtail the ammunition capacity of semiautomatic assault weapons, 
as the Senate cast a preliminary vote against banning the military-style guns. 
</P>
<P>
Under mounting pressure for federal action to take the weapons out of the hands 
of drug dealers and other criminals, the White House reluctantly announced a 
year ago that it would back a 15-round limit on the ammunition clips sold with 
the guns. 
</P>
<P>
But White House officials are acknowledging that the Administration has shifted 
its approach, and is now supporting an alternative by Sen. Strom Thurmond 
(R-S.C.) that would toughen penalties for gun-related crimes rather than slap 
new controls on firearms. 
</P>
<P>
The limit on clips "didn't meet with a lot of enthusiasm. It wasn't pushed 
intensely," said one White House official. 
</P>
<P>
News of the shift came as the Senate rejected, 82 to 17, a proposal by Sen. 
Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) to ban 27 semiautomatic pistols and rifles that 
he claimed had become the "weapons of choice" of drug dealers and other 
criminals. The measure also would have imposed a 15-bullet limit on ammunition 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Both California senators, Democrat Alan Cranston and Republican Pete Wilson, 
supported the Metzenbaum measure. Last year, the state of California and 27 
cities and counties across the country enacted bans on the weapons. Last week, 
the New Jersey Legislature approved the nation's toughest ban, including a 
provision that would require most people who legally bought the weapons to give 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
The Metzenbaum measure was offered as an amendment to an omnibus crime bill 
heavily charged with election-year politics. The legislation would make 
extensive changes in the federal death penalty and rules of evidence and 
appeals process. It would also vastly expand aid to law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate was expected to vote today on a narrower proposal by Sen. Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.) to ban 14 semiautomatic firearms, which are designed to 
resemble fully automatic assault weapons used by the military. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Metzenbaum and DeConcini proposals were aimed primarily at U.S.-made 
guns not covered by an import ban imposed last July by Bush on 43 foreign-made 
assault weapons. The President has opposed extending the ban to domestically 
manufactured assault weapons, which account for about 75% of such guns in 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum noted widespread support for an expanded assault weapons ban in 
public opinion polls and by many law enforcement leaders, including Los Angeles 
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. But he said that numerous Senate colleagues had 
told him they feared voter resentment that could be stirred up by the National 
Rifle Assn.'s harsh rhetoric and organizing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be afraid of the NRA," Metzenbaum pleaded during contentious debate, 
noting that he had survived an attack at the polls in 1988. "The NRA is a paper 
tiger. Its bark is louder than its bite." 
</P>
<P>
And Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said, "Vote for the NRA or vote for your 
local police," who, he said, are "outgunned by these types of weapons." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) protested that such a ban would 
not harm criminals, who could get the guns anyway, but law-abiding hunters and 
target shooters who "wouldn't hurt a flea." 
</P>
<P>
What is needed to curb crime, Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) said, is not more 
gun control but an enforceable death penalty for 30 federal crimes ranging from 
assassination of the President to murder of egg product inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's try 'em and fry 'em -- that'll get things going," Simpson said with 
characteristic irreverence. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's original suggestion to limit ammunition clips was part of an anti-crime 
package he proposed last May. At that point, pressure had been building to 
restrict assault weapons since the previous January, following a schoolyard 
massacre in Stockton, Calif. Rapidly firing a Chinese-made AK-47 with a huge 
ammunition clip, a drifter named Patrick Purdy killed five children and wounded 
30 others. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Bush's comments on crime have focused on calls for greater use 
of the death penalty, particularly in cases involving drugs and the murders of 
law enforcement officers. He has criticized the Democrats' crime package as a 
"weak imitation" of the Republican alternative, complaining that it would 
effectively nullify the death penalty and limit the use of evidence seized by 
police.

VISITING BISHOP FROM KENYA STIRS FUROR; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: THE EPISCOPALIAN PRELATE WAS FORBIDDEN TO CRITICIZE HOMOSEXUALITY AT 
A WALNUT CREEK CHURCH. HE THEN ISSUED A 'JUDGMENTAL' PRESS RELEASE.

<P>
An ecclesiastical flap erupted Tuesday between a California bishop and a 
visiting prelate from Kenya who was denied an opportunity to criticize 
homosexuality from the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
The Rt. Rev. William Swing, Episcopal Church bishop for Northern California, 
chastised Anglican Bishop Alexander Muge of Kenya on Tuesday for issuing 
"judgmental" press releases after the African prelate was refused permission to 
speak against homosexual behavior at a Walnut Creek church. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began last week when Muge told the church's rector that 
"homosexuals and lesbians have taken over the (Episcopal) Church leadership" in 
the United States, accounting for the denomination's membership decline. 
</P>
<P>
Muge said he was "shocked" when the Rev. Gary Ost, rector of St. Luke's 
Episcopal Church in Walnut Creek, promptly said that Muge would not be allowed 
to deliver a scheduled talk that night if anti-homosexuality was his topic. 
</P>
<P>
"I insisted that the spirit of the Lord was leading me to speak on Sodom and 
Gomorrah," said Muge in a press release. Muge, bishop of Eldoret Diocese in 
Kenya, also said the rector and a woman parishioner told him that they were 
Christians as well as homosexuals and that they had the support of Bishop 
Swing. Ost could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Swing said in a telephone interview Tuesday from San Francisco that 
Episcopal congregations such as St. Luke's are within church law "to hire and 
continue with a priest who is a homosexual Christian." 
</P>
<P>
Saying it was "strange" that the visiting bishop did not contact him before 
creating a stir, Swing added that the controversy raised questions about the 
responsibility a bishop has "in keeping confidential, personal information 
volunteered to him by a priest." 
</P>
<P>
Swing said he would "never go into another bishop's diocese, bypass the local 
bishop, and hold a press conference that was judgmental." The Times and other 
news media were alerted to Muge's statements and his press conference Monday in 
Concord by associates of the Episcopal Synod of America, an ultraconservative 
body within the denomination. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Tuesday, Swing said, "I suspect that poor Bishop Muge is 
naively being used by some background group that is trying to exploit his moral 
bias in matters of human sexuality to further their own cause." Asked if he was 
referring to the Episcopal Synod, Swing said, "That's a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Muge's travels through the state are being coordinated by African Team 
Ministries, an interdenominational agency based in Pasadena. Keith Jesson, 
president of the agency, said the Kenyan bishop kept speaking engagements last 
weekend in Claremont and Orange and was in Palm Springs for church meetings 
Tuesday and today. 
</P>
<P>
"All this was totally unexpected; he has been preaching on evangelism," Jesson 
said. "I advised Bishop Muge not to do anything until he spoke to Bishop 
Swing." 
</P>
<P>
Swing said the Episcopal Church, which still espouses the virtue of "sexual 
intimacy inside marriage only," nevertheless is struggling with questions of 
how best to minister to gay and lesbian Christians and what stances it should 
adopt. 
</P>
<P>
Muge, in his press statement, said many U.S. Christians are faithful to the 
Gospel "despite rampant secularization" but that future American missionaries 
to Africa should be screened for their beliefs. "We are not being judgmental as 
such. . . . Sin should be rebuked by any and all means," he said.

PLANE'S LOAD FOUND TOO HEAVY IN FATAL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plane that crashed early this year at Burbank Airport, killing all four 
occupants, was carrying too much weight and the flight instructor who may have 
been piloting the craft had traces of alcohol and marijuana in his blood, the 
National Transportation Safety Board reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The findings did not constitute a ruling on the cause of the fiery crash on 
Jan. 18. They were contained in an investigator's analysis of the crash that 
will be used by the safety board to determine a probable cause. 
</P>
<P>
NTSB Air Safety Investigator Thomas H. Wilcox said it was unclear whether the 
amounts of alcohol and marijuana discovered were sufficient to have impaired a 
pilot's judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"Was his judgment impaired? Was his reaction time slow? I don't know. But he 
crashed the plane," Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
The single-engine Piper Cherokee crashed shortly after taking off on a training 
flight to Santa Barbara with four certified pilots aboard. The victims were 
Lawrence W. Anderson Jr., 30, of Thousand Oaks, who was also a flight 
instructor; Jeffrey Fader, 28, of Canyon Country; Ingvar H. Gronberg, 27, of 
Burbank; and George E. Kraft, 33, of Marina Del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Crash investigators found no engine or other mechanical failure, officials said 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox said Tuesday the total safe weight limit for the plane and its contents 
was 2,325 pounds, but the estimated weight with the four occupants, fuel and 
baggage was 110 pounds more than that. 
</P>
<P>
He said the plane would have been able to take off with that weight but the 
pilot also apparently attempted a steep banking turn that doubled the gravity 
force on the plane, requiring an extreme amount of power to overcome the 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
"The effect of the weight was compounded by the steep turn," Wilcox said. "They 
hit a power limitation." Because the engine "just was not producing" enough 
power, the plane dropped almost vertically, its left wing striking the ground 
first, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fader was in the pilot's seat and Anderson, the flight instructor, was in the 
co-pilot's seat at the time of the crash. But only the steering yoke in front 
of Anderson was broken, indicating that he was gripping it -- flying the plane 
-- on impact, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally during an emergency situation, the flight instructor will take 
control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox said that toxicological tests performed on Anderson's body were positive 
for cannabinoids and ethanol, chemicals found in marijuana and alcohol. Wilcox 
declined to say what amount of the chemicals were found. 
</P>
<P>
It was unknown if there was enough of either chemical to impair Anderson's 
judgment, he said, but it is a violation of federal flight rules for a pilot to 
fly a plane with any amount of those chemicals in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
Tests on the other victims found no alcohol or drugs, Wilcox said.

Police Tuesday called off a search for two wallabies that have been running 
wild near this Dutch town for two months. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't do any harm to let them live up in the dunes," Deputy Cmdr. J. N. 
Boer of the National Police said after abandoning the search. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, we have better things to do." 
</P>
<P>
The wallabies are relatives of the kangaroo and are also native to Australia. 
They were the pets of a local resident until they hopped over his fence. 
</P>
<P>
Police were concerned that the sight of two 20-inch-high wallabies hopping down 
the highway might cause a traffic accident. They even called in a helicopter to 
ferret out the marsupials. 
</P>
<P>
The wallabies eluded searchers. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the owner had refused to cooperate in capture attempts. Repeated 
telephone calls to his home were not answered. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no law against letting your pet kangaroos roam free, but he will be 
responsible for whatever might happen," Boer said.

The American Red Cross received a record $165 million in donations in 1989 but 
spent $151 million, three times more than the record. Most of the money, $127 
million, was spent on victims of Hurricane Hugo in the Southeast and the 
California earthquake, Red Cross Chairman George Moody said Tuesday at the 
organization's annual convention.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SHOOTS ESTRANGED WIFE TO DEATH, THEN 
SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man apparently distraught over marital problems fatally shot his estranged 
wife outside an Acton saloon on Tuesday, then drove to a spot about a mile away 
where he killed himself with a shotgun, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple was identified as Carl George Etheredge, 68, of Acton, and Norma 
Jean Etheredge, 49, of Agua Dulce. 
</P>
<P>
They had been separated for about a year. She was shot at least three times. He 
died of a single blast to the head. 
</P>
<P>
She was the advertising manager at the Vanguard News newspaper, which serves 
Acton, Agua Dulce and the southern Antelope Valley, a spokeswoman for the paper 
said. The couple's son, Vincent C. Etheredge, is the newspaper's publisher. 
George Etheredge operated an antique mall in Agua Dulce, acquaintances said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SALVAGE CREWS BEGIN RAISING PRINCESS LOUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Salvage crews on Tuesday began the slow, delicate task of raising the 2,400- 
ton Princess Louise on Tuesday, nearly seven months after the former cruise 
ship and restaurant mysteriously capsized at a San Pedro shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
The salvage effort, which is expected to be completed today, will allow the 
330-foot vessel to be towed later this week to waters off the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, where it will be sunk for use as an artificial reef for marine life 
and divers. 
</P>
<P>
Once a fixture in the Los Angeles port, the Princess Louise capsized on Oct. 30 
as it was being prepared for sale at Southwest Marine of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
The salvage effort began two months ago, delayed by insurance claims and a 
continuing dispute over the cause of the accident.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The body of a missing 74-year-old hiker was found Tuesday morning at the bottom 
of a canyon in the Angeles National Forest about five miles north of Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Larry Curry of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's said the man, 
whose name was withheld pending notification of his family, apparently died 
from a fall into a steep ravine. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the man and a 63-year-old companion had been hiking in the 
Williams Canyon area above the East Fork of the San Gabriel River Monday 
afternoon when the two decided to separate. When the older man failed to return 
as scheduled, the younger man notified sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
A helicopter crew that was aiding a 16-member search-and-rescue detail on the 
ground spotted the body at 7:25 a.m.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 33.5% INCREASE IN L.A. SEWAGE FEES ADOPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a 33.5% increase in 
sewage fees and tentatively approved a parking tax and increased trash pick up 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
The average homeowner's sewage fee will increase from $10.43 to $13.93 a month 
beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials said that if a rate payer manages to cut back water use by 
10%, in accordance with Mayor Tom Bradley's proposed water-rationing, the fee 
will rise to only $12.54. 
</P>
<P>
The parking and trash measures failed to garner the unanimous vote needed for 
formal approval during the first reading of an ordinance and will be 
reconsidered next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The parking tax would be levied on all those who park in commercial garages and 
parking lots, and is expected to raise $22.5 million in the coming fiscal year. 
Monthly sanitation charges would increase from $1.50 to $3 for homeowners and 
from $1 to $2 a month for residents of apartments and condominiums.

ARMED BROTHERS KILL THIEF WHO SHOT THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two brothers turned the tables on a would-be robber Monday night and mortally 
wounded him with a barrage of bullets after the gunman, wearing a ski mask, 
attacked the pair in front of their mid-city Los Angeles home, police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At least 13 rounds were fired during the shooting in the 2100 block of South 
Curson Avenue about 9:15 p.m., detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the suspect knew that the brothers were packing heat," said a 
Wilshire Division detective who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man was identified by authorities as Jerome Moore, 22, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Davis, 44, was shot in the legs and Nathaniel Davis, 46, was shot in the 
foot during the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Ed Ortiz said the brothers' car had just pulled into the driveway of 
their home after finishing work at their auto repair shop in South Los Angeles. 
The pair had an undisclosed amount of cash, the day's receipts from the shop, 
at the time, Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman rushed up and ordered Gerald Davis, who had gotten out of the car, 
to sprawl on the ground. He then fired several rounds from a semiautomatic 
pistol at Gerald Davis, hitting him at least three times in the legs, Ortiz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nathaniel Davis, who was still in the car, pulled a .38-caliber handgun and 
began firing at the masked assailant, Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Gerald Davis, although wounded, also began returning fire -- 
from a .38-caliber revolver he was carrying, Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, mortally wounded, ran about a block from the scene of the shooting 
to his car, detectives said. Officers, summoned by the brothers, later found 
Moore in his car with a gunshot wound in the chest, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
A ski mask and a semiautomatic pistol were found in the car, Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was taken to Midway Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced 
dead, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The two brothers were also taken there for treatment of their wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide investigators said that neither brother was held because detectives 
believe they acted in self-defense in the face of an apparent robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is expected to review the circumstances 
surrounding the shooting.

MENENDEZ ATTORNEY ACCUSES REINER OF LEAKS TO NEWS MEDIA; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: LAWYER FOR ONE OF THE BROTHERS ACCUSED OF MURDER SAYS D.A. WANTS CASE 
'TRIED IN THE PRESS' TO AID HIS CAMPAIGN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid heated courtroom arguments over the imminent release of evidence in the 
Menendez murder case, a defense attorney excoriated Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner for 
allegedly leaking information to the media to further his political career. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Leslie Abramson, who represents Erik Menendez, one of two brothers 
charged with the shotgun slayings of their multimillionaire parents, told Santa 
Monica Superior Court Judge James Albracht that she has information that "these 
leaks are coming from candidate Reiner's office downtown." 
</P>
<P>
Abramson said the leaks, which she did not specify, reflect "Reiner's decision 
to have this case tried in the press to divert attention from some of the 
boners of the recent past." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer was referring to Reiner's campaign for the Democratic nomination for 
state attorney general and to a series of political missteps during the past 
two weeks in another high-profile case, the McMartin Pre-School molestation 
retrial of Ray Buckey, concerning an alleged plea-bargain offer and an attempt 
to contact the trial judge. 
</P>
<P>
Abramson argued that granting the press increased access to evidence will only 
result in glitzy cases, like the Menendez murders, being "tried in the media -- 
with all of its money, all of its pizazz, and all of its power to slant 
things." 
</P>
<P>
"She's wrong," Deputy Dist. Atty. Elliott Alhadeff, who is prosecuting the 
Menendez brothers, said tersely when asked as he left the courtroom about 
Abramson's allegations against Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
"That's balderdash," said district attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons, who sat 
in on an ABC television interview with Reiner last week about the Menendez 
case. "At no time did he give out any information that would even lead to their 
finding out what they found out about the case." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides had agreed not to disclose certain information they had asked 
Albracht to seal. But several television accounts that included supposedly 
secret information have aired this month -- even before the defendants have had 
a preliminary hearing on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
After reading and listening to long arguments, the judge said he was "fed up 
with verbiage" and ruled Tuesday that an audiotape of Lyle and Erik Menendez's 
911 call reporting the murders and a four-hour videotape (with sound and 
certain portions deleted) of the search of their psychologist's home must be 
released to the public within 48 hours, or by noon Thursday. He said that 
release of the tapes does not appear to violate privileged communications or to 
interfere with the defendants' right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
Albracht said he would reserve ruling until May 30 on a media request for 
records relating to shotguns allegedly purchased by the pair, to give the 
defense time to present written arguments against their release. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Gerald Chaleff said he may file an emergency appeal to halt 
the dissemination of the tapes. The defense said it is opposed to release of 
such evidence before it is introduced in court. Jeff Douglas, a lawyer for 
psychologist Jerome Oziel, argued that the videotaped search of Oziel's home 
was an invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the controversial audiotapes seized during the March search -- 
recordings of psychotherapy sessions in which the brothers allegedly confessed 
to the murders -- was postponed until June 8. 
</P>
<P>
The psychotherapy tapes precipitated the arrests of Lyle, 22, and his brother, 
Erik, 19, although they had long been suspects in the slayings of their 
parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were found dead in their Beverly Hills mansion last Aug. 20, hit 
numerous times at close range with blasts from two 12-gauge shotguns. The guns 
have not been found. 
</P>
<P>
Suspicion initially focused on the possibility that the killings were the work 
of organized crime, aimed at Jose Menendez, a high-ranking entertainment 
executive with Carolco Pictures Inc. But police said the evidence began to 
point toward the sons early in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants face special circumstance allegations of multiple murders, 
killing for financial gain and lying in wait, which could result in the death 
penalty. Both insist they are innocent, and the Menendez family has rallied 
behind them.

DOCTOR TAKES THE STAND IN MCMARTIN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pediatrician who examined the three child witnesses in the retrial of 
McMartin Pre-School defendant Ray Buckey testified this week that she found 
physical evidence of "blunt force penetrating trauma" consistent with sexual 
abuse in all three. 
</P>
<P>
During two days on the witness stand, Dr. Astrid Heger testified that she found 
vaginal scarring in the three girls and anal scarring in two of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's significant trauma to this anus," she said of one child, 
referring to photographs taken at the time of the examinations six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Heger is director of County-USC Medical Center's child abuse and neglect 
program and an assistant professor at the University of Southern California. 
She is internationally known for her work in diagnosing sexual abuse in 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Her testimony is considered key prosecution evidence that the alleged 
molestations are not a figment of the children's imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
Under lengthy cross-examination by defense lawyer Danny Davis, Heger maintained 
that there are -- and were in 1984 at the time of the examinations -- medical 
standards for diagnosing past trauma indicative of sexual abuse, and that she 
followed them. 
</P>
<P>
She explained her findings to the jury with diagrams, photographs and slides, 
and said that she not only examined the children's genitals but also conducted 
a complete physical examination and took a medical history from the child and a 
parent in each case before arriving at a diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
One of the child witnesses has testified in the retrial. The second of the 
alleged child victims is expected to take the stand late today. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey is charged with eight counts of molestation involving the three girls, 
who are now approaching adolescence. They attended his family's Manhattan Beach 
nursery school in the late 1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, who has maintained his innocence since he was arrested seven years ago, 
was acquitted of most of the charges against him in January. The remaining 
charges are among those that left an earlier jury deadlocked.

SUSPECT IN JUVENILE HALL MASS ESCAPE IS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL and RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teen-age escapee suspected of aiding six violent-crime suspects to flee the 
county's Central Juvenile Hall last week by smashing a car through a utility 
gate has been arrested, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Lt. Robert Barker said Barry Mortis, 17, was 
arrested on a fugitive warrant Sunday at a house near 61st Street and Vernon 
Avenue. Mortis refused to come out of the house at first, but eventually 
surrendered without incident, Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
Mortis, who fled Juvenile Hall in March, was linked to one of two cars used in 
the jailbreak and knew one of escapees who raced to freedom through the smashed 
gate, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest, Mortis was returned to Juvenile Hall to face an escape 
charge, along with allegations of kidnaping, attempted rape and kidnaping for 
purposes of robbery, the charges on which he was originally detained. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over the escape -- all six youths are still at large -- brought a call 
by the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday for a study of the feasibility of 
housing violent youthful offenders in maximum-security facilities, instead of 
in Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very concerned that minors declared unfit and charged with murder and 
other violent offenses would be detained in Juvenile Hall to begin with," said 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, who called for an investigation of last week's escape. 
</P>
<P>
"The sophisticated and probable preplanning involved in the escape itself 
indicates a level of criminal maturity that juvenile halls are just not 
equipped to deal with," the supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, in whose district Central Juvenile Hall is located, noted that four of 
the fugitives had been detained on murder charges and had been declared "unfit" 
for handling by the Juvenile Court, but had been ordered detained in Juvenile 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Edelman, Chief Probation Officer Barry Nidorf said he has 
asked for a review of every file of violent offenders in county juvenile 
facilities. According to probation officers, 95 offenders charged with murder 
are now housed in the system. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are unfit to stand trial as a juvenile, why do we continue to have 
them at Juvenile Hall?" Edelman asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make sense to me either. It is because we are ordered by the 
court," Nidorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said, "We can't tolerate any more escapes similar to this." 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's breakout, a 1981 Chevrolet station wagon that had been stolen in 
the Mid-Wilshire area was used to crash through a gate on the north side of 
Juvenile Hall on Eastlake Avenue in Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the six fled in a second car.

ALMOST ALL OF THE WESTERN FINALISTS AGREE WITH CHOICE OF MAGIC AS MVP

Nearly every player on the Phoenix Suns and the Portland Trail Blazers said 
Tuesday that the Lakers' Magic Johnson deserved his second consecutive NBA 
most-valuable-player honor, although most diplomatically added that any of six 
players could have been selected. 
</P>
<P>
"The man deserves it," Trail Blazer forward Buck Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic is the best player that's come down the pike in a long time. He is 
phenomenal, but he makes people like A.C. Green, Mychal Thompson and Vlade 
Divac better players." 
</P>
<P>
The lone dissenting vote was cast by Portland guard Clyde Drexler. Although 
Drexler did not begrudge Johnson the honor, he said he would have voted for 
fellow Houstonian Akeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you pick Magic Johnson for MVP, you can't go wrong," Drexler said. 
"But maybe I'm a little biased. I would've taken Akeem. It's hard to overlook 
his statistics. He was up there in almost every category." SAM McMANIS

MELVIN DURSLAG: HOLTZ MAY NOT HAVE A PHI BETA KAPPA IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Melvin Durslag 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To begin with, you don't want to underestimate the cerebral endowment of Lou 
Holtz, football coach at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Lou has experienced success on the field. He is a philosopher and noted 
speaker, renowned for his wit. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, you aren't sure whether Holtz was pulling society's leg the other day 
when he observed, quite unblinkingly, that professional sports should set up a 
chain of 10 academies, at which they would train athletes for their armies. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to be a professional athlete," he said, "go to that academy. 
Preparing people for pro sports is not the role of the universities. We are 
there to educate people." 
</P>
<P>
The listener draws back, reflecting on this profound thought. If, indeed, 
universities are to reject athletes leveling an eye on the pros, the first 
thing that's going to happen is that NBC is going to cancel the 
multimillion-dollar football contract it recently signed with Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Could the network sell Ivy League-type football? If it could, it would have 
signed a contract with Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeding only with student athletes, Notre Dame and maybe 100 colleagues 
embracing what is labeled big-time college football must brace themselves for 
unoccupied seats in their stadiums, not the automatic sellouts on which they 
have feasted for years. 
</P>
<P>
And what are they going to say to their angels who are asked to make 
contributions to the university each year in order to retain choice locations 
in the stadium? 
</P>
<P>
"Look, Jack," they are going to say, "all the top players are now attending pro 
academies, and what we offer is schoolboy football, but we are sure that will 
not water down your generosity." 
</P>
<P>
If, as Holtz suggests, the academies are activated, what will be the impact on 
bowls, from which the universities are dredging millions, and whose bids serve 
as such an emotional stimulant to team supporters? 
</P>
<P>
Informed the prime players have fled, Federal Express, Mobil, USF&amp;G, Mazda, 
John Hancock, Sunkist and Eagle are going to shrug. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't mind 150-pound quarterbacks," they are going to say. "Five feet-seven 
is tall enough." 
</P>
<P>
"But will they sell delivery service, gasoline, automobiles, insurance and 
orange juice?" they will be asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't important," they will respond. "The only thing that counts is 
education." 
</P>
<P>
Now the Associated Press and United Press International are contacted. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the Lou Holtz plan of student athletes," they will be asked, "will you 
continue to run weekly polls?" 
</P>
<P>
They will answer: "Running them is easy. The problem is getting someone to read 
them." 
</P>
<P>
"And you don't foresee beefs over which team is No. 1?" 
</P>
<P>
"When cricket season approaches at Oxford," they reply, "a sign is posted on 
the bulletin board, soliciting recruits. In some cases, knowledge of cricket is 
unimportant if one has a car one is willing to use to transport teammates to 
matches, petrol shared. Cricket has been played at Oxford for 600 years, 
without a single argument developing over which club in the league is No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Now approaches July, the time of year at which drums begin to roll in behalf of 
Heisman candidates. How much universities spend to promote a hero for the 
Heisman Trophy rarely is known, because such expenditure is a point of 
embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
When candidates are students only, and no prospects for the pros, will 
promotion budgets change? And will television carry live announcement of the 
winner? 
</P>
<P>
More important, will he be contacted by Bob Hope? 
</P>
<P>
When Lou Holtz recommends pro academies, he must allow for major adjustments in 
the lives of the coaches. One adjustment would call for a farewell kiss to 
salaries spiraling into six figures. 
</P>
<P>
And what kind of radio and TV shows are tendered the coaches of St. Mary's, 
Santa Clara, Occidental, Whittier and Pomona-Pitzer, engaged in student 
football? 
</P>
<P>
Often, arrangements are made with local car dealers for the head coach and his 
staff to drive new machines, in exchange for promotional opportunities, if not 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Told the team is shifting to student football, the car dealer will give the 
coaching staff a bus schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Since Lou Holtz is only 53, we don't like to disillusion him at an age so 
tender. But he must be informed that we already have pro academies in this 
land. 
</P>
<P>
They are called Notre Dame, USC, Ohio State, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Clemson, Miami 
and the like. Pursuing the buck as they do, they serve as idols of the children 
they shepherd.

MIKE DOWNEY: DODGERS ARE JUST WHAT DOCTOR ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doc Gooden needed a doctor. He broke the middle toe of his left foot -- or, 
rather, a teammate broke it for him -- a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden decided to give it a minor stress test. So, he pitched against the 
Dodgers. That's all the Dodgers ever give Dwight Gooden -- minor stress. The 
man is 11-1 lifetime against them. 
</P>
<P>
Covering first base, though, or leaving the batter's box, Gooden limped and 
lumbered around the infield Monday night. He looked old and lame for a kid of 
25. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like Bill Buckner," Gooden said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, all the New York Mets and the sporting public can hope for is that Gooden 
takes it easy and gets back to his old form. Vin Scully told his radio audience 
the story of Dizzy Dean, and how he favored his sore foot so much that he 
wrecked his delivery and his career. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden confined himself to five innings against the Dodgers, staked to a big 
lead by a bunch of hits including a Darryl Strawberry home run that landed 
someplace near Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
He was sharp, scattering three hits, but said: "I definitely was favoring the 
foot out there. Usually you land on the ball of your foot on your 
follow-through? Well, I was afraid to do that sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I must have looked a little herky-jerky out there." 
</P>
<P>
No, Doc Gooden on his worst day never looked either herky or jerky. 
</P>
<P>
Already, going into the 1990 season, this kid had racked up an even 100 
victories. At his age, 300 seems likely, 350 certainly possible. If only he can 
overcome life's little problems. Gooden was on the disabled list from April 1 
to June 5, 1987. He was on it again from July 2 to September 2, 1989. In one of 
those instances, Gooden had a substance-abuse matter to attend to, which makes 
every day of the rest of his life a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
He appears and feels relaxed. There was a time when Dwight Gooden looked like a 
kitten caught in a car's headlights. After a game he always looked jumpy, 
skittish, scared. On the mound, he looked like Bob Feller. In the clubhouse, he 
looked for an exit. 
</P>
<P>
Not after pitching against the Dodgers, though. Gooden stood there in his white 
silk shirt with the solid-gold cross necklace and shot the breeze like a 
veteran who had been doing it his whole life. 
</P>
<P>
He and the Mets had held a team meeting before the game, to talk over the 
reasons they were so low in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
"This one was different," said Gooden, who has been to these sorts of things 
previously. "It was different because so many people spoke up. Ordinarily, 
you've got one or two guys who want to get something off their chest. This 
time, 10 or 12 people must have stepped forward." 
</P>
<P>
One of them may or may not have been catcher Mackey Sasser. If he did step 
forward, you can bet Gooden jumped out of the way, fast. 
</P>
<P>
It was Sasser who was unfolding a folding chair in San Diego the other day when 
he decided that the best place to set it down was atop Dwight Gooden's foot. 
Diagnosis: hairline fracture. 
</P>
<P>
"You always think it'll be a line drive or a hit-by-pitch that'll get you," 
Gooden said, laughing. "Not somebody's chair." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, what was a catcher doing sitting down, anyway? Why didn't he just 
squat? 
</P>
<P>
Being extra careful around a man who already has struck out more than 1,200 
batters might also be a good idea. Remember, Nolan Ryan has fanned 5,000-plus, 
but he's 43 years old. He has 18 years on Gooden, provided Doc can stay away 
from chairs and other bad stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Gooden work is one of baseball's real pleasures. There is an 
effortless way about him, a smoothness, that rivals Ryan's. If he was 
herky-jerky against the Dodgers, he sure didn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
The only time we could really tell the foot was troubling Gooden was when he 
covered first base on a grounder. Mike Marshall flipped him the ball, leading 
him by a couple of strides, and you could see Marshall flinch, realizing that 
he had led Doc by too much. 
</P>
<P>
It was exactly what the Doctor hadn't ordered. But gimpy old Gooden made a 
lunge for the ball, caught it and dragged his right foot across the base, 
retiring the speedy Juan Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
"How old did I look on that play?" Gooden asked. 
</P>
<P>
Old enough that he is definitely no kid anymore. Young enough, however, that 
Dwight Gooden still figures to do a lot of good things for the Mets -- even 
more than Bill Buckner has.

MEXICO TIED, REAL MADRID WINS IN FRONT OF 34,816 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After surprising almost everyone except its own fans by reaching the 
quarterfinals of the 1986 World Cup, Mexico has languished in international 
soccer anonymity, the victim of its own wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Banished from the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul and this summer's World Cup in 
Italy because it used overage players in a world youth tournament, Mexico has 
had little chance to prove itself on the international stage. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly galling for Mexico's fans is the fact that had it not been banned 
by FIFA, the sport's international governing body, Mexico almost certainly 
would have qualified for Italy -- probably at the expense of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, top international players such as Hugo Sanchez and Manuel Negrete have 
to sit on the sideline in June and watch while American youngsters barely out 
of college take part in the sport's quadrennial extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
But Mexico is not wasting its time. Its goals are clear: Qualify for the 1992 
Olympic Games in Barcelona and, above all, qualify for the 1994 World Cup in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, Mexico will have to shake off the rust that has accumulated over the 
past few years. On Tuesday night, in the first match of an exhibition 
doubleheader at the Coliseum, the team looked decidely ordinary in a 1-1 tie 
with F.C. Cologne of the West German Bundesliga in front of a crowd of 34,816. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mexico's goal -- by forward Ricardo Pelaez in the 17th minute -- was more 
the result of hard work than of spectacular play. Mexico, in fact, showed none 
of the flair or inventiveness of which it is capable. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico held on to its advantage until the 71st minute, when a fierce, 20-yard 
shot by Cologne's Andrzej Rudy after an excellent solo run through the defense 
tied the score. The German team was unlucky to not win, in fact, with only a 
snap save by goalkeeper Adrian Chavez thwarting Dario Decoud from close range 
in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Mexico was saving its best for Thursday night, when it will play 
Spanish champion Real Madrid at 9 p.m. in the second match of another Coliseum 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's nightcap, Real Madrid, led, ironically, by Mexican national team 
striker Sanchez, the top goalscorer in the Spanish League for the past five 
years, defeated a Central American all-star team, 2-0, on goals by Adolfo 
Aldana and Alberto Aguila. 
</P>
<P>
In another bit of irony, the Central American all-stars featured the El 
Salvador-born Hugo Perez, inexplicably left off the U.S. World Cup team by 
Coach Bob Gansler, ostensibly because he was deemed to have not yet recovered 
from an injury.

SCHVANEVELDT GETS DASH FOR SPEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD McKINZIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do you give the trainer who seems to have everything in the way of older 
horses? 
</P>
<P>
Why, you give him a two-time national champion who has won 15 of her last 18 
races and has earnings of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Such a horse is the newest addition to the Blane Schvaneveldt stable. National 
champion Dash For Speed arrived at Los Alamitos from Texas on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Considered to be one of the top quarter horse mares to race in the last decade, 
the 5-year-old Dash For Speed has been sent to Los Alamitos this summer with 
one goal -- the 1990 world champion title. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Bob Blakeman and Tom Bradbury, Dash For Speed has won seven Grade I 
stakes and as a 3-year-old became only the second horse in history to sweep the 
Ruidoso Downs series of the Kansas, Rainbow and All American Derbies. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Dash For Speed won eight of nine starts, among them three Grade I 
stakes, and went over $1 million in earnings. But she never has won the world 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It just kills us that this mare has never been world champion," Blakeman said. 
'She has done everything we ever asked of her and we just feel that she 
deserves one last shot to be world champion.' 
</P>
<P>
What cost Dash For Speed the title as a 3-year-old was a disastrous Los 
Alamitos winter campaign, during which she was beaten in both the Grade I 
Breeders Championship Classic and the Grade I Champion of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, with a world championship all but certain, Dash For Speed was once 
again upset in the Breeders Championship Classic and the top honor went to See 
Me Do It. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to run her this summer and then we're going to run at Los Alamitos 
this winter and go after the Breeders Championship Classic and the Champion of 
Champions," Blakeman said. "If she can win those two races, I know she'll be 
world champion." 
</P>
<P>
That the owners of Dash For Speed even have the option to run the mare this 
summer is largely because of the new breeding technology in quarter horse 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
A yearling produced by Dash For Speed would be worth more than $100,000 in 
today's market, but instead of having to choose between racing or retirement to 
the breeding shed, Dash For Speed's owners have taken advantage of embryo 
transfer technology, using a surrogate mare to carry Dash For Speed's foal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this spring, Dash For Speed was bred to the stallion Streakin Six at 
Phillips Ranch in Texas. Shortly afterward, the new embryo was transferred to 
the surrogate mare, which will carry the foal for the full 11-month term and 
give birth next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"She really got here in good shape," Schvaneveldt said of Dash For Cash. "She 
looks ready to run." 
</P>
<P>
The first stop on Dash For Speed's summer schedule will probably be the Grade I 
Anne Burnett Invitational Handicap July 14. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see how she's doing, but that looks like where we'll run her," 
Schvaneveldt said. 
</P>
<P>
Another race that will probably be on Dash For Speed's summer schedule is the 
$100,000 Los Alamitos Championship on July 28. She won't have to look far to 
find her main rival for that Grade I race. 
</P>
<P>
Dashing Val, another 5-year-old Dash For Cash offspring, is stabled right next 
to Dash For Speed in Schvaneveldt's barn and right now he looks to be the best 
older quarter horse in the country. 
</P>
<P>
A winner of the Kaweah Bar Handicap and the Shue Fly Handicap in his first two 
starts of the year, Dashing Val made it three for three when he won the Grade I 
Go Man Go Handicap last Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you'd have to say he's been a nice surprise . . . ," said 
Schvaneveldt, who bought Dashing Val last summer. "I've always thought he was 
fast, and he's really shown it here." 
</P>
<P>
Schvaneveldt said after Dashing Val's victory in the Go Man Go that the colt 
would be freshened until the Los Alamitos Championship, in which he probably 
will race Dash For Speed. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight the trials for the $350,000 Grade I Kindergarten will be held with the 
best 2-year-olds on the grounds competing for the 10 final berths in that 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
The finals of the Kindergarten will be held on June 2 and even though it's 
early in the year, several young horses have established solid credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Caesar Dominguez will send out Bay Meadows Futurity winner Takin on the 
Cash in tonight's trials. A son of Dash For Cash, Takin On The Cash has been 
idle since his April victory in the Bay Meadows Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Bob Baffert has a pair of Kindergarten hopefuls -- fillies Dash For 
Time and Miss Strikin Jet. 
</P>
<P>
Dash For Time was a troubled fourth in the recent Leo Handicap, a race won by 
her stablemate Miss Strikin Jet. 
</P>
<P>
Bloodlines might be on the side of Miss Strikin Jet in the Kindergarten trials. 
The filly is a half-sister of Ourautograph, last year's Kindergarten winner. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Wayne Thompson will send out Four and Two in the trials off an 
impressive recent stakes victory at Los Alamitos.

HORSEMAN'S GROUP OKS FRIDAY NIGHT PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the California Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn. 
overwhelmingly approved Hollywood Park's proposal for four consecutive Friday 
night programs later in the current meeting. 
</P>
<P>
According to Don Robbins, Hollywood Park's general manager, the vote was 2,482 
in favor and 563 against. 
</P>
<P>
This signifies a 28% turnout from the CHBPA members who received ballots, which 
had to be signed in order to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
The next step for Hollywood Park comes today when track representatives will go 
in front of the California Horse Racing's Board's Operations Committee during 
the Board's meeting, which begins at 10 a.m. at the Airport Marriott. 
</P>

ELECTRONIC MAIL STIRS DEBATE ON THE PRIVACY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The proliferation of electronic communications -- from telephone voicemail to 
facsimile machines to computer messages -- is raising new questions of privacy 
that are leading to a growing number of legal disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the mayor of Colorado Springs, Colo., acknowledged that he 
routinely read electronic messages that city council members sent one another 
on city-bought computer terminals installed in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit by a former employee of Torrance-based Epson America is the latest 
action to focus on the privacy rights of employees who send electronic messages 
-- so-called E-mail -- to one another over the company's computer system. 
</P>
<P>
Alana Shoars filed a pair of lawsuits, one in March and another in April, 
charging Epson America and two managers with invasion of privacy under the 
California Penal Code. She alleges in the suits, filed in Superior Court in 
Torrance, that a manager eavesdropped on her private E-mail and that of a 
number of the company's other 700 employees. Shoars contends that she was fired 
after discovering the manager monitoring messages that she assumed were 
confidential. The company denies the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
These and other incidents have raised thorny legal issues dealing with what is 
public and what is private, experts say. They also may undermine public 
confidence in computer technology, which is constantly creating new 
communications services, some fear. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of voicemail -- the sending of voice messages by telephone -- 
computer "hackers" have managed to penetrate some corporate systems and plant 
messages aimed at frightening employees. There have been cases, too, of people 
overhearing their neighbors' supposedly private cellular telephone 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to previous incidents and concerns, Congress in 1986 enacted 
legislation to protect the privacy of users of electronic mail, paging devices, 
cellular mobile telephones and computer transmissions. The ground-breaking 
Electronic Communications Privacy Act gives users of these new forms of 
communications generally the same privacy rights as those granted to those 
using first-class mail. But it focuses mainly on public systems, such as that 
in Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado Springs is one of a number of cities, including Santa Monica, that 
have set up computer-messaging systems. These systems are designed, in part, to 
enable residents to look up public documents and comment on public-policy 
issues from terminals at home or in such public places as municipal libraries 
or city hall. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado Springs also provided terminals to city council members for use in 
their homes. Many of them routinely communicated back and forth through the 
city hall computer -- messages that Mayor Robert Isaac admitted that he 
routinely monitored. 
</P>
<P>
Isaac said he was concerned that some members might be using the system in 
violation of Colorado open-meeting laws. 
</P>
<P>
In the Epson case, Noel Shipman, Shoars' attorney, said his client was employed 
as an electronic mail administrator at the U.S. headquarters of the 
Japanese-owned maker of computer printers. Epson's plants used MCI Mail, one of 
a number of long-distance messaging networks linking millions of computer 
terminals around the world, as its E-Mail system. The confidentiality of MCI 
Mail messages is maintained through use of passwords. 
</P>
<P>
Shipman said Shoars' supervisor at Epson "read and printed thousands of 
confidential messages" sent by the "nearly 700 employees" signed on to the 
system. She said she was fired after she discovered the supervisor monitoring 
messages and, as she put it, "refused to cooperate . . . in his violation of . 
. . privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Shoars was fired Jan. 25 for "gross misconduct and insubordination," according 
to her suits. 
</P>
<P>
Epson, in a statement issued Tuesday, called Shoars' allegations "completely 
without merit" and denied that "the privacy of electronic mail had anything to 
do with Ms. Shoars' termination." Epson filed a motion to dismiss the case, 
which is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Shoars' lawsuit seeks unspecified financial damages. Shipman said a similar 
class-action lawsuit may be filed on behalf of Epson employees.

JAMES FLANIGAN: AT CHRYSLER, IACOCCA SHOULD BLAME HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"For all sad words of tongue or pen," wrote John Greenleaf Whittier, "the 
saddest are these, 'It might have been.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler, is on the public stump again, declaiming 
virtues in Chrysler cars and criticizing shortcomings in Japanese cars -- like 
a baseball manager trying to stir excitement when the team is down. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going through a bad patch here," admits Iacocca in an interview. The 
company that Iacocca and government loan-guarantees brought back from near 
bankruptcy in 1980 is in the midst of both a $1.5-billion cost reduction 
program -- closing plants in Detroit, St. Louis and Kenosha, Wis. -- and a 
five-year, $15-billion investment program, trying to get the products it needs 
to stay in the competitive car business in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the market conditions, I think we're doing a super job. But if people 
are saying 'my God they're in trouble,' and it begins to affect my sales, then 
I have to go out on the stump and say this is bull. That's just red-blooded 
American salesmanship," says Iacocca, 65, the man who launched the Mustang at 
Ford in the 1960s and the minivan at Chrysler in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But Iacocca has himself to blame for Chrysler's dilemma. The $35-billion 
(sales) company doesn't have the cars to compete. Its main line of cars is old 
now, and though it has profitable minivans and Jeeps, it won't have its new LH 
and LX series in the showrooms until August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Honda is bringing out variations on its top-selling Accord, beefing 
up the Acura line and moving to overtake Chrysler in car sales. Other Japanese 
car makers are expanding U.S. production also, while U.S. auto makers are 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Iacocca and Chrysler in the 1980s says a lot about why. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler played to tie, not to win. Instead of reinvesting in the car business 
when its finances had recovered in the mid-80s, the company went on the 
defensive -- along with the other U.S. car makers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had all this money, making $1.5 billion a year after taxes, and we got too 
fat," says Iacocca. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler spent $1 billion to acquire two companies in aerospace-defense -- 
deciding that government business was safer than competing in a crowded car 
market. And it spent another $1.4 billion buying back its own stock. 
</P>
<P>
But now it has sold the bulk of its aerospace holdings to invest again in cars. 
So the question arises: Could those billions in the '80s have been better 
invested in automobiles? 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca's answer seems to say that any effort might have failed, so it was 
better to do nothing: 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to have the LH-LX cars, but you can't do it all at one time. We 
might have thrown in another billion of investment, but that would mean 
doubling the technical staff, hiring engineers I'd later have to lay off and 
expanding my operating budget. It would be gambling that the billion will pay 
off in three or four years," says Iacocca. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Honda, a company with lower sales than all the U.S. car companies, invested 
a greater percentage of its cash in the car business each year than Chrysler. 
Honda honed its manufacturing, and produced multivalve engines -- which 
Chrysler now must develop. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next five years we're going multivalve, so it's not that they invented 
something. It's that they moved fast," says Iacocca, a 44-year veteran of the 
industry who seems bewildered by the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not so much that they're faster on their feet," he says, "it's that 
they seem to have capital available from the great savings pool that we don't 
have in this country." 
</P>
<P>
But Chrysler had capital to spare -- and it used it to buy in stock, providing 
a boon to shareholders and to Iacocca and other Chrysler executives who cashed 
in stock options. Iacocca made $23.6 million in 1986 salary and stock gains. 
The following year he made $17.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I never get defensive about that," he says. Chrysler stock went from under $10 
a share to over $100. (The stock was later split.) "I kept mine to $100," says 
Iacocca. "I'm 65, I sold options, and for a couple of years got a lot of money. 
That's the free enterprise system. What do you want me to do? I made the stock 
go up." 
</P>
<P>
But now the stock is down: It closed Tuesday at $15.875, down from a 1987 high 
of $48 (adjusted for splits). So this is a harder time to make the $3 billion a 
year investments in cars that Chrysler is making. But it has no choice -- 
Japanese car makers have taken a technical lead on the Americans, say analysts 
such as Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton. And Chrysler, smallest of 
the Big Three, is vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Will Chrysler survive? "Oh God yes," says Iacocca, vehemently denying rumors 
that ultimately the company will merge with its joint venture partner 
Mitsubishi. "No way," says Iacocca. "We'd die before we'd sell out to the 
Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
"Chrysler has enough cash flow for three years," says analyst Charles Brady of 
Oppenheimer &amp; Co., and sufficient room to maneuver until it gets its new LH 
line. "Then will come the real test." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iacocca has hinted he may postpone his retirement, currently slated 
for 1991 -- he has to keep the flag flying, and anyway he doesn't want it said 
that he saved the company, made his millions and walked away in time of 
trouble. "Don't count us out," says Iacocca. 
</P>
<P>
But if he had invested more in the car business, Iacocca might already have 
retired in triumph. And Chrysler might not be so vulnerable, and it might not 
be laying off thousands of employees today. The saddest words, as Whittier 
said, it might have been.

MEXICO WILL SEEK FREE TRADE PACT WITH THE U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: PRESIDENT SALINAS WANTS PROVISIONS FOR MIGRATION OF WORKERS. 
BUT SENATORS OPPOSE ANY EUROPEAN-STYLE COMMON MARKET. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will seek a free trade agreement with the 
United States and Canada that includes provisions for migration of workers, he 
told Mexican senators Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks followed Senate recommendations -- based on three weeks of hearings 
-- that Mexico negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States. 
Senators, however, rejected the possibility of a European-style common market 
as a threat to Mexico's sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas listed market access, reciprocity and recognition of the rights of 
Mexican workers in the United States as major components of the Mexican 
negotiating stance in proposed free trade talks. He did not specify the type of 
labor-flow arrangements that Mexico would propose, but he appeared to be 
referring to legal and illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
However, a Western diplomatic source was skeptical that provisions covering 
immigrant labor -- one of the most sensitive issues between the United States 
and Mexico -- could be part of a trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Labor is very difficult to negotiate, even in Europe," he said. "I don't think 
you could get that. (The U.S.) Treasury (Department) favors freer movement of 
labor, but the Labor Department does not." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Mexican officials, including Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra 
Puche, have said they want the subject of labor on the table in any talks with 
the United States, and the Senate agreed. 
</P>
<P>
A free trade agreement "would facilitate the stable and permanent flow of 
Mexican goods and services -- including labor -- into (the United States)," 
Senate President Maximiliano Silerio Esparza told Salinas in presenting results 
of the hearings on international trade strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas requested the hearings, which ended Saturday, after published reports 
here indicated that U.S.-Mexico trade talks were already under way in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's recommendations cleared the way for more intense discussions and a 
possible preliminary agreement when Salinas meets President Bush in Washington 
next month. The senators also called for a transition period to allow Mexican 
industry to adjust and invest to meet the added competition that such an 
agreement would permit. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas said the recommendations resulting from the hearings will provide the 
framework for trade negotiations. "Our relationship with the United States is 
the most complex and difficult, but it also offers the most opportunities," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States accounts for 68% of Mexico's foreign trade, and Mexico ranks 
third among U.S. foreign markets. Mexico is fifth among countries that sell to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship with the United States even figures into Mexico's Pacific Rim 
strategy as outlined by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"Recognizing the symbiotic relationship between the United States and Japan, we 
should be able to insert ourselves in an advantageous way in what will be the 
most important economic relationship of the third millennium," Silerio Esparza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's proximity to the United States should attract more Asian investment 
here, he said. He also urged further development of Mexico's Pacific Coast 
ports and of the Pacific Rim potential of maquiladoras -- factories 
concentrated in the U.S.-Mexico border region that assemble mainly U.S.-made 
components into products aimed at the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican interest in a free-trade agreement was sparked by the country's 
increased emphasis on exporting and the repercussions of the U.S.-Canada 
free-trade agreement, which was signed last October. 
</P>
<P>
A Mexican Commerce Department study found that the U.S.-Canada agreement could 
increase Mexican textile exports by up to $123 million a year and steel exports 
by $17 million annually because Mexico has textile and steel agreements with 
the United States that are likely to give Mexican products entree to Canada. 
However, it indicated, the overall effect on Mexico will be negative because 
Canada and the United States are likely to buy from each other some products 
that they previously bought from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"That is why Mexico must find a mechanism for better access to the U.S. 
market," Serra Puche said in a recent talk with foreign journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Commerce secretary and the Senate report mentioned concerns about 
Mexican companies' access to the U.S. market -- concerns raised this spring 
when Mexican cement makers were accused of dumping their product in the United 
States.

OXY CHIEF DEFENDS FIRM'S FUNDING OF MUSEUM; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: ARMAND HAMMER TELLS SHAREHOLDERS THAT THE OIL COMPANY GAINS GOOD WILL 
FROM HIS ART COLLECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp., on Tuesday defended the 
company's controversial support of a $95-million museum being built to house 
his private art collection. 
</P>
<P>
In response to questions during Occidental's annual shareholders meeting in 
Santa Monica, Hammer said he was donating his collection for the people of Los 
Angeles. "Why am I doing this? One reason: You can't take it with you." The 
line brought laughter from shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
"The second reason is, I think it's good for Occidental," said the 92-year-old, 
apparently healthy chairman. The collection has been seen by millions of people 
on tours around the world, he said, bringing Occidental "a lot of good will, 
and a lot of the things . . . that Occidental has accomplished have been due to 
the good will established by these exhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
The Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, now under construction 
adjacent to Occidental's Westwood headquarters, is scheduled for completion in 
November. Total construction and endowment costs will be about $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the museum continues while a Delaware court mulls a proposed 
settlement of shareholder lawsuits challenging the museum's construction. The 
settlement would limit the museum's construction and financing costs and 
restrict the amount of money Occidental can give to other Hammer charities. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Hammer said an auditorium shelved when costs ballooned could 
now be built as early as next year if private fund-raising efforts succeed. He 
said the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York was working with Occidental on 
expanding the new museum's bookstore as a way to raise money for the 
auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that he had "irrevocably deeded" ownership of his 
$400-million art collection to the controversial museum that will bear his name 
and that is being paid for by Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer signed an agreement to transfer ownership of his collections to the 
museum upon his death, an Occidental spokesman said. Until then, the art will 
be exhibited in the museum once it opens, but Hammer will retain ownership. The 
collections include paintings by old masters and notebooks of Leonardo da 
Vinci. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, questions about the art's ownership and provenance have arisen 
during court challenges to the museum's construction, with documents disclosing 
that Occidental, not Hammer, paid for significant portions of the collections.

HEARST, SOVIETS MAY JOINTLY PUBLISH NEWSPAPER 
</P>

Hearst Corp. and the Soviet government's Izvestia newspaper are in the early 
stages of a joint newspaper-publishing venture that they hope will bring the 
first Western-style newspaper to average Soviet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists for both organizations are now putting together in Washington a 
test issue of a weekly paper that is to be published in English in the United 
States and in Russian in the Soviet Union. The paper will include Western-style 
analyses of Soviet and American government policy, as well as lifestyle 
features and stories on sports, business, entertainment, fashion and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
The paper, to be called We, will also offer editorials and cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an attempt to find the outer limits of glasnost -- to get around the 
Cold War barriers that kept outside opinions from reaching the average 
Soviets," said John Wallach, Washington-based foreign editor of Hearst 
Newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The journalists may find out how much criticism the Soviet government will 
abide in the test issue, which is due to be published July 4 in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
The issue will include a harsh commentary by Zbigniew Brzezinski, a longtime 
critic of Soviet governments, on what President Mikhail S. Gorbachev must do 
for his country to win full international acceptance. Also featured will be an 
analysis of the Soviet Union's AIDS problem that contradicts the Soviet 
government's assertion that the disease is nearly nonexistent in the U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
Other articles will explore the crime problems of Moscow and Washington and 
enumerate the most common public gripes about Gorbachev and President Bush in 
their respective countries. The American and Soviet journalists are also 
planning a feature that will list some of the best restaurants in Moscow, with 
addresses and phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the Soviet capital often find it difficult to locate such 
restaurants, Wallach said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the journalists from Izvestia have not been shy about selecting 
stories, cartoons and comics that criticize their government and the state of 
affairs in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 copies of the test issue will be distributed to leaders of 
government, business and education in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Washington and 
other U.S. cities. The paper will be full-color and standard size. 
</P>
<P>
Officials stressed that the venture is in a very preliminary stage, noting that 
the Soviets' only commitment so far is a letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
The venture is not expected to make money for some time, Wallach said, but 
officials of the privately held Hearst believe that it can ultimately prove 
profitable. The company hopes to sell advertising to U.S. firms that are 
seeking to do business in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Several American magazine companies, including Time and Reader's Digest, are 
now trying to put together joint ventures to distribute magazines in the 
U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Sergei Dardykin, deputy foreign minister of Izvestia, said the 
venture was the first time "when we, together, have the opportunity to publish 
a newspaper that we hope will be trusted by both American and Soviet readers."

DOW RISES 7.55, AIDED BY DIP IN INTEREST RATES 
</P>

<P>
Fresh declines in interest rates and a late buying surge helped the stock 
market extend its spring rally Tuesday, propelling the Dow Jones industrial 
index to its fifth record high in the past seven trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which climbed 24.77 points to an 
all-time high Monday, gained 7.55 points to set another record -- 2,852.23. 
</P>
<P>
Chances of another advance were in doubt at midday as profit taking eroded a 
strong early rally, but buyers appeared in the last 30 minutes to give the 
market a lift. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered losers by 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of New York 
Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 816 up, 689 down and 501 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume surged to 203.35 million shares from Monday's 166.28 million. 
</P>
<P>
The market got an early lift from declining interest rates and a strong 
performance on stock markets in Tokyo and London. 
</P>
<P>
After the market opened, the Dow Jones industrials surged nearly 26 points in 
the first half hour before stalling. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, the average was slightly below Monday's close, and it drifted in 
negative territory most of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"There was probably a little too much exuberance at the beginning," said Newton 
Zinder, a market analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Raftery, vice president for technical research at Smith Barney &amp; Co., 
added at midday, "This is perfectly normal profit taking." 
</P>
<P>
The stock market has rolled up impressive gains the past three weeks in a rally 
attributed mainly to declines in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Declining rates help stocks by making the potential rewards on them more 
appealing than yields on fixed-income investments. Lower rates also can improve 
the profit outlook for some companies by cutting their borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some market watchers expect a correction in the stock market that 
will drive prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
Even small declines in stock prices appeared to draw out buying interest in the 
last 30 minutes of the session, lifting the market higher. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows that even modest price discounts are being met by anxious buyers who 
have missed this three-week old rally -- and short sellers," said Alfred E. 
Goldman, director of technical market analysis at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Short-sellers are traders who establish positions based on the presumption that 
prices will fall; they are drawn into the market as buyers when it becomes 
clear that they have bet wrong and have to settle their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Nova Corp. of Alberta, Canada, 
which fell 3/8 to 7 following a 1/2-point gain in active dealing Monday. The 
company said Monday it was selling its rubber division. 
</P>
<P>
Computer Associates International fell 3/8 to 15 1/2 after reporting earnings 
results that disappointed some analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Among widely held stocks, Philip Morris rose 1/2 to 45, American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph lost 1/4 to 43 1/8 and International Business Machines was up 
3/4 to 117 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Express tumbled 5 1/8 to 47 amid apparent disappointment over April 
volume figures released late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed up as a stronger yen helped the market regain ground 
lost in the morning. But analysts were still worried about the near-term trend. 
The 225-share Nikkei average rose 173.25 points to 31,938.30. 
</P>
<P>
Strong buying interest propelled shares sharply higher in active trading on 
London's stock exchange. The Financial Times 100-share index closed up 29.2 
points at 2,311.3. 
</P>

Foreign Purchases Boost Bond Prices 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices snapped a three-day lull, strengthened by foreign buying and a news 
report that suggested the yawning federal deficit might not be so intractable. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond, a closely followed barometer of the market's mood, 
rose more than $8 per $1,000 in face amount, its first big advance since last 
Wednesday. The bond's yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 8.60% 
from 8.68% the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Bond strategists attributed the market's rise partly to evidence of significant 
purchases of intermediate-maturity Treasuries by foreigners. Some reckoned that 
the buyers were oil-producing Persian Gulf countries looking for safe ways to 
put pools of cash to work. 
</P>
<P>
Others said the market rallied on a report in the Chicago Tribune that several 
federal agencies had amassed $50 billion in unspent appropriations, which 
presumably could be used to narrow the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.188%, unchanged from late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Goes Higher; Mark Still Reeling 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained ground against most other currencies, particularly the West 
German mark, which remained under pressure as a result of growing political 
discord over plans to reunite with East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the dollar benefited from continued weakness in the mark 
related to concern about the future of the reunification plan. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose in Europe to 1.6685 West German marks from 1.6630 Monday and to 
1.67315 marks in New York from 1.66245.

</P>
<P>
Cocoa Futures Hit a 14-Month High 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa futures prices seesawed to a 14-month high on New York's Coffee, Sugar 
and Cocoa Exchange amid mounting fears of supply disruptions from the Ivory 
Coast, the world's largest producer. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, precious metal futures rose; copper advanced; 
grains and soybeans were mostly lower; energy futures were mixed, and livestock 
and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa futures settled $39 to $45 higher, with the contract for delivery in July 
at $1,491 a ton.

BANK INSURANCE FUND FALLS AGAIN, FDIC SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: THE SECOND STRAIGHT ANNUAL DROP LEAVES THE RESERVE AT ABOUT HALF THE 
LEVEL REQUIRED BY LAW.

<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Tuesday that its bank insurance fund, 
which insures 13,200 banks, fell for the second consecutive year to about half 
the level the law requires. 
</P>
<P>
The fund that backs up the nation's federally insured bank deposits declined by 
$851 million in 1989 to $13.2 billion, when 207 banks failed or required 
government assistance to remain open, the FDIC said in a preliminary, unaudited 
financial report. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 loss was down from a $4.24-billion loss in 1988 when a post-Depression 
record of 221 banks failed. 
</P>
<P>
While last year's loss was less severe than the 1988 drop, the report said "the 
continued high level of closed or assisted banks is having a detrimental impact 
on the fund," which insures all bank deposits up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The fund's $13.2-billion level at year-end represented 0.7% of the value of all 
insured bank deposits, a little more than half the 1.25% level required by the 
savings and loan bailout law enacted last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The loss results because the FDIC was forced to pay more to take over the 
failed banks than it received in insurance premiums paid by healthy banks. 
</P>
<P>
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman predicted that the bank insurance fund could 
return to profitability this year if it is not forced to take over any large 
banking institution. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the bank fund declined in 1989, the drop was considerably less severe 
than the previous year," Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
A heavy blow to the fund in 1989 occurred with the failure of MCorp. Regulators 
have estimated that the failure of the Dallas-based bank holding company could 
end up costing $2 billion, making it the second costliest bank failure in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman predicted that bank failures could decline to 150 to 175 this year, 
still a large number compared to the 10 bank failures in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said his forecast was a very rough estimate based on the rate banks 
have been failing so far. 
</P>
<P>
"Much depends on future interest rates and future real estate markets," he told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
A financial institution becomes insolvent when the value of its assets, 
primarily in the form of loans it makes, drops below the level of its 
liabilities, represented by its customers' deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the back-to-back losses, analysts said they believed that the FDIC 
would be able to escape the sort of trouble that befell the Federal Savings and 
Loan Insurance Corp., the sister fund set up to insure deposits at savings and 
loan institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the record number of S&amp;L failures, the FSLIC became insolvent, 
requiring the government to step in with the costliest bailout in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution said the FDIC situation deserves 
close attention to keep it from escalating into another S&amp;L crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The key lesson we learned is don't delay," he said. "The thrift crisis got out 
of hand because Congress and the regulators did not act."

Seattle-First National Bank will begin Saturday to dispense postage stamps at 
its automated teller machines -- a move that will spark increased interest in 
the future of ATMs as a source of products other than cash. 
</P>
<P>
If the highly touted joint venture between Seattle-First and the U.S. Postal 
Service proves successful, it may open doors for similar efforts across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, banks and other institutions have made a variety of efforts to 
branch into products besides cash at ATMs. Products being tested include movie 
tickets, coupons, ski-lift tickets and other items that can be tailored to the 
size and thickness of currency.

EX-EDITOR SUES TO DISPUTE FIRING BY WALL ST. JOURNAL

<P>
A former editor for the Wall Street Journal sued the paper Tuesday for $12.64 
million, claiming that he was fired and his reputation smeared by a false 
charge of plagiarism. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Kandell, the Journal's assistant foreign editor before his dismissal 
May 2, also demanded the return of original notes and other documents that he 
contended the paper's editors had kept, knowing that they would support his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal fired Kandell, 43, after accusing him of lifting uncredited 
material from another writer's book for a Page 1 story about three private 
entrepreneurs in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Kandell quoted Paul Steiger, deputy managing editor of the Journal, as having 
said his alleged offense was "the most serious transgression to take place at 
the Journal since the Foster Winans case." R. Foster Winans was convicted in 
1985 of using his position as a Wall Street Journal columnist to profit from 
insider stock trading information. 
</P>
<P>
In his lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Kandell contends 
that he was libeled and his professional reputation destroyed by the Journal. 
He demanded $10 million in punitive damages and $2.64 million in compensation 
for "willful, wanton and reckless disregard of the truth" and "actual malice" 
on the paper's part. 
</P>
<P>
He said the libel was contained in a letter of apology that the newspaper sent 
to the author of a book dealing with the same subject and in a subsequent 
article in the weekly newspaper Village Voice about Kandell's case. The Voice 
was not named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Roger May, a spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Co., owner of the Journal, said, 
"Dow Jones believes the suit is utterly without merit, and the company intends 
to defend itself vigorously." 
</P>
<P>
Kandell's article, in the March 30 edition of the Journal, profiled a Soviet 
machine tool maker, a Czechoslovak inventor and a Hungarian banker as examples 
of individuals succeeding in the private sector. Kandell said he based the 
story on interviews with the three individuals in their countries after hearing 
them speak at a meeting in New York last November, sponsored by the Council on 
Foreign Relations. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, at the same meeting, he also learned of a book, "Communist 
Entrepreneurs," and met the author, John W. Kiser III. He said he later "read 
the book once and put it aside." 
</P>
<P>
Kandell's suit said he told Steiger and senior editor Barney Calame that he 
hadn't relied on Kiser's book and hadn't credited it because he had "done all 
his own legwork and the book was not where he had first learned of the 
subject." 
</P>
<P>
On May 1, Kandell said, the editors told him that they had decided he should 
have mentioned Kiser's book in the article "but emphasized that it was a 
judgment call." Later that same day, Kandell said, he learned he was to be 
fired. He quoted Steiger as saying he had shown a "lack of candor" and his 
replies to questions had left him (Steiger) "with a gut feeling that I had not 
been truthful." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was dismissed the next day, effective immediately, after consulting 
with his lawyer and refusing to sign a letter of resignation that he said would 
have kept him on the Journal's payroll through June 30.

contrasted with earnings of $5.6 million for the comparable year-earlier 
period. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 figure included an extraordinary gain of $5.5 million resulting from 
the company's reorganization plan. Revenue rose 47% to $2.2 million from $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent P. Williams, president and chief executive, said the earnings loss 
resulted from insufficient liquidity to purchase certain parts and services 
needed to assemble and ship products, higher operating expenses and the cost of 
two acquisitions made during the second quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The improved revenue resulted from the contributions of the acquired firms.

REGULATORS AGREE TO SELL LINCOLN S&amp;L STAKE IN TCS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regulators running insolvent Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan have agreed to sell the 
Irvine thrift's stake in TCS Enterprises back to the San Diego 
financial-services firm for 30% of the original price, the company's chairman 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Lincoln's former parent company immediately criticized 
regulators for selling too cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
TCS will pay $1.50 a share -- $867,000 in all -- to buy back the 20% interest 
that Lincoln acquired in January, 1985. The original purchase price was $5 a 
share, or nearly $2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas C. Stickel, chairman and chief executive of the firm that bears his 
initials, said regulators rejected his offer to pay the S&amp;L the original 
purchase price because the terms included payment over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The RTC wanted a cash offer, which we eventually settled upon at $1.50 per 
share," Stickel said in a prepared statement. He could not be reached for 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
RTC executives also could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great deal for TCS and a terrible deal for the taxpayers," said 
Bradley J. Boland, a spokesman for American Continental Corp. in Phoenix. The 
company owned Lincoln when regulators seized the thrift on April 14, 1989. 
"This is another example of how the taxpayers are being pillaged by the federal 
government's incompetence and inability to maximize values for Lincoln's 
assets," Boland said. 
</P>
<P>
TCS is the company that hired Lawrence W. Taggart in late 1984 from his job as 
commissioner of the state Department of Savings and Loan. It was Taggart who 
introduced Stickel to Charles H. Keating Jr., American Continental's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
While TCS has been profitable since Lincoln's investment, it is expected to 
announce soon substantially lower earnings for its fiscal second quarter, which 
ended April 30. TCS recently has been losing money on a mortgage-packaging 
arrangement with Great American Bank, a San Diego savings and loan that has 
been crippled by its Arizona real estate operations.

GOLDMAN, SACHS SOUGHT BY UAL UNIONS TO AID BUYOUT

UAL Corp.'s three unions are seeking to hire investment bank Goldman, Sachs 
&amp; Co. to assist them in financing their $4.4-billion bid for the airline 
company, a spokesman for the unions said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the move appears to be an admission that the unions, UAL's 
machinists, pilots and flight attendants, are having difficulty lining up bank 
financing with their existing advisers, Salomon Bros. Inc. and Keilin &amp; 
Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Financing for the deal is being watched closely because a $6.8-billion bid by 
UAL's management and pilots collapsed last October when the group could not 
persuade banks to lend for that deal, prompting a 190-point plunge in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The latest bid, which was approved by UAL's board in early April, offers a 
combination of cash and securities with a total face value of $201 a share for 
the parent of United Airlines, the second-largest U.S. carrier. 
</P>
<P>
"The unions have had talks with Goldman; those discussions are continuing and 
the intention is that Goldman would complement Salomon, not replace them," a 
spokesman for the unions said, adding that no agreement has yet been reached.

ALICE KAHN: THE FACE OF RACISM, THEN AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I first became aware of having a mind, three voices were speaking in it. 
One was world-weary Holden Caulfield. Another was hopeful Anne Frank. The third 
was John Howard Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
You may not remember Griffin's name, but if you were coming of age around the 
year 1960, you certainly saw his work. He wrote a seven-part series for Sepia 
magazine called "Journey Into Shame." The series was syndicated in newspapers 
across the country and eventually published as a book called "Black Like Me." 
</P>
<P>
I don't really remember reading newspapers before "Journey Into Shame" was 
published. I think I just looked at the cartoons and the advice columns, as my 
kids do now. But when I read the premise of the story in the Sunday supplement, 
I got hooked. A white man using pills, skin dyes and ultraviolet treatment had 
made his skin black. Changing nothing else about himself, he journeyed through 
Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama and reported on his experiences. That was 
during an era of drive-by lynchings. 
</P>
<P>
It made for compelling reading. In the hands of a lesser writer, the whole 
thing might have been just a journalistic stunt. But like Holden and Anne, 
Griffin's highly personal voice seemed to speak for all thoughtful people. John 
Howard Griffin woke many of us up to the injustice and violence in America. He 
made us ask: What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
For his efforts, Griffin was run out of the Texas town where he lived with his 
wife and young children by repeated threats of "castration." 
</P>
<P>
I recently decided to reread "Black Like Me." Perhaps to remember a time when I 
believed racism would be conquered. Perhaps to feel nostalgic for a time when 
racism seemed to be a problem confined to the South -- before I knew about 
Nazis in San Francisco, cross-burnings in suburbia and hate literature at our 
elite universities. Before the baseball bat became the weapon of choice in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
Another motivation has been having those why-do-they-hate-us talks with my 
children. As my children become aware of black anger, they can't understand 
what they have done to deserve it. Recently, one of my daughters described 
perfectly something I remembered from "Black Like Me." It was a description of 
the "hate stare," the hostile glaring look a stranger gives you based solely on 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin also knew that the hate stare worked both ways. Toward the end of 
"Black Like Me," when his skin turned white again, he described walking down a 
street in a "Negro" section of Montgomery, and "I, the white man, got from the 
Negro the same shriveling treatment I, the Negro, had got from the white man. I 
thought, 'Why me?' " 
</P>
<P>
After reading "Black Like Me" the first time, like the millions of others who 
read it, I vowed that the injustice would stop, that I would do something about 
it. Some things did change. But when you look at the black male death rate, the 
black infant mortality rate, the black-on-black crime rate, conditions of the 
underclass -- it's hard to feel that life has become more fair. 
</P>
<P>
Today we seem bogged down in petty fights about semantics, about rap lyrics, 
about who is really a racist. We are divided by defensiveness. I wonder, if 
Griffin wrote his book today, if someone wouldn't find some way to call him a 
"racist" for it. 
</P>
<P>
I no longer think about what I can do to right the wrongs. I think more about 
how I'd better be oh, so careful of what I say and how I say it. I'd better not 
even write about race. Otherwise, I could spend the rest of my life writing 
columns about how I'm not white like them.

GIRLS CLUBS OF PASADENA PROVIDES DAY CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to your article concerning day-care centers (Times, 
May 2). The article did not provide a complete description of day-care centers 
in Pasadena. Girls Clubs of Pasadena Inc. would like to expand the information 
given about its position and its services. 
</P>
<P>
We operate two fully licensed preschools; however, you only mentioned the 
center located in Northwest Pasadena. The Girls Clubs operates a second center 
at our main branch located at 3160 E. Del Mar Blvd. This facility has a full 
enrollment with a waiting list. We are in the process of expanding this 
facility in order to become licensed to accommodate 12 additional children. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, we only charge $60 a week per child with siblings receiving a 
reduced rate. We also have a sliding scale. We receive no government funding. 
</P>
<P>
Our fully licensed centers provide an age-appropriate curriculum, teaching 
early childhood development and stressing self-esteem. Our teachers are fully 
qualified in early childhood education. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major community needs is half-day care for kindergartners who only 
attend school a few hours each day. The Girls Clubs of Pasadena Day Care 
Centers are ready to provide this service immediately at the North Branch, 
charging $30 per child per week for half-day care. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Boys Club, Girls Clubs of Pasadena relied heavily on the surveys 
conducted by the city of Pasadena. It was felt that many of the children would 
be those whose mothers were enrolled in the Gain Program. Unfortunately, this 
program has not developed as first indicated. However, we still believe that 
the need for safe, affordable and nurturing child care is needed in the 
Northwest area of Pasadena. The problem is how to get the funds necessary for 
the children to attend these much-needed programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Girls Clubs' objective is to never have to turn away any child. But like 
any organization -- whether nonprofit or for-profit -- the bills have to be 
paid. We definitely feel that we have one of the most affordable, quality 
preschool programs in the area and that our rates are at the subsidized level. 
</P>
<P>
We would greatly appreciate having a more complete article written about our 
preschool program.

ADOBE FLORES IS A STILL WORTHWHILE HISTORICAL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was delighted to see the in-depth article on our historic adobe ("Historic 
Adobe Flores . . . " by Loretta Schertz Keller, Times, May 16), and I have been 
very pleased with the loving care (owner) Mr. (Wallace Robert) McCloskey has 
given the house. 
</P>
<P>
How well I remember the day the large azaleas were ripped out and carted away 
before the groundbreaking for the new apartments. 
</P>
<P>
A tearful spectacle and one that few neighbors were alerted about, and those 
who were didn't spread the word about the disastrous happening about to take 
place. A time when an insensitive mayor and City Council could have stepped in 
to save the site, or at least the house, for the city of South Pasadena. (I 
would like to note that (a portion of) the cactus garden of rare specimens is 
city owned.) 
</P>
<P>
It's important, too, to realize that although the "site's historical value was 
destroyed by surrounding construction," the house and cactus garden in no way 
have lost their importance as a historical monument, and many of us have the 
dream that one day it will belong to the city, to be enjoyed and seen by the 
public on a regular basis.

STAGE REVIEW;

<P>
STILL KICKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is an indestructible mystique that hangs like a shroud about Michael 
Bennett's "A Chorus Line." Aside from this show's ultimate celebration of the 
Broadway gypsy, it has become its primary creator's ultimate legacy. The two 
are inseparable. And thoughts of Bennett -- of the magnitude of the loss 
suffered by the theater community in his premature death of AIDS in 1987 -- 
were the first to well up through the opening bars of the new Los Angeles 
production of "A Chorus Line" that opened Monday at the Las Palmas Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"A Chorus Line" has always been bittersweet and sentimental about its own. But 
the fact that it kicked off at Joe Papp's Public Theatre in New York on April 
16, 1975, before moving to Broadway and running there undimmed for 15 years -- 
an unprecedented 6,137 performances -- surviving Bennett, book writer James 
Kirkwood and lyricist Edward Kleban, has made it elegiac. 
</P>
<P>
It has become a tribute to all of Broadway's late masters: Bennett, Bob Fosse, 
Gower Champion (who early in his career staged "Lend an Ear" at the Las Palmas, 
introducing the world to a then-newcomer named Carol Channing). Like it or not, 
the ghosts are in the room. They were all there Monday, augmenting the 
production with their reverberations. 
</P>
<P>
For those who come to "A Chorus Line" without baggage from the past, this show 
is what it always was: A paean to those valiant, anonymous members of the 
chorus line, willing to endure the shortest careers in show business, working 
the hardest under severest stress, and to come out of it saying that "What I 
Did For Love" was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
Can there be anyone out there who doesn't know the non-plot of "A Chorus Line"? 
</P>
<P>
In that unlikely event, it is the sassy, defiant, sad, cocky, salubrious and 
remarkably sane individual stories of dancers Cassie (Janet Eilber) and Val 
(Suzanne Harrer) and Sheila (Lynn Rose) and Paul (Wayne Meledandri) and Mike 
(Lloyd Gordon) and Al (Michael Albert Simms) and Kristine (K. Dawn Owens) and 
Connie (Kim Ima) and Diana (Elise Hernandez) and others, auditioning for a 
brusque director/choreographer named Zach (Joseph Malone) who is asking rude 
questions: What made them become dancers? Who is the person behind the resume? 
</P>
<P>
Simple as that. Yes, but terse, eloquent, funny and, underneath it all, 
ineffably wistful. "A Chorus Line" has become an icon -- the national anthem of 
musicals. We've absorbed that serendipitous Marvin Hamlisch score through the 
pores and experienced that "one singular sensation" at the first utterance of 
"And a six, seven, eight. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
All of this emotional programming is in the new Steve Bellin/Danny Taylor 
"Chorus Line" at the Las Palmas. 
</P>
<P>
And if at first the moves seemed a bit tentative Monday, and the orchestra 
timid, it soon gathered momentum. There is the underlying feeling that the 
company has not been together long enough to develop the polished ensemble this 
show demands, but given some staying power, those rough edges should smooth 
out. 
</P>
<P>
The star turns are impressive, starting with Gordon's gymnastic "I Can Do 
That," moving right along to Simms' and Owens' comic duet, "Sing!," and coming 
to a compelling stop at "Nothing" by the vocally strong Hernandez and at 
Harrer's rousing and saucy "Dance: Ten; Looks: Three." 
</P>
<P>
Yet of all the actor/dancers, it is Meledandri as Paul (a role he also played 
on Broadway) who delivers the most accomplished performance. He has a fluid 
grace, eloquently matched by the dignity of his tortured confessional. In this 
regard, Malone's aphoristic Zach is forceful counterpoint -- a driving voice 
calling out orders from the back of the room, but capable of subtle inflections 
between lines. 
</P>
<P>
This is especially true in the confrontational scenes with Cassie, the former 
girlfriend who left him without explanation. Hers is a role that has always 
seemed a set-up impossible to live up to. Eilber doesn't avoid its pitfalls, 
delivering a dance that's more stressed and choppy than smooth. 
</P>
<P>
As always, it is Sheila, the cynical "adult" of the bunch, who dishes out the 
best lines, and Rose makes up for a weak singing voice with a languorous skill 
for displaying her willowy frame and raising other people's eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
The set by Gimmicks, Unlimited, faithfully re-creates the bare stage and 
mirrored periaktoi of the original, and the costumes imitate Theoni V. 
Aldredge's original ones. Dramaturgically, the weakest scene is still the 
spoken one that precedes "What I Did For Love," which remains a helluva lead-in 
to the soaring finale: "One." 
</P>
<P>
"A Chorus Line" is in a class by itself, uniquely conceived and created. And 
this new production delivers its full emotional punch, if not always the full 
physical prowess to match it. 
</P>

GARAGE SALE SAVVY; 
</P>
<P>
SMART SELLERS CHECK LIABILITY INSURANCE, LOCAL LAWS BEFORE HOLDING YARD SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring cleaning got you thinking about putting on a garage sale? Before you set 
up shop, better check with your insurance agent to ensure you have adequate 
liability insurance in case a visitor is injured while browsing through your 
sale items. 
</P>
<P>
"The individual consumer is usually covered with liability -- most insurance 
policies have some liability coverage, and homeowner policies have it as an 
automatic matter, of course," said David Crocker, area manager of the Western 
Insurance Information Service, a nonprofit consumer education group that serves 
10 western states. "But in such a sue-happy society, they'd be well-advised to 
make sure of their coverage." 
</P>
<P>
An average homeowner policy includes liability coverage of $100,000, Crocker 
said. But "for some people, $1 million isn't enough." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers who are "just getting rid of stuff from spring cleaning, chances are 
they won't have to buy extra coverage," Crocker said. "But if it's a regular 
thing -- a lot of people have a garage sale every Saturday -- then the insurer 
might consider it a commercial venture. If you have strangers coming on your 
property every weekend, you just have a higher risk that someone will slip and 
fall or cut themselves." 
</P>
<P>
If you live in the city of Los Angeles, holding garage or yard sales too 
frequently also can run you afoul of local government. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles municipal code, for example, says an individual can conduct 
only three garage sales a year at the same site -- more often than that and 
you're violating the code. But policing garage sales is difficult, a 
spokeswoman at the city clerk's office admitted. 
</P>
<P>
If consumers conduct sales too frequently and are "going to make a business of 
it, then they have to have a commercial permit," said Lisa Adea of the City 
Clerk's tax and permit division. That means you have to have a retail sale 
license, which costs $100.78 a year and is renewable annually on Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
No license for garage sales is required by Los Angeles County, whether you have 
one a year or 365 of them, a spokeswoman for the county's licensing section 
said. But it might be wise to check with your city's clerk or police to see if 
city permits are required. 
</P>
<P>
As for insurers, if presented with just one injury at an infrequent yard or 
garage sale, "I think an insurance company would probably go ahead and pay one 
claim, but if they found out you're doing it every week, that would be running 
a business and they'd insist on a commercial package policy," said Dave 
Bentley, a Torrance insurance agent. "Commercial insurance for liability can 
get quite expensive -- $1,000 to $1,500." 
</P>
<P>
If you're planning to rent space to sell items at a swap meet or flea market, 
your homeowner liability coverage will not apply. You'll need separate 
coverage, either purchased through the organizers of the meet or your own 
insurer. 
</P>
<P>
"Swap meet coverage would be about $1,500," Bentley estimated, but added: "The 
people who run the swap meet usually cover the individual vendor." 
</P>
<P>
If you and your neighbors get together once a year for a combined sale, you 
probably will be covered under your or their homeowner policies, Crocker said. 
Or, if you're running a sale to benefit a charity, say a church, then any 
accidents are "likely to be covered under its own insurance policy," said 
Crocker. 
</P>
<P>
Now that you've gotten the insurance questions settled, you should follow basic 
garage sale tips from experts: 
</P>
<P>
Set the date and give yourself at least three weeks to prepare. Avoid holiday 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Limit your sale to two days. Most items will sell on Saturday. If you really 
want to get rid of the stuff, lower prices to rock bottom on things left by 
mid-afternoon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on your budget, advertise in your local paper or the free 
neighborhood circulars. Newspaper ads mainly will attract garage sale regulars. 
The most effective way to get the word out for drive-by customers is to put up 
big, easy-to-read signs around the neighborhood a few days before the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Mahakian and Thelma Jackson of Hollywood, who held a successful dual 
sale last weekend, stressed the importance of having good street signs with 
directions to your house. 
</P>
<P>
"We did very well, and I think it was a combination of good signing -- people 
said our signs were quite complete -- and the right prices," Mahakian said. 
"People come to garage sales looking for bargains." 
</P>
<P>
Bargains or not, you should try to price sale items realistically. Be sure, 
too, that you know what you're selling; a Depression-era glass vase, for 
example, may not be your cup of tea, but it surely will be worth more than a 
few dollars. Check prices at antique shops if you have a question about an 
item's worth. 
</P>
<P>
Schedule your sale as early as possible. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to try a civilized hour such as 9 a.m., be prepared for the first 
customers to arrive a lot earlier: Most garage-sale junkies believe the "early 
bird gets the worm" and may arrive at your door at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
If you advertise your sale in the paper, Mahakian advised, expect antique 
dealers to show up the day before to try to snap up bargains. 
</P>
<P>
Organize items in groups and set up tables to display them on. People seem to 
feel items on the ground are cheaper. Spruce up sale items by washing or 
dusting them. If you have clothing, hang it rather than boxing it. 
</P>
<P>
To dispose of items you really don't want to haggle about, put them in a box 
marked "Everything here is $1." 
</P>
<P>
Make sure you have plenty of $1, $5 and $10 bills, as well as coins, to make 
change. 
</P>
<P>
To make it easier for appliance buyers, have an outlet available so they can 
make sure electric appliances work. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the sale is over, take down your street ads. 
</P>
<P>
Your neighbor may need the space next weekend.

FONDA GETS GOLDA MEIR AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Photographers wanted to photograph Jane Fonda. The press wanted to talk to her. 
The guests wanted to meet her and be photographed with her and be interviewed 
with her. 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked designer Arnold Scaasi if he knew her. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know Jane," said Scaasi, slowly surveying the human beehive that 
buzzed around the star, "but she's very busy." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Fonda had flown in to Los Angeles Monday morning to accept the 1990 
Golda Meir Fellowship award from the Women's Committee, Builders of Scopus of 
Hebrew University, for her public service works, as well as her work in the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
The award was given to her at a luncheon and Scaasi fashion show at the Regent 
Beverly Wilshire hotel that drew about 350 people -- almost all women -- to the 
hotel's ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
Too rushed to slip into her usual Versace ensemble, Fonda wore an unwrinkled 
sage green pantsuit, black tank top, black pumps and a silver and turquoise 
necklace. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the work they're doing at Hebrew University, educating the immigrants 
coming to Israel from the Soviet Union, is fantastic," said Fonda during a 
brief media free-for-all that had most of the guests peering across the room at 
the commotion while sipping coffee and cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
In an unprepared speech, she spoke extensively of her work in trying to free 
Ida Nudel, a Jewish Soviet refusenik and economist who, after exile in Siberia, 
was finally allowed to emigrate to Israel in 1987. Fonda had traveled to the 
Soviet Union in 1984 to meet with Nudel in a collaborative effort to free her. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what she got out of our meeting," Fonda continued, "but I know 
what I got out of it; one of the things I learned from her was never give up. 
Nothing is impossible. . . . For years after I left the Soviet Union she kept 
speaking out, and putting herself in danger. I still didn't believe it would 
ever happen, but she knew it would. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks not to me, but to Armand Hammer, and to you, she is now in Israel. 
That's what's so beautiful -- it's never one famous person in Hollywood who's 
responsible. It's because there's an international movement of people who are 
concerned about the plight of Soviet Jews." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the lunch (individual tickets were $500) will fund 150 Golda Meir 
Fellows at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the Israeli counterparts of Rhodes 
and Fulbright scholars. 
</P>
<P>
Fonda's speech was followed by a showing of the fall 1990 Scaasi fashions. 
</P>
<P>
In the audience (watching models slink down the runway wearing 
Dalmatian-spotted coats and holding Dalmatian dogs on leashes) were women's 
committee chairman Marilynn Gersten; luncheon chairmen Della Koenig, Leona 
Palmer and Wendy Goldberg; honorary chairman Barbara Davis (with daughter Nancy 
Zarif), and 1985 fellowship award winner Jane Morgan Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
Also: Jane Seymour, Cyd Charisse, Constance Towers, Rosemarie Stack, Lee 
Minnelli, Eva Gabor, Jill St. John, Cecilia Peck and Lillian Silbert.

FOR HAMMER, A CANCAN AND DO BIRTHDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been a pretty good year, as far as Dr. Armand Hammer is concerned. The 
Berlin Wall crumbled, and he's looking forward to the upcoming summit between 
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that he feels is going to 
signal "the beginning of getting rid of nuclear weapons," as well as bringing 
the two countries together. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have capitalism and socialism working together. Now," he added, "all 
I've got to do is get rid of cancer." He will, naturally, be in Washington for 
the summit on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the man's only 92. 
</P>
<P>
Some 200 friends of the physician/art collector/diplomat/Occidental Petroleum 
chairman gathered Monday night to put another candle on his multitiered 
birthday cake. The annual ritual, which combined old-friend camaraderie, some 
Borscht-Belt shtick from emcee Danny Thomas, Jane Morgan Weintraub sweetly 
singing "Happy Birthday to You" and themed entertainment, took place at a 
black-tie dinner at the Beverly Hills hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The theme was the Gay Nineties. Birthday 92 was carried out with cancan girls, 
feathered fans for the women and corncob pipes and hats for the men, a 
barbershop quartet and tables decorated with Victorian lamp centerpieces. 
</P>
<P>
Guests filtered in to a cocktail reception and had their pictures taken in a 
Victorian setting with red velvet banquettes, red and gold tasseled curtains, 
feathered boas, fans, hats and the cancan girls as accessories if desired. 
</P>
<P>
Well-wishers included Barbara and Marvin Davis, Merv Adelson, Sherry Lansing 
and David Niven Jr., Archbishop Roger Mahony, Danny and Rose Marie Thomas, 
Jerry and Jane Weintraub, Sybil Brand and Cesar Romero, Millicent and Robert 
Wise, Marcia Weisman, George and Betty Longstreet, Stephen Garrett and daughter 
Georgia, and Dr. Robert Schuller and wife Arvella.

AFTER A 30-YEAR DETOUR, SAXMAN IS BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty-five years after he was touted by fellow players, critics and fans as 
the heir apparent to Charlie Parker's be-bop throne, saxophonist Frank Morgan 
is beginning to realize his musical potential. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, 56, took a 30-year side trip, a chaotic, heroin-induced odyssey that 
included stops at some of California's finest penal institutions: Chino, 
Tehachapi, San Quentin. The highlight of his old life was leading a prison band 
that included trumpeter Art Pepper. 
</P>
<P>
But by 1985, Morgan, who opens five nights at Elario's in La Jolla tonight, was 
ready to change. 
</P>
<P>
"It was after I went into the studio and made 'Easy Living,' " Morgan said, 
referring to his comeback album. "Right after that, I turned myself in and went 
back to prison. The state of California had an all-points bulletin out on me. I 
was a parole violator, for using (drugs) and not showing up after I tested 
positive -- three or four different charges. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear to me where I belonged: in the studio, with Cedar Walton, Billy 
Higgins and Tony Dumas, rather than trying to find something to steal. I thank 
Rosalinda, my wife. She knew the parole department was looking for me, and told 
me to take care of that. She said, 'You just made a good album. If you position 
yourself, it can change our whole life.' " 
</P>
<P>
He did, and it has. 
</P>
<P>
Although Morgan had long dreamed of playing New York City, in front of the 
music world's best and brightest, he didn't make it until 1986, when he 
headlined several critically acclaimed nights at the legendary Village 
Vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time they used to try to send me to New York, I'd go back to prison. It 
was really a . . . game I was playing with myself, but that was then and this 
is now, and I really love it." 
</P>
<P>
Fans seem to love Morgan's newest recording, "Mood Indigo," which, according to 
him, is setting sales records for Island, his label. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in my life, I'm going to get some real royalties. I've 
gotten some already," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The album marks a departure for the man weaned on the searing bop lines of 
Charlie Parker. This time around, Morgan focuses on softer ballads, slower 
tunes, nice melodies, although the bop influence is frequently apparent in 
rapid-fire strings of notes. 
</P>
<P>
Among 11 songs are two by Duke Ellington, one of Morgan's heroes. In 1948, 
guitarist Stanley Morgan, who led the Ink Spots until his death last year, took 
his 15-year-old son backstage to audition for the legendary bandleader after a 
show at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just an awesome time, taking my horn out in Duke Ellington's dressing 
room to play 'Sophisticated Lady.' I was extremely nervous. I'm always nervous, 
especially before I start playing." 
</P>
<P>
Ellington liked what he heard. Johnny Hodges was quitting the band and Morgan 
was invited to replace him, but he couldn't leave high school to go on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
The new album's title track and "In a Sentimental Mood" are Morgan's most 
recent homages to Ellington. The latter is stripped to basics, with Morgan's 
whispering alto lines carrying the melody over the spare accompaniment of 
pianist George Cables, Morgan's frequent musical partner. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight is the presence of trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, who takes an awesome 
bop solo on John Coltrane's "Bessie's Blues." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan contributed "We Three Blues," describing his composing technique as 
strictly spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never really written a tune at home and taken it to the studio," he said. 
" 'We Three Blues,' I just started playing a lick and developed a motif. Then I 
tried to remember it when we got ready to record." 
</P>
<P>
As his vitality has returned, Morgan's career has soared. 
</P>
<P>
There's talk of a movie about his life. Morgan might even play himself, not 
that far-fetched an idea considering he received good reviews for a role in an 
off-Broadway play in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan hopes to record with a symphony orchestra under the direction of Zubin 
Mehta. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1975, he brought the L.A. Philharmonic into Chino and I played with him 
there; 15 years later, I did what he asked me to do: contact him when I got 
out. He's putting it in motion. We'll commission someone to write music for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Next up is an album with a pianist, probably Cedar Walton, although Morgan 
won't say for sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't put my future plans in stone. I think my thing is recording what I 
feel at the moment. I don't like to pick tunes or do anything that makes me 
have to go with what I planned two months ago. I'm not going to feel the same 
two months from now as I do today." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan believes his playing at any given moment is a snapshot of everywhere 
he's been, everything he's done. 
</P>
<P>
"Change is constant. For me to play 'Mood Indigo,' it's part of my life 
experience, going back to the Shrine Auditorium." Those early memories of 
Ellington go through Morgan's mind each time he plays the song, he said. "I 
seek that in any tune I play. I believe in playing tunes that mean something to 
you. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to know the words. Songs aren't just chord changes and notes. 
There's a story. The story is the thing. That's what I'm trying to do when I 
play, not just a series of licks, or how fast you can play." 
</P>
<P>
No matter the city or the audience, Morgan feels he has the massive history of 
jazz to live up to. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to underestimate the ability of people to listen. The fact is, 
people can listen far better than I'll ever be able to play. Take a person 
who's been listening to this music as long or longer than I've been playing it. 
Think of all the things they've heard, all the masters they can go into a 
record store and take home to digest and ingest for years. You think they don't 
know when they're hearing the real (thing)?" 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Morgan will be joined by bassist Bob Magnusson, drummer Tootie 
Heath and pianist Bob Hamilton. Showtimes are 8:30 and 10:30 Wednesday, 
Thursday and Sunday and 9, 10:30 and midnight Friday and Saturday.

SHOP . . . : In a big spread headlined "Orange County: Retail Squeeze, Plenty 
of Juice," Monday's Women's Wear Daily concedes South Coast Plaza's status as 
"California's most successful mall" and says the recently remodeled Fashion 
Island is "gaining steam." 
</P>
<P>
It also reports MainPlace/Santa Ana sales running 12% ahead of last year. 
"Retailers say Orange County isn't overstored yet because the population is 
rich, growing and glitzy," the article says. Another reason: "Tourists 
represented just 3.5% of the traffic at South Coast Plaza four years ago, but 
now they account for 22%." Catherine Gewertz and Tony Marcano

FULLERTON WINS EFFORT TO BAN MEDFLY COPTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County judge on Tuesday refused to force open the Fullerton airport 
to malathion-spraying helicopters, dealing the state its first legal setback in 
its 10-month aerial attack on the Mediterranean fruit fly in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
State agriculture officials, disappointed but undaunted by the ruling, promised 
to find another base in time for tonight's scheduled spraying around Garden 
Grove and Panorama City. They will also consider appealing the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Medfly Project officials, forced out of their base at El Monte Airport last 
week by noise complaints from neighbors, sought to move their helicopter 
operations to Fullerton Municipal Airport for at least three more rounds of 
malathion spraying in Orange and Los Angeles counties, scheduled to last 
through mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
But the idea met with protest from Fullerton city officials, who complained 
about noise and safety concerns at an airport that has already drawn demands 
for closure from some critics after several plane crashes there. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Voss, director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture, responded 
Friday with a terse letter to the Fullerton mayor that pointed out the state's 
broad emergency powers and reminded city leaders of their own obligations as 
"responsible officials." 
</P>
<P>
That set up Tuesday's showdown in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the state, Fullerton and the city of Buena Park waited anxiously 
for 3 1/2 hours as Superior Court Commissioner Julian Cimbaluk read legal 
arguments in his chambers. (Buena Park officials have often complained about 
safety problems at the neighboring Fullerton airport.) 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at about 5 p.m., with lawyers and reporters gathered around, 
Cimbaluk's clerk emerged from chambers to announce that Cimbaluk had refused 
the state's request for a temporary restraining order that would have forced 
officials to open the airport to anti-Medfly helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Cimbaluk said in his brief decision that the state had not shown enough of an 
emergency to warrant such an order before a hearing could be set to explore the 
issue further. 
</P>
<P>
Cimbaluk set another hearing for June 8 -- just five days before Medfly Project 
officials had hoped to spray Compton for the final round of malathion 
applications in Southern California. There are two rounds of applications 
scheduled in the interim: one tonight around Garden Grove and Panorama City, 
and another on May 30 around Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Among those standing watch at the court for Cimbaluk's decision was Medfly 
Project Deputy Director Don Henry, in charge of the program's day-to-day 
operations. Asked minutes after the announcement what the state would do now, 
Henry responded bluntly: "Spray." 
</P>
<P>
Both he and Robert Fox, the chief deputy director of the state agriculture 
department in Sacramento, said they did not believe that the ruling would 
prompt any delay in tonight's spraying or in any future aerial applications. 
</P>
<P>
State agriculture officials will confer this morning on whether several other 
potential airport sites can be used as helicopter bases and whether they should 
appeal Cimbaluk's ruling, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be doing some scrambling to figure out what to do now," Fox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Henry added: "As far as I know, we're still going to spray. . . . I'm not going 
to wait" until the June 8 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
He added that barring a successful appeal, the state would abide by Cimbaluk's 
ruling and scrap plans to move their helicopters to the Fullerton airport by 
late this afternoon. "We don't like to do anything by brute force," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision marks the first time that the state has lost a legal challenge in 
its $30-million Medfly eradication campaign in Southern California, which began 
last fall in an attempt to protect the state's $16-billion agriculture industry 
from the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
At least seven times in recent months, Southland municipalities and other 
malathion critics have gone to court to try to block the state's sprayings on 
the grounds that it poses risks to endangered species, the environment, the 
homeless and other people. And seven times, the protesters had lost. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike virtually all of those previous challenges, Fullerton attorneys made 
clear that they were not criticizing the spraying itself -- only the 
"haphazard" way in which they said the state had gone about switching its 
malathion airport operations on such short notice. 
</P>
<P>
In a declaration included as part of the city's lawsuit, Fullerton Municipal 
Airport Director Roland Elder said the use of as many as six Bell 206 
helicopters at the facility poses "a significant danger." 
</P>
<P>
He likened the idea to "attempting to conduct battleship operations in a fish 
pond." 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton site is designed primarily to help accommodate overflow traffic 
at other, larger airports in the area. Using the airport for malathion 
helicopters would force changes in existing takeoff and landing patterns and 
significantly increase the risk of a serious nighttime accident -- during hours 
when there are no air traffic controllers on duty, Elder argued. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton attorneys also cited noise as cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that the state seems to hold an "anything goes" attitude toward 
sprayings, attorney Jeffrey Wertheimer, representing the city of Fullerton, 
said: "We think (the sprayings) could go on for a while." 
</P>
<P>
But state officials, in their written arguments before Cimbaluk, countered that 
emergency declarations issued by Gov. George Deukmejian and supported by 
resolutions of county supervisors in Orange and Los Angeles counties give them 
the authority to use the Fullerton airport. The city's refusal to honor that 
emergency power, the state argued, threatens the Medfly eradication effort and, 
ultimately, California agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said that they looked at six other airports besides Fullerton 
-- in Long Beach, Burbank, Huntington Beach, Santa Monica, Los Alamitos and 
Sylmar. But for reasons such as restrictions on nighttime flying, none of those 
airports worked out, Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
Its physical layout and its proximity to a 36-square-mile spray zone around 
Garden Grove -- now the largest remaining application area in the Southland -- 
made Fullerton the logical choice, Deputy Atty. Gen. Clifford T. Lee said. 
"We're not picking on Fullerton," he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both the state and city said they would be willing to look at a 
compromise settlement in the wake of Cimbaluk's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, calling the ruling "a vindication of 
our position," said: "We want the state to look at other alternatives that are 
practical for the city and for them." 
</P>
<P>
Those alternatives, he added, should not involve the Fullerton airport.

DIANNE KLEIN: WHAT IN THE WORLD IS ALL THE HUBBLE HUBBUB ABOUT?

<TEXT>
<P>
HUBBA-HUBBA: Uh . . . So this is it, huh? The Hubble Space Telescope snaps a 
picture of a fuzzy space dot 
</P>
<P>
not to be confused with slightly more fuzzy dot shot from earth -- and NASA 
astronomers go into orbit. "It's quite an image-fantastic," says a Hubble 
honcho. "We are just pleased as punch at this point." Gee, me too. Except for 
$1.5 billion, you'd think it would come with double prints. 
</P>
<P>
TEEN-AGE MUTANT MEDFLIES: The first of the sterile Mediterranean fruit flies is 
buzzing around Orange County. Agriculture officials have dyed them pink, 
undoubtedly after years of research about what really turns flies on. I'm not 
sure about the details, but as I understand it, the plan calls for the 
deceptively sexual steriles to lure the fertiles into an amorous embrace and 
voila! Safe sex whether they like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
This is progressive thinking. Now if only the governor could think as 
creatively about financing family planning clinics. 
</P>
<P>
BUT MOMMY, IT'S ONLY PRETEND: Sixteen-year-old Ariel defies father, runs away 
from home, is snookered in business deal, brings bodily harm to father, but 
it's all worth it because she eventually gets her guy. Check it out: "The 
Little Mermaid," now a Disney sensation in video. 
</P>
<P>
SNAKES, BUT NO SNAKES: Mike Courtney, who lives in Orange, thinks the City 
Council should let him keep B.C., his 10-foot boa constrictor, at home. Seems 
B.C. has grown longer than a city ordinance allows. Courtney argues that if the 
council relaxes its ordinance, other snake owners would "come out of the 
woodwork" instead of harboring their snakes illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Hissss. No offense intended, Mike, but I'd just as soon all those snakes stayed 
in the woodwork. Or under a rock, in the desert, where even a developer dare 
not tread. Or in a jungle, far far away, beyond the travel itinerary of even 
the most intrepid yuppie vacationer. 
</P>
<P>
ONE FOR THE BIRDS: And speaking of Orange . . . the City Council recently voted 
to lift restrictions on the number of pet birds residents may keep. This is 
thanks to Lou and Delores Palush, whom I wrote about months ago. Makes me want 
to crow. 
</P>
<P>
THE SHOCKING S-WORD: If another radio or TV announcer tells me that we're in 
for a day of hazy sunshine around the Southland, I'll scream. Smog. Just say 
it. That's what it is. 
</P>
<P>
AND THE TWAIN SHALL PEAK: So maybe tonight we'll find out who killed coke head, 
gal-about-town and all-around beautiful person Laura Palmer on the season 
finale of Twin Peaks. Or will we? Or is Laura really dead? It could all be a 
dream, you know. Laura could really be Arnold Palmer's daughter, hit with a 
golf ball on the driving range and knocked unconscious, a la Newhart. Twin 
Peaks may be Munchkin Land, or Hooterville. Or it could be a cast hallucination 
brought on by a sugar overdose. 
</P>
<P>
I know, of course. Agent Cooper's been telling me everything, on tape, from the 
start. But don't think I'm going to ruin the surprise now. 
</P>
<P>
AD INFINITUM: The sea . . . shoosh. The gulls . . . caw, caw. The fog moves in, 
heavy, fecund with its white silence. The Zen of advertising. We were supposed 
to know that it was a car they were selling, the Infiniti. Well now the car 
company has a new ad. It, too, goes on and on and on. We see a car, presumably 
the Infiniti, going up a street and down a street. Up, down, up, down. The 
announcer even says that. It's annoying, it's repetitive, it's boring . . . ah, 
yes, Zen master. It's what infinity is all about. 
</P>
<P>
GET THOSE EXCUSES IN ORDER: About 15 sea lions have washed up on Orange County 
shores over the past two weeks. Not to worry, says a biologist with the 
National Marine Fisheries Service. "If it keeps building to, let's say, about 
50 in two weeks," he goes on, "then we can say it's because of some commercial 
fishing." Beyond that, it's anyone's guess. Gang warfare at sea? Mass suicide 
sparked by word of a Sea World roundup? 
</P>
<P>
THE DEVIL RAISED THE RENT: The Rev. Robert H. Schuller is putting out the word 
to the faithful to hand over $3.2 million so he can keep his "Hour of Power" on 
the air. Here's a radical idea. How about donating the same amount to charity 
for a better return on your money?

NTSB URGES SAFETY SEATS FOR INFANTS ON AIRLINERS; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATIONS: PARENTS AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT GENERALLY ENDORSE THE RECOMMENDATION 
BUT SAY IT COULD MEAN FAMILIES WOULD FLY TOGETHER LESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY MARCANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board recommended Tuesday that infants and 
toddlers be required to sit in safety seats aboard airliners rather than travel 
for free when carried in their parents' arms. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, approved by the safety board, 4-0, would require children less 
than 40 inches tall or 40 pounds from traveling aboard airplanes without car 
seats approved for airline use. 
</P>
<P>
At John Wayne Airport, the proposal was generally endorsed by parents as a 
positive step toward greater safety. Still, parents agreed that the 
recommendation will hit hardest in the pocketbook and could sharply curtail 
trips by families with small children. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand it, but at the same time it's going to hurt costwise," said 
Karen Oi, 35, of Laguna Hills, who was pushing her 16-month-old son, Steven, in 
a stroller after dropping off relatives at the airport. "But safetywise, I 
think it's a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
The safety board recommendation is meant to deal with children 2 years or 
younger, but the height-weight requirement could mean older children would also 
be included. 
</P>
<P>
"All objects must be secured during takeoff and landing," said the safety 
board's chairman, James Kolstad, "including coffeepots and luggage -- and yet 
infants, our precious children, are not. I don't think the cost of protecting 
an infant's life is too much to ask." 
</P>
<P>
Under the recommendation, parents would be required to buy a ticket for each 
child to be assured of a seat. Once in force, the requirement could mean that 
airlines could turn away parents with unticketed children at the gate. Airlines 
would be expected to continue to allow infants and toddlers to fly for free 
aboard planes not fully booked. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation, however, does not address who would be required to provide 
the safety seats or whether airlines would be asked to absorb their cost. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation must be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. The 
FAA has resisted making safety seats mandatory in the past and has proposed a 
requirement that airlines allow infant seats aboard if passengers choose to use 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Most airlines already allow passengers to bring safety seats aboard, and the 
airline industry as a whole supports mandatory safety seats. The flight 
attendants' union, consumer safety groups and some members of Congress have 
also called for mandatory infant restraints. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is opposed by some travel agents, who contend that it would 
increase fares for young families and possibly force them to drive rather than 
fly on short trips. The agents, citing statistics showing automobile travel is 
more hazardous per mile than flying, argue that the proposal would effectively 
increase safety risks for young families. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Lousignont, 31, of Mission Viejo said his family would be among those 
that would be doing "a lot more driving" if the safety board's recommendation 
is approved. 
</P>
<P>
"With five of us, there's no way we could travel" by air, said Lousignont, who 
was at the airport to drop off relatives. He was accompanied by his wife, 
Kathy, 32, and their children: Tiffany, 5; Chelsea, 20 months, and Colin, 3 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more cost effective to fly the grandparents to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another traveler, Joe Former, 32, of Huntington Beach, agreed that economic 
costs would prohibit frequent travel for himself and his family. But Former, 
who was on his way to visit relatives in Washington with his 20-month-old 
daughter, Kayla, said he would support the safety board's proposal only if the 
airlines provided the safety seats at no cost to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
He added that his daughter would be safe in his arms aboard the cross-country 
flight. "I'm not going to let her go," he said.

SUPERVISORS OK RECYCLING POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved a policy to encourage 
employees to participate in a paper recycling program and use white paper 
whenever possible because colored paper cannot be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy, proposed by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, also asks county 
vendors to submit bids on white recycled paper. 
</P>
<P>
The county sends out about 7,500 bid notices a year, said county purchasing 
manager Michael Kolodisner. 
</P>
<P>
For each notice, the county receives an average of three bids. From now on, 
each bid notice will carry a recycling message. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure if the county says it would like to see the bids on recycled paper, 
the bidders would comply," Kolodisner said. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to save more trees and lighten the load in the county land dumps, 
Vasquez said in his proposal that the county can set an example for other major 
employers in the county by adopting a recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
"As a major paper purchaser, county government can make a difference in the 
market by developing a policy of purchasing white recycled paper for the 
majority of its needs," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
The county already operates a pilot desktop recycling program, which encourages 
employees to dump white paper in recycling bins rather than in the 
wastebasket.LILY ENG

TWO CITIES APPROVE 'BLINDER RACKS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ and GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana and Costa Mesa city councils this week approved ordinances that 
require news racks displaying pornographic newspapers to be partially covered 
with "blinder racks" to prevent minors from being able to see sexually explicit 
material. 
</P>
<P>
The blinders must cover at least two-thirds of the front page of pornographic 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
Only publications sold on sidewalks will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
In 30 days, Costa Mesa will send notices to news rack owners explaining the new 
ordinance. They will have 30 to 60 days to comply before the city begins 
issuing citations, City Manager Allan L. Roeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Non-compliance in Costa Mesa will be a misdemeanor with a potential fine of 
$200 and time in jail. In Santa Ana, punishment for the misdemeanor is stiffer, 
with violators facing up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa ordinance will give that city the opportunity to beef up 
enforcement of an existing code that bans news racks not permanently installed 
on sidewalks. City workers found that much of the adult material was being sold 
from news racks chained to permanent racks that have permits from the city. 
</P>
<P>
The owners will be advised to apply for permits for permanent status. Roeder 
said that the city issues those permits on a first-come, first-served basis and 
does not consider whether the racks will display sexually explicit 
material.MARY ANNE PEREZ and GREG HERNANDEZ

OVERPASS EXPANSION FOE IS THREATENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANICA KIRKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A leader in the fight to block expansion of the Yale Avenue pedestrian 
overpasses said Tuesday that he had received a death threat. 
</P>
<P>
David Flint, treasurer of a group that wants the bridges to remain restricted 
to pedestrians, bicyclists and emergency vehicles, played the tape of the phone 
call at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The caller said, "How dare you use our money for political causes," and said 
Flint's family and home were in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"What the hell is happening behind the nice, glossy, planned community?" Flint 
asked. "There are wackos out there." 
</P>
<P>
The threat also prompted outrage from Yale Action, the group advocating 
expansion of the overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not appropriate at all. It's not right," said Gary Vanderpol, the 
treasurer of Yale Action. "That's not the kind of campaign we're running." 
</P>
<P>
Flint said the threat followed the distribution of a flyer challenging a 
decision by the Deerfield Homeowners Assn. to donate $2,500 to Flint's group, 
the Friends of Caution for Neighborhood Preservation. The flyer, which lists 
Flint's phone number and address, claims that the homeowners' association will 
lose its tax-exempt status if it makes the contribution. The flyer was 
distributed by two former officials in the Deerfield Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But the association doesn't have tax-exempt status now, Flint said. Flint, vice 
president of the association, said it has budgeted $6,000 of its $350,000 
annual budget for taxes this year. 
</P>
<P>
One of the authors of the flyer said he had assumed that the association had 
tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
On June 5, voters will decide whether the bridges on Yale Avenue over the 
Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe railroad tracks and over the San Diego Freeway 
should be expanded to accommodate two-lane vehicular traffic. DANICA KIRKA

COUNCIL ZEROES IN ON SITE FOR CIVIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday took the first step toward acquiring property owned 
by the Mission Viejo Co. for a civic center complex. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 to set up a subcommittee to investigate obtaining 
eight acres at Chrisanta Drive and La Paz Road that would give the city enough 
room to build a civic center, a community theater and expand a county library 
on the site. 
</P>
<P>
That parcel is now occupied by an Edwards Theatres movie complex and the 
Mission Viejo Co. headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The council has already voted to bid on another City Hall site and last week 
authorized its staff to make an offer of about $3 million on a two-story office 
building at 24800 Chrisanta Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision was angrily opposed by Councilman Robert A. Curtis, who 
had negotiated with the Mission Viejo Co. last week to donate 7.2 acres of land 
near Crown Valley Parkway and Interstate 5 for a civic center complex. 
</P>
<P>
The land grant would have been tied to the city's approval of a 719-home 
housing project in east Mission Viejo and the development of a hotel and 
commercial project. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is an absolutely ludicrous attempt to undermine this gift of 7.2 
acres," Curtis said. "I intend to protect this opportunity against any 
ill-advised effort to sabotage it." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman William S. Craycraft, Councilwoman Victoria C. Jaffe and Mayor 
Christian W. Keena have labeled as inappropriate Curtis' efforts to negotiate 
an agreement on his own. 
</P>
<P>
But Curtis said it would be "foolish" to reject the Crown Valley property 
"regardless of its genesis and embark on a route whose ramifications have yet 
to be fully explored." 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe said the approval of the committee does not mean that the city has 
committed itself to a City Hall site. "This does not in any way bind or tie the 
hands of the council," she added. FRANK MESSINA

SCHOOL CUTS VOTED IN BUDGET SHORTFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine Unified School District has voted to compensate for a $2.2-million 
budget shortfall in the 1990-91 year, including raising school lunch prices and 
eliminating some bus service. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.1 million in cuts for the most part will not affect classrooms, although 
the board voted to cut weekly elementary school music classes for the sixth 
grade and to alter scheduling for other primary grades, saving about $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
School lunch prices will increase from $1.25 to $1.50 for high school students 
and from $1.15 to $1.25 for elementary school students. Bus service will be 
eliminated for some areas, though the school board has not decided which routes 
will be cut. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of budget shortfalls in succeeding years, board members said 
they are prepared to eliminate money for all high school sports teams. The 
teams cost about $600,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
However, board members said the teams could continue if they are funded through 
such other sources as booster clubs or the city. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Supt. Paul Reed emphasized that cuts in athletic programs would be 
needed only if the current shortfall continues.LAURA MICHAELIS

On a warm but breezy day, with the beach sand between her toes, Robyn 
Vanlerberghe couldn't resist the temptation. 
</P>
<P>
She strolled shin-deep into the ocean, letting the wind-swept waves lap at her 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss everything about the beach," said Vanlerberghe. "The sun, the sounds, 
the smell, everything." 
</P>
<P>
Vanlerberghe, 35, and five other students spent Tuesday absorbing it all at 
Dana Point Harbor. But to learn how it looked, these students from Braille 
Institute's Orange County Center in Anaheim relied on either what limited 
eyesight they had or the detailed descriptions of Harry Helling and Linda 
Blanchard of the Orange County Marine Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Vanlerberghe, who lost her eyesight after being stricken with 
diabetes, are totally blind. Others in the group could see at very close range. 
</P>
<P>
On a park bench outside the Marine Institute, before their trip to the tide 
pools, Helling described the ocean as "one of the most diverse environments in 
California" filled with more than 200 species of animals, most of them sharing 
a common bond with the visitors from the Braille Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"Like most of the animals of the sea, sight is not the most important sense for 
a sea star," Helling said. "Because it is a wavy and often very dark 
environment, creatures of the sea, like the sea star, see light and dark only 
and rely on a good sense of smell." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a guide, the students worked their way along the rocks to the 
tide pools, with its crabs, snails, barnacles, sea anemones and octopuses. 
</P>
<P>
The tide-pool tour is one part of the second annual, three-day Touch for Sight 
1990, a group of events co-sponsored by the Braille Institute, Orange County 
and the Dana Point Harbor Assn. Other activities include a walking tour through 
the harbor's Mariners Village, which allows them to touch a variety of art 
objects, a visit to the Marine Institute's laboratory, and, on Thursday, a 
fishing trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We bring either those who ask to come or are better able to handle this kind 
of trip," said Braille instructor Joe Buffomante. "Some of them are totally 
blind, others can see such things as signal lights or have some sort of light 
perception." 
</P>
<P>
Brad Grabill of Irvine and Cindy Hackworth of Downey ventured out on the rocky 
point, picking their way slowly over the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of Helling and Blanchard, the pair allowed some snails, hermit 
crabs and a sea urchin to meander about their hands. When Grabill consented to 
venture farther out, toward the breaking waves, Hackworth applauded his 
bravery. 
</P>
<P>
"You are a very daring person, Brad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Trusting, not daring," Grabill responded. LEN HALL

COSTA MESA RELENTS ON AID BAN FOR ALIENS; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: COUNCIL RESCINDS REQUEST FOR CHARITIES TO SCREEN FOR UNDOCUMENTED

<TEXT>
<P>
Acknowledging that its attempts to regulate illegal aliens had failed, the City 
Council has voted to rescind a controversial policy that asked charitable 
groups to screen clients to make sure they were legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
After more than an hour's debate that failed to produce a consensus on what 
role the city should play in enforcing immigration laws, the council voted 3-2 
Monday to accept a compromise offered by Mayor Peter F. Buffa that essentially 
tosses the problem back to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
All agencies that receive federal grant money from the city will now be 
required to "comply with all applicable federal immigration laws." 
</P>
<P>
The original policy, passed last August, barred the city from giving federal 
funds to any charitable group that aided illegal aliens. Supporters said it was 
needed to discourage the influx of undocumented workers into the community. 
</P>
<P>
Legal authorities said the revised policy is essentially meaningless because 
immigration laws apply to employers, not to their clients. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing that would require a screening procedure outside of the 
employer context," said Francisco Garcia, an attorney with the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Education Fund. "The reference to immigration law is obscure 
and puzzling." 
</P>
<P>
While directors of many service organizations hailed the action as a retreat 
from what they saw as a dangerous precedent, others said they were unsure what 
to make of the new language and worried it may present them with other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point I don't know whether it is acceptable or not," said Shirley 
Cohen, director of the Feedback Foundation, which provides meals to elderly 
county residents and is a recipient of city funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what all the immigration laws are or which ones apply to us. I 
think it's totally unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
Others were equally disturbed that the city did not fully abandon attempts to 
restrict how federal funds are used. 
</P>
<P>
"They postponed any kind of real decision," said Father Jaime Soto, Catholic 
vicar to Orange County's Latino community. "There has been no real resolution 
which, regrettably, is indicative of the broader community's abiding 
ambivalence towards immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
City officials conceded they were uncertain of the practical implications of 
the action. 
</P>
<P>
The new language will be included in contracts given to 35 social service 
agencies that received about $279,000 in federal community development block 
grant funds distributed by the council later in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But the council did not propose any means of implementing the measure or of 
determining whether agencies were complying with federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
"This basically leaves it up to the agencies themselves to determine whether 
they are violating federal law," Buffa said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the restrictions would shield the city from liability should any agency 
be found in violation of federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
However, Councilmen Orville Amburgey and Ed Glasgow, who strongly dissented, 
said the new policy essentially scuttled the city's attempts to regulate 
illegal aliens in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"As of now, the council's previous position is of no value," said Amburgey. 
"This asks for nothing more than is required right now, that they obey all 
laws." 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey proposed the original policy, which passed on a 3-2 vote in August. 
Buffa, architect of Monday's compromise, supported the measure at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The council subsequently voted to make the measure voluntary, with Buffa again 
providing the swing vote, when federal authorities questioned whether it might 
violate federal anti-discrimination rules. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated requests from the city, the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, which issues guidelines for the use of block grant money, has not 
made a decision on its legality. 
</P>
<P>
According to the old policy, the city "will not consent to support individuals 
or agencies who employ, provide assistance to, house, feed, or in any other 
fashion, support illegal aliens." 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey argued that Costa Mesa had become a mecca for illegal aliens who take 
advantage of assistance programs offered in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Critics warned the measure would create confusion and would be impossible to 
enforce. Many service organizations said that to accept the policy would mean 
setting up costly and unworkable screening procedures that would divert funds 
away from services for clients. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey and Glasgow said Monday that Costa Mesa is within its rights demanding 
that agencies screen their clients. An opinion by City Atty. Thomas Kathe had 
found there was no clear federal standards on the issue.

DEMOCRATS CLASH OVER ALLEGED ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTION

Assembly candidate Jerry Yudelson charged in a complaint to state election 
officials Tuesday that his Democratic primary opponent has received an improper 
campaign contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Tom Umberg, who is facing Yudelson in the June 5 primary, disputed the 
allegations and responded by calling his opponent a "compulsive liar." The 
complaint was filed with the Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint said Umberg used the results of a $3,000 poll conducted in 
November by the Orange County Democratic Foundation in soliciting support for 
his candidacy during a December trip to Sacramento. Yudelson charged that 
Umberg had not filed the proper documents to be a candidate in December and 
therefore the poll represented an illegal contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg denied that he was ever in Sacramento in December and said that he never 
talked with any legislators about his candidacy until February, after he 
announced his campaign. He also said the only information from the poll that he 
received was included in a letter the foundation sent to its members. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is desperate," Umberg said. "He's going to throw as much garbage as 
he can, and it doesn't matter whether it's true or not. He has a complete 
disregard for the truth." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Yudelson responded: "Give me a break. The guy moved his family 
and bought a house in Garden Grove, and he was given the full value of that 
poll before he did that. To expect us to believe anything else is like asking 
us to believe in Santa Claus or the tooth fairy." 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson and Umberg, both of Garden Grove, are running in the Democratic 
primary for the 72nd Assembly District now represented by incumbent Curt 
Pringle (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Redfearn, chairwoman of the Democratic Foundation, said the group 
conducted the poll last fall to determine if Pringle could be beaten. The poll 
tested hypothetical match-ups between Pringle and four possible Democratic 
candidates, including Umberg and Yudelson. 
</P>
<P>
It found that Umberg would beat Pringle and Yudelson would lose, Redfearn said. 
She said the results of the poll were offered to all four Democrats and were 
published in a letter to the foundation's members.

GRAY DAVIS WARNS BUSH ON OIL DRILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A state report that says the amount of oil recovered from the Feb. 7 tanker 
spill off Huntington Beach was vastly overstated should send a message to 
President Bush not to permit any new oil drilling off the Southern California 
coast, a top state official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
State Controller Gray Davis, chairman of the State Lands Commission, said in 
Los Angeles that "more oil drilling means more oil tankers and, Mr. Bush, we 
don't need more tankers. . . . The Huntington Beach accident was enough." 
</P>
<P>
Davis issued his plea as the commission released a report prepared by a 
Norwegian firm assessing cleanup efforts after the 399,000-gallon spill. The 
oil leaked out of the crippled freighter American Trader at a marine terminal 
about 1.3 miles southwest of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a Democrat and a leading environmentalist, used the report to lobby 
against opening large tracts of coastal Southern California, including Orange 
County, to oil and gas exploration and drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is expected to announce his recommendations for future oil drilling off 
California, Florida and the Gulf Coast very soon. 
</P>
<P>
Most local, state and federal officials representing Orange County oppose more 
oil drilling along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Coastal waters from Palos Verdes to San Diego contain some very fertile oil 
fields, and if President Bush designates any area of Southern California for 
drilling, he'll probably zero in on Orange and San Diego counties," predicted 
Robert H. Sulnick, executive director of the Santa Monica-based American Oceans 
Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
More drilling off the coast, Davis said, only increases chances of another 
accident similar to the American Trader spill that cost $30 million to clean 
up, killed or injured more than 750 birds, including several of an endangered 
species, and closed miles of shoreline for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
While generally praising British Petroleum's cleanup efforts, the State Lands 
Commission report said the amount of spilled oil that was actually recovered 
from the ocean was far less than company estimates. The state report said only 
21% of the oil, or roughly 83,748 gallons, was picked up by skimming vessels. 
Earlier estimates offered by the U.S. Coast Guard put the recovery rate at 37%, 
or 147,630 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
The difference could mean that American Trading Transportation Co., owners and 
operators of the 811-foot, U.S.-registered tanker, may eventually pay more than 
$8 million in fines -- rather than $5 million if 37% of the oil had been 
recovered. British Petroleum owned the oil on the tanker and coordinated the 
cleanup, but Davis said American Trading &amp; Transportation Co. will likely 
be held liable for the fines because it owned the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how much oil was recovered, Davis said, the spill underscored how 
difficult, even under the best conditions, it is to recapture even a small 
amount of oil. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with good weather and a fairly good response, we were able to get only 
20% of the oil," he said, adding that "you can never put the toxic genie back 
in the bottle. . . . At best you can only clean up a small percentage of the 
oil." 
</P>
<P>
The report by Oceanor, a consulting firm in Trondheim, Norway, is a review of 
how industry, government and private response teams performed in the days 
following the February mishap when, at low tide, the American Trader sat on its 
own anchor and began oozing crude oil at the Huntington Beach marine terminal. 
The terminal is owned by Golden West Refining, a Santa Fe Springs-based 
company.

BADHAM SAYS NO TO UNITY PLEDGE;

POLITICS: CANDIDATE TRYING TO UNSEAT ASSEMBLYMAN GIL FERGUSON SEES GOP'S "11TH 
COMMANDMENT" AS INCUMBENT INSURANCE.

<P>
Orange County Republican Party Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes says it is the local 
GOP's 11th commandment: "Thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican." 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Badham, who is trying to unseat incumbent Assemblyman Gil Ferguson in 
the 70th District, speaks of it in less reverential terms. "I'm going to 
abolish it when I'm elected," she said this week. 
</P>
<P>
It is the county Republican Party's code of ethics, a six-paragraph document in 
which candidates in contested Republican races pledge, among other things, to 
conduct their campaigns "in the most ethical and moral tradition, maximizing 
the opportunity for a Republican victory in the General Election." 
</P>
<P>
Badham has refused to sign the pledge, saying it is an unnecessary scrap of 
paper. The issue arose Monday night at the county Republican Party Central 
Committee's monthly meeting, during which Badham was pressed repeatedly on her 
refusal to sign. 
</P>
<P>
"She has not discussed the issue (of) why she has not signed this pledge, and I 
think it should be addressed before she leaves tonight," said sergeant-at-arms 
Bob Ray after Badham briefly addressed the 80 or so party loyalists in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Badham returned to the podium and noted that her opponent had signed the pledge 
but still had been quoted in newspaper articles attacking her personally. 
</P>
<P>
"He has called me an 'airhead,' and that was quoted in the Sacramento Bee," she 
said. "I don't . . . find that ethical practice, and I'd like to know why he 
signed it if he can't conduct an ethical campaign." 
</P>
<P>
After Badham's initial explanation, Ray questioned her again, saying he had not 
asked her about Ferguson but wanted to know why she had not signed. 
</P>
<P>
When Badham answered that she took the pledge to mean that incumbent Republican 
officeholders should not be challenged, she was heard groans and boos. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding of the code of ethics is . . . 'Thou shall not challenge a 
fellow Republican,' " she said. "Within the party in Orange County, there's 
absolutely no reason to have a code of ethics form. . . . If my opponent signed 
it, but can't abide by it, I don't know what good it does, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson was invited to Monday's meeting but did not attend, instead sending a 
letter explaining that business in the Capitol prevented him from doing so. In 
a recent interview, however, he said he would refuse to debate Badham until she 
signs the code. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to run . . . as a Republican in this county, you sign the 
pledge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes called it "unusual" for a candidate not to sign the pledge and said the 
only other Republican candidate in the county who has not returned the pledge 
is 58th Assembly District candidate Peter von Elten. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that no one has complained of campaign ethics violations in any 
race so far. 
</P>
<P>
Badham, 30, a moderate conservative and public relations manager for Ricoh 
Electronics, is a decided underdog against Ferguson, 67. One of the most 
conservative legislators in Sacramento, Ferguson has a strong base of volunteer 
support in his district, which includes most of the county from Newport Beach 
south. 
</P>
<P>
Badham was in hostile territory Monday night when she accepted the invitation 
to speak to some of the most committed party faithful, including many Ferguson 
supporters. Near the the meeting room exit, someone had taped a photocopied 
newspaper article detailing a lawsuit filed against Badham by her former 
campaign consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But the daughter of former Rep. Robert Badham did not seem to let that bother 
her. "I may not win by much, but I'm definitely going to win on June 5," she 
told the crowd.

MATER DEI NEEDS A LATE BREAK TO MAKE THE BEST OF A BAD DAY

It was a perfect ending to a not-so-perfect game for Mater Dei High School. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff March, Lakewood's center fielder, lost a fly ball in the sun in the eighth 
inning that allowed Jim Betzsold to score the go-ahead run, and the host 
Monarchs won, 5-4, Tuesday in the second round of the Southern Section 5-A 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Cale Carter, Mater Dei's sophomore catcher, lofted a high fly to center that 
Marsh misjudged, and Betzsold scored from second with nobody out in the inning. 
Carter's run-scoring triple advanced Mater Dei into Friday's quarterfinals and 
ended a difficult day for the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
The game had barely begun when Mater Dei's starting pitcher, Jason Dietrich, 
had to leave with one out in the second inning when he complained of pain in 
his right elbow. Dietrich missed most of last summer with tendinitis in his 
elbow, and will likely miss the remainder of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Two innings later, paramedics were called after Mater Dei shortstop Lionel 
Hastings' mother collapsed while working in the snack bar. She was admitted to 
St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, where her condition was listed as stable. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's shabby defense only compounded a woeful day. The Monarchs committed 
errors in the sixth and seventh innings that allowed Lakewood to take a 4-2 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the setbacks, Mater Dei (20-8) rallied for two runs in the seventh. 
Dave Gonzalez hit a run-scoring triple and Rick Ellis beat out an infield 
grounder to short to drive in a run to tie the score, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Sutton (8-4), the fourth pitcher for Mater Dei, struck out two of the 
three batters he faced in the eighth. Afterward, Mater Dei Coach Bob Ickes was 
visibly shaken by the day's events. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, when we won the title in 1980, we had five games just like 
this," he said. "When you go up against this type of competition, you sometimes 
need a break or two to win. 
</P>
<P>
"We were dodging bullets all afternoon, and then we finally got our offense 
going. The bottom of the lineup came through in the seventh after Hastings 
carried us through most of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Hastings hit solo home runs in the first and sixth innings off Lakewood starter 
David Reeser and pitched two innings in relief before giving way to Sutton in 
the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood (22-5) hit into three double plays early and failed to get a hit until 
the sixth inning, when it scored three times to take a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit into bad luck today," said Spud O'Neil, Lakewood's coach. "Those double 
plays killed us. But Mater Dei did a great job to come back and tie us, 
considering the adversity they faced today." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei will travel to Marina (14-12-1) for the quarterfinals Friday. Marina, 
the surprise team of the 5-A division, advanced with a 3-1 victory over 
Esperanza.

David Schultz, pitching his second complete game of the season for Marina High 
School, led the Vikings to a 3-1 upset of Esperanza in the second round of the 
Southern Section 5-A baseball playoffs Tuesday at Marina. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Marina (14-12-1) has advanced past the first round of the 
playoffs since losing to Lakewood in the 1976 semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz (6-2), a senior right-hander, allowed one run and five hits while 
striking out four and walking three. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best game I've ever pitched," Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
Marina next plays host to Mater Dei in a quarterfinal game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Marina jumped on Esperanza starter Joe Foss (7-1) in the second inning to take 
a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Martin doubled down the right-field line and scored on Brad Barton's 
single. One out later, Barton scored on Jeremy Preall's double down the 
right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
Marina increased its lead to 3-0 in the third, when first baseman Marc Newfield 
hit a home run, his fifth of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really relaxed today," Viking Coach Paul Renfrow said. "There was no 
pressure on us. Everyone counted us out in the beginning. The pressure was on 
Esperanza. It's exciting to play a team like Esperanza and come out on top." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza scored in the fourth, when Jason Hodges singled in Rich Hills. With 
two outs and runners on first and third, Esperanza tried a double steal, but 
catcher Robin Lindsey made the play at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza had another chance in the sixth. After Keith McDonald apparently 
grounded out to second for the third out, the first base umpire ruled that the 
ball went foul after hitting McDonald's foot. McDonald then singled to center, 
putting runners on first and third. 
</P>
<P>
But Schultz struck out Esperanza's top hitter, Dan Redington, to end the 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like that was the old Marina when we didn't get that call," Schultz 
said. "In years before, we would have folded, but I thought if we could get the 
next batter, we'd go the rest of the way."

<P>
Paramount (16-4), the San Gabriel Valley League champion, scored four runs on 
four hits in the third inning to seal its fourth victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia (13-11) had its best chance to get back in the game when it loaded the 
bases with no outs in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Tony Truel was hit by a pitch to lead off the inning and 
Mauricio Hernandez and Brice Hoy each walked. But Paramount pitcher Steve Lopez 
got Grant Rowan to fly out, then Kevin Schlect hit a sacrifice fly to score 
Truel. Chad Phillips flied out to center to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount added two runs in the fifth on a two-run single by Lopez, which gave 
the Pirates a 6-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount added another run then Truel hit his second home run of the season to 
lead off the bottom of the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez went 6 2/3 innings for Paramount, allowing five hits and three runs, two 
of which were earned. Magnolia starter John Strait retired the first six 
batters he faced before running into trouble in the third. Inzunza and Fidel 
Alarcon each went two for four for Paramount. KEN HILL

<P>
Courtney (7-0), a senior right-hander, retired 12 of the last 13 batters. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up a leadoff single to Roger Ray in the fourth, then retired 11 batters

Orange High School baseball Coach Ed Howard was able to save his ace for 
another day. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers dealt Howard a winning hand Tuesday by scoring three runs in the 
sixth inning to beat Santiago, 4-3, in the second round of the Southern Section 
3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
And Orange did it without having to use its best pitcher, Ruben Hernandez, who 
had pitched a one-hitter against Newport Harbor in the first round last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Curveball specialist Josh Belovski held Santiago to three runs in four innings 
before giving way to reliever John Martinolich. 
</P>
<P>
Before Orange came to bat in the sixth inning, trailing 3-1, Howard pulled his 
players aside for a huddle in front of the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"They were tired, but I told them I'd rather seem them tired than watching TV 
this week," Howard said. "I didn't want them to be reading about the rest of 
the playoffs in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
The pep talk paid off. Orange shortstop Greg Folsom led off the inning with a 
single, and Jason Smith and Rich Prater followed with singles to load the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
The next batter, Hernandez, hit a sharp grounder to second baseman Marco Perez, 
who got the force at second but threw wildly to first for an error. Two runs 
scored on the play, tying the score. 
</P>
<P>
Two batters later, Jesus Romo's sacrifice fly drove in Hernandez with the 
go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago (18-8), which had won several one-run games this season, ran out of 
comebacks in the seventh, when Martinolich (8-0) retired the side in order. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kissell (7-4) took the loss for Santiago, which was making its first 
playoff appearance since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Orange started the season 2-7, but has won eight in a row and 14 of 16 since 
moving Folsom from third base to shortstop over spring break. 
</P>
<P>
Folsom played a major role Tuesday, handling nine tough chances without an 
error. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense has been flawless," Howard said. "I can remember only two errors 
as a team since Easter break." 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Romo also made several nice plays on low throws, and center 
fielder Jeff Peterson robbed Santiago's Enele Scanlan of a hit with a diving 
catch in the sixth.

DAWKINS PUTS EXTRA EFFORT INTO NO-HITTER

<P>
A majority of Walter Dawkins' pitching woes this season has come in the first 
few innings of games. 
</P>
<P>
So, Dave Demerest, La Quinta High School's coach, tried something different 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He had Dawkins warm up as usual, then rest as usual, then pitch a simulated 
inning in the bullpen before the start of the game . . . as unusual. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment worked to near perfection as Dawkins pitched a no-hitter to lead 
La Quinta to a 1-0 victory over El Monte in the second round of the Southern 
Section 3-A playoffs at La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins, a junior, added a home run in the third inning for La Quinta (21-8), 
which advances to Friday's quarterfinals against Tustin at a site to be 
determined by a coin flip today. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins allowed four walks, had two strikeouts and was helped out frequently by 
the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Steve Cherms' range extended far up the middle in the first, fifth 
and seventh innings, where he stopped ground balls that would have gone for 
hits. Don Hopkins went to the fence in right field to catch a fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Matt Logan picked a runner off first in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Cherms made two impressive plays in the seventh. First, he went behind second 
base to get a sharp grounder that Dawkins deflected, and threw to first for the 
first out. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins walked Rick Perez, then Eli Perez punched the ball to the right of 
Cherms, who reached for it, got it and threw out Eli Perez by a step. 
</P>
<P>
The game ended when Eddie Lorres grounded to second baseman Brett Osborn. 
</P>
<P>
"They had me warm up a different way," Dawkins said. "Otherwise, sometimes I 
come out flat and get into trouble right away. . . . I realized I had a 
no-hitter about the fifth, and the defense really did the job behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins mixed his fastball and breaking pitches well, but struggled with his 
control. He threw 87 pitches, 51 of them strikes. Again he had trouble in the 
first two innings, throwing 39 pitches. His best inning was the third, when he 
threw only five pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins needed to be sharp El Monte's Shawn Kennedy also pitched well. Kennedy 
made one costly mistake, a hanging curveball to Dawkins that he drove over the 
left-center fence to lead off the third. The home run was Dawkins' second in 
the playoffs and fifth of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins also had an infield single in the first. Anthony Beltran had a bunt 
single in the third and Matt Logan had a sharp single to left in the seventh 
for La Quinta's only hits. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta had the bases loaded with one out in the second, but Kennedy struck 
out Justin Sogoian and Cherms. Kennedy (7-4), a senior right-hander, finished 
with 11 strikeouts for El Monte (13-10). 
</P>
<P>
"Our offense wasn't great," Demerest said, "but it was enough with Dawkins 
pitching as well as he did."

FULLERTON FOOTBALL HERE TO STAY, FOR NOW;

TITANS: ACADEMIC SENATE VOTES TO TABLE A RESOLUTION THAT WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED 
THE PROGRAM.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Fullerton Academic Senate voted Tuesday to table discussion of 
the Titan football program, in effect killing a resolution that would have 
eliminated the sport at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"The net effect of this motion is that football will continue at Cal State 
Fullerton," said Jack Bedell, senate chairman. "This is the end of the football 
question until someone raises it again." 
</P>
<P>
Academic senators spent about 90 minutes during a May 3 meeting debating the 
merits of Division I football at Fullerton and the possibility of either 
downgrading the program to Division II or III or eliminating it. 
</P>
<P>
That discussion continued for an hour at Tuesday's meeting but ended abruptly 
when a motion to table the item passed, 15-13, thus precluding a vote on Dr. 
Leland Bellot's resolution to phase out the football program. 
</P>
<P>
Bellot's resolution stated: "In order to properly support the range of men's 
and women's Division I intercollegiate sports CSUF desires to compete in, we 
should phase out intercollegiate football (on a time schedule that would allow 
us to meet our contractual obligations) and reallocate the available resources 
to the other existing athletic programs." 
</P>
<P>
Because the senate will meet for the last time during this semester Thursday 
and because football was not placed on the agenda for that meeting, the subject 
likely will not be discussed again until the next school year. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who are against football have taken their best shot and failed," 
Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll said. "Next year we'll have a new 
president and a new on-campus stadium under construction. It will be a whole 
new ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
In February, the Academic Senate sent a list of questions to school President 
Jewel Plummer Cobb regarding the financial feasibility of continuing the 
Division I football program at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb's response, which was drafted by Carroll and discussed at a school 
Athletics Council meeting in April, was basically a ringing endorsement for 
Division I football. 
</P>
<P>
The president said Division I football brings the school significant 
visibility, status and national recognition, and a drop to Division II or III 
would jeopardize the entire athletic program's standing in the Big West 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
She also argued that a push to eliminate football would incongruous with the 
school's efforts to build the Titan Sports Complex, which is scheduled for 
ground-breaking this summer. The centerpiece of the project is a 10,000-seat 
football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Academic Senate received the response in May, but some senators, including 
Bellot, were not convinced that Fullerton should continue its football program. 
</P>
<P>
"Football continues to represent a serious budget deficit," said Bellot, a 
history professor who also is chairman of the school's budget advisory 
committee. "In order to sustain the program, there is little flexibility to 
maintain other athletic programs." 
</P>
<P>
But there was plenty of support to continue the football program. Dr. Vyron 
Klassen, a mathematics professor, cited financial problems in the UC Irvine 
athletic department as an argument that cutting football will not necessarily 
put the Fullerton athletic department in the black. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no guarantee that without football, we wouldn't lose money or the 
budget for other sports would increase," Klassen said. "I think the resolution 
is misleading, and it won't accomplish what we're intending." 
</P>
<P>
Had the resolution passed, it would have been sent to Cobb, who would have had 
to pass or veto it within seven days. The Academic Senate is merely an advisory 
group that recommends action to the president -- it does not set policy. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Cobb, who attended Tuesday's meeting, won't ever have to vote on the 
issue. She is retiring this summer and will be replaced by Milton A. Gordon. 
Carroll hopes Gordon never has to vote on the issue either. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased this occurred so we can get on with other things," Carroll said.

<P>
AST Research Inc., the Irvine-based maker of personal computers, is revealing 
more details about its plans for future computer products. 
</P>
<P>
AST plans to introduce its first notebook computer at the Comdex computer show 
in Las Vegas this November. 
</P>
<P>
Safi Qureshey, AST president and chief executive, said the high-end computer 
will fit in a briefcase and have features such as extended battery-power life 
and the latest in display technology. 
</P>
<P>
The company will also introduce a multi-processing personal computer for the 
high end of the PC market later this year, Qureshey said. AST hopes that the 
computer, which will simultaneously use two super-fast Intel Corp. i486 
microprocessors, will compete for business with larger, more expensive 
minicomputers. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone, Advanced Logic Research in Irvine is also planning to launch 
a multi-processor machine at the Comdex show in November, said Dave Kirkey, 
Advanced's vice president of sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
AST also said it may sell computers in Japan under its own name if a recent 
deal with Sharp Corp. to distribute AST computers in that country does not 
materialize. Under the Sharp proposal, the Japanese electronics firm would 
market AST computers compatible with NEC Corp. machines under the Sharp name. 
AST said it has been approached by several Japanese distributors who expressed 
interest in selling the products in Japan.

FAO STORE REOPENS WITH EYE-CATCHING TOYS, PRICES

Perhaps the best way to judge the excitement building Tuesday for the opening 
of a newly expanded FAO Schwarz toy store at South Coast Plaza was to count the 
number of noses pressed to the glass. There were many. 
</P>
<P>
Few could resist a peek at the big stuffed lions and giraffes staring back at 
them through the window as workers readied the store for its opening today. 
Some stopped for a glimpse at the miniature red BMW with Babar the Elephant 
behind the wheel, or the giant talking moon face that will greet shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
The goal, explained an exuberant FAO Schwarz President Peter L. Harris, is to 
go beyond being the pre-eminent name in toy retailing and create a giant 
retailing fantasy land that no kid -- or parent -- can resist. 
</P>
<P>
"We really have gone far out to create the ultimate experience of music, color 
and animation," Harris said as he bounced between displays to show off some of 
the latest toys. "It's not just a box with merchandise. The store itself is a 
plaything." 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Plaza store is the last of FAO's 16 U.S. stores to receive a 
face lift in a program that began when the flagship store on Manhattan's Fifth 
Avenue moved across the street and was redone. Harris said the Orange County 
toy shop has been such a success that he wanted to tinker with ideas in other 
FAO stores before incorporating the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, FAO Schwarz has moved to a location with one-third more display 
space than its former location. The new store is near the Carousel Court and 
next door to the Disney store. 
</P>
<P>
When browsers drift past the giant building block entrance and into the store, 
the big happy moon face with twitching eyes will detect their presence and 
greet them with a cheerful: "Welcome to fun, to happiness, to FAO's World of 
Toys!" 
</P>
<P>
To their right will be mounds of giant stuffed animals with giant price tags to 
match. To their left, strollers will find a sea of dolls and stacks of board 
games and video screens displaying Nintendo games. 
</P>
<P>
A special FAO Schwarz song plays over and over to set the theme for the store. 
A talking five-foot robot will converse with youngsters, who can also squeal at 
the sight of an acrobatic monkey doll wheeling across a 30-foot-long high wire. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a native Californian who once headed the new defunct Gemco department 
store chain, said the store will maintain its distinctive inventory and 
services that make FAO Schwarz "the Tiffany of toy stores." 
</P>
<P>
The chain, for instance, was first to sell a new Sony Corp. toy that allows 
children to electronically sketch pictures that can be transferred to a TV 
screen, he said. For Christmas, the store will stock a special collectors' 
edition of a Barbie doll dressed in a blue satin gown. 
</P>
<P>
The larger store isn't trying to be an upscale version of toy supermarkets such 
as Toys R Us, Harris said. Unlike the typical Toys R Us shopper, FAO customers 
usually arrive at the store without knowing what they want to buy but expecting 
to find the unique. To help affluent working parents, the store offers such 
service as telephone ordering and same-day delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said he expects sales at the new South Coast Plaza store to be double 
what they were at its former location.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: FORMER ALLERGAN EXECUTIVE NAMED TO HEAD I-FLOW CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I-Flow Corp., the Irvine developer of drug-infusion systems, has hired Donald 
M. Earhart, a former Allergan executive, as its president and chief operating 
officer. Earhart also is being considered for the top job as chief executive 
officer and to become a member of I-Flow's board of directors, the company said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Eric Brown resigned as I-Flow's chief executive over a 
disagreement with the company's board of directors about business strategy, 
according to a company spokesman. At that time Michael A. Pentopoulos, an 
independent consultant, stepped in to serve as the company's chief executive. 
Pentopoulos would resign that position to Earhart. 
</P>
<P>
Earhart, 46, was formerly president of the Optical Division of Allergan, a 
major eye care products manufacturer in Irvine. At Allergan, Earhart managed a 
line of ophthalmic products with sales of more than $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, I-Flow is a 5-year-old research firm that has yet to make its 
first sale. Officials of the company, which went public in February, say they 
hope to have their first home drug-infusion product ready for market by the end 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
"That Earhart chose to join I-Flow, with so many other excellent opportunities 
open to him, is a very strong testament to his and our faith in the future of 
the company," said Dr. John H. Abeles, I-Flow's chairman. LESLIE BERKMAN

Wespercorp: The Irvine computer products company lost $46,000 for the third 
fiscal quarter ended March 31, compared to a net loss of $97,000 for the 
similar period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Sales declined 28%, to $342,000 from $476,000. For the nine-month period, the 
company posted net earnings of $2,000, contrasted with a year-earlier loss of 
$292,000. Sales fell 40%, to $1.2 million from nearly $2 million. The company 
said the sales decline for the nine-month period is attributed to the sale of 
its Audiofile product line, lower spare parts sales to the Federal Aviation 
Administration because of a supplier's delay in shipping material, and reduced 
sales of some products.

LOW RATING ANGERS ORCHESTRA OFFICIAL 
</P>

<P>
An official of the Garden Grove Symphony reacted with anger to the reported 
comments of a California Arts Council advisory panel that last week 
characterized the orchestra as "very poor." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel slapped on the face for something we did two or three years ago," 
general manager Yaakov Dvir-Djerassi said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, whose ratings provide the basis for arts council grants, had 
complained that the orchestra's programming "tends to be very light and popular 
in orientation. Each concert borders on a pops flavor." 
</P>
<P>
It gave the orchestra a 2+ on its scale of 1 to 4. Groups rated below 3- rarely 
get state arts money. 
</P>
<P>
Dvir-Djerassi called the criticism "out of date." 
</P>
<P>
"The programming three years ago was different from what we have now. This 
season we separated the classics from the pops programs. Next season, we will 
do strictly the classics. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was an unfair judgment on their part. We are more careful of 
programming today than at any other time." 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra has failed to qualify for CAC grants for the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that Sacramento really knows the role the Garden Grove Symphony 
plays in its community," the general manager said. "It is a bridge not only to 
the regular classical music audience but also to minorities, youth and the 
underprivileged. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing all sorts of things to advance the cultural aspects of the 
performing arts north of the (Garden Grove) Freeway -- which apparently to 
Sacramento means absolutely nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Dvir-Djerassi also complained that the arts council has sent just one adviser 
to hear the orchestra live. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time he came was when he did the Brent Pierce Salute to the 
Centennial of Orange County," he said. "So we had a commissioned work. I don't 
know too many orchestras in Orange County who are doing commissioned works." 
</P>
<P>
One positive comment offered by the arts council adviser who visited the 
orchestra, Dvir-Djerassi added, was about "the community support for the 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"The lowest attendance we had was always 80% of a 1,500-seat auditorium, which 
says quite a bit for the orchestra," Dvir-Djerassi said. 
</P>
<P>
The general manager understands how an arts council grant bestows legitimacy 
upon an organization. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can get more grants based on their grant," he said. "So we always 
read (the arts council reports) very carefully and correct the things that 
should be corrected. We take those things very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"This season and last, we eliminated all the student musicians so people won't 
say, 'You have student players.' The composition of the orchestra is like any 
major orchestra. We do everything to justify the artistic quality of the 
entity." 
</P>
<P>
Dvir-Djerassi said that despite low ratings, he is not discouraged and plans to 
continue applying for grants. 
</P>
<P>
"There is next year always," he said. "We will get it eventually. The road to 
heaven is paved with lots of problems. . . . If after 10 years, every year they 
tell us the same thing, then I'll worry. But we have a few more years to get 
there."

<P>
The Bush Administration today dramatically increased its estimates of the cost 
of rescuing the savings and loan industry, based on a new forecast that as many 
as 
</P>
<P>
1,030 institutions will fail. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told Congress that the government will 
need to borrow between $90 billion and $130 billion to clean up the S&amp;L 
mess, far higher than the $50 billion in long-term borrowing authority included 
in the S&amp;L bailout bill passed by Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
These estimates do not include the cost of paying interest on the borrowings. 
When that figure is included, the S&amp;L bailout cost is expected to top $300 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Brady said the Resolution Trust Corp., which is closing or selling insolvent 
thrift institutions, could run out of funds by the end of 1990 or early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Brady blamed the increased cost on a weaker economy, particularly in real 
estate. Slumping real estate prices mean that more S&amp;Ls are likely to fail 
since the bulk of their loans are based on real estate prices. 
</P>
<P>
When the S&amp;L bailout legislation was passed last year, it was believed that 
between 450 and 550 institutions would fail. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration based its new cost estimate on a belief that between 722 and 
1,030 institutions will fail. 
</P>
<P>
Brady stressed that any estimate could be wrong because of the large number of 
variables. But he said the Administration's new $90-billion to $130-billion 
estimate provided a reasonable range of what the ultimate cost will be. 
</P>
<P>
"One could make even bleaker assumptions and make an estimate based on even 
higher populations of failed thrifts," he said in testimony before the Senate 
Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"While such a scenario is theoretically possible, we believe it to be quite 
unlikely under any reasonable set of economic conditions," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration said that for just the 1991 fiscal year, which begins next 
Oct. 1, the cost of the S&amp;L bailout will be $61 billion, almost eight times 
the projection made in Bush's budget request to Congress in January. 
</P>
<P>
The higher S&amp;L bailout estimates were described by one Treasury official as 
the "largest wild card" plaguing Administration and congressional negotiators 
trying to reach a compromise on the 1991 budget. The official briefed reporters 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury official said the department was not offering any recommendations 
on how to pay for the higher costs of the savings and loan bailout, such as new 
taxes. He said that decision would have to be made in the budget negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the Senate banking committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan warned that banks should not overreact to the losses suffered on 
their real estate loans by cutting back on loans. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an overreaction that limited the credit availability for prudent 
activities," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the Fed is carefully monitoring the lending slowdown to make 
sure it does not hurt the economy. "Our concern is to make certain that what is 
emerging is contained and to make sure that it does not have a negative impact. 
Our actions should be precautionary." 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Brady said the government is obligated to protect the savings 
of millions of Americans who deposited funds in federally insured thrifts that 
have gone bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we make good on that promise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift industry has been wracked by regional economic downturns and 
fraudulent managers in recent years, forcing the government to protect 
depositors' savings. 
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, the 2,878 surviving thrifts reported $19.2 billion in total 
losses, the Office of Thrift Management has said. Hundreds more of them are 
expected to fail eventually.

SUPERVISORS URGE HALT OF MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County supervisors, struggling for a way to express their opposition to 
aerial malathion spraying inside the county, unanimously voted today to call on 
the state to halt the practice. 
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution approved by the supervisors, the board "demands an 
immediate halt to all aerial pesticide spraying over urban areas." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the board directed the county's chief administrative officer to 
notify "all appropriate governmental authorities" of the county's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
After months of fragmenting on issues relating to the aerial spraying, today's 
action finally represented a move that the entire board could support. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we go again with that pesky thing," Board Chairman Don R. Roth said 
wearily when the issue was raised. But he too expressed his opposition to 
malathion spraying, and he joined his colleagues in approving the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, modeled after one recently passed by supervisors in Los Angeles 
County, stops short of directing the county's agricultural commissioner not to 
cooperate with the state-ordered spraying, however. That provision was dropped 
in response to concerns by some supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Because the spraying is mandated by the state, the county's action today cannot 
bring a halt to it. But Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, one of the sponsors of the 
resolution, said he hopes that the cumulative effect of city and county 
governments expressing their opposition to the spraying will eventually cause 
the state to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
"Hurling words against a brick wall may not at first seem to make a lot of 
sense, but we're hoping it will have an eroding effect," Stanton said. "It's 
important to send this message out that we don't like this spraying."

<P>
An Anaheim man was critically injured this morning when his speeding motorcycle 
plowed into a van on the Orange Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
John Sentino, 24, was traveling north near the Chapman Avenue off-ramp at 1:50 
a.m. at a speed estimated at more than 100 m.p.h. when he hit the van without 
applying his brakes, California Highway Patrol Officer Angel Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
At impact, he flipped off his motorcycle, flew about 40 feet and landed in the 
center divider, Johnson said. He was not wearing a helmet. No one in the van 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Sentino was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he was listed in 
critical condition with massive head injuries and a broken leg, hospital 
spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said.

A window of a commuter jet with 18 people aboard blew out at 14,000 feet, 
dragging a man from his seat as other passengers clung to him and forcing the 
pilot to make a quick descent and emergency landing, a Horizon Airline 
spokesperson said today. 
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Gayle Sears of Portland, suffered minor cuts and bruises 
and was treated for possible shock before his release from Highline Community 
Hospital near Sea-Tac Airport, said spokesperson Nancy Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sears was buckled in his seat in the second row on the right side of 
the plane, the sudden decompression dragged him toward the window as other 
passengers grabbed him, passengers told officials. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the window blew out completely and cleanly as the Fairchild 
Metro 3 jet passed over Olympia on a flight from Portland, Ore., to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot completed the emergency landing without further incident and the 
other passengers disembarked normally and continued on to their destinations, 
Hamilton said.

Richard E. Berendzen, who has resigned as American University president, 
pleaded guilty today to two misdemeanor charges of making obscene telephone 
calls from his university office. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax County General District Court Judge J. Conrad Waters Jr. sentenced 
Berendzen to 30 days in jail on each charge, but suspended all the jail time, 
provided the Harvard-trained educator stays out of trouble for one year. 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply regret all of this," Berendzen told the judge in his only comment. 
Commonwealth's Atty. Robert Horan said Berendzen received the standard 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Berendzen, 51, resigned April 8 as president of the Washington, D.C., 
university, saying he was exhausted. He was charged May 11 with two misdemeanor 
counts of making indecent calls to a day-care provider who is married to a 
Fairfax County police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax County police filed the charges a week after Berendzen left Johns 
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore where he was treated at the Sexual Disorders 
Clinic.

SENATE VOTES 52-48 TO BAN 9 ASSAULT WEAPONS IN SETBACK FOR BUSH, NRA

<P>
The Senate voted today to prohibit the importation and manufacture of nine 
military-style assault weapons in a surprise defeat for the Administration, 
Senate Republicans and the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 52 to 48 to retain in its anti-crime package a provision that 
would ban for three years five foreign- and four U.S.-made semiautomatic 
weapons -- called the "weapons of choice" for criminals and drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the restrictions immediately called for reconsideration of the 
decision. But the Senate voted 50-49 not to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration and Senate Republicans active on the bill opposed the ban 
and the National Rifle Assn. campaigned for its defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the assault weapon ban had said over the weekend they held little 
hope of winning. They said they expected to face opposition on the campaign 
trail this fall because of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
California's senators, Democrat Alan Cranston and Republican Pete Wilson, voted 
in favor of the firearms restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), leading the fight against the ban, said that it 
would hurt only the "decent, honest people" who collect these weapons or use 
them for target practice, or sometimes for hunting. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch said "deranged psychopaths" and the "crooks and violent people will be 
able to get them." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said "assault weapons put awesome killing 
in the hands of drug runners, hate groups and other criminals." 
</P>
<P>
"The ease with which these weapons can be obtained is fueling the arms race on 
the streets of every community in America," Kennedy added. "This is literally a 
matter of life and death for law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), the chief sponsor of the restrictions, said, 
"Assault weapons are rapidly becoming the weapon of choice for drug dealers. 
Our law enforcement officials are literally fed up." 
</P>
<P>
Five of the weapons included in the Metzenbaum and DeConcini proposals have 
already been banned from coming into the United States under an executive order 
signed by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill under consideration today initially was part of the Bush 
Administration's anti-crime package, but has long since been reshaped by 
majority Democrats led by Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
(D-Del.). The Administration now opposes the measure. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the question of cracking down on firearms, the key provisions of 
the anti-crime package are an expansion of the death penalty, a curb on 
petitions for court review of sentences and relaxed standards for search and 
seizure by police. 
</P>
<P>
The two parties differed sharply on details of those issues, as shown by the 
controversy over the assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats proposed bans on assault weapons, but Republicans proposed only 
increased penalties to 10 years in prison for criminals who use them in the 
commission of violent or drug-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Senate voted 82 to 17 to kill a ban on 21 types of semiautomatic 
assault weapons proposed by Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio). The amendment 
would have also banned bullet magazines with more than 15 rounds.

DOW MANAGES 4.03 RISE TO STAY ON RECORD ROLL

The stock market eked out a small gain today, marking another record-high close 
as the market recovered from losses earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 4.03 to 2,856.26, reaching a 
record closing high for the third straight session. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues and declines were about evenly balanced in the overall tally 
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 753 up, 739 down and 517 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 172.33 million shares, against 203.35 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose .27 to 195.85. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported this morning that new factory orders for 
durable goods fell 4.1% in April, providing a fresh sign of weakness in the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
As the day passed, the news helped to foster a moderate decline in interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of long-term government bonds rose almost $5 for each $1,000 in face 
value, reducing their yields to the 8.56% to 8.59% range. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that positive influence, however, brokers some traders were intent on 
cashing in on the stock market's recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, U.S. Treasury bond prices were narrowly mixed in volatile 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
The government's bellwether 30-year issue traded down around 1/16 point by 
midday, or 62.5 cents per $1,000 face amount, while its yield stood at 8.60%, 
unchanged from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Shorter-term bonds, meanwhile, were slightly higher in price. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices have been swinging pretty wildly today," said Kevin Flanagan, a money 
market economist for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The market can't seem to figure 
out which way it wants to go." 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bonds started out lower overseas, then rallied on the news of plunging 
gold prices in Europe and after the government reported a the drop in April 
durable goods orders, Flanagan said. But investors eager to cash in on the bond 
rally eventually pushed prices down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
News of a drop in gold prices and a weak durable goods report would be 
considered bullish for bonds, since it lessens the prospects of higher 
inflation, thereby keeping interest rates from rising. Bond prices move 
inversely to interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were unchanged to 1/16 point higher, intermediate maturities rose as much as 
3/32 point and long-term issues fell around 1/16 point, the Telerate Inc. 
financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a 
$1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, rose 0.04 to 1,149.73. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.89% as the discount declined 8 
basis points to 7.65%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.12% as the discount 
declined 4 basis points to 7.71%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.16% as the 
discount fell 5 basis points to 7.61%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8 3/16% around midday, unchanged from late Tuesday.

HARVARD SELLS ITS STOCK IN TOBACCO FIRMS

Harvard University has sold the stock it owned in companies that manufacture 
tobacco products because of the dangers of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
The university decided to sell the stocks last September and completed the 
sales in March, Harvard President Derek Bok said. 
</P>
<P>
He revealed the sale in a letter to three Harvard School of Public Health 
students, who had been demanding that the university sell its investments in 
companies manufacturing cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
"In reaching its decision, the corporation was motivated by a desire not to be 
associated as a shareholder with companies engaged in significant sales of 
products that create a substantial and unjustified risk of harm to other human 
beings," Bok wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Allan Blum, a Houston physician and chairman of Doctors Ought To Care, a 
national anti-smoking group that pushes for divestiture of tobacco stocks, 
called Harvard's decision a "breakthrough morally and financially." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic event that can't help but send a message that there's 
something rotten about holding tobacco stocks," Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Ridgway, vice president of public affairs for Lorillard Tobacco Co., said 
the decision may deprive Harvard of profitable stock investments. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would behoove them to look at the best investments, and our stock 
has done very well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bok said the decision was based on an Advisory Committee on Shareholder 
Responsibility review. 
</P>
<P>
He also said tobacco companies did not adequately answer questions about 
ethical issues in selling tobacco and their adherence to World Health 
Organization guidelines for marketing tobacco products in the Third World.

TWA Chairman Carl Icahn confirmed he is considering selling the airline to 
employees, a newspaper said today. 
</P>
<P>
The airline's Machinists Union has proposed an employee stock ownership plan in 
which employees would buy stock in the company and perhaps participate in 
running it, Icahn said in an interview with the Kansas City Star. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn's statement is thought to be the first acknowledgement he is willing to 
sell TWA as a whole, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn said he was more optimistic about the employee buyout concept after 
meeting machinists' union representatives Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, only the machinists union has been involved in buyout talks. 
TWA's pilots, based in St. Louis, have said they would not participate in an 
employee buyout because of the heavy debt burden at TWA.

THOMPSON ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL

A producer of pornographic movies testified Tuesday that she saw widespread 
drug use during a five-hour visit to the home of gonzo journalist Hunter S. 
Thompson last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 52, charged with four felony counts of possession of illegal drugs 
and dynamite, appeared in Pitkin County District Court for a pretrial hearing, 
where he was ordered to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
The writer had originally faced an additional felony cocaine possession charge 
and one misdemeanor count of sexual assault, but those charges were dismissed 
at the daylong hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were filed after the producer, Gail Palmer-Slater, 35, told 
sheriff's deputies she was assaulted during a visit with Thompson at his Woody 
Creek home outside Aspen on Feb. 21. She told deputies Thompson grabbed her 
left breast. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Charles Buss of Grand Junction said there was enough evidence 
to establish probable cause for a trial, but dismissed one count charging 
cocaine use and one of sexual assault. He scheduled a motions hearing for June 
25-26 in Pitkin County District Court. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson did not testify at the hearing. At the conclusion, when the judge read 
the charges against him, Thompson stood and pleaded innocent to all counts. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is the American legal system, we're all in trouble, we're all in 
trouble," Thompson said as he left the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer-Slater said her purpose in meeting with Thompson was to obtain the movie 
rights to his novel, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
After arriving at Thompson's house about 7 p.m., Palmer-Slater testified, she 
witnessed use of drugs by Thompson and several of his friends. She said she was 
offered some "white powdery fluffy stuff," which she refused. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, she said, Thompson walked into the kitchen, looked at the counter 
and said, "Oh look, coke," and dipped his head into the substance. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, his nostrils covered with a white residue, said, "There's coke 
everywhere I look in this house. That's why I love this house," Palmer-Slater 
testified.

Prince is used to getting royal treatment, but one Dutch couple decided to put 
a stop to the divine rights of rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
A Dutch court has ruled in favor of Marcel Soek and Merith Gijtenbeek, who sued 
the posh Hotel des Indes for allegedly giving their VIP suite reservation to 
the singer. 
</P>
<P>
The court ordered the hotel to pay a $13,369 penalty unless it gives the 
Imperial Suite to the couple for their June 2 wedding night, the couple and the 
hotel management said today. 
</P>
<P>
The couple booked the suite in March, but "the hotel told us after several 
weeks that the room was going to be given instead to an American pop star along 
with 10 other royal suites," Soek said. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't tell us who the star was, but the lawyer slipped the other day in 
court and said it was Prince," Soek said. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Des Indes General Manager Bernard Felix said the hotel has not decided 
whether to appeal the ruling.

LIZ SMITH: 'LOLITA' COMING BACK -- WITHOUT THE '62 NO-NOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Liz Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE RETURN of "Lolita"? Yes. Agent Irving Lazar sold Vladimir Nabokov's classic 
novel -- about a mature man obsessed by a 14-year-old nymphet -- about 25 years 
ago. It was then made into a wonderful 1962 movie, directed by the great 
Stanley Kubrick via MGM/7 Arts/Allied Artists. 
</P>
<P>
Now the film rights have returned to Nabokov's estate representative, Nikki 
Smith, and Smith and Lazar have sold "Lolita" all over again -- to Carolco 
Pictures International, a major independent. 
</P>
<P>
Their asking price this time was $1 million, and "Fatal Attraction" director 
Adrian Lyne is to be at the movie's helm. 
</P>
<P>
You do remember the original, a movie somewhat hampered by the strictures, 
mores and no-nos of the time. Noel Coward and Laurence Olivier were each sought 
for the leading role of the lecherous Humbert Humbert, who marries Lolita's 
mother to be near his heart's desire. James Mason ended up playing the role, 
with Sue Lyon as the nubile adolescent, Shelley Winters as her mother, and 
Peter Sellers as the driven observer, Quilty. 
</P>
<P>
So, you can begin casting in your head for the new Carolco version that will 
allow unhampered license in this day and age to Nabokov's exquisite, delicious 
and literary story. (This freedom does not necessarily mean the film will be 
improved upon in Version 2. After all, Nabokov wrote his own screenplay and was 
Oscar-nominated for the effort.) 
</P>
<P>
THE NEW YORK POPS has become a highly visible "hit" after seven uphill years of 
striving annually at Carnegie Hall in a night sponsored by The New York Daily 
News. It seems Skitch Henderson and his musicians have "arrived" at last, 
mysteriously, as in all "overnight" successes. Even the dinner after was a hit 
in the Plaza Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
We ended with a vulnerable Liza Minnelli, paying tribute to New York and to 
Sammy Davis Jr. in a rousing and sentimental finale. 
</P>
<P>
IN SPITE of the poor reviews, producer David Brown announces that "The Cemetery 
Club," Ivan Menchell's comedy at the Brooks Atkinson Theater in New York, has 
been acquired by Disney for Touchstone Pictures. Let's hope they also take the 
award-winning actors -- Eileen Heckart, Elizabeth Franz and Doris Belack. I 
wouldn't listen to the critics on this one; audiences seem crazy about this 
play. Brown has become the hottest new boy on the block. He also has "Tru" and 
"A Few Good Men" on Broadway.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: MEDICINE SOMETIMES THE CAUSE OF RINGING IN THE EARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Imagine what it would be like to have a bee buzzing around inside your head or 
a bunch of crickets permanently perched on your shoulder. That's what Ben 
experiences every day. 
</P>
<P>
Tinnitus is sometimes described as "ringing in the ears," but sufferers talk 
about hissing or humming noises as well as a high-pitched ringing or an 
electronic type of whine. 
</P>
<P>
There are many possible causes of tinnitus, including loud noises, ear 
diseases, hypothyroidism or hypertension, among others. In Ben's case, the 
tinnitus is brought on by the Naprosyn (naproxen) he takes to relieve arthritis 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the anti-inflammatory drugs Ben might take for arthritis are capable of 
provoking tinnitus. But Ben might be less sensitive to one of them if his 
doctor is willing to experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Other medications notorious for causing tinnitus include quinine (Legatrin, 
Q-vel, Quinamm) for restless legs. Malaria medicines, a variety of antibiotics 
used against serious infections and certain diuretics for cardiovascular, liver 
or kidney disease can cause both ringing in the ears, which usually disappears 
when the drug is discontinued, or hearing loss, which may be permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Among the antibiotics, neomycin has the worst reputation, but streptomycin, 
Kanamycin, and several others administered only by injection may also cause 
tinnitus and hearing impairment. High doses of erythromycin have been 
associated with reversible hearing loss and tinnitus. 
</P>
<P>
The diuretics known to affect hearing are Bumex (bumetanide), Edecrin 
(ethacrynic acid) and Lasix (furosemide). Either tinnitus or hearing impairment 
is usually reversible if the medication can be discontinued soon enough, but 
these are drugs that must not be stopped without a doctor's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, a patient who notices a strange sound that others do not hear, 
or who suddenly has trouble hearing, should get in touch with his or her 
physician.

Comedian Bill Cosby asked a court in Los Angeles on Tuesday to appoint a 
trustee to control the assets of his former business manager, alleged to have 
embezzled more than $8.5 million from Cosby and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"It is nothing personal," Cosby said of his former manager, Mary Waller. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is my money." 
</P>
<P>
He said Waller is incapable of controlling her money. Outside the courtroom, 
Waller, 46, said "Hi" to Cosby and kissed him on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
Cosby and his wife, Camille, sued Waller eight months ago, accusing her of 
embezzling more than $8.5 million from them during the time she was chief 
financial officer of SAH Enterprises, a Cosby corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Waller filed for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Marla Maples began a new job today as spokeswoman for No Excuses jeans with the 
blessing of Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
"He's absolutely supportive. . . . He thinks it's a wonderful idea," she said 
at a news conference when asked about her billionaire friend's reaction to her 
decision to take a job previously held by Donna Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Maples, the other woman in Trump's breakup with his wife, Ivana, was introduced 
to more than 150 TV and press people at the Four Seasons restaurant by jeans 
manufacturer Neil Cole. She wore tight black size 5 jeans, a white T-shirt with 
the No Excuses logo across the chest, and her blonde hair long and straight. 
</P>
<P>
Cole explained that his company has a policy of naming "exciting and 
newsworthy" personalities as spokespersons, such as Rice and TV personality 
Joan Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Rice was responsible for sinking Gary Hart's 1988 presidential campaign.

BRONCOS' ELWAY NOT SURE IF HE'LL PLAY OUT CONTRACT

<TEXT>
<P>
John Elway, just a month shy of his 30th birthday, says he doesn't know if he 
will fulfill the four years remaining on the six-year, $12.7-million contract 
he signed in September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Elway told The Denver Post when asked if he planned to play 
through the end of his contract with the Denver Broncos. The Post interview was 
published in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm giving you a serious answer. I'm just taking it year-by-year right now. It 
all depends on how everything goes." 
</P>
<P>
Although he does not know how much longer he will play, he said he has not 
thought about when he may retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not planning on retiring," Elway said. "If you ask me if I'm thinking 
about that, the answer is no." 
</P>
<P>
Elway turns 30 on June 28, and he would be 33 after the 1993 season, when his 
contract expires. 
</P>
<P>
When Elway signed the six-year contract, he was the highest-paid player in NFL 
history, but he now ranks no higher than seventh in the league. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is not concerned about the situation because of his close 
relationship with team owner Pat Bowlen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to hold me out or anything," he said. "I would never do 
anything like that to Mr. Bowlen. Yeah, I've thought about Jeff George getting 
what he got ($2.5 million per year compared to Elway's $2.12 million). But 
that's as far as it's gone. It's not going to be a stumbling block or anything 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Bowlen said earlier this year that he would make sure Elway's contract fell 
into line with the highest-paid players in the league sometime in the future. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Bowlen told The Post, "Nothing has changed from what I said a 
couple of months ago. John and I know what's going on in the league. John still 
has four years left on his contract, but John and I understand each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe 12 to 18 months from now, we'll sit down and talk about it. You can't 
always be the highest-paid guy all the time. I think John understands that. 
Those things happen. I don't think John is worried about it, and I know I'm not 
worried about it."

GRAZIANO HIT THE TOP, HAD THE LAST LAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENNY GREEN, THE GUARDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only rarely does the modern professional fighter impinge on the cultural 
history of his time. More than one great champion has been spotted in training 
reading the funnies, caught red-handed by reporters delighted to find someone 
even less literate than they. 
</P>
<P>
The old-time middleweight, Philadelphia Jack O'Brien, used to travel with a 
secretary and could claim a tenuous link with literature by having once punched 
John O'Hara's father through a dining-room door, all in the spirit of brotherly 
love. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Tunney became a confidant of Shaw, lectured on Shakespeare and went on a 
walking tour with Thornton Wilder. 
</P>
<P>
But no pug this century has ever approached the distinction of Rocky Graziano, 
who finally took the long count Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Through no fault of his own, it was Graziano's bizarre fate to become a matinee 
idol by proxy. To this day his image is hopelessly confused with that of Paul 
Newman, of all people. 
</P>
<P>
Graziano, whose career was pure grand guignol from the first street fights to 
reform school, proved irresistible to the moguls in Hollywood. The result was 
"Somebody Up There Likes Me," in which Newman portrayed a genial slugger with 
the heart of a lion. 
</P>
<P>
Graziano was what is known in the trade as a crowd-pleaser. His theory of life 
was simple to the brink of imbecility. He once explained his style by saying he 
figured that he could hit people at least three times as hard as they could hit 
him, so that it was good sense to take two shots in order to land one. That 
strange method brought about a transmutation from slob to star, in a series of 
punishing contests culminating in the three awesome arguments with the 
middleweight champion, Tony Zale. 
</P>
<P>
It was rumored by his backers that Zale was made of solid teak, including his 
head. But in the second of his three debates with Graziano, the street fighter 
hit him so hard that the man of teak folded up like an accordion. The 
unthinkable had happened. Graziano was champion of the world, an eminence so 
dizzying that it gave him at last the social acceptability he had always pined 
for. 
</P>
<P>
Zale regained the title in their third fight, but it is doubtful if Graziano 
minded much. He had been the champion, and nobody could ever take the 
distinction away from him. No more the bum, not even after he challenged Sugar 
Ray Robinson one night and hit Robinson so hard in the glove with his head that 
he fell into a deep slumber. 
</P>
<P>
But Graziano had the last laugh on all his opponents. When he retired from the 
ring he went into show business and, like Max Baer and Maxie Rosenbloom, became 
a popular buffoon in television comedy shows. 
</P>

NCAA PANEL TELLS PLAN TO USE CBS' $1 BILLION 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An NCAA committee has proposed a revenue-sharing plan for distributing some of 
the $1 billion CBS will pay over the next seven years for rights to the 
basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The formula, which the NCAA said will increase payments to schools from 58% to 
250% in the first year, was among 12 recommendations made by a special 
committee to distribute money from the new television contract with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The payments would increase 6% to 7% in succeeding years. 
</P>
<P>
Payments to schools in the past have been based on how far they got in the 
tournament, a system that led to complaints that the traditional basketball 
powers got richer at the expense of others. 
</P>
<P>
Two sets of criteria would be used under the formula. The first would be the 
number of sports sponsored by an institution, the number of times it has 
participated in an NCAA championship the past three years and the number of 
scholarships it awards. 
</P>
<P>
The second guideline was the number of times the school had been in the 
basketball tournament the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
Conferences would be urged to allocate part of the money for academic programs 
at the institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations included additional money for Division II and Division 
III schools, including up to $3 million that would be distributed to Division 
II schools under the same formula used in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
Hearings will be held on the recommendations June 14 in Arlington, Va., Chicago 
and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The special committee will meet again June 18 to finalize its recommendations 
before giving them to a budget subcommittee. That committee will forward them 
to the Executive Committee in August. 
</P>
<P>
"The preliminary report is based upon suggestions from the membership, and we 
received a very productive initial response to our call for suggestions," said 
Judith M. Sweet, chair of the committee and director of athletics at UC San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Other preliminary proposals include: 
</P>
<P>
* Providing catastrophic injury insurance for student-athletes in all three 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
* Full funding of Division II and Division III championships. 
</P>
<P>
* Increasing the size of traveling parties for Division I championships and 
increasing the per diem. 
</P>
<P>
* Increasing traveling parties for Division I championships that make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
* Increasing the traveling party for the Division I basketball to 75 and 
increasing the per diem. 
</P>
<P>
* Putting part of the revenue in a membership trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
* Establishing an emergency fund for Division I. 
</P>
<P>
* Providing graduation incentives or career grants to Division I athletes. 
</P>
<P>
* Providing an inflationary increase in the conference grant program. 
</P>
<P>
* Increasing postgraduate scholarships.

Teddy Tinling, the man who revolutionized women's tennis wear and became a

</P>
<P>
Tinling died while being treated for a respiratory complaint in a Cambridge 
hospital, the hospital announced. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant Englishman's most celebrated, and controversial, moment came in 
1949 when he shocked the Wimbledon Establishment by designing lace-trimmed 
panties for a U.S. player, (Gorgeous) Gussie Moran. 
</P>
<P>
Tinling designed outfits for such Wimbledon champions as Maureen Connolly, 
Louise Brough, Doris Hart and Maria Bueno. He also acted for a number of years

REDS GAME BECOMES A WALK IN THE PARK FOR ANDRE DAWSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Andre Dawson likes respect at least as much as the next guy. But he admitted 
having second thoughts after the Cincinnati Reds fitted him for a straitjacket 
and walked him, still kicking and screaming, into the history books. 
</P>
<P>
Eight times on Tuesday, the National League's grim reaper of late walked to the 
plate. And five of those times, by design, he kept on walking. The first 
intentional pass came in the first inning against the first Cincinnati pitcher, 
the last in the 16th against the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
If that was difficult to follow, imagine how befuddled Reds Manager Lou 
Piniella must have felt after dropping a 2-1 decision. 
</P>
<P>
The revolving door that led to the mound at Wrigley Field spun so often that it 
made his head swim, and about the only constant he could remember afterward was 
instructing several of the pitchers who walked through it to walk the guy in 
blue pinstripes wearing No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
"How many did he have?" Piniella asked reporters. "Five? My God." 
</P>
<P>
It was a measure of respect never accorded the Babe or Henry Aaron -- not to 
mention Willie, Mickey and the Duke -- and only Roger Maris and Garry 
Templeton, with four intentional passes each, had ever sniffed such rarified 
air before Dawson. It became so predictable and moved so near comedy by the end 
that it seemed Rodney Dangerfield was batting behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson, though, was closer to a grimace than a grin by the time it was over. 
</P>
<P>
"What did I do," he said to no one in particular, "to deserve that?" 
</P>
<P>
Depends on where you want to start. 
</P>
<P>
Coming into this season at age 35 and coming off his sixth knee operation, 
Andre Dawson was supposed to be getting older, not better. He was supposed to 
be disabled, not dominant. Sure, he beat the odds once, but who figured he 
would do it again? 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Dawson turned his back on the Expos organization and a $1-million 
salary after 10 stellar seasons in Montreal and found few invitations awaiting. 
Though those were the days of collusion, there was a consensus among baseball 
people at the time as well that he was over-the-hill and as such, overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
When he showed up at the Cubs' training camp in Mesa, Ariz., the following 
spring and just about begged (on chronically bad knees) for a job, his new 
employer was not overly generous (Dawson signed for a $500,000 base salary, 
plus incentives) nor optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
But with a work ethic almost unmatched in baseball, he posted numbers as fine 
as any in the last decade -- .287 average, 49 home runs, 137 RBIs -- and became 
the first National Leaguer to win the Most Valuable Player award while toiling 
for a sixth-place team. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, he underwent knee surgery in May and managed to put up the kind of 
numbers in 118 games -- .252, 21 HRs and 77 RBIs -- that most of his 
counterparts could not match in 162. Yet, playing in obvious pain, he struggled 
mightily through the NL championship series at .105, and his very public 
failure to produce in the clutch several times began anew the whispers that he 
was finished. 
</P>
<P>
And when Dawson had major reconstructive surgery on the right knee (the fourth 
operation) a few days afterward, the doubts were aired in black and white. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I never do is put pressure on myself. But it's funny how the same 
guys who will build you up will write your obit," he paused, checking himself, 
"will announce your retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know the anguish of rehabbing a knee, they don't know how hard it 
is. How frustrating it gets to be pitched around all the time. They don't 
know," he said, finally, "what makes you tick." 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, when Dawson is the subject, few people do. Even Cubs Manager 
Don Zimmer, who often sounds as though he is in awe of Dawson, didn't expect to 
have him around at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came to camp and we had a look at him, we knew how hard he'd worked, 
but the knee looked so bad we planned to (put him on the disabled list) at the 
start of the season. We figured, 'He's a cripple.' 
</P>
<P>
"But the last 10 days of camp, he suddenly started moving," Zimmer said, "like 
all that work suddenly paid off -- just like that." 
</P>
<P>
And just like that, Dawson started tearing up opposing pitchers. Coming into 
Tuesday's game, he was hitting .346, with league-leading totals in homers (13) 
and RBIs (41). Indeed, Dawson is on a pace to outstrip his 1987 numbers, and he 
has yet to get hot -- by his definition, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel like it -- yet," he said. "When you're hot, you hit everything on 
the nose. The ball looks like a balloon. Those things haven't happened yet." 
</P>
<P>
Opposing managers might beg to differ. Just one day earlier, Dawson was named 
Player of the Week after batting .428 (12-for-28), with nine runs scored, three 
doubles, five homers and 15 RBIs in the last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder, then, that Piniella felt Dawson should rest his bat on the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Three times he ordered Dawson walked (by Tom Browning in the first and eighth 
innings and Scott Scudder in the 14th) when there was only one man on and two 
out; twice more (by Tim Birtsas in the 12th and Scudder again in the 16th) to 
load the bases with two out. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," he said, "I don't need to tell you that he's been hot . . . and it's not 
like this is the first time the guy's been on fire. 
</P>
<P>
"So I figured, if somebody else is going to beat us, fine," Piniella added. 
"But not him." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it's not like Piniella didn't feel a little silly by the finish. 
</P>
<P>
When Dawson looked into the Reds' dugout and smiled on a slow trot toward first 
base after the fifth and final walk, Piniella smiled sheepishly back, shrugged 
and called out, "It's not my fault the guys in front of you keep getting on."

MARY BRUCE, DARING PILOT AND AUTO RACER, DIES, 94

<P>
Mary Victor Bruce, a pioneer aviator, race car driver and speedboat pilot, has 
died, her son said today. She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
She died Monday "of old age," said her son and only survivor, Anthony Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
She was born Mildred Mary Petre on Nov. 10, 1895, to English nobleman Lawrence 
Petre, the squire of Coptfold Hall, and his wife, a Broadway actress. Her 
great-grandmother was a California gold miner. 
</P>
<P>
Within months of taking up flying, Bruce went around the world solo in her 
airplane, Bluebird. The 1930 trip included a crash on takeoff in Baltimore and 
her arrest in New York for flying circles around the Empire State Building. 
</P>
<P>
"She was flying such tight circles around the building that the typists inside 
said they could see the color of her eyes (blue)," her son said. 
</P>
<P>
He said she was quickly released from arrest and celebrated by New Yorkers for 
her daredevilry. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the same decade, Bruce performed death-defying dives from 2,000 to 50 
feet for a flying circus. 
</P>
<P>
She founded and owned an air ferry service that flew British newspapers and 
executives across the English Channel to Paris in time for breakfast. The 
airline was the first to use stewardesses, substituting young women for the 
traditionally male stewards. 
</P>
<P>
In race car driving, Bruce won the 1927 Ladies Cup at Monte Carlo and set 117 
world records for motoring, including traveling the farthest north into Lapland 
by motorcar. 
</P>
<P>
She married Victor Austin Bruce in 1929. They were divorced in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
At 81, she made a comeback after 37 years out of the air and looped the loop in 
a two-seater plane.

SIMULCASTING DISPUTE REDUCES PURSES AT NEW YORK RACE TRACKS

Purses are being reduced at New York thoroughbred tracks and Yonkers Raceway, a 
harness racing facility, officials of the tracks said today, blaming revenue 
lost through a simulcasting dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a contractual dispute with Catskill OTB, there has been no 
simulcasting of Aqueduct and Belmont Park races at Yonkers Raceway since Jan. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
NYRA purses will be cut almost 14% effective Saturday, and Yonkers purses will 
be reduced by about 12% effective Memorial Day, the organizations said in a 
joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
NYRA officials estimate that loss of revenues because of the dispute will mean 
a decline of $3.75 million a year in funds available for purses. 
</P>
<P>
"Without legislative help it is unlikely that these purse cuts can be 
restored," NYRA President Gerard J. McKeon said.

JAZZ: SHE LIKES A QUIET AUDIENCE AND THE RIGHT WORKING CONDITIONS. TO THAT END, 
SHE HAS RENTED THE TIFFANY FOR HER SHOW.

<P>
If there were a word to describe the voice of Blossom Dearie, who's at the 
Tiffany Theater through Monday, it would have to be sopranissimo. But no word 
or phrase can precisely pin down her special delicacy, the almost childlike 
grace, fragile on the surface, yet assured enough to bring honesty to every 
ballad and joy to every jump tune. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be called a jazz singer," she says, "though I certainly have 
some roots there. I'm not a cult singer either -- that word is used too much 
with a political connotation now -- and after being called a legend, that 
sounds too much like an epitaph. I think of myself as a songwriter's singer. 
All the great Broadway and Hollywood teams are in my repertoire, along with 
contemporary people like Dave Frishberg and Bobby Scott. Writers bring their 
songs to me because they rely on me to define their work with respect. That's 
very flattering." 
</P>
<P>
As a pianist, she considers herself mainly a self-accompanist. "I can't play 
jazz choruses like my friend Joyce Collins -- she's marvelous at that." For the 
Tiffany gig, she's backed by bassist Joel Di Bartolo of "The Tonight Show" 
band. 
</P>
<P>
"The job here is a new experiment for me," said Dearie. "I rented the theater, 
which means finding a sound person and a lighting person and someone to sell 
the tickets and rent the piano and place the ads. It's a nice hall and I do a 
two-hour show at 8 p.m. -- 6 p.m. on Sundays -- and then sell my cassettes and 
CDs afterward." 
</P>
<P>
Though she had lived in Paris for several years and led a successful vocal 
group there, Dearie said her present career as a singer-pianist-songwriter 
began in London in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"London was absolutely swinging in the '60s. I started at Ronnie Scott's club, 
and did a lot of television. I was on a show Peter Cook and Dudley Moore had 
called 'Not Only But Also.' When I was in Australia and New Zealand last month, 
I found a built-in audience of people who had seen me on the BBC programs that 
had been shown there." 
</P>
<P>
It was in London that her songwriting career took off. "I wrote 'Sweet Georgie 
Fame' with Sandra Harris; it was recorded by Tony Bennett. Later I collaborated 
with Johnny Mercer, who wrote the lyrics to 'I'm Shadowing You' and 'My New 
Celebrity Is You,' which was the one of the last songs he ever wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"At present I'm working with Jack Segal. We wrote 'After Me,' 'Good Morning,' 
and 'Bye Bye Country Boy.' I regard him -- and so does my audience -- as a 
world-class lyric writer." 
</P>
<P>
(Dearie's best-known song, "Inside a Silent Tear," was written with a 
lesser-known lyricist, Linda Albert, and has been recorded by Cleo Laine and 
several others.) 
</P>
<P>
Dearie's recording career goes back to the days when Norman Granz was still 
producing for Verve Records (one of the albums from that era, "Blossom Dearie," 
has just been reissued on CD), but in 1972 she founded Daffodil Records. 
"Johnny Mercer gave me the name for it. I have 10 albums out, with three on CD 
and more to come. My upcoming project is a video, which I'll make in London, 
probably at Ronnie Scott's." 
</P>
<P>
Because her style and sound are unique, one does not tend to think of Dearie in 
terms of influences, but she does admit to one. "Although I admire many singers 
and musicians, the one who truly stands out as an influence was Jeri Southern. 
I remember her record of 'You'd Better Go Now,' which was a hit in the 1950s. I 
fell in love with that; she was playing piano and singing, and it made a 
lasting impression on me. I have never stated this before, and I've never even 
met Jeri Southern." 
</P>
<P>
Like Southern (who retired in the 1960s and is now a teacher), Blossom Dearie 
requires a quiet, receptive audience. She has been very particular about 
working conditions; late-night hours, smoky clubs and cash registers that play 
the wrong chord are not for her. 
</P>
<P>
"For five years I spent six months of each year at the Ballroom in New York, 
where I had just one show at 6:30 p.m. It was lovely, and people really paid 
attention. I hold my listeners in high regard, because they respect me; they 
are very polite and they deserve a good performance -- which is why I'm at a 
theater here with just 99 seats. The conditions look ideal to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy controlling my working circumstances and having my own record company 
and being at a great stage in my career. I'm at the top of my game, and still 
learning something new and wonderful every day."

LEGENDARY FLEISHER WILL CONDUCT AND SOLO AT ARTS CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
THE PIANIST TURNED TO TEACHING, CONDUCTING AND ONE-HAND REPERTORY AFTER A HAND 
BECAME DISABLED IN 1965. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than one generation of music lovers has regarded pianist Leon Fleisher -- 
and particularly his work with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra -- as 
the stuff of legends. Thus, people felt heartsick when Fleisher's right hand 
became disabled in 1965, at the peak of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Fleisher, 62, subsequently turned to teaching, conducting and playing the 
one-hand repertory commissioned from Ravel and Prokofiev by Austrian pianist 
Paul Wittenstein, who had lost his right arm in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Fleisher will appear in both roles -- conductor and soloist -- with the Pacific 
Symphony today and Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"When it turned out that I wasn't able to do the repertoire I grew up playing," 
Fleisher said last week in a phone interview from a friend's home in Los 
Angeles, "it became inevitable I would take up the stick." 
</P>
<P>
But the transition took some adjusting. "With a piano, you have a direct 
connection with the instrument," he said. "You are personally responsible 
through your skills for the sounds that come out of the instrument. As a 
conductor, you have 90 to 100 musicians, who are sometimes skeptical about your 
abilities." 
</P>
<P>
He described his first conducting experience -- a community orchestra in 
Annapolis, Md., in Paul Hindemith's monumental "Symphonic Metamorphosis of 
Themes by Weber" as "scary, very frightening." 
</P>
<P>
"I was conducting (with gestures) from the floor to the ceiling, from the left 
wall to the right wall," he said. "That's one of the things you learn with 
experience: The size of the gesture can be smaller and equally effective." 
</P>
<P>
In 25 years, he has become reconciled to the change in career. 
</P>
<P>
"I've discovered in my old age that the greatest joys are those that are 
shared. That's certainly what you do with an orchestra," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said: "Sometimes you feel like you're on the back of an enormous 
dinosaur astride the Grand Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
What happens when he serves as both conductor and soloist? 
</P>
<P>
"I have disagreements with the conductor very frequently," he said with a 
laugh. "I've done it a number of times, and it's getting a little bit easier, 
simply because I'm learning to trust the orchestra more and more. The orchestra 
loves to have that responsibility. The musicians are forced to listen, to look, 
to know their parts so well. . . . Often, it's a welcome relief for them." 
</P>
<P>
Fleisher briefly ventured a return to two-handed playing in 1982, after years 
of physical therapy and surgery to alleviate his carpal tunnel syndrome. But 
the effort, although hailed by critics, turned out to be physically premature. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, he made that appearance with the Baltimore Symphony conducted by 
Sergiu Comissiona, who was to lead the Pacific in this week's concerts. 
Comissiona, however, withdrew and cited his new duties as music director for 
the Vancouver Symphony. Fleisher said Carl St. Clair, the Pacific's newly 
appointed music director, recommended his serving as conductor. 
</P>
<P>
"Carl remembered that I had done an almost identical program when I had my 60th 
birthday present -- which was the Boston Symphony itself," Fleisher said. "I 
got to conduct it on the evening of my birthday. He asked me if I would do that 
here. I was delighted." 
</P>
<P>
Fleisher cited three main influences in his life -- conductor Pierre Monteux, 
with whom he made his debut at age 14; pianist Artur Schnabel, and Szell of the 
Cleveland Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in my life," he said, "have I met a musician who had anything negative 
to say about Monteux, who was one of the most benign, lovable and accomplished 
conductors -- and self-effacing -- and of great historical importance. 
</P>
<P>
"Isaac Stern put it most succinctly when he said, 'When you play with Monteux, 
if you're going to sneeze a year from now, he has a handkerchief ready.' There 
was that kind of security." 
</P>
<P>
Schnabel was simply "the most powerful influence in my life." 
</P>
<P>
"I almost can't talk about him," Fleisher said. "I came to him when I was 9 and 
stayed with him for 10 years. He shaped my entire awareness of music and 
provided me with the knowledge that music-making is a sublime activity -- can 
be, should be." 
</P>
<P>
And of Szell, whom Fleisher describes as "one of the most powerful influences 
in my life as an artist," he said: "His ear was probably one of the most 
refined and demanding of his time. He created an orchestra such that 90 people 
played as one." 
</P>
<P>
Szell, of course, was also known as a severe disciplinarian. 
</P>
<P>
"He was only as demanding on other people as he was on himself," Fleisher 
countered. "I don't think that orchestras are against that kind of work. I 
don't think they want to be slovenly. They want to participate. He might not 
have been the world's greatest diplomat. But that was part of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Fleisher saw another side to Szell. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing in London, and Szell invited me to his room to sing through 
the piece -- I think it was the 'Emperor' Concerto -- because he didn't have a 
piano in his hotel room. We were sitting at a table and I was drumming, playing 
the table, while he was singing and whistling (the orchestra's part). At some 
point, he stopped me and said, 'You made a mistake.' And I said, 'But I've 
never played this table before.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, that sort of good-humored give and take is hardly typical of the 
conductor-musician relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"Conducting is not a very democratic affair," Fleisher said. "Conductors stand 
higher than the musicians. Psychologically, that's not a good position for an 
orchestra player to be in. On top of that, he has a stick in his hand. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But one is not up there to be loved. One is up there to be respected, and if 
you have the wherewithal to command the respect of the orchestra, they will 
play." 
</P>
<P>
On at least one count, Fleisher sees the role of the conductor as precisely the 
same as that of any musician. 
</P>
<P>
"Schnabel likened the role of a performer to that of an alpine mountain guide 
who knew how to get you up to the top of the mountain, but the purpose was for 
you to enjoy the view from the top," he said. "You are only the indispensable 
middleman." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Fleisher will conduct the Pacific Symphony in music by Beethoven, Ravel 
and Rachmaninoff at 8 p.m. today and Thursday at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Fleisher will also be soloist 
in Ravel's Concerto for the Left Hand. Tickets: $9 to $30. Information: (714) 
474-4233.

SOUTH AFRICA'S CLEGG HAS A SONG OF CHANGE; 
</P>
<P>
APARTHEID: HE ESCHEWS DIRECT POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT IN BATTLING SEGREGATION. 
INSTEAD HE WORKS THROUGH HIS BIRACIAL BAND.

President Johnny Clegg? 
</P>
<P>
Not likely. The South African pop musician has long been a leader in the fight 
against apartheid, and there's been some talk that political changes in his 
country could boost him to a role of statesman/artist, a la Czechoslovakia's 
playwright-President Vaclav Havel. 
</P>
<P>
"No, thank you," said Clegg, a short but solid, curly haired singer, sitting in 
a Beverly Hills hotel lounge recently. "The problem in South Africa is there 
are already too many politicians, too many political things spinning around 
which have clouded the issues for years." 
</P>
<P>
Clegg, 36, believes he can be more effective through his music than in 
politics. Clegg and his band Savuka -- the biracial make-up of which is still 
revolutionary in South Africa -- will be opening for Tracy Chapman tonight and 
Thursday at the Greek Theatre, Saturday at the Pacific Amphitheatre and Monday 
at San Diego State University's Open Air Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"I can accomplish more raising the issues on stage, you see," he said. "I'm not 
accountable to a party and don't have to present things in a certain way. . . . 
My position has always been that it's through cultural interaction and change 
that true change happens in the everyday life of the working man. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a racist and I'm to convince you about certain things, I believe I 
can do it far more convincingly if I expose you to the food, dress style, the 
dance, the different things of the culture you detest, the race group you 
detest. I'll present them to you as human and there might be one or two things 
you like, and things you dislike, but you will have experienced them. Culture 
to me has to do with experience. That's the whole point." 
</P>
<P>
Few people can claim more cultural experience than Clegg. "I'm a patchwork," he 
said of his background. He was born in England to a Zimbabwe-born woman of 
Lithuanian Jewish heritage. When his mother remarried a journalist with a 
fascination for Africa, the family moved to Zimbabwe, then to Zambia and then 
to South Africa. By the time Clegg was 12 he had attended six different schools 
(some biracial, some white-only) in three different countries and shared his 
stepfather's love for African culture. 
</P>
<P>
Defying both convention and law, he enlisted a black musician to tutor him in 
traditional styles and by 15 he was playing and dancing at otherwise all-black 
gatherings. It was here that he first was made aware of the politics that come 
along with South African culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a migrant labor hostel in Johannesburg in a room of some 30 or 40 
people," he recalled. "We were all dancing inside and the police had a raid on 
the hostel. There's lots of faction fighting in the hostels, every weekend 
people are killed, stabbed." 
</P>
<P>
The police initially thought this young white boy was being held captive. When 
he told them he was there voluntarily, he was whisked home, where his mother 
was given a stern lecture not to let him go there anymore and warned that if he 
had not been a minor he would have been jailed. 
</P>
<P>
But Clegg persuaded his mother that he knew what he was doing and eventually 
became such a fixture in the black music and cultural scene that he was 
ceremonially inducted into three Zulu tribes and became a founder and vice 
president of the social-change-minded South African Musicians Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
A teen-age partnership with black musician Sipho Mchunu -- largely banned from 
public performances -- evolved into the band Juluka, which had an international 
hit with the song "Scatterlings of Africa." After Mchunu quit, Clegg 
reconstituted the band as Savuka, which means, "we have risen." 
</P>
<P>
With its third album, "Cruel, Crazy, Beautiful World," Clegg and Savuka have 
achieved a full melding of traditional Zulu styles and modern Western pop, as 
well as a global outlook in such songs as "One (Hu)man One Vote" and "Warsaw 
1943 (I Never Betrayed the Revolution)." The album has cemented Clegg's 
superstar status both at home and in Europe (he's particularly huge in France) 
and is affording him increased exposure in North America. 
</P>
<P>
This international success has become increasingly important to Clegg, who 
believes that the struggles in South Africa only presage what is coming for the 
rest of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
"In a kind of peculiar way South Africa is a preview of what is going to happen 
in the next 20 years with the politics of globalism," he said. "The East meets 
the West, the North will meet the South, and in that a lot of the problems that 
South Africa is now being forced to address in a very short time will have to 
be addressed: race, class, ethnicity, language, First World, Third World, rural 
and urban. And I really believe there will be a South African model: Either we 
tried to do it this way and failed, or it kind of worked." 
</P>
<P>
And his own experiences as a "patchwork man"? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a prototype model," he said, half-jokingly. "There are others following. . 
. . Maybe."

HAPPIER STRAWBERRY STILL STRUGGLES

In time, Darryl Strawberry says, he will be able to mix a competitive meanness 
with the mellowness that defines his personality since his treatment for 
alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
And it is only a matter of time, he believes, until he regains a productivity 
of the type that has been absent since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"What is time?" asks New York Met Manager Dave Johnson, who may be running out 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
"A month? Two months? Six? A year?" 
</P>
<P>
Johnson sat in the visitors' dugout at Dodger Stadium, flipping through the 
calendar of his mind, knowing that Strawberry presents as much of a dilemma to 
the Mets as when the questions dealt with the albatross of his potential. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, they still do and always will. 
</P>
<P>
It is simply that now, as Strawberry looks for a way to blend the pressure-free 
calm he derived from his treatment program with the fire needed on the field, 
the dilemma is significantly affected by the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Batting .239 in the wake of a season in which he hit .225, Strawberry becomes 
eligible for free agency when it ends. So the questions facing the Mets are 
these: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Should they try to trade him now or risk getting nothing in return if he 
leaves as a free agent? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Should they try to sign him to a multiyear contract at the going rate of $3 
million a season, despite believing it would be unjustified, or run the risk of 
waiting until the season ends -- by which time Strawberry might have generated 
a justifiable bidding war at more than $3 million a year? 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine that at some point this season we'll sit down and discuss the 
situation with Darryl," General Manager Frank Cashen said at Dodger Stadium. 
"It's just that salaries have gotten out of hand, and there are differences of 
opinion as to what constitutes a $3-million-a-year player." 
</P>
<P>
With a $1.8-million salary in 1990, Strawberry disputed Cashen, saying he won't 
discuss his future or a possible contract with the Mets until the season is 
over and he has first discussed it with his family. 
</P>
<P>
The former Crenshaw High star has said that playing in Southern California with 
the Dodgers, Angels or San Diego Padres would be nirvana, but he doesn't want 
to deal with that issue now. 
</P>
<P>
For the present, as part of his recovery, he doesn't want to put any more 
pressure on himself than what he faces for nine innings each day. 
</P>
<P>
He is a distinctly different personality since his spring treatment at a New 
York clinic. The edge is no longer that of a razor. The tendency toward anger 
has faded. He continues to explore this new road at Alcoholics Anonymous 
meetings in Manhattan and cities throughout the National League. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really start drinking until I had to deal with the pressures in New 
York and the expectations people put on me," Strawberry said. "I wasn't a 
stumbling, falling-down drunk, but I'd get angry, nasty, selfish, and the more 
I drank, the more pressure I felt I was relieving when, in fact, I was just 
creating more." 
</P>
<P>
An abusive incident involving his wife, Lisa, at their Los Angeles home in 
January might have led Strawberry to the realization that he needed help. He 
said he is proud that he sought it on his own, that no one forced him into it. 
Lisa is tattooed on his left arm, and he still has her on his heart. They are 
together this summer in New York, along with Darryl Jr., 5, and their daughter, 
Diamond, 2. 
</P>
<P>
The change in Strawberry can be seen in the religious medal he wears around his 
neck, replacing the replica of a gun he had worn in 1988 after the National 
League's most-valuable-player voting was announced. The award went to Kirk 
Gibson of the Dodgers, and Strawberry thought he had been robbed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling of contentment knowing you can go through a day sober," 
Strawberry said. "I know it's a disease and the battle with it goes on for a 
lifetime, but the inner happiness I have now is more gratifying than anything." 
</P>
<P>
All of that -- his feelings of contentment and happiness -- pleases a Met 
management that has too often had to cope with an angry and stressed right 
fielder, but there is still concern: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Over his slumping bat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Over what some in the Mets' family view as a passive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets were told by doctors that Strawberry may need time to merge his two 
worlds -- that of the recovering alcoholic trying to defuse pressure and 
stress, and that of the big league player waging war with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm kind of mellow right now, and that's part of the recovery," he 
said. "I'm trying to take things as they come and not force anything, not take 
myself out of what I'm trying to accomplish. I know I have to get meaner and I 
will . . . but right now I want to take it all in stride." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Johnson takes it cautiously when discussing Strawberry's attitude, 
choosing to link it with his struggle at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"If a guy is hitting 40 to 50 points less than he's capable of, he often 
appears to have less intensity," Johnson said. "If Darryl was 40 or 50 points 
higher, the perception would be that he is very intense. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I think he's like a lot of our hitters -- not as patient or 
selective as they could be, trying too hard, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing is certain: There are too many times when I've seen him unhappy, so 
I'd rather see him happy and having difficulty, because I know in the long run 
it's best for Darryl and his family. I mean, he still has his whole career 
ahead of him." 
</P>
<P>
At 28 and in his eighth season with the Mets, Strawberry's dismal batting 
average is compounded by the fact he has driven in only 15 runs and hit only 
five home runs, ending a string of 40 at-bats without a homer Monday night when 
he hit a prodigious blast off Mike Morgan of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
His 1990 struggle is a continuation of 1989, when he batted .224 with runners 
in scoring position, drove in 77 runs, his second-worst RBI total, and hit 29 
home runs, 10 fewer than in '87 and '88. 
</P>
<P>
The 77 RBIs and 29 homers might represent decent totals for most players, but 
Strawberry is judged by a different yardstick, particularly now, when the Mets 
have to make a decision on his future and he must be the bellwether for a 
strangely impassive team that is last in the league in hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"Darryl has got to hit for us to win, and he hasn't hit consistently since the 
middle of the 1988 season," Cashen said. "When your best hitter goes that way, 
it's only natural to be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Said Strawberry: "I know I have to be productive. I've been that way in the 
past, so there's no reason to think I won't be that way again. The confidence 
is there. I've hit the ball well on this trip. I'm not going to start worrying 
or doubting, putting that pressure on myself. It can only go so bad, and I've 
got 400 at-bats to go." 
</P>
<P>
In that regard, Strawberry is frequently out early to work on his mechanics, 
which along with mellow and mean is one of the three M's he is attempting to 
adjust.
