THEATRE LAB COMMISSIONS SEVEN PLAYS

<P>
With $200,000 in hand from a recent Ford Foundation grant, the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center's Latino Theatre Lab has commissioned six Latino playwrights to 
write seven plays for the lab to produce starting next year. 
</P>
<P>
The plays are the first installment of 17 new plays the lab hopes to present in 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
The first of these presentations will be one of two plays to be written by 
Cuban playwright Eduardo Machado. Now referred to as "Project X-2," Machado's 
next play is expected to deal with the denial of one's sexual identity. It will 
be directed by Simon Callow in a February, 1990, production. 
</P>
<P>
The author of the recent Theatre Center production "A Burning Beach," Machado 
was the only one of the six playwrights not present at a recent press 
conference at the center to announce the commissions. The other five 
playwrights are Jimmy Santiago Baca, Harry Gamboa Jr., Sam Garcia, Cherrie 
Moraga and Milcha Sanchez-Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Latino Theatre Lab Director Jose Luis Valenzuela said the commissions represent 
a milestone for the 10-year-old Latino Theatre Lab because "this is the first 
time we're commissioning playwrights, and they will have (lab ensemble) actors 
at their disposal." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela also said he chose the six playwrights from a field of 18. Because 
of the great diversity of the Los Angeles Latino community, he said, his goal 
was to "find totally differentvoices who all have something different to say 
about how they see the world." 
</P>
<P>
Baca, a New Mexico poet and novelist, will write his first play for the lab. A 
former prison inmate, Baca taught himself to read and write during four years 
in solitary confinement. His play will deal with "how much are (Latinos) 
willing to give away (their) identity for the various token prizes society may 
offer," Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
Gamboa, a founding member of the Chicano art group ASCO, wrote the conceptual 
drama "Jetter's Jinx," which was performed at the Theatre Center in 1985. His 
new two-act play with music will deal with "urban issues and the desire to 
remain invisible, part of the phantom culture in the city, the people you 
pretend not to know and hope you don't see when you look in the mirror," Gamboa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, whose play "The Land of Plenty," was given a staged reading at South 
Coast Repertory earlier this month, will adapt a Jack London short story titled 
"The Boxer." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez-Scott will also submit an adaptation. The author of the previous lab 
productions "Roosters" and "Stone Wedding," she will adapt Bizet's "Carmen" in 
the magical realism style that characterized her earlier works, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Moraga, a San Francisco poet and playwright, will look at the repercussions of 
exposing farm workers to pesticide spraying -- in her play, "Heroes and 
Saints." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bushnell, the Theatre Center's artistic producing director, said the grant 
covers only the development of the plays. Productions will be part of the 
theater's regular season offerings.

NEW EAST L.A. COLLEGE PRESIDENT 'EXCITED' OVER PLANS FOR SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The newly appointed president of East Los Angeles College, Omero Suarez, says 
his plans for the college include working closely with the community, striving 
to raise the rate of students who go on to four-year colleges and universities, 
and improving some of the physical facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited," he said of his appointment. "I think East Los Angeles 
College holds tremendous potential to service minority students." Los Angeles 
Community College District officials announced his appointment April 20. 
</P>
<P>
Suarez, 42, is currently head of the Valencia junior college division of the 
University of New Mexico. Suarez, as the first director of the division located 
south of Albuquerque, is credited with leading it from a tiny storefront 
operation in 1981 to a permanent campus of more than 1,000 students, half of 
whom are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Chicano migrant workers, Suarez will begin July 1 at the campus in 
Monterey Park, where 68% of the 12,300 students are Latino and 20% are Asian. 
He will succeed Arthur Avila, the president for nine years who was forced out 
last September after disputes with faculty and district trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three finalists, Suarez was the only one from outside the Los Angeles 
district. Observers said the district wanted a fresh face to deal with 
administrative turmoil and a high student dropout rate. The other finalists 
were Evelyn Wong, acting president of Los Angeles Trade-Tech College, and Raul 
Cardoza, a vice president at East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees originally voted 5 to 2 for Suarez, but that vote was later 
changed to a unanimous one. 
</P>
<P>
Suarez stressed that his family history makes him very "sensitive to people who 
do not speak English and who have trouble with employment." Seeking 
agricultural work, his parents moved the family to Nebraska from Texas when 
Suarez was 5 years old. To this day, his mother does not speak English, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Suarez is the fourth oldest of nine children and was the first to attend 
college. He has a bachelor's degree from Chadron State College in Nebraska, a 
master's from the University of Nebraska and his doctorate in higher education 
administration from the University of Oklahoma, where a decade ago he headed 
the Chicano studies service center. He is married to a businesswoman who has a 
doctorate in adult education; they have two children. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Garvin, president of the Los Angeles Community College board, praised 
Suarez's record in Valencia: "He created a college out of nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Sources in New Mexico familiar with Suarez agreed with that assessment. They 
said that he has sometimes clashed with faculty over cuts and changes in 
program directions but that he is generally very well respected and the 
university there did not want to lose him. 
</P>
<P>
Suarez will earn $79,448, officials said, and will be given moving expenses.

INS MAY NEED ITS OWN REFORMS TO KEEP UP WITH IMMIGRATION ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK del OLMO, Del Olmo is a Times editorial writer and columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years after Congress enacted the landmark Immigration Reform and Control 
Act of 1986, billing it as the answer to immigration problems that had been 
festering for 30 years, people are calling for new laws to deal with problems 
that the authors of the law did not anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
The reform act, based on the assumption that jobs are what lure illegal 
immigrants here, made it unlawful for employers to hire them. To balance this 
restrictionist intent, the law included an "amnesty" for illegal aliens, 
allowing them to legalize their status if they had been here since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Many critics questioned how well this simple approach to a complex phenomenon 
would work. But the law was enacted because immigration had become a political 
issue, requiring some kind of action. It has not taken long for the shiny new 
law to become tarnished in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
It is increasingly clear that the new law has not stopped illegal immigration. 
There has been a decrease in the number of people trying to slip into the 
United States since the law went into effect, but hundreds of people continue 
to be arrested daily sneaking across the U.S.-Mexico border. In the first full 
year after the new law went into effect, 940,000 illegal immigrants were 
arrested there, down from 1.6 million in 1986 but still one of the highest 
number of arrests ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
So officials of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service are talking 
tough about new measures to keep unwanted people out. One example is the 
agency's decision to publicize a drainage ditch planned for the Otay Mesa south 
of San Diego as its newest weapon against smugglers. In fact, the ditch is a 
routine flood-control project needed by Tijuana as much as by San Diego. 
Mexican officials even cooperated in planning it until the INS made a big deal 
out of the matter, turning it into a political embarrassment for them. 
</P>
<P>
If the INS wants to improve border enforcement, it doesn't need new 
fortifications. And it doesn't need more Border Patrol agents, since almost 
1,000 were hired under the 1986 immigration law and there is only scant 
evidence that they are being used more efficiently than their predecessors. 
What's needed is a reorganization of the chief agency charged with enforcing 
the law -- the INS. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the INS problems, bureaucratically speaking, is the fact that it is 
one of several agencies, along with the Customs Service and Coast Guard, 
charged with keeping our borders secure. It will surprise nobody that there are 
sometimes lapses in coordination among so many agencies. That is why the 
General Accounting Office has several times called for their consolidation into 
a single border management agency. Congress has been reluctant to pursue the 
plan because of pressure from government employee unions that fear a loss of 
jobs. Still, it is a worthwhile idea. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond better border control, this country needs to put more thought and 
money into absorbing immigrants. At present, this responsibility also falls to 
the INS, but it never gets the financial support and attention that the 
agency's police functions do. That is one reason the reform act's amnesty 
program has been so haphazardly run: nobody's ever tried to legalize so many 
people before on such a large scale, even in the INS. 
</P>
<P>
I can't help but wonder if naturalization wouldn't be handled better by another 
agency, say a bureau of immigration in the Labor Department. A new immigration 
agency would not add needless bureaucracy, either, for it would have many other 
important responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Although most Americans see immigration as a problem, in the near future the 
problem may be that we don't have enough immigrants. That could happen if our 
birth rate continues to decline while our native-born population continues to 
grow older and live longer. We may then need more young workers -- not fewer -- 
from countries such as Mexico, and that means we'll need an agency to assess 
our labor needs and regulate the entry of people to fill those jobs.

U.S. FINALLY GETS A KICK AT WORLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Fernando Dominguez 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In July, 1950, the attention of soccer fans around the world turned to Brazil, 
where 13 countries competed at the fourth World Cup tournament. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year when the exuberant hosts pulled out the stops to make it the 
greatest extravaganza of its kind. They even built the 200,000-seat Maracana 
Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, which remains the largest soccer arena anywhere, 
specifically for the competition. That's where they reckoned the national team 
would be crowned champion. 
</P>
<P>
And it was the year when the United States made its last appearance at one of 
the quadrennial events. 
</P>
<P>
Things didn't exactly work out for the Brazilians as they had hoped. Little, 
unassuming Uruguay shocked them with a 2-1 victory before 199,850 -- still an 
attendance record -- in the final match. The stunning upset allegedly caused 
eight deaths from heart attacks in Montevideo, Uruguay's capital. 
</P>
<P>
That was slightly more dramatic than the uproar caused in Britain a few days 
earlier by another unlikely result. 
</P>
<P>
In that one at Belo Horizonte, the spunky Americans, sparked by a goal by 
Haiti-born Larry Gaetjens, blanked all-mighty England, 1-0. The defeat prompted 
British newspapers to carry black stripes on their front pages. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the last hurrah for the United States at the Cup. The team lost 
its other two games in the first round and has never made it out of the 
regionals since. 
</P>
<P>
That could change soon. For the first time in 40 years, the United States 
stands a reasonable chance of making it to the World Cup finals. It is down to 
its last phase of qualifying matches in the CONCACAF (Confederacion Norte, 
Centroamericana y del Caribe de Futbol) group. 
</P>
<P>
To join the party next year in Italy, the United States needs to finish no 
worse than second in the five-nation group that includes Costa Rica, Guatemala, 
Honduras, El Salvador and Trinidad and Tobago. The teams play a round-robin, 
home-and-away format that will run through most of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico has been the perennial powerhouse of the confederation, but it got 
caught sending adults to do boys' work at a junior tournament last year and was 
kicked off international competition for two years. The suspension turned 
CONCACAF into a free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have an incredible advantage because Mexico is out," said Tabares 
(Tab) Ramos, a Uruguay-born, 22-year-old midfielder who scored the only goal in 
a 1-0 U.S. victory over Costa Rica on April 30. Ramos, who played for the U.S. 
Olympic team at Seoul, said, "We have reached a level where we don't accept 
anything but a victory." 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Hugo Perez agrees, but takes a more cautious approach. The 25-year-old 
forward from El Salvador, a U.S. Olympian in 1984 and a veteran of Major Indoor 
Soccer League action, knows that overconfidence can be lethal. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Mexico is not playing, all the other teams will play above their heads," 
Perez said. "You have to be very careful at all times." 
</P>
<P>
That's precisely how Bob Gansler, the U.S. coach, wants his troops to think. 
Gansler, 47, is a former internationally experienced player and coach. He 
replaced Lothar Osiander at the helm of the national squad in January. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Mexico you have no favorites. It's a horse race between the other 
five. Any of the teams can finish 1-2," the Hungary-born Gansler said. "We have 
a realistic chance. It's a great opportunity for our players to get to Italy, 
but we cannot get caught up in arrogance and think we have an automatic pass." 
</P>
<P>
Others believe that the team has graduated from understudy to headliner. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most competitive team (the United States) has had in many years," 
said Peruvian Tony Tirado, the director of sports programming for the New 
York-based Spanish-language Telemundo television network and a commentator on 
World Cup matches since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"They play a European-style game, somewhat mechanical and without the picardia 
(shrewdness) of the Latin teams, but always playing positively and looking for 
the opportunities. They create good counterattacks and don't play as timidly 
and defensively as before." 
</P>
<P>
Much of that success has to do with a new breed of more technically sound 
players. Chief among them are Perez, Ramos, forwards Peter Vermes and Brent 
Goulet, and midfielder and team captain Rick Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Vermes, 22, plays for Raba ETO in Hungary and is a constant threat to score; 
Goulet, 24, played last season with a British club and is a former collegiate 
star at Warner-Pacific College in Portland, Ore., where he scored 108 career 
goals, and Davis, 30, is an 11-year veteran who has played more international 
games than any other American player. 
</P>
<P>
"We have evolved as far as our technical ability to play the game," Gansler 
said. "There's much more variety offensively and defensively because the 
players are better." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the team has improved enough to make it to Italy next year will be 
answered Nov. 19 when the Americans travel to Trinidad for their last CONCACAF 
match. 
</P>
<P>
If the team pulls it off, it would overcome 40 years of frustration in 
international soccer.

A mother's 21-month jail stay should end because further incarceration won't 
end a bitter child custody battle or persuade her to reveal where she has 
hidden her daughter, a Washington appeals court was told. Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, 
a prominent plastic surgeon, was sent to the District of Columbia Jail on civil 
contempt charges in August, 1987, after refusing to produce her daughter Hilary 
for court-ordered visits with Eric Foretich, Morgan's ex-husband and the girl's 
father. Morgan said she hid the girl because Foretich had sexually abused her; 
Foretich has denied those charges. Morgan has been in prison ever since, and 
the 6-year-old Hilary's whereabouts are unknown. "She will not trade her 
freedom for her daughter's safety," Stephen Sachs, Morgan's attorney, told a 
three-judge District of Columbia Court of Appeals panel that was reviewing a 
lower court judge's decision to keep Morgan behind bars.

The United States gave Somalia weapons that were used to viciously quell an 
insurgency, then provided disaster assistance to the victims the next month, 
the General Accounting Office reported. The congressional watchdog agency found 
that a $1.4-million U.S. shipment of M-16 automatic rifles and 2.3 million 
rounds of ammunition arrived in Somalia in June, 1988, just as the army 
launched massive artillery and aerial shellings to crush a rebellion in the 
north. Then, "starting in August, 1988, the U.S. government responded to the 
emergency with $1.9 million in disaster assistance to help the victims of the 
conflict," the GAO report said. Since the attacks, the Administration has 
suspended further weapons deliveries.

A U.N. report said that it is too late to halt all the effects from global 
warming and that nations should begin to prepare for rising sea levels and crop 
damage expected from the "greenhouse effect." Experts who submitted the report 
to a meeting in Kenya of the U.N. Environment Program's governing council 
reiterated the need to slow down the rate of climatic warming by such measures 
as encouraging a switch away from fossil fuels. They also said that rising 
oceans could inundate lands now settled by 1 billion people in the next 60 
years and urged governments to discourage large-scale coastal developments and 
get ready to help existing seaside enterprises that eventually have to be 
abandoned.

Two white South Africans were hanged for murder, but lawyers won a last-minute 
stay of execution for two black political activists. A spokesman for the South 
African group Lawyers for Human Rights said Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee 
issued the stays to allow lawyers to present new evidence. The two black men 
were convicted of the "necklace" killing -- in which a gasoline-filled tire is 
placed around the victim's neck and set afire -- of a black police officer. The 
two white men who were hanged were convicted in separate cases of murder and 
robbery.

Declaring that federal policies are wasting far more energy than could ever be 
pumped from oil and gas fields off the California coast, a parade of witnesses 
Wednesday urged a task force appointed by President Bush to push for a national 
energy policy that stresses conservation and development of alternative energy 
sources. The strongly worded pleas, combined with opposition to offshore oil 
and gas drilling by most of the state's ranking constitutional officers, came 
as the President's Outer Continental Shelf Leasing and Development Task Force 
pressed its review of controversial plans to open up millions of acres of 
offshore tracts to oil and gas development. Bush appointed the task force March 
21 to review those issues and directed it to report back to him next January.

Tokyo police reported searching the offices and homes of a Japanese machinery 
maker and its executives on suspicion that the company illegally exported 
sensitive nuclear reactor material to East Germany. The firm, Prometron 
Technics Ltd. of Tokyo, was suspected of exporting the material used for 
nuclear reactor control rods on several occasions between 1986 and 1987 in 
violation of international and domestic regulations. The material, known as 
hafnium, is a rare metal substance. News reports said the hafnium, which the 
firm imported from the United States, is used chiefly in military reactors 
aboard nuclear-powered ships.

AETNA ENDS ITS MORATORIUM

Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, the ninth-largest seller of property and casualty 
insurance in California, said that it is resuming sales to new customers of 
auto, homeowner and commercial liability policies. The announcement ended a 
two-week moratorium on such sales while the company evaluated how the state 
Supreme Court decision upholding most of Proposition 103 would be enforced. A 
company spokesman said Aetna had concluded from statements made May 11 by state 
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie that the state intends to allow the 
insurance industry a fair rate of return in California for each line of 
insurance. Numerous insurers have expressed satisfaction at Gillespie's 
decision to allow a profit for each line of insurance, while a number of 
consumer groups have criticized the decision.

HOLDING PARENTS RESPONSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pillsbury opens his column by saying, "It is a typically American response to a 
serious social problem: Make it a crime." 
</P>
<P>
I feel that most Americans would agree with the reverse of this -- that the 
typical response to a crime is to make it into a social problem and thus 
absolve the criminal of guilt and not punish, but rather rehabilitate him. 
</P>
<P>
Crimes are committed by criminals and criminals must not be absolved of 
responsibility for them. It isn't society that kills bystanders from moving 
cars or mugs grandfathers for a few dollars, it isn't society that holds up 
liquor stores or bilks investors -- it is the criminal! 
</P>
<P>
It has become fashionable, for the last several decades, to make society the 
culprit. We are told that criminals are simply expressing their anger, that 
their behavior is a logical consequence of being oppressed and discriminated 
against. If this is so, then an overwhelming majority of Holocaust survivors or 
Vietnamese refugees should have been criminals. The fact is that there is 
comparatively little crime among them. 
</P>
<P>
The time has come to reject the guilt trip laid on us by the sociologists and 
shrinks, and other well-meaning but unrealistic people. Our society is being 
threatened by the barbarians among us, those who do not accept or even know of 
the values we share -- sanctity of human life, personal responsibility, 
obligation and consideration towards others. These barbarians have forfeited 
their right to live among civilized people; like animals they should be locked 
and kept in cages.

PORNOGRAPHY AND 'ADULT CHOICES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reference to your editorial, there is more at stake than mere freedom of 
speech. There is also freedom of religion at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-pornography laws were enacted at the request of different religious 
groups who wanted to jail and silence all those who do not believe in "original 
sin," and their doctrine that sex is evil. 
</P>
<P>
Since they could not directly jail the unbelievers, different religious groups 
got laws enacted by working through surrogates and by using a propaganda 
campaign that any sexual depiction was "dirty, filthy, and unfit for human 
consumption." 
</P>
<P>
However, many Americans do not believe in original sin, or that sex is dirty, 
etc. 
</P>
<P>
More than a million adult video cassettes are rented each week. Nor, as the 
propagandists would have you believe, does viewing such material lead directly 
to violent sex crimes: If it did, there would be over 1 million such crimes per 
week. 
</P>
<P>
In short, no matter how much religionists may want the manufacture, sale, and 
viewing of such films to be a criminal event, they should stand back and make 
this a personal, rather than a governmental, issue. 
</P>
<P>
By keeping up the lie that adult materials cause sex crimes in an era when many 
households can prove that to be a lie, the credibility of religionists goes 
down the drain totally.

PLANTING TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Eastern Sierra Environmental and Water Conservation Assn. would like to 
have Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley plant his 5 million trees in the Owens 
Valley where the city of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has denuded 
an entire valley so that Los Angeles can grow out of all reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
It is only right that these trees be planted in the Owens Valley where the rain 
cycle once again would be allowed to fulfill nature's need. It should be 
considered criminal to destroy one part of California so that another part can 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California depends on water stored in the Eastern Sierra Mountains. 
Destroy this environment by denuding its valleys and killing its trees and 
nature's cycle is changed. So we ask that the Los Angeles DWP replace the trees 
and vegetation that have been systematically destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Planting more trees in Los Angeles will bring about more destruction to our 
environment in the Eastern High Sierra watershed, because more water will be 
taken for these 5 million trees and you gain nothing. Killing one area and 
planting another is a waste of taxpayers' money and the precious environment.

BUS SAFETY

Shame on the members of the federal committee who "rejected the idea of 
requiring seat belts on the nation's . . . school buses, concluding that it 
would cost $40 million and save an average of just one life a year . . ." if 
used by only half the students on each bus (Part I, May 9)! How can anyone put 
a price tag on the life of a child? Incidentally, that same issue of The Times 
carried a story of a school bus accident in which 8 children were injured. 
</P>
<P>
These same folks who rejected the school bus seat belt idea would undoubtedly 
think nothing of spending $40 million on a weapon for the Defense Department, 
but heaven forbid using it to protect our kids! Anyone who cares for our 
youngsters should contact his or her representative and suggest we purchase one 
less bomber and use the money to buy seat belts for our school buses!

Tian An Men Square is converted into the world's largest peace park. Images 
from China are telling the world that nonviolence is effective, both as a 
conviction of the heart and a tactic of the street. The eruption of nonviolent 
disobedience has brought the Chinese dictators to a state of powerless 
confusion that could never have happened as quickly or been as widespread had 
the students chosen guns or bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Without exception, every show of force -- nonviolent or violent force -- has as 
its goal the changing of minds. George Bush sends 2,000 troops to Panama to 
persuade Manuel Noriega to change his mind about ruling his country. Bank 
robbers aim guns at tellers to change their minds about who should own the 
money in the drawer. Mahatma Gandhi fasted to change England's mind about who 
should rule India. 
</P>
<P>
Every conflict or problem, whether among individuals or governments, has been, 
and will be, solved through the exertion of violent or nonviolent force. No 
third way exists. Choosing nonviolent noncooperation, the Chinese students are 
proving the truth of Gandhi's statement: "Government of the people is possible 
only so long as they consent either consciously or unconsciously to be 
governed." 
</P>
<P>
Eleven Latin American dictators were overthrown in this century through 
nonviolent strikes. Armed Philippine guerrillas tried for years to drive out 
the Marcos regime. He was defeated by nonviolent resistance. 
</P>
<P>
What has violence done? Compare El Salvador and Poland. At about the same time 
in the late 1970s, rebels in both countries wanted to change the mind of the 
government. In El Salvador, they attacked with guns. More than 70,000 have been 
killed on all sides. Governance has worsened. In Poland, they attacked with 
moral force. Few have died. Governance has improved. 
</P>
<P>
A massacre of innocents -- the "crackdown" that pessimists say is inevitable -- 
is still possible in China. What isn't possible is that the bravery and wisdom 
of the past two weeks of massive nonviolence can be canceled. The story still 
to be written is how this group of Chinese students came to understand so well 
and so boldly that the strength of truth and justice is superior to the 
weakness of guns and tanks.

ALREADY, SANDINISTAS SET TRAPS FOR NEXT ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOSCO MATAMOROS, Bosco Matamoros is a spokesman for the Nicaraguan 
Resistance. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Latin America, democratic governments are being consolidated; even Chile is 
preparing to celebrate a new era of freedom. Only three obstinate dictatorships 
remain: that of Castro, fossilized in history, that of Noriega, the self-made 
authoritarian, and that of Ortega, exponent of Latin Stalinism mixed with 
disguised Somocism. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan Sandinistas, while presenting themselves wrapped in the mantle 
of revolutionary heroism, in fact rule through a Stalinist mass security 
apparatus. Like the Somozas before them, they try to preserve the appearance of 
respect for democracy by accepting "periodic elections" against a tamed 
opposition. In reality, such elections are held not to put power at stake, but 
rather, as in Panama, to justify the continuation of the dictatorship. The 
Somozas governed Nicaragua in this manner for 40 years, and the Ortegas have 
done the same for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years of Sandinista rule have forced 2 of every 10 Nicaraguans into exile 
and 3 of every 10 into unemployment, and inflation of more than 50,000% per 
year has reduced the economy and the solution of the country's economic 
problems to an alchemist's formula. 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega's acceptance of the Esquipulas and San Salvador peace 
agreements was an acknowledgement of the historical failure of the Sandinista 
experiment and of Nicaragua's isolation. Confronted by the region's aspirations 
for democracy, Ortega finally had to accept the necessity for a new social pact 
and the resolution of national conflict through national dialogue and 
consensus. 
</P>
<P>
However, the new electoral and media laws, approved unilaterally by the 
Sandinista-controlled National Assembly, are another demonstration of 
Sandinista use of agreements as tactical retreats when faced with overwhelming 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
These laws disregard both the San Salvador agreements and the Nicaraguan 
opposition's proposal for balanced representation in the electoral system, as 
well as the recommendations of the electoral commissions of Costa Rica and 
Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
The majority in the Electoral Council remains assigned to the Sandinistas, and 
approval of opposition members rests with the Assembly, where the Sandinista 
party holds a controlling majority. This law does not recognize the right of 
access by the opposition to the list of registered voters, thereby enabling a 
manipulation of electoral mathematics by the party that controls the process: 
the Sandinistas. This legislation brings to life the political axiom long 
practiced by Latin American dictators: "He who counts the votes wins." 
</P>
<P>
The new media law further restricts freedom of the press, despite the 
Sandinistas' claims of being guided by similar legislation in democratic 
countries. Jail sentences and closure of the offending medium can be imposed 
for dissemination of information that "threatens public security and the 
national economy." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's strategy, which was evident during his recent trip to Europe, is to 
create the illusion of a democratic electoral process in Nicaragua, one in 
which opposition rights appear to be respected. Meanwhile, the Sandinistas' 
total control over the system leaves the opposition at present with two grim 
alternatives: collaborating with the regime in fraudulent elections or 
challenging the persuasion of bayonets. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition in Nicaragua is pluralistic, a broad alliance formed by 16 
political parties, ranging from the Communists to the Conservatives and 
including the Resistance. It constitutes a democratic alternative to the 
Sandinista front. And in truly free and honest elections, it is capable of 
winning, with the objective of forming a government of unity and 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic elections in Nicaragua would inspire confidence in political 
solutions and be a measure of the success of the Central American peace plan. 
The brutal violence of Gen. Manuel Noriega against the opposition in Panama may 
be a harbinger of what could occur again in Nicaragua. Already, supporters of 
the opposition have been beaten by security forces, and thousands of 
Nicaraguans remain in detention as political prisoners. The situation in these 
two countries signals the broader problems that today have the region at the 
crossroads between democracy and peace or dictatorial polarization and armed 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
In Esquipulas and elsewhere, the Sandinistas made a commitment to extend the 
regional movement toward democracy to the people of Nicaragua. Elections are 
set for next February. We Nicaraguans look to the Organization of American 
States, the Latin democracies and the international community for action that 
will ensure respect for the electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguans are willing to take the risks and bear the responsibility for 
democracy. We do not want others to carry out our struggle. Throughout history, 
Latin Americans have paid the price for U.S. failure to resolve internal debate 
over its own policy and for its vacillation between splendid isolation and 
unpredictable actions. Now we ask the international community, including the 
United States, to give consistent support to efforts to achieve democracy in 
our region.

Will China's protesters produce a Madison -- a constitutionalist, a codifier of 
liberty -- before there emerges a Napoleon whose riposte to philosophy is 
artillery? Probably not. But a 20th-Century Chinese thinker said when asked the 
significance of the French Revolution, "Too soon to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on 1989 from, say 2005, as Wordsworth looked back on 1789 from 
1805, many Chinese, young no more, will surely think, "Bliss was it in that 
dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven!" However, many may then feel 
as Wordsworth did about the long gone "hour of universal ferment" when "the 
soil of common life (was) too hot to tread upon." They may say as he did, "Now 
do I feel how I have been deceived."

<P>
The drama of China and the Soviet Union today lies in the tension between 
liberalization and democratization. The drama yet to come is the conflict 
between the dream of democratization and its achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Liberalization is what an authoritarian system's leaders concede to prevent 
democratization. China's students, and the others demonstrating in Beijing and 
other cities, ask for democratization, and China's situation has probably now 
gone beyond the point where further liberalization by the leadership could 
successfully deflect these demands. The government no longer appears to possess 
the ability to reimpose itself. Even if it managed to convince the army to 
attack the demonstrators, its authority has been wasted. 
</P>
<P>
The students condemn corruption, social inequalities, political compromise. But 
inequality and compromise are essential ingredients, and corruption an 
inescapable one, in the reforms Deng Xiaoping has been carrying out in China -- 
to the extravagant praise of the same foreign commentators who now celebrate 
the students. These are the reforms which have made China's economic progress 
possible and presaged today's events. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago another generation of students was against just the same three 
things: compromise, inequalities, corruption. They called themselves the Red 
Guard and demanded "extermination" of the "devils and demons of revisionism." 
They had a leader; they were driven by the messianism of the aging Mao Tse 
tung. 
</P>
<P>
There is no Mao today, thank God. There also is no evident force capable of 
taking the place of a ruined government and producing a constructive solution. 
There is messianism, unfocused. All that has happened is now to produce a 
marvelous abstraction, a shining, beautiful something. It is wonderful, 
alluring -- but no one should be surprised if it ends badly.

LEWIS' NAME ARISES AGAIN AT INQUIRY 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After gaining an international reputation as an expert in the administration of 
anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to track and field 
athletes, Dr. Jamie Astaphan said he was approached on two occasions last year 
to work with Carl Lewis and other members of the Santa Monica Track Club. 
</P>
<P>
But Astaphan, whose most famous patient was Lewis' sprint rival, Ben Johnson, 
testified Wednesday before the Canadian government's commission of inquiry into 
drug use by athletes that he ignored the overtures, which he said were made 
after meets last August at Ottawa, Canada, and Zurich, Switzerland, by Dr. Jack 
Scott. 
</P>
<P>
A former sports and political activist best known for his connection with Patty 
Hearst during her association with the Symbionese Liberation Army, Scott has 
maintained a high profile in athletics as a physical therapist. He has treated 
both Lewis and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from his Berkeley office, Scott gave a different 
version of the story. He said Astaphan approached him after Johnson finished 
second to Lewis in the 100 meters on Aug. 17 at Zurich and expressed 
frustration because of the Canadian sprinter's notoriously lackadaisical work 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
"Astaphan came up to me and said, 'Introduce me to Carl,' " Scott said. "He 
said, 'If I can do for Carl what I've done for Ben, it won't even be close.' " 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he did not consider acting upon Astaphan's request because of "his 
reputation that he gave out steroids and other illegal drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Douglas, the Santa Monica Track Club manager, said Scott told him 
essentially the same story during the Summer Olympics at Seoul last October, 
when Johnson was disqualified because of his positive test for an anabolic 
steroid after winning the 100 meters. As the runner-up, Lewis subsequently was 
awarded the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
When told of Astaphan's version, Douglas laughed. "That's obviously not true," 
he said, speaking by telephone from Santa Monica. "Number one, we're anti-drug. 
Number two, if anybody is going to approach anybody, it would be me. Jack Scott 
does not represent the Santa Monica Track Club." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time Lewis' name has emerged in testimony at the inquiry, the 
track and field phase of which entered its 13th week Wednesday. Johnson's 
coach, Charlie Francis, earlier suggested that Lewis might have been part of a 
plot to sabotage Johnson's drug test, a theory that since has been discounted 
by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan, who has been working with Canadian athletes since 1983 despite moving 
his practice almost three years ago to his native Caribbean island of St. 
Kitts, is expected to shed more light on Johnson's positive drug test before 
his testimony ends sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
But it was his threat to "spill every detail" about drug use in track and field 
that attracted a large group of reporters and photographers to the downtown 
office building that has been rented for the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
If Astaphan, who turned 43 Monday, intends to provide significant details, he 
is saving them for another day. He said an Eastern European athlete who was 
visiting Toronto in the fall of 1985 traded him 48 bottles of Miotolin, which 
contains the steroid furazabol, in exchange for 144 bottles of a vitamin 
mixture concocted by Astaphan. He said the athlete told him that he and his 
teammates referred to the drug as Estrogol as a diversionary tactic. There is 
no such drug as Estrogol. "They did not want, quotation marks, the damn 
Americans to get ahold of it," Astaphan said. 
</P>
<P>
But Astaphan had to be pressed by the commission's co-counsel, Robert P. 
Armstrong, before he would identify the athlete as an East German. 
</P>
<P>
Because he had never heard of furazabol, Astaphan said he consulted Canadian, 
European and U.S. doctors before prescribing it for the athletes he treated. 
</P>
<P>
When reminded by Armstrong that he was supposed to keep furazabol a secret from 
the Americans, Astaphan said that he did not consult the two Southern 
California doctors he believed to be most closely associated with U.S. track 
and field athletes, Dr. Robert Kerr of San Gabriel and Dr. Walter Jekot, who 
has offices in Los Angeles, Santa Ana and San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr, who is expected to testify next month, has admitted that he treated many 
Olympic athletes from throughout the world with anabolic steroids and other 
performance-enhancing drugs before 1984. But it was the first time Jekot's name 
has been introduced in testimony. "It's my understanding that Dr. Jekot is the 
one most American track and field athletes go to," Astaphan said. 
</P>
<P>
Jekot, who admitted to having formerly prescribed steroids to athletes, was 
nevertheless mystified by Astaphan's comments. "No, I haven't prescribed 
anabolics in my practice for the last two years," Jekot said Wednesday. "When I 
was prescribing them most of my patients were weightlifters, body builders and 
football players. I had very few track people. As a matter of fact, I can count 
them on my hand." 
</P>
<P>
Jekot said that he had a fairly extensive practice for more than 10 years in 
which he prescribed steroids to athletes and nonathletes. However, two years 
ago he was asked by the L.A. County Medical Assn. to halt the practice. Jekot 
said he has not prescribed the drugs since then. 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan said he began treating athletes with anabolic steroids in October, 
1983, after a sprinter, Angella Taylor Issajenko, returned from an appointment 
in San Gabriel with Kerr. He said Issajenko loaned him a copy of Kerr's book, 
which he called "a recipe book for taking steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Like Kerr, he said he felt bound by the Hippocratic Oath to see that Issajenko 
and his other patients, once they decided to start on a steroid program, used 
the drugs without endangering their health. "If they didn't get it from me, 
they would get it elsewhere," Astaphan testified. "They came to me for advice 
and supervision, and I felt it was my responsibility to get it to them." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he believes side effects associated with steroid use have been 
greatly exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
"Taken in the recommended doses, there are no side effects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He named 14 Canadian athletes he treated with steroids. Johnson was the third 
to start, beginning early in 1984. According to Francis' testimony, Johnson had 
been using steroids obtained from other sources since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan estimated that he gave Johnson 50 or 60 injections between 1984 and 
1988 and said he never doubted the sprinter was aware he was receiving 
steroids. Johnson, who is expected to testify in mid-June, has said that he 
never "knowingly" used banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very inquisitive," Astaphan said. 
</P>
<P>
But Astaphan said the only time he gave Johnson a drug containing stanozolol, 
the steroid found in his system at Seoul, was in 1984 or 1985. "After the fifth 
or sixth day, he wanted to quit because he couldn't run," Astaphan said. "He 
tightened up." 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan described Johnson as a less-than-ideal patient, testifying that he 
often did not keep his appointments. 
</P>
<P>
"Ben works by his own timetable," Astaphan said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Johnson arrived in a training camp at Tallahassee, Fla., in the spring 
of 1985 without the bottle containing his drug of choice at the time, 
testosterone, because he had forgotten to take it from Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
It was such behavior, Scott said, that Astaphan complained about when he tried 
to switch his allegiance last year to Lewis. But that was not Astaphan's 
testimony Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack Scott approached me in Zurich and said for me to meet with Carl Lewis and 
the (Santa Monica) group because he said they expressed an interest in working 
with me," Astaphan said. "I told him I wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
"He had made the same suggestion in Ottawa, that I work with the Santa Monica 
group, but I ignored him." 
</P>

DODGERS' STRENGTH SHOWS, 4-2; 
</P>
<P>
GIBSON HITS HOMER, LEARY PITCHES L.A. PAST PHILADELPHIA 
</P>

<P>
It wasn't exactly a night of firsts for the Dodgers, but for the first time in 
a long time Wednesday night: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tim Leary won, combining with reliever Jay Howell to beat the Philadelphia 
Phillies, 4-2, for his first victory in six starts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kirk Gibson hit a home run, his first since coming off the disabled list 
Tuesday, his first since April 10 and his first at Dodger Stadium since last 
Oct. 15, when his dramatic home run off Dennis Eckersley of the Oakland 
Athletics gave the Dodgers a 5-4 victory in Game 1 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda filled out a lineup card that included the names 
of Gibson, Eddie Murray and Mike Marshall. He had done that only 11 times 
previously in 41 games, and not once since April 25. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get some runs," Lasorda said beforehand of a lineup that 
featured Gibson, who is not fully recovered from a strained left hamstring 
injury, as the starting center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
They got them, if not exactly in large bunches. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph drove in two without hitting the ball out of the infield, and 
Gibson and Jeff Hamilton contributed solo home runs. 
</P>
<P>
All of this was against Phillie starter Larry McWilliams, who two weeks ago 
limited the Dodgers to five hits in a 2-0 victory at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Leary gave up six hits in eight innings, walked four and struck out 
six before he was helped in the ninth by Howell, who got the final three outs 
for his fifth save in five opportunities, and extended his scoreless-innings 
streak to 13. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing I made it to the ninth inning," said Leary, who hadn't won 
since April 16, when he beat the Houston Astros. "Fortunately, they hit some 
balls right at people. It's been tough the last few outings, when I kept us in 
the game but didn't win. You get in a drought like that and it's tough to keep 
your head up." 
</P>
<P>
Leary lifted his head in the second inning, when Dwayne Murphy hit a mammoth 
home run over the 395-foot sign in center field. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe he hit it that far on a 3-and-2 count," Leary said. "I was a 
little more careful with him after that." 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies didn't score again until the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, meanwhile, caught up during an unusual third inning, which started 
innocently enough, with Mike Scioscia walking and Mariano Duncan ending a 
four-for-31 slump by doubling down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
Leary then slapped a sharp grounder to first baseman Von Hayes, whose throw to 
the plate arrived so far ahead of Scioscia that the Dodger catcher beat a hasty 
retreat back to third base. There, however, stood Duncan, who quickly made his 
way back toward second. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan eventually was tagged out in a rundown between second and third and 
Leary, who had at one point stood at second, wound up at first. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia scored on a single by Randolph, who lined a pitch off the right leg of 
McWilliams. 
</P>
<P>
The inning came to a strange end when catcher Darren Daulton fielded Mickey 
Hatcher's chopper in front of the plate, tagged the stationary Hatcher, who 
apparently believed the ball was foul, and threw to third baseman Mike Schmidt, 
who tagged Leary to complete a double play. 
</P>
<P>
After all that, the game was tied, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson put the Dodgers ahead, 2-1, in the fourth, sending a pitch by McWilliams 
into the right-field pavilion. The home run was Gibson's third of the season 
and his first since a solo shot against the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick 
Park last April. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw him a fastball to challenge him," McWilliams said. "I didn't want to 
walk him. That was his pitch and he hit it out." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan led off the fifth with his second hit, dropping a bunt down the 
third-base line. Then, after advancing to third on a sacrifice by Leary and a 
wild pitch, he scored on a well-executed squeeze by Randolph, who bunted along 
the first-base line. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton's seventh-inning home run to left field gave the Dodgers a 5-1 lead. 
It was his second home run in five games. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until the last six or seven games, it's been ugly," Hamilton said of his 
lack of offensive productivity. "The at-bat before (when he grounded to the 
pitcher) was real bad and I didn't swing good. 
</P>
<P>
"I was jumping around up there." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda said Kirk Gibson would again play center field tonight, 
substituting for the struggling John Shelby, who is hitting .171 and has struck 
out an average of once every four at-bats. "He can go get the ball as good as 
any of them," Lasorda said of Gibson, who said he frequently played center 
field with the Detroit Tigers. "You saw him run that ball down out there 
tonight. That was a hell of a catch." Gibson made a diving catch of a sinking 
line drive by Chris James in the eighth inning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Add Mike Schmidt of the Philadelphia Phillies to the list of those who believe 
that Fernando Valenzuela's lack of success is because of the ineffectiveness of 
his fastball. "When he was at the top of his game," Schmidt said of Valenzuela, 
who has not won since last June 14, "you had to respect his fastball because he 
could back you off the plate. And that made his screwball so much more 
effective. You can wait on him because you can say, 'He doesn't have a fastball 
I need to think about.' " . . . In five of Valenzuela's eight starts, including 
a 4-1 loss to the Phillies Tuesday night, the Dodgers have scored one run or 
fewer. And in his next start, Sunday against the New York Mets, Valenzuela 
(0-4) will oppose Dwight Gooden. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda, on former Dodger Ken Howell, who beat Los Angeles for the second time 
in two weeks Tuesday night and is 5-2 in his first season with the Phillies: 
"It's good to see him winning, but not against us." . . . Among Dodger 
opponents, only George Foster, who hit 23, has hit more home runs at Dodger 
Stadium than Schmidt, who has hit 22. . . . The Dodgers purchased the contract 
of minor league infielder Jim Pankovits from the Pittsburgh Pirates. Pankovits, 
33, was assigned to Albuquerque.

STANLEY CUP NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
FLAMES WILL TRY TO WIN FIRST CUP WITH CUP FIRST 
</P>

MONTREAL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the long and esteemed history of the Montreal Canadiens, the team has never 
lost the Stanley Cup at home. 
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing that, Calgary Coach Terry Crisp -- the guy who "ain't afraid of no 
ghosts," who says home-ice advantage is a maligned and over-used phrase, who 
says his team always plays well in Montreal, who puts no stock in odds and 
percentages -- spit out a phrase akin to "Oh, shoot!" 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm nervous," Crisp said. "I've never heard of that statistic." 
</P>
<P>
But Crisp and his Calgary Flames are going to make a run at it tonight when 
they go into Game 6 of the Stanley Cup series with a three-games-to-two lead. 
</P>
<P>
A victory by Montreal would tie the series and send it to Calgary for Game 7 on 
Sunday. A victory by Calgary would give the Flames their first Stanley Cup and 
end the streak that lends itself to talk of ghosts and mystique. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Crisp said. "If it has to happen, we'd like to be the team to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The Flames won Game 4 here Sunday night, coming back after a double-overtime 
loss at the Forum in Game 3. And then the Flames won a second consecutive game 
in Calgary Tuesday to tie the series. A victory in Game 6 to win the Cup would 
be the Flames' third consecutive victory over the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens haven't lost three in a row this season. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp chose rest over practice for his team on the travel day, making the 
announcement shortly after saying that the Flames' performance in Game 5 was 
their worst of the series. 
</P>
<P>
When Montreal Coach Pat Burns was asked after the game Tuesday night what his 
game plan will be tonight, he said: "We are going to win. There is nothing else 
we can do. The only thing to do on Thursday is win the game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Montreal's Bobby Smith: "It's gonna be a great Game 6 at the Montreal 
Forum. The Stanley Cup finals! We have a lot of momentum on our side coming off 
the last 40 or 50 minutes of Game 5." 
</P>
<P>
Among the many complaints the Canadiens had about the way the game was 
officiated Tuesday was this from Bobby Smith, commenting on an interference 
call on him that negated a Montreal power play: "Yes, I bumped him. But I've 
bumped my wife harder trying to get past her in the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
Calgary's Al MacInnis on the fact that both teams use four lines: "Bobby Smith 
said earlier that we're the first team that they've played this season with 
four lines. It is a big part of both clubs. You can run into injuries when 
players get tired. And you have more fresh guys out there, so it's a real 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on how well right winger Joey Mullen has been playing, Crisp said: 
"He's a throwback. I've been saying this all year. He's a throwback to Gordie 
Howe and Glenn Hall. No hoopla or big banners. Just put your jersey on and 
play. I keep seeing things from Joey Mullen. When it comes to athe third or 
fourth effort, Joey keeps coming up with a new twist."

MORNING BRIEFING: BO'S HOMER DOESN'T QUITE MEASURE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Jackson hit a tape-measure home run off Nolan Ryan in Arlington, Tex., 
Tuesday night, but he has a lot of distance to cover before he catches up with 
Mickey Mantle, according to the man who virtually invented the term 
"tape-measure homer." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur E. (Red) Patterson was the New York Yankees' publicity man in 1953, when 
Mantle hit what many still believe to be baseball's longest home run. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson went outside Griffith Stadium that night, April 17, 1953, stepped off 
the distance of a majestic Mantle home run and came up with a figure of 565 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
When he worked for the Yankees, Patterson said he saw Mantle hit "about a 
dozen" home runs in the 450- to 500-foot class. But the Washington blast, he 
says, outdistanced them all. 
</P>
<P>
Add Mantle: The homer seems to get a little longer every time Patterson tells 
the story. When contacted Wednesday, Patterson, now 80, described it again. 
</P>
<P>
Mantle, batting right-handed against left-hander Chuck Stobbs, hit a drive that 
was helped by a wind. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball not only cleared the left-field bleachers, but went out of the park 
about halfway up the scoreboard, which was on top of the bleachers," recalled 
Patterson, now a special consultant for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"It was still going up when it went out. 
</P>
<P>
"I found a kid with the ball, and he told me the ball came down 'In a lady's 
back yard.' He showed me the spot and I stepped it off -- I never really used a 
tape measure -- to the outfield fence. Then I added the home-to-fence distance 
inside the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave the kid $10 for the ball, got Mantle's bat, and convinced the Yankees 
to put them on display in the Yankee Stadium lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"We did, and someone stole them. 
</P>
<P>
"Our radio announcer, Mel Allen, made pleas every day for them to be returned, 
that no questions would be asked. Some kid returned them. He told us he took 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"The (New York) writers accused me of fabricating the whole thing, but it's a 
true story. The bat and ball are in the Hall of Fame today." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Jackson's homer traveled 461 feet, according to the IBM tape 
measure chip in Arlington Stadium's scoreboard. According to Kansas City 
writers, it was Jackson's second-longest homer. He hit a 475-footer in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For Added Measure: Only one player, Willie Stargell, ever hit a fair ball out 
of Dodger Stadium, and he did it twice. The first was a 506-foot 6-inch blast 
off Alan Foster in 1969; the second a 470-footer off Andy Messersmith in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Stargell's 1969 homer cleared the outfield pavilion roof on the fly. The 1973 
shot hit the roof, then bounced out of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Only four players, according to the Dodgers, ever reached the loge level 
(second level) with home runs: Frank Howard, Dave Kingman (twice), Dave Parker 
and Nick Esasky. 
</P>
<P>
For Short Measure: There can be no discussion of tape-measure homers without 
mention of Frank Howard's rocket launched at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh in 
1960. Someone stepped that one off at 565 feet, too. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, Babe Ruth was credited for a spring training homer in Tampa, Fla., 
that traveled anywhere from 560 to 656 feet, depending on who was telling the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
Another epic Mantle home run occurred at Yankee Stadium in 1963. Batting 
left-handed against Kansas City's Bill Fischer, Mantle hit a ball that struck 
the upper-deck facade, 18 inches below the roof. It was one of two homers 
Mantle hit off the facade. 
</P>
<P>
There is no record of anyone hitting a fair ball out of Yankee Stadium, but 
there are stories of Josh Gibson accomplishing the feat in a Negro League game. 
</P>
<P>
For Final Measure: Steve Gietschier, archivist at the Sporting News, says he's 
never seen a list of baseball's longest homers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a thick file labeled 'tape-measure homers,' but it's just old 
clippings," he said. "From looking at it, I'd say every well-known home run 
hitter in the game has hit at least one." 
</P>
<P>
Dept. of Brains and Spikes: One of the entries in the women's mile at the Aug. 
6 Jack-in-the-Box Invitational track meet at UCLA is Kathy Kanes, who recently 
received her doctorate in chemistry at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. Caltech? 
</P>
<P>
"She's probably on the top-50 list of U.S. women milers," meet director Al 
Franken said. "She's never going to beat Mary Slaney. But then, Mary Slaney 
never explained room temperature fusion to me, either." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: "I enjoy physical contact," said Dennis Byrd, 270-pound defensive 
lineman from Tulsa and a New York Jet draft pick. "I really like to hit. This 
is the only sport except boxing where you can abuse someone and not go to jail 
for it."

NEWSWIRE: ESPOSITO IS FIRED BY NEW YORK RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Esposito was fired Wednesday as coach, general manager and vice president 
of the New York Rangers after a tenure marked by his many trades. 
</P>
<P>
Esposito was fired less than two months after receiving a vote of confidence 
from Madison Square Garden Sports Group, which owns the hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
Esposito, who never led the team past the first round of the Stanley Cup 
playoffs, said the firing left him "in some ways relieved, in other ways 
frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Esposito, 47, had one year remaining on his contract.

TRIPLE CROWN BONUS PLAN SACRIFICES FAIRNESS TO BOLSTER BELMONT FIELD

<P>
In the 1960 World Series, the Pirates were outscored by the Yankees, 55-27, but 
Pittsburgh still won the title by taking four of the seven games. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates won by 6-4, 3-2, 5-2, and 10-9, while New York was winning, 16-3, 
10-0 and 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
However, no one suggested that the Yankees be declared the champions. But under 
the rules of racing's Triple Crown, a horse can win two out of the three races 
in the series and still not earn a $1-million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
That happened in 1987, the first year the $1-million bonus was offered. 
</P>
<P>
Alysheba won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, but then missed finishing 
third by a neck in the Belmont and blew the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Bet Twice, second in both the Derby and the Preakness, won the Belmont and beat 
out Alysheba on points, 11-10. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing could happen this year. Sunday Silence, after winning the Derby 
and Preakness, can clinch the bonus by finishing at least third if Easy Goer 
wins the Belmont. Of course, a win by Sunday Silence at Belmont Park on June 10 
gives him a Triple Crown sweep and a $5-million payoff. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with the Triple Crown point system of 5-3-1 for first-, second- and 
third-place finishes in the three races is that a winner doesn't receive much 
more credit than the horse that runs second. 
</P>
<P>
The Triple Crown tracks -- Churchill Downs, Pimlico and Belmont -- considered 
altering the point system after the Bet Twice-Alysheba anomaly, but decided to 
keep it in order to encourage entries for the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the system is unfair. Any horse that dominates a series deserves the 
big bucks. Would tennis give the Wimbledon championship to a player who won the 
most games, but not the most sets? 
</P>
<P>
Since Gato Del Sol won the Kentucky Derby in 1982, six of the last eight 
winners have been 3-year-olds who trained in California. 
</P>
<P>
The last four Derby winners -- Ferdinand, Alysheba, Winning Colors and Sunday 
Silence -- were California-based and in 1983, between the last four and Gato 
Del Sol, came Sunny's Halo, who trained at Hollywood Park and swam in the 
track's swimming pool before he used a two-race Arkansas schedule to get him 
ready for Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
The five California horses ran in the Santa Anita Derby. That was the final 
Kentucky Derby prep for Ferdinand, Winning Colors and Sunday Silence, with Gato 
Del Sol and Alysheba running in the Blue Grass when that Keeneland stake was 
run nine days before the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
None of the California horses were favored in the Kentucky Derby. "I think that 
the California horses come to Churchill Downs underrated and the Eastern horses 
are overrated," trainer Wayne Lukas said last week. Lukas won the Derby last 
year with the filly, Winning Colors. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Anita Derby, which is run a month before the Kentucky Derby, is 
perfectly situated for the horse who will need no additional racing experience 
before running at Churchill Downs. It is almost certain to be run in good 
weather and gives a trainer enough time to get his horse acclimated in 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Wood Memorial, run at Aqueduct two weeks before the 
Derby, no longer is a prime prep race. The last horse to come out of the Wood 
and win the Derby was Pleasant Colony in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there probably will be no rush of Eastern horses going to the Santa 
Anita Derby instead of running in the Wood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to run in the Florida preps and then ship to Santa Anita, 
because we race in the East," said Shug McGaughey, Easy Goer's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good program going into the Derby this year. If you have a hard race 
in the Wood, then it comes a little bit too close to the Derby, but Easy Goer 
didn't have a hard race this year, and we thought it was just perfect for him." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker will leave next week for the first part of his retirement tour 
abroad. Shoemaker will start in Zurich, Switzerland, and continue through 
England, Ireland, the Netherlands, West Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy 
and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker, 57, who hopes to train horses when he retires at the end of the 
year, will return to the United States in late July and later in the year he 
will visit Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
Last week at Pimlico, Shoemaker sat on the porch of the jockeys' room with his 
friend, veterinarian Alex Harthill. 
</P>
<P>
The track announcer started talking and Shoemaker said: "Geez, Doc, that (South 
African) accent sounds exactly like Trevor Denman. How could there be two guys 
in racing that sound like that?" 
</P>
<P>
"Shoe," Harthill said, "that is Trevor Denman." 
</P>
<P>
Denman, the regular caller at Santa Anita and Del Mar who will be calling the 
races in Maryland until July 4, says that it's been an adjustment for him at 
Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still trying to get used to the horses and the jockeys' styles," he said. 
"You get spoiled in California, with all the good horses. By and large, it's a 
different class of horse running in Maryland." 
</P>
<P>
There have been mixed reviews for the 36-year-old Denman at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
"He sounds too much like a tobacco auctioneer," one fan said. 
</P>
<P>
But Clem Florio, a handicapper for the Washington Post, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is fabulous," Florio said. "He lets you know what's really going on 
in a horse race." 
</P>
<P>
When Shoemaker won a race at Pimlico last week, Frank De Francis, the principal 
owner of the track, held a $5 win ticket that was worth about $60 on the horse. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought I'd keep the ticket as a souvenir, because it probably 
would be the last time Shoe would ride at Pimlico," De Francis said. "But then 
I thought about the $60. I cashed the ticket. I'll get a souvenir of Shoe from 
another track." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring will be challenged by Faultless Ensign, Contested Colors, 
Manastash Ridge and Irish Actor in the $500,000 Jersey Derby at Garden State 
Park on Monday. . . . The same day, On the Line, Seeking the Gold and Simply 
Majestic will run in the $500,000 Metropolitan Mile at Belmont Park. . . . On 
Saturday, Open Mind, the best 3-year-old filly in the country, runs in the 
$150,000 Acorn at Belmont. . . . Some of the 3-year-olds who weren't good 
enough for the Triple Crown -- Endow, Music Merci, Mercedes Won and Notation -- 
will run at Sportsman's Park Saturday in the $500,000 Illinois Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence's hoof problems appear to be behind him, even though he loosened 
his left front shoe while winning the Preakness. . . . Two horses from France 
-- Le Voyageur and Sovereign Water -- are due to arrive in New York next week 
to run in the Belmont Stakes on June 10. They will be required to spend 26 
hours in the quarantine paddock at Aqueduct before they can be moved to Belmont 
Park. Le Voyageur is a son of Seattle Slew and owned by Calumet Farms. . . . 
Hawkster, fifth in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, is going to run in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Aronson is leaving the American Horse Council to work for Freestate 
Raceway, the harness track in Laurel, Md. Starting Wednesday night, Freestate 
began experimenting with a system in which post positions won't be known for 
horses until after betting is shut off about a minute before the race. Post 
positions are more of a factor in harness races. The track says it is trying to 
create more betting interest, and it probably will. In harness racing, stables 
sometimes don't bet as much on their own horses when they draw outside posts, 
but under this setup, no one will know ahead of time where the horses will 
start. Big bettors are already complaining about the experiment, because it's a 
handicapping factor that's being taken away from them.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

FUTURE IS NOW: ORIOLES ENJOY VIEW FROM TOP

<P>
It's no mistake. The Baltimore Orioles are on top of the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Orioles are 21-21 and tied with the Boston Red Sox, but the Orioles 
were the worst team in baseball last season, when they lost their first 21 
games and were crying "wait until next year." 
</P>
<P>
Oriole Manager Frank Robinson is having trouble holding back the enthusiasm of 
his young team. A number of things are going right. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Orioles were short a starting pitcher, so they sent Jay Tibbs 
out to face the White Sox Wednesday night at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Tibbs, who was working on a 10-game losing streak, pitched six strong innings 
as the Orioles won, 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Tettleton hit his 10th home run and Phil Bradley had three hits to back 
Tibbs. 
</P>
<P>
After beating Texas last July 9, Tibbs lost nine consecutive starts and a 
relief appearance as the Orioles totaled 107 defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Tibbs' success typifies the change in fortune of the Orioles. Even when they 
have trouble scoring runs, they get solid pitching from some young arms. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 6, Milwaukee 2 -- Since he signed as a free agent, Mike Moore hasn't 
received much offensive support from the Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was given a 5-0 lead after three innings in this game. He held the 
Brewers to five hits in eight innings at Milwaukee and improved to 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Moore lost his bid for a shutout when Gary Sheffield singled in the fourth and 
Rob Deer hit a 420-foot drive, his 12th home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland, which needed the victory to stay ahead of the Angels in the West, had 
13 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 2, Cleveland 1 -- Doyle Alexander didn't get the victory at Detroit, 
the Tigers' fifth in six games under interim manager Dick Tracewski, but he 
exemplified the renewed Tiger spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, despite pitching with a hairline fracture of the jaw, held the 
Indians to four hits in seven innings. The Tigers won it in the 10th when Gary 
Pettis doubled and scored on Lou Whitaker's one-out single. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander was hit in the jaw last Friday night by a smash off the bat of Kansas 
City's Frank White. One X-ray showed nothing, but the second revealed a 
hairline fracture. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he only feels pain if he squeezes his jaw," Tracewski said. 
"Doyle's a gritty old goat." 
</P>
<P>
It was the ninth time this season that the Tigers have scored three or fewer 
runs with Alexander pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 6, Seattle 5 -- Wade Boggs, who has been hitting about 50 points below 
his career average, ended his slump at Boston as the Red Sox won their second 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs went three for three, getting two doubles and a single, scoring two runs 
and driving in another. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs, winner of four consecutive batting titles, has been bothered by a 
hamstring problem. The perfect night at the plate increased his average to 
.301. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Boddicker (3-4) ended his three-game Fenway Park losing streak. He gave up 
three runs, one unearned, and seven hits before Bob Stanley had to rescue him 
with the bases loaded and two out in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners played without Ken Griffey Jr., who suffered an apparent neck 
injury while making a sensational catch in Tuesday's game. Doctors said he 
might return to the lineup tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 10, Toronto 4 -- Frank Viola still isn't pitching as well as would be 
expected, but his teammates are giving him more than enough support. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby Puckett led a 13-hit attack at Toronto with his second four-hit game of 
the season and the 30th of his career to lead the romp. 
</P>
<P>
Viola, given a five-run lead in the first inning, made it through six innings. 
He gave up eight hits and four runs in six innings but improved to 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett was 4 for 6, including a double, and increased his average to .337. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 6, Texas 4 -- Bo Jackson hit his 12th home run and Frank White went 
three for four at Arlington, Tex., to help the Royals end a six-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Although he fell behind by 2-0 early, Bret Saberhagen went 6 2/3 innings to 
improve to 4-4. Tom Gordon took over in the seventh and pitched the last 2 1/3 
innings to earn his first major league save. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Julio Franco made an error before Jackson's home run, but he 
also drove in two runs to increase his RBI total to 41. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

MADDUX ROLLING AGAIN AND SO ARE CUBS, 3-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, Greg Maddux of the Chicago Cubs was the toast of the National 
League. He was 8-3 on his way to an amazing 15-3 record at the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
After making the All-Star team but not playing, the right-hander came 
plummeting back to earth, finishing the season with a 18-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
His start this season was no better than his finish last season. He was hit 
hard in his first four outings and was 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
As Maddux, 23, begins to prove he isn't a fluke, the Cubs are proving they 
aren't either. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux pitched the soaring Cubs to a 3-1 victory Wednesday night at Houston, 
missing his third consecutive complete game by one out. 
</P>
<P>
Shawon Dunston singled in two runs in the fourth to give Maddux the support he 
needed. Maddux took a shutout into the ninth, but, after Gerald Young singled 
home a run with two out, Mitch Williams came in to get the final out for his 
12th save. 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept the Cubs in first place in the NL East. The Cubs are without 
their big gun, Andre Dawson, who underwent knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs are also without outfielder Mitch Webster, but they are getting 
outstanding pitching and timely hitting. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 5, St. Louis 1 -- The Reds continue to thrive on turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, after the Cardinals' Terry Pendleton singled in a run, relief 
pitcher Ron Dibble became so incensed, he threw Pendleton's bat against the 
screen. Dibble was ejected, and Manager Pete Rose decided to suspend the 
youngster for two days. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't affect the Reds on Wednesday night as Tom Browning, who hadn't won in 
a month, somehow managed to escape jam after jam and went the distance to give 
the Reds' bullpen a rest. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals had eight hits, five of them doubles, and three walks but only 
one run. The Reds' third consecutive victory kept them in first place in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sabo hit a home run and a double to lead the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, Atlanta 1 -- A 1-1 tie at Atlanta lasted seven innings after R.J. 
Reynolds' infield out scored Andy Van Slyke in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pirates exploded in the 14th. Glenn Wilson hit a two-run double to 
break the tie and hand the Braves their fourth loss in a row and ninth in the 
last 11 games. The Braves have scored only 10 runs in their last 85 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Pirate Manager Jim Leyland was ejected in the ninth for arguing a checked-swing 
strike call against Van Slyke. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 1, San Francisco 0 -- Kevin Gross pitched a five-hitter and Hubie 
Brooks drove in the only run with a sacrifice fly as the Expos won at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Gross (5-3) struck out 11 and walked four in his best performance since the 
Expos obtained him in an off-season trade with Philadelphia. He outdueled San 
Francisco starter Don Robinson (2-4), who gave up only three hits in seven 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos scored an unearned run in the first without a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Raines drew a leadoff walk, stole second and went to third when catcher 
Terry Kennedy's throw skipped past shortstop Jose Uribe into center field. 
After Dave Martinez walked, Raines came home on Brooks' one-out fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
New York 3, San Diego 0 -- Kevin McReynolds and pinch-hitter Mark Carreon hit 
home runs at San Diego to lift the Mets to victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets held a 1-0 lead in the seventh inning when Carreon was sent in to bat 
for Ron Darling, who had given up four hits in six innings. Darling and relief 
pitcher Rick Aguilera had 13 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The loser was Bruce Hurst, who gave up two runs in seven innings and didn't 
walk a batter. DAN HAFNER

Four of the top five-seeded players, including UC Irvine's Mark Kaplan, were 
eliminated in Wednesday's first round of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
men's singles championships. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan, seeded No. 4, lost to Paul Mancini of West Virginia, 6-4, 6-4. Kaplan 
lost in the semifinals as a sophomore and the quarterfinals as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
The most surprising upset came when No. 1 MaliVai Washington of Michigan lost, 
6-4, 6-3, to Georgia's Francisco Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Playing before a home-court crowd of 2,300, Montana broke Washington's service 
three times in the final set. He won a sudden-death point to clinch the 
victory. In other upsets, unseeded Pat Crow of Cal State Long Beach knocked off 
third-seeded Johan Kjellsten of Louisiana State, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, and unseeded 
Byron Black of USC beat fifth-seeded Steve Bryan of Texas, 2-6, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's two seeded players both won. Brian Garrow, who reached the singles final 
last year, defeated John Stimpson of Alabama, 6-3, 6-1, and Buff Farrow 
eliminated Rich Benson of Kentucky, 6-2, 6-2. Black's upset helped USC go 3-0 
for the day. Eric Amend downed Jeff Chiang of Columbia, 6-7 (7-5), 6-4, 6-2, 
and Greg Failla defeated Hakan Svensen of Southwest Missouri State, 4-6, 7-5, 
6-1, despite facing match point in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Kronemann was Irvine's only winner, downing Steve Herdoizi of 
Northwestern, 6-0, 6-4. Teammate Mike Briggs lost to Steve Jung of Nebraska, 
7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches involving area players, Kip Brady of UC Santa Barbara defeated 
Dave Harkness of Brigham Young, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4; Grant Saacks of Pepperdine lost 
to Mark Mance of Duke, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1, and Jose Luis Noriega of the University 
of San Diego defeated Steve Longley of South Carolina, 7-5, 6-2.

The Scene: Tuesday night's annual BMI Pop Awards Dinner at the Regent Beverly 
Wilshire Hotel, honoring "the 66 songs most performed on radio and television 
during the past year." Some of them seemed destined to become classics, while 
others were the sort of tunes that get stuck in your head after you go to the 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: At the reception beforehand, songwriters discussed (what else?) the 
music business. Several people were heard murmuring about Rob Lowe and that 
revealing videotape aired on Monday night's edition of "A Current Affair" -- 
the one that allegedly showed how the actor spent his time off from last year's 
Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: BMI President/CEO Frances W. Preston, who served as the 
evening's emcee; songwriters and performers Patrick Swayze; Belinda Carlisle; 
Taylor Hackford; David Cassidy; Don Was; Lisa Hartman; Barbara (Mrs. Roy) 
Orbison; Siedah Garrett; Michael Bolton; Stephen Bishop; Eric Carmen; Lamont 
Dozier; Otis Blackwell; Eddie Holand; Allee Willis; Pebbles and BMI songwriter 
of the year Gloria Estefan with husband Emilio Estefan and members of the Miami 
Sound Machine. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Invitations specified black-tie, and most guests dressed 
conservatively -- by music industry standards, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment: BMI kept the evening moving fast by eliminating performances in 
favor of quick video clips flashed on monitors. With 66 awards to be given out, 
it was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Veal and cheesecake for dinner, though most guests surveyed preferred the 
shish kebab and shrimp scampi that was being served at the reception 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: Barbara Orbison, who accepted an award for her late husband's duet of 
"Crying" with country singer k.d. lang, made a powerful and moving speech. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: Despite lights fading in and out like a New York City brownout, 
guests had to be exhorted (and then begged) to leave the reception and go sit 
down to eat dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: Gloria Estefan, whose award as songwriter of the year came as a 
surprise to her, mentioned that she finally felt successful "when I heard one 
of my songs being played on Muzak." KEVIN ALLMAN

YOUR COINS: DOLLAR'S SIZE HURTS CHANCE FOR REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I realize your column is mostly devoted to rare coins, real or 
imagined, so although my question is a bit out of the mainstream I hope you 
will consider answering it. What I would like to see is Susan B. Anthony's 
birthday, Feb. 15, 1820, become a national celebration, not as a paid holiday 
but as a day when the dollar coin, minted in her memory, is used to purchase 
goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
It would not only be a wonderful way to honor the woman who was instrumental in 
getting the vote for so many, it might even help promote circulation of 
millions of Anthony dollars now sitting in the mint. Previously, I contacted 
advice columnists and a former Treasury secretary but received no specific 
assistance from them. 
</P>
<P>
Will you please advise me how to go about accomplishing my goal? -- M.A. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Anthony dollar is one of the colossal failures of modern coinage. 
Millions and millions of these dollars were minted between 1979 and 1981. 
Unfortunately, as you suggest, millions and millions still reside in government 
vaults, unloved and unwanted. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is a basic flaw in the design. The Anthony dollar is so similar in 
size to the quarter that it is easily confused for a coin worth only one-fourth 
as much. It didn't take consumers long to decide the confusion was not worth 
the monetary risk, and Anthony dollars fell from disfavor to disuse. 
</P>
<P>
It's a pity too, because the Anthony dollar represented the first time that a 
woman, besides Miss Liberty, was honored on a circulating United States coin. 
But the coin didn't circulate, and I'm not sure that any organized effort on 
your part or others will ever be successful. 
</P>
<P>
The problem lies with the basic concept of the coin's size. It's likely that 
the Anthony dollars still in the vaults will eventually be melted down. 
Feminists would probably be better served by petitioning Congress to approve a 
new Anthony dollar -- or some other denomination -- that the public would 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Could you give me some information as to the relative value of a 1-cent coin 
that I have. It is dated 1964, but is not the same size as the regular one now 
in use. It is so small you can hardly pick it up. It has a picture of Abe 
Lincoln on one side. -- J.S. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your coin is a novelty, produced perhaps by someone attempting to make a 
comment about how our spending power has shrunk. But it is not a coin in the 
true meaning of the word and it has no numismatic value. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have what I'm guessing is an Olympic gold medal from 1932, a commemorative 
medal, that is. It is quite heavy and has been in the family a long time. Where 
can I go to learn its worth? -- B.G. 
</P>
<P>
A: To determine its worth you'll have to identify the medal. There are books on 
the subject; perhaps your local library can help you. There are also dealers 
who specialize in medals. You'll have to make the rounds but you might get 
lucky and find an Olympics specialist. It's hard to tell with commemoratives, 
but Olympic gold medals themselves (they're not really gold, I understand) sell 
for about $475 to $1,500, depending on the condition.

YOUR STAMPS: GEOGRAPHY MAY AFFECT SELLING PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY KRAUSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Does it matter where I buy or sell stamps? Do certain sections of the 
country or certain cities have prices different from other places? And what 
about big versus small dealers? -- P.L. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Stamps are usually most expensive and desirable in their own country of 
origin. For example, U.S. stamps bring strong prices here, while British 
Colonies do well in London. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, big cities tend to have higher prices than small towns. It costs a 
lot of overhead to operate a stamp store in a nice location in New York, 
Chicago or Los Angeles. Market prices have to reflect the dealer's cost of 
doing business. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, big dealers in a big city may have more capital to buy 
stamps with when you want to sell to a dealer, and they may have a long list of 
customers who might be interested in seeing what you have to offer -- while a 
smaller dealer in a small town may possess neither the cash nor the market 
contacts that his bigger brethren have. 
</P>
<P>
But with modern telephone and insured-mail communications, stamps are easily 
sold and transported across the country and overseas, so prices have a tendency 
to equal out over the long run. Bargains don't remain bargains long. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What stamps do you recommend buying this year for investment value? -- E.L. 
</P>
<P>
A: Those with a proven track record for price appreciation over the years: 
scarce U.S. and Western European issues, Zeppelins, old covers in nice 
condition, anything that stamp dealers say they are eager to buy. And remember, 
nobody can foresee the future. Buy stamps for enjoyment and knowledge, and hope 
for possible profits after holding them awhile. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When my grandmother came to America from Germany, she brought with her a 
small box of stamps that were issued shortly after 1920. They are all 
regular-size stamps, with overprints on them indicating higher values. Are 
these worth anything today? -- P.N. 
</P>
<P>
A: These were inflation issues of 1923 that were made by the German Post Office 
to keep up with the devastating currency inflation that hit Germany at that 
time. Most list for only a few cents each in the catalogues, although some with 
genuine cancels can be quite valuable. Show them to a stamp dealer.

FOOD BRIEFS: RISING DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND SUPERMARKET FEES HURT NEW PRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consumers can expect little in the way of innovative new food products in the 
coming months, according to a leading industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Spiraling development costs as well as increasingly high fees charged by 
supermarket chains for access to shelf space are reasons for the drop, said 
Martin Friedman, editor of Gorman's New Product News, a Chicago-based trade 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to manufacturers' timidity is that several promising items brought to 
market last year did poorly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit by the combination of these three factors are the small firms, 
often a fertile ground for product development. 
</P>
<P>
"Retailers' aggressive pursuit of slotting allowances made the cost of getting 
on the shelf much more expensive and even prohibitive for smaller companies," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The supermarket chain practice of, in essence, charging rent to manufacturers 
for a store's shelf space has become commonplace. The fees, though an 
annoyance, are manageable for the giant food processors with a host of major 
brands. However, regional firms find the payments much more difficult to 
absorb. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman said that the grocers have been getting bolder in demanding failure 
fees from food companies trying to bring an item into markets for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"If a new product doesn't make its sales quota for the store, then the 
manufacturers pay for it (with a failure fee)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative trends, manufacturers still managed to bring 10,558 new 
food items into retail channels in 1988, a modest 4% increase from the previous 
year. However, the jump was "dismal" compared to the wild 20% increases of just 
a few years ago, Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
The pace has slowed even further in the first few months of 1989. New Product 
News reports that 1,987 food items debuted in the first quarter of this year, 
or 3.4% more than in the same period in 1988. The totals are deceiving, 
however, because many of the introductions are simply new flavors, sizes or 
variations on existing brands. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to a slowdown in the quantity of new food items coming on stream 
in the last 12 months, there also was a shortage of truly major, significant 
new brands or even innovative categories," said Friedman. "Instead of 
full-blown new product introductions, manufacturers are expanding their 
established brand (lines)." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no so-called breakthrough products on the horizon, several 
interesting items are appearing in markets. 
</P>
<P>
Poultry Personality -- The Geo. A. Hormel Co. is hoping that a former Miss 
America can help sell marinated chicken breast. Currently being test marketed 
in Minneapolis and Denver is Chicken by George. The product, however, is not 
named after the meat company's founder but for television personality Phyllis 
George. 
</P>
<P>
The vacuum-packed, ready-to-cook chicken, which is skinless and boneless, sells 
for about $1.99 per 5-ounce serving. There are eight different versions 
featuring marinades such as lemon-herb, mesquite barbecue, teriyaki and others. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed I'd have my picture on a chicken package," said George. 
"Jewelry, perfume or clothes, maybe. But chicken? Never." 
</P>
<P>
The product was developed in 1986 at the George household with the help of her 
husband John Y. Brown, ex-governor of Kentucky and a former principal in 
Kentucky Fried Chicken fast-food chain. Hormel purchased the line last year and 
expects nationwide distribution within a year's time. 
</P>
<P>
The product is designed to offer convenience and ease of preparation -- it can 
be microwaved, broiled, baked or sauteed. 
</P>
<P>
"After being a beauty queen and a sportscaster, what's left? Being in the 
chicken business," said George. "The goal is to do for chicken what 
Baskin-Robbins did for ice cream. . . . I want to be the Betty Crocker of the 
1990s." 
</P>
<P>
Sales during the test market have exceeded expections, and Hormel has announced 
it will expand the concept to beef, fish, pork and turkey. A spokesman for the 
company said Chicken by George should be available in Southern California by 
July. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave's Menu -- Now that between 70% and 75% of all American households 
already have microwaves, products designed especially for the quick-cooking 
ovens are proliferating, according to Friedman of New Product News. 
</P>
<P>
Convenience is also central to a new product by Beatrice/Hunt-Wesson Inc. The 
firm's new Minute Gourmet provides seasoning, sauce and a cooking bag to 
prepare any of several fresh meat items. Consumers need only add one pound of 
fresh meat along with the other ingredients to the product's specially designed 
packet and then heat according to directions. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's Minute Gourmet produces a "gourmet meal for a family of four in 
minutes," according to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Five flavors are offered in the line, including Chicken Cacciatore, Oriental 
Beef and Cajun Pork. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt-Wesson acknowledges that consumers have been reluctant to prepare meat in 
the microwave because of uneven results in the past. However, Minute Gourmet 
addresses any perceived microwave shortcomings with its new cooking system. The 
shelf-stable product will retail for about $2.29. 
</P>
<P>
The company is even offering a toll-free number to provide information on the 
Minute Gourmet cooking process, for which a patent is pending. The number is 
(800) 468-7638. 
</P>
<P>
Microwaveable side dishes are also a burgeoning category. General Foods' recent 
entry is Minute Brand Microwave Dishes, which include four different rice 
preparations and the same number of pasta presentations. Other firms with 
similar offerings include Ronzoni, Kraft, Betty Crocker and MJB Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Catch -- Seafood is not without a few novel items. Slowly making its 
way onto restaurant menus and into supermarket fish counters is Le Topper's 
Aquagator, or farmed alligator meat from Louisiana. The Lafayette-based firm, 
which has had success with its soft shell crayfish, has a way yet to go with 
Aquagator. Apparently, company officials are still wrestling with how to 
attractively package the gator fillets. And as with many exotic meats, 
Aquagator is said to taste "just like chicken." 
</P>
<P>
There are no such identity problems for a new seafood product being marketed as 
Mox Lox. The imitation smoked salmon is from Sea Legs, which has used surimi, 
or a highly processed fish paste, to create a full-line of shellfish 
imitations. Ten years in development, Mox Lox, sells for about 50% of the price 
of real smoked salmon, or $1.99 per 3-ounce package. Calories, fat and sodium 
are also reduced. 
</P>
<P>
"Branmania" -- There has been an explosion in the number of products attempting 
to appeal to consumers' health consciousness. Most prominent among these are 
the wide variety of processed foods containing oat bran. 
</P>
<P>
"The cereal companies are stumbling over each other, trying to get more oat 
bran products and product claims out to the public," said Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some of these items have gotten quite aggressive in stating the case 
for oat bran's ability to lower cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
For example, General Mills' new Benefit cereal states in bold lettering on the 
package that it can "reduce cholesterol." Only in fine print does the label 
further state that the reduction is possible "when (the cereal is) part of a 
low-fat diet." 
</P>
<P>
Benefit does provide an indication, confirmed by industry analysts, that brans 
other than oat will soon become prevalent. In addition to oat, Benefit contains 
wheat bran as well as sugar beet fiber. 
</P>
<P>
The cholesterol concerned will now be able to add oat bran to those few 
products that, at present, do not contain the compound. J&amp;J Snack Foods 
Corp. is distributing Pride O' the Farm Oat Bran Shake. The 88% pure bran is 
used as topping and pours easily from its 8-ounce container. 
</P>
<P>
The Pennsauken, N.J.-based J&amp;J has also added oat bran into a version of 
its soft pretzels. Under the Superpretzel label, shoppers can buy 
cholesterol-free soft pretzels in stores' frozen food sections. If salt is 
omitted during preparation, then the 10% oat bran pretzels are a veritable 
health food. 
</P>
<P>
Among those items hoping to ride oat bran's coattails, is Tastee Apple Fiber. 
Lost in the attention lavished on bran is that fiber can also play a role in 
lowering cholesterol. The Newcomerstown, Ohio, firm is encouraging consumers to 
also use apple fiber as a topping or baking ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
Liquid Assets -- Everyone is talking about seltzer-like carbonated soda, but 
Sparkletts has actually done something about it. The Walnut Creek, Calif.-based 
firm has devised a plastic copy of the old seltzer bottle complete with 
push-button siphon. The reusable top helps maintain the fizz in the specially 
designed two-liter bottles. Four flavors are available in the "never-goes-flat" 
Sparkletts Seltzer Original line. 
</P>
<P>
Mendocino Beverage Co.'s new Truffle Mineral Water can be easily classified as 
a specialty item with a limited audience. Truffles, known for their pungency, 
are not normally associated with sparkling water. But that did not prevent 
Santa Rosa-based chef John Ash from collaborating with Mendocino on this 
unusual product. An acquired taste, the truffle water will retail at about $5 
per six-pack. 
</P>
<P>
Prince of Peace Enterprises Inc., have acknowledged from the start that they 
are providing an "alternative drink" in Blue Mountain Gold Ice Coffee. Packed 
in 8.5-ounce cans, the drink can be served hot or cold. The firm claims that 
the beans used to brew the coffee are those from Jamaica's Blue Mountain, 
considered among some of the most expensive. Unanswered in the firm's 
promotional material is why such costly beans are used to make coffee-in-a-can. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet Anniversary -- Finally, what all newly introduced products have in common 
is their manufacturer's dream of having healthy sales for at least a few years. 
In that context, the accomplishment of Hostess Cupcakes is noteworthy. The 
cream-filled chocolate treats with the signature swirl of white icing were 
introduced in 1919. Today's clamor for convenience foods is apparently nothing 
new. Hostess Cupcakes were originally promoted as a way of reducing the time 
women spent in the kitchen.

 FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: CUTTING THROUGH FAT OF CONSUMER NUTRITION LABELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No doubt about it: Consumers have more low-fat, low-calorie food choices then 
ever before, backed by more product information than ever before. The problem 
is that to use all this labeling and terminology you need to come to the 
supermarket equipped with a small encyclopedia of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Labeling terms aren't always crystal-clear. Regulations may differ depending on 
whether a food comes under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture or the Food and Drug Administration. Some foods designed for the 
health-conscious may not be that healthful at all. If you haven't done your 
homework, it may be hard to find the meaning behind the message. 
</P>
<P>
Several critical signposts can guide your quest to cut calories and fat. Take 
beef. Here, the key is to look for the USDA Select grade and, even more 
important, to buy leaner cuts. For example, 3 1/2 ounces of Choice chuck blade 
contains about 16 grams of fat, compared to 14 grams in the Select grade. The 
same portion of Choice top round, broiled, provides 6 1/2 grams; in Select 
grade, just under 5 1/2 grams of fat. Tenderloin and bottom round fall in the 
middle, with Choice cuts containing about 10 grams of fat and the Select under 
9 grams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaner Pork Available 
</P>
<P>
If you eat well-done ground beef, you'll get 19 grams of fat from regular beef, 
nearly 18 grams from lean, and 16 grams from extra lean. Depending on cut and 
grade, anywhere from 26% of the calories, as in top round, to 60% of the 
calories in regular ground beef, come from fat. The net result is that 3 1/2 
ounces of meat can contain from 180 to 270 calories. For Prime cuts, the tally 
goes higher. 
</P>
<P>
Leaner pork is also available now. Again, the key is in the cut. In roast loin, 
62% of calories are from fat; in rib, 52%; in tenderloin, just 26%. Calories in 
3 1/2 ounces of these cuts range from a high of 280 to a low of 165. 
</P>
<P>
The deli department also offers new products. "Lite" items, some up to 95% 
fat-free, include corned beef, pork, beef roast, turkey breast and ham. Still 
others, while not quite as low in fat, may contain less fat than traditional 
products. But beware: Some products have more sodium than do traditional foods. 
Fresh meat and poultry, selected with an eye to reduced fat, thus remain your 
best bets. 
</P>
<P>
The meaning of the term lite, incidentally, wavers like a flag in the breeze. 
Under USDA rules, lite indicates fewer calories or less salt and at least 25% 
less fat or other ingredients than the usual product. Along with lite, the 
terms light, lean, leaner and lower fat can all be used on products with at 
least a 25% reduction in fat. Foods designated as lean or low fat must also 
contain less than 10% fat. Extra lean must contain no more than 5% fat. 
Moreover, the label must state just how much fat it contains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Rules 
</P>
<P>
If this sounds overwhelming, there is more. For raw ground beef and hamburger, 
there are other rules. Fat levels for regular ground beef are 30%; for lean 
ground beef, 22.5%; and for extra lean, 15%. 
</P>
<P>
For labeling other low-calorie foods, a completely different set of 
regulations, formulated by the FDA, applies. If the words low calorie, low in 
calories or a low-calorie food appear on the display panel, you can expect that 
a serving provides less than 40 calories and no more than 0.4 calories per gram 
as eaten (unless it's a sugar substitute). The catch is that the manufacturer 
defines the serving, and twice as much serving means twice as many calories. 
Additionally, foods like celery that are naturally low in calories may be 
labeled celery, a low-calorie food. 
</P>
<P>
For "reduced-calorie" foods, other rules apply. The reduction in calories must 
be at least one-third, the label must carry a comparison with regular food and 
the food must not be nutritionally inferior to its standard counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, foods designated sugar-free, sugarless, and no sugar must be either 
labeled low or reduced calorie, or else carry an explanatory phrase, such as 
"not a low-calorie food," or "useful only in not promoting tooth decay." For 
example, cookies baked with a sugar substitute might require such an 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike calorie designations, the use of the term light on foods under FDA 
regulation is not defined. Whereas light breads usually contain fewer calories 
and more fiber than the standard, light olive oil is usually lighter in color 
and flavor but not in calories. And depending on alcohol content, some light 
beer may contain as many calories as regular beer. 
</P>
<P>
Why is labeling so complicated? There are many reasons. Some inconsistencies 
will be resolved sooner than others. As consumers, the only way to pare down 
fat and control caloric intake is to learn the rules, then use them in making 
your choices at the market.

Rhubarb Nibbler Can Rest Easy -- Leaves, Not Stalks, Poisonous 
</P>
<P>
Question: I was blithely nibbling a stalk of raw rhubarb when my neighbor 
walked in and informed me that it is poisonous. I don't eat it raw in great 
quantity because of the tart taste, but I've never become ill from the amount I 
did consume. So is she wrong or right? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Although your neighbor is wrong, we can understand her concern. For 
centuries, rhubarb was used as a medicinal herb. More than 300 years ago, it 
was suggested that the leaves could be eaten as food. Unfortunately the leaves 
contain a potentially fatal toxin. During World War I, Americans were 
encouraged to eat rhubarb as a vegetable supplement, and many cases of 
poisoning resulted from toxins in the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem is associated only with the leaf, not the stalk, even if eaten 
raw. 
</P>
<P>
Nutritionally, edible rhubarb is unremarkable, containing small amounts of 
minerals, and vitamins A and C. It does provide some calcium, but because it 
also contains oxalic acid, the mineral is probably not available to the body. 
Rhubarb is low in calories -- 16 per cup of raw fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you use artificial sweetener, the tally quickly mounts as you add enough 
sugar to make it suitably sweet. A half-cup serving typically contains as many 
as 140 calories. Combining rhubarb with a sweet fruit such as strawberries 
allows you to use less sugar and keep down the calorie count. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My daughter insists on eating sushi and sashimi made with raw fish. How 
common is the problem of raw fish harboring worms? 
</P>
<P>
A: Reports of fish parasites have increased in the United States with the 
rising popularity of sushi and sashimi, and we have no way of knowing how many 
people spontaneously recover from fish-worm infections without seeking medical 
help. Even so, it is not expected to become a major health problem in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
That said, we must note that for the occasional individual who does encounter 
the parasitic worms that inhabit fish, the experience can be sobering. 
</P>
<P>
Such a case was recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. A 
young man was admitted to the hospital with pain in his lower right side. 
Increasing severity of symptoms led to surgery for the removal of his appendix, 
which turned out to be normal. Before the abdominal incision was closed, a 
pinkish-red worm, over 1 1/2 inches long, was seen moving along the surgical 
drape covering him. The young man recovered. The report didn't mention whether 
he continues to eat sushi. 
</P>
<P>
The type of worm identified as the culprit, eustrongylides by name, had been 
found in only four other cases of fish infections. All were fishermen who had 
swallowed their bait minnows whole -- hardly a common practice. Three of them 
also required surgery. 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial accompanying the report, Peter M. Schanz, V.M.D., Ph.D., of the 
Centers for Disease Control, makes a surprising observation: Despite the rise 
in numbers of restaurants serving raw fish, the majority of fish-worm 
infections reported in the United States have been linked to food prepared at 
home. Restaurants have been involved only rarely. The same is also true in 
Japan, where authorities attribute it to the training and experience of the 
chefs. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line? To reduce your risk to zero, eat your fish thoroughly cooked. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband claims that he heard a radio report that low blood cholesterol 
levels have been linked to greater likelihood of stroke. Is this true and, if 
so, does that mean it's dangerous to lower one's cholesterol? 
</P>
<P>
A: Hold steady. Such a relationship has been reported recently, but it in no 
way suggests that you should abandon efforts to lower cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
The study that your husband heard about examined deaths from stroke in a group 
of nearly 351,000 men considered for enrollment in the MRFIT intervention 
trial, designed to evaluate approaches to reducing the risk of heart attack. 
The investigators examined information from death certificates of the men who 
had died six years later and compared this with data obtained as the men were 
evaluated for possible participation in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
They did find that risk of stroke caused by hemorrhage in the brain was higher 
in men with lower cholesterol levels. But that's not the whole story. First, 
this risk was confined to men with elevated diastolic blood pressure, a group 
in whom this type of hemorrhage is relatively common. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the increased risk was observed only among men with extremely low 
cholesterol levels, 160 milligrams per deciliter of blood -- well below average 
cholesterol levels in this country. Moreover, the inverse relationship between 
blood cholesterol levels and risk was limited to only one type of stroke. For 
other types, either no relationship was found, or risk increased as cholesterol 
levels rose. 
</P>
<P>
These findings need further investigation. But if you're wondering whether 
there's a risk trade-off in trying to lower serum cholesterol, the answer is 
no. The figures tell it best: In this study, after taking age into account, the 
death rate for hemorrhagic strokes in the brain was 2.36 per 10,000; for 
strokes not caused by hemorrhage (and not associated with lower blood 
cholesterol levels), it was 2.62 per 10,000.

 NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: FAT-WATCHERS CAN ENJOY A HOLIDAY MEAL FROM GRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial Day usually signals the beginning of the outdoor barbecue season, but 
it can also begin a period of anxiety for fat-watchers since some favorite 
grilled items are major sources of saturated fat -- the dietary element most 
recently implicated in raising serum cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
Beef roasts and steaks, cheeseburgers and frankfurters are among the top 
sources of saturated fat in the diet, according to a recent issue of 
Environmental Nutrition, a diet, nutrition and health newsletter written by 
registered dietitians. Health-conscious consumers should keep this in mind when 
planning the holiday cookout menu. 
</P>
<P>
A bill of fare built around lean-meat alternatives (avoiding such items as beef 
and pork ribs) and augmented with fresh fruit, vegetable and whole grain 
accompaniments will preserve the festive theme of the holiday and still adhere 
to recommendations that fat in the diet be held to 30% of total calories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newsletter Suggestions 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter suggests: choosing select grades of beef instead of the more 
fat-marbled cuts such as choice or prime; using non-stick vegetable sprays; 
removing skin from poultry before cooking, and opting for white poultry meat 
over dark. 
</P>
<P>
Some other ideas for preparing flavorful but low-fat grilled meals: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Choose lean top round steak, which contains about 166 calories per 3-ounce 
cooked serving. Marinate in a tenderizing mixture with a minimum of oil, then 
grill. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Season ground turkey with spices or packaged flavorings such as instant 
soup mixes to give additional flavor and use as a substitute for ground beef in 
hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rub chicken or Cornish hens with a spicy dry marinade or marinate in a 
no-oil dressing for extra flavor before grilling. 
</P>
<P>
GRILLED CORNISH HENS

 ABOUT WINE: EYES OF TEXAS ARE UPON THE GRAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may be hard to imagine a dust-covered, chaps-bedecked cowpoke ridin' in off 
the range, hopping down from his steed and asking for a Sauvignon Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
Be assured that the folks at what has been called Domaine Texas don't envision 
that image either. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Domaine Cordier -- the real but most un-Texas-like name of the ranch 
-- hopes to appeal to the growing number of sophisticated wine lovers in Texas' 
major cities as well as a curious national and international market that 
wonders, "Can Texas grow fine wine grapes?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, perhaps no one really wonders about that at present, but after the first 
wines of this new property have been released, interest should be sufficient to 
sell all that's being made on the range, somewhere south of Odessa. 
</P>
<P>
The first wines of Domaine Cordier will be released to the market in a month. 
They were unveiled last week in Dallas and by judicious use of the U.S. mail 
and telephone, I not only have tasted the wines but I have also interviewed the 
key people responsible for them. 
</P>
<P>
The first wines, which will be distributed in California through Seagram's 
Chateau and Estates division, include a Sauvignon Blanc ($7.50), a Chardonnay 
($12) and a Fume Blanc ($8.50), all from the 1988 vintage. A line of red wines 
is to be released next year. 
</P>
<P>
The white wines are well made, with the accent on freshness. I preferred the 
Sauvignon Blanc to the others. It offers a typical grassy/herbal aroma and 
crisp, citrusy aftertaste. The Fume Blanc, which was aged in oak, is more 
herbal and complex, but a bit disjointed at present. The Chardonnay is a 
light-styled wine with little perceptible oak, and a delicate finish. 
</P>
<P>
Domaine Cordier made 4,000 cases of the Chardonnay, 10,000 cases of the 
Sauvignon Blanc and 4,000 cases of the Fume Blanc. That may seem like a lot of 
wine, but it's really piddling compared to what the property could have made. 
</P>
<P>
That is because total vineyard plantings thus far are Texas-size: 1,000 acres 
outside the southwest Texas city of Ft. Stockton. This means Domaine Cordier 
could easily produce 250,000 cases of wine by itself, should it choose, and 
very well may when grapevines are fully mature and producing a full crop. Most 
have been planted in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Wine lovers know the name Cordier. It is the huge French firm that owns such 
world-renowned Bordeaux properties as Chateau Gruaud-Larose, Chateau Talbot, 
Chateau Meyney and others in Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cordier, which does more than half its business in exports, also 
owns two properties in Vouvray and two more in Sancerre and was a logical 
choice to invest in the germinating Texas wine industry because it has worked 
on experimental wine-growing projects in such remote and hitherto hostile 
climates as Venezuela, Thailand, and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the French firm owns Cordier Coutras, 50 miles from Bordeaux, a giant 
production facility that makes wines for the French table wine market. It also 
produces some base wines for sekt (German sparkling wine) sold to Germany. It 
processes about 4.5 million gallons of wine each year. 
</P>
<P>
Grape growing and wine making began in Texas in the early 1970s after a 
feasibility study done for Texas A&amp;M University showed that fine wine 
grapes could be grown in West Texas. Soon, experimental vineyards were planted 
through the University of Texas on a high plateau east of El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
The region around Lubbock became an early producer of fine wine in Texas. 
Lubbock, in the Texas hill country in the northern part of the state, is an 
hour's drive east of the border to New Mexico, which surprisingly has a long 
and rich wine history of its own. 
</P>
<P>
A second region that showed promise, about 1978, was in Tow, about 90 miles 
northwest of Austin in the center of the state, adjacent to Buchanan Lake. 
There, Ed and Susan Auler began to make fine wine from both French and 
French-American hybrid grape varieties. Today their Fall Creek winery is one of 
the state's best and most consistent. 
</P>
<P>
The Cordier property developed by the University of Texas about 250 miles 
southwest of Lubbock -- and just 100 miles from the Mexican border -- was 
originally a joint venture between local interests and Cordier, which acted as 
consultant and was a 24% owner. 
</P>
<P>
The venture marketed wines under the brand name Ste. Genevieve (who was the 
saint of Paris). Despite the desert-type climate in Pecos County, the region 
had a built-in bonus: very cool nights. 
</P>
<P>
So instead of fast-maturing, overripe grapes, one could count on a long growing 
season similar to the fine wine regions of the world. Also, on this 3,000-foot 
high plateau, there was no rainfall late in the growing season and no humidity 
to fret over, meaning that rot, a feared enemy of wine makers, was 
non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the Lubbock area to the north, rot devastated many of the early 
winery projects, their owners failing to recognize the severity of the problem. 
One Texas wine maker told me recently, "The good ol' boys would rather go 
huntin' and fishin' than spray to keep the mold down, and then the grapes'd 
come in so black and rotten you couldn't make a decent wine with 'em to save 
your life." 
</P>
<P>
For various reasons, the Ste. Genevieve wines didn't sell and in 1987 Cordier 
agreed to take over complete control of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Louis Blanc of Etablissments Cordier in France, who was in Texas to launch 
the new brand, said he felt the Texas vineyards had the potential to make great 
wine, not merely interesting wine. 
</P>
<P>
"My first impression is that Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon (Blanc), 
and Chenin Blanc will be the best varieties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unique in this project is a drip-irrigation system in which each vine gets the 
appropriate amount of water, doled out by a computer in France. 
</P>
<P>
"We control the water by use of an electronic system," said Blanc."There is a 
sensor on the vines that measures the amount of water in the vine. This sensor 
speaks to a computer at the winery that is connected to a computer in France, 
which determines the (water) need of the vine." 
</P>
<P>
The Ste. Genevieve brand, launched in 1984, will continue to be seen in Texas 
as a lower-priced wine. And other Domaine Cordier wines will be available only 
in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Cordier markets wines in 52 countries and David Milligan, president of Chateau 
and Estates, said he would show the wines to the trade at the huge VinExpo wine 
show in Paris in June. He said there is already interest in Scandinavia and 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Measure of Fame 
</P>
<P>
Besides Auler's Fall Creek project (which is now beginning to market its wines 
in California), Bobby Cox's Pheasant Ridge winery near Lubbock has achieved a 
measure of fame with some worthy Chardonnays and Cabernets. They are, alas, 
priced so high (about $20 a bottle) that even the well-heeled have to swallow 
hard to support a fellow Texan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite problems experienced by some Texas hill country wineries, a number have 
achieved success. One of the largest is Llano Estacado, which has broad 
distribution in Texas but little in California. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more energetic projects to surface recently is a winery called 
Teysha, an Indian word meaning friend. It is a project of Clint McPherson and 
his son, Kim. Clint was a founder of Llano Estacado and Kim was wine maker 
there before both left the partnership.

$13 Million Invested 
</P>
<P>
Cordier is taking its Texas project seriously. It has invested $13 million and 
has brought in a wine-making team from France, Lucien Viaud to direct the 
vineyard and assist in wine making and Jean Louis Haberer as head wine maker. 
</P>

"We are all very excited," said Milligan. "We're trying to produce something 
that is world class, something that will compete with anybody."

Wines of the Week: Preston Vineyards Estate White and Estate Red ($5 each) -- 
This is what inexpensive table wines should be. Rather than buy some sweetish 
wine called Chardonnay (that may have as much as 75% Chardonnay), try the 
Preston Estate White, a blend of four varieties that offers a spicy aroma and 
broad yet dry aftertaste. The red, which is 77.5% Carignane and the rest 
Zinfandel, is a light-bodied, chillable wine that goes great with pasta. A 
berryish note is appealing. (Bonus points to the first person who correctly 
finds the misspelled word on the back label of the Estate White. Answer in a 
few weeks.)

SERVE POTATO-FILLED PASTRIES FROM INDIA AS APPETIZERS FOR HOLIDAY PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These deep-fried, potato-filled pastries are traditional snacks in India, but 
here they serve as tasty appetizers on Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
Diced, cooked potatoes are simmered briefly with peas, onion, ginger, cilantro, 
cumin, turmeric and cayenne pepper to make the pungent filling. Evaporated milk 
helps bind these ingredients together and tempers the spicy taste. The Samosa 
filling is cradled in a crisp and flaky pastry. 
</P>
<P>
The pastries can be prepared several hours ahead, frying them only until very 
lightly golden. Then, just before serving, briefly fry again 1 to 2 minutes. 
Or, fried and cooled Samosas can be reheated in the oven at 375 degrees for 8 
to 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Yogurt, cucumber and mint serve as a refreshing dip. 
</P>
<P>
SAMOSAS 
</P>
<P>
2 3/4 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup evaporated milk 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup water 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon minced ginger root 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
2 cups diced, cooked potatoes 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon cumin 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon turmeric 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup peas 
</P>
<P>
Combine flour and 1 teaspoon salt in medium bowl. Cut in butter until mixture 
resembles cornmeal. Stir in 1/2 cup evaporated milk and 1/2 cup water. (Mixture 
will be dry.) Knead 10 minutes working in dry particles. Cover and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Saute onion and ginger in oil in 10-inch skillet. Add potatoes, cilantro, 
cumin, turmeric, cayenne, peas and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup milk 
and 1/4 cup water. Cover and simmer 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Divide pastry into 8 portions. Roll each portion into 7-inch circle, keeping 
remaining portions covered. Cut circle in half, then form half circles into 
cones by overlapping halves of cut side. Seal seam with water. Place 2 slightly 
rounded tablespoons filling in cone. Moisten edges of pastry and press 
together. Fold over and flute with fingers or press with fork tines. Repeat 
with remaining pastry. Deep fry in hot oil, heated to 360 degrees, until 
golden. Makes 16 pastries. 
</P>
<P>
Yogurt With Cucumber and Mint 
</P>
<P>
2 cups well-drained shredded peeled cucumbers 
</P>
<P>
1 cup plain yogurt

 HINTS FROM HELOISE: SPICES WON'T SPOIL BUT THEY MAY LOSE THEIR POTENCY AS TIME 
GOES BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: How long can one keep spices in the cupboard? We will be moving 
in the near future and I was wondering if I should throw them all out and start 
anew since I have had some of them for a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JEANNE, Belleville, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JEANNE: Before you throw away all those spices, check each one for its 
individually strong, full-bodied aroma and a fresh look. Spices will not go bad 
or spoil; instead, they may lose their potency as time goes by. 
</P>
<P>
The oils in spices, which give them their flavor, escape when exposed to heat, 
moisture or air and eventually deteriorate if stored for a long time. This is 
why it is very important not to store any spices near or over areas of 
higher-than-normal heat or humidity such as over or near a stove, sink or 
dishwasher. Also, a good habit to get into is to replace the lid of a spice 
container as soon as you are through with it to keep it fresh. 
</P>
<P>
If you have added a particular spice to a recipe and the food does not taste 
properly seasoned, the spice has probably lost its potency and should then be 
thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Here is what I do to remove any lingering odor of oven cleaner: I 
spread a thick layer of newspaper on the floor of the oven and with a spray 
bottle filled with warm water, I spray the top and sides of the oven well. 
After drying the inside of the oven with a clean cloth, I roll up the newspaper 
carefully and discard it. 
</P>
<P>
This removes all of the oven cleaner residue and prevents bad odors when I 
first turn the oven after it's been cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
 -- FRANCES, Delta, Utah 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have heard of several ways to flour a cake pan. Some say to use 
cocoa powder when baking a chocolate cake and others say to substitute biscuit 
mix for flour for light-colored cakes. I would like to add my method that has 
never failed me. 
</P>
<P>
After greasing the cake pan, I use the mixed dry ingredients of the recipe to 
flour the pan. If I am using a cake mix, I use some of the dry cake mix. When 
doing this, always remember to return any excess dry mix to the mixing bowl and 
proceed with the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
I have never had a problem with a white dusty look on the bottom of any of my 
cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- E.L., Norwalk, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have found a way of cooking pasta without overheating the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
I first boil the water, to which I have added a pinch of salt and a little 
olive oil, then I add the pasta. When the water begins to boil again, I cover 
the cooking pan with its lid and turn off the burner, leaving the pan on the 
same burner for the recommended cooking time without the heat. 
</P>
<P>
After the recommended time I remove the lid and drain the pasta. It always 
turns out just right this way. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LORI, Sacramento, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I recently bought a couple of cast iron skillets. 
</P>
<P>
The saleswoman gave me a tip: She said that after I wash and dry them to put 
them in the oven to dry completely. Moisture can make cast iron deteriorate. 
It's a good idea to place paper towels between the pans when stacking them so 
there's no trapped moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 -- SUSAN, Amarillo, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have a hint that saves me a lot of time and irritation from 
chemicals of commercial oven cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
I use baking soda to clean my oven and I even use it around the burners when 
something that was spilled around them has become baked on. I just wet the 
inside of my oven with a wet rag and then sprinkle baking soda around (more 
heavily on soiled areas) and let it set for about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Then I use a scrubbing pad and all the baked-on mess comes off real easily. If 
there are some bad spots, use extra soda and scrub a little harder. Rinse out 
the oven. It will be sparkling. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BEVERLY, Boardman, Ohio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: If you happen to break anything that leaves tiny fragments of 
glass all over the floor, here is a great tip that will help pick up all the 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
I was staying at a cabin on vacation. While doing the dishes I dropped a glass 
and it shattered all over the floor. I looked for a vacuum or broom, but 
couldn't find either. I remembered a tip that my aunt told me many years ago, 
so I tried it. 
</P>
<P>
After picking up the large pieces of glass, I wet a piece of newspaper. I put 
the paper on the tiny bits of glass, lifted the paper and the glass clung to 
the paper. I did this all around to make sure I got all the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
It worked. I never found a piece of glass during my stay there.

BUILDING THE BEST KEBABS FOR THE BACK-YARD CHEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Build a better kebab and hungry barbecue fans will beat a path to your back 
yard. Here are some guidelines to make you kebab champ of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Allow four servings per pound of boneless meat or fish; three servings per 
pound of shrimp with shell or chicken with the bone. Plan on one cup of fruit 
or vegetables per person. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cut meat for kebabs in even-size pieces. About 1-inch cubes are the best; 
meat and vegetables get done at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kebabs cook more evenly if there's breathing space between pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Short of time? Look in the fresh meat case of the supermarket for 
ready-to-cook kebabs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Add flavor with a marinade. Place the meat or seafood cubes in a plastic 
bag in a shallow dish. Add your favorite marinade and close the bag. Chill two 
to four hours for fish, seafood or chicken; six hours or overnight for beef, 
pork or lamb. Reserve the marinade to brush over the kebabs as they cook. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There's no need to precook these fruits and vegetables: apple wedges, 
1-inch papaya pieces, orange slices, 1-inch fresh pineapple pieces, 1-inch 
green or red pepper pieces, pea pods, frozen artichoke hearts and 1-inch jicama 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Precook for 1 to 2 minutes: 1/2-inch slices of summer squash, broccoli or 
cauliflower florets and baby scaloppine squash; 4 to 5 minutes: baby carrots, 
1-inch pieces of green onion or leek; 6 to 8 minutes: 1-inch pieces of fresh 
corn on the cob; 12 to 15 minutes: halved tiny new potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cherry tomatoes cook fast. Place them on the skewer for the last 2 minutes 
of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grill kebabs on an uncovered grill over hot coals for 8 to 12 minutes. Turn 
often.

FIRE DESTROYS PAN PACIFIC AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN and NIESON HIMMEL, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspicious fire Wednesday destroyed Los Angeles' Pan Pacific Auditorium, a 
54-year-old landmark that for decades served as one of the city's major sports 
and entertainment centers and commanded a worldwide reputation for its 
distinctive architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it could be arson," said Assistant Fire Chief Tony Ennis. 
</P>
<P>
"We got inside for a quick look, but we couldn't tell anything," said Capt. 
Gary Seidel of the Fire Department's arson squad. "Everything was all wet. It 
will be a couple of days before we know the cause." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said late Wednesday that they want to question a man who arrived 
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's emergency room suffering from smoke 
inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we just want to talk to him in regards to what he observed at the 
time of the fire," said Seidel. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began shortly after 7 p.m. At times, flames from the dilapidated, 
boarded-up auditorium at 7600 Beverly Blvd. shot 200 feet into the night sky 
and could be seen from as far away as the Civic Center and the Silver Lake 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Streets were closed for four blocks in each direction from the blaze, but 
spectators by the hundreds walked to the scene, just east of CBS' Television 
City, and watched flames write the final chapter in the auditorium's uncertain 
recent history. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lost a monument here," said Stanley Treitel, head of a community group 
working to revitalize the Fairfax district. He said the county was moving 
toward rehabilitating the building and preserving its facade. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacle created a tremendous traffic jam. "People were still coming home 
from work, and the streets were gridlocked," said Carol Botney, 27. "People 
were getting out of their cars, and some were fighting. With the huge smoke 
cloud, it looked like a scene after they dropped the bomb." 
</P>
<P>
The fire started in the building's southwest corner, Ennis said. Two 
firefighting task forces arrived almost immediately, one going inside and 
another going to the roof to open it for ventilation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first fire units in found a man either just in or just out of the building 
when they arrived," said Fire Marshall Craig Drummond. "He appeared to have 
suffered slight burns, and they took him to the rescue ambulance for treatment. 
But he bailed out and disappeared into the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Officials believe this was the same man who later appeared at Cedars. No other 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The smoke inhalation victim left the hospital before he was treated, Seidel 
said, but a witness jotted down his license plate number. Arson investigators 
went to an undisclosed address where the car's registered owner lives. The man 
had not arrived by 11 p.m., Seidel said. 
</P>
<P>
Seidel said the man was not considered a suspect. He said preliminary 
indications were that the man was a passer-by who tried to help put out the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters said it was virtually impossible to fight the fire from outside 
because the fire's "seat," or point of origin, was inside. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't get to the seat of the fire, you'll never put it out," said 
firefighter Roy Rodriguez, a member of the first company to arrive at the 
scene. "We're going to let it go, then we're going to put it out." 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour, the building's east wall and roof had collapsed. Witnesses said 
they heard what sounded like two large explosions before the roof was engulfed 
in flames. 
</P>
<P>
John Ewing, 48, a vice president of a heating and air conditioning firm, said 
he saw at least 10 firefighters "up on the roof cutting holes. The flames came 
through the holes. You could see them backing away." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they ordered firefighters off the roof when it became evident 
that they could not "stay ahead of the flames." 
</P>
<P>
Fire Capt. Keith Massey expressed disappointment in the inability to check the 
blaze. "We've been out here every month for the last 15 years, practicing how 
to fight this fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the fire traveled along the roof very quickly. Ten minutes after 
firefighters left the roof, part of it collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like a big tree falling, crackling noises at first and then a big 
crash," said Scott Vincent, 29, of the roof's collapse. "Standing across the 
street, you could feel the heat." 
</P>
<P>
Martin Echivibel said he first "saw the smoke from Venice, then from Culver 
City. I decided to come watch. The flames were big. Watching from Culver City, 
it looked so close." 
</P>
<P>
At the fire's peak, more than 200 firefighters from 50 companies -- some from 
as far away as the San Fernando Valley -- battled the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
As firefighters contained the flames, all that was left standing were three 
charred walls and the distinctive fin-shaped pylons at the entrance. The pylons 
began to collapse about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was stubborn. By 10 p.m., it finally was controlled, but the damage 
was done. Only one pylon remained standing, and it fell about 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Opened in 1935, the once-magnificent auditorium was an early home to the Ice 
Capades, car shows, circuses, conventions, political gatherings, concerts and 
hockey and basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
Considered a prime example of the short-lived architectural style called 
Streamline Moderne -- an expression of America's romance with machines and 
transportation -- the auditorium has stood empty since 1972. 
</P>

Chazanov, John Kendall and John H. Lee.

ACCORD REACHED IN SCHOOL STRIKE; 
</P>
<P>
DISTRICT, L.A. TEACHERS AGREE TENTATIVELY ON 24% SALARY HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ and LARRY GORDON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tentative settlement was reached early this morning to end a teachers' strike 
that paralyzed the vast Los Angeles Unified School District for eight 
emotionally charged days and disrupted the education of nearly 600,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement announced at 1 a.m. by union and district officials, 
teachers would get a retroactive 8% raise for the past term and 8% for each of 
the following two years. They also would receive several long-sought policy 
changes including the elimination of mandatory yard supervision by elementary 
school instructors and the creation of shared-decision making councils at 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers will also receive half of the pay they were docked for withholding 
grades and the rest they can earn back through extra work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a marriage," district negotiator Dick Fisher said of the compromise 
settlement. "You don't win or lose, you try to keep an ongoing relationship." 
The union scheduled a ratification vote at a noon meeting today at the Sports 
Arena, but teachers could return to their classrooms as early as Friday. Both 
sides held out hope that classes will quickly return to normal. The school 
board also must approve the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minimum Pay Hike 
</P>
<P>
The minimum pay for district teachers will rise in steps from the current 
$23,440 to $29,529 in July 1990. Top pay will jump from $40,871 to $51,490 for 
a teacher without an advanced degree and from $43,319 to $53,938 for a teacher 
with a doctorate degree. 
</P>
<P>
The pact is designed to bring a measure of labor peace for the next two years 
to the nation's second-largest school district after New York City. Teachers 
worked this school year without a contract, although taking various job actions 
such as withholding grades to pressure the district until the traumatic strike 
began on May 15. The teachers' strike was the first in 19 years; the 1970 
strike lasted 23 days. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the announcement last week of enormous amounts of unanticipated state 
revenues helped to break the deadlock. Leaders from both sides in the dispute 
attributed the settlement and newly upbeat mood to their trips to Sacramento on 
Tuesday and assurances from state legislators there that the district was to 
receive at least $40 million in extra state funds this fiscal year. However, 
still up in the air is how much of that money can be designated for salaries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sense of Realism' 
</P>
<P>
According to Johnson, legislators had "brought a sense of realism" to the 
situation. He particularly praised Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) 
for helping defray tempers. On Monday, the district and union swapped barbs 
about their respective bargaining positions and a quick resumption of 
negotiations had appeared unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Teams of three officials from each side entered the Westin Bonaventure Hotel 
downtown about 3 p.m. for talks under the supervision of a state mediator. On 
one side of the table were Weintraub, schools Supt. Leonard Britton, and 
district negotiator Dick Fisher; bargaining for the union were Johnson, union 
vice-president Helen Bernstein and negotiator John Britz. 
</P>
<P>
In the days leading up to Wednesday's bargaining session, there had been some 
misdemeanor arrests and sporadic incidents of unruliness. But fearful 
predictions of young people getting caught up in bursts of gang violence never 
came true as students skipping school seemed more intent on watching movies, 
shopping and playing video games. After a few days, some students even said 
they were getting nostalgic for their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, one of the most serious incidents occurred when a striking 
teacher at Andrew Carnegie Junior High School in Carson was arrested and held 
on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon when he allegedly threw a rock at 
a car crossing a picket line and hit a 12-year-old student. A spokesman for the 
county sheriff said teacher David Torgersrud, 30, of San Pedro, was being held 
with bail set at $5,000. The girl was treated at a hospital for cuts and then 
released. 
</P>
<P>
School police said two other teachers were arrested in less serious incidents 
Wednesday, one of them for attempted trespassing at district headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
While signs pointed toward a settlement throughout the day, the school district 
still asked a Superior Court judge Wednesday to limit picketing at schools and 
other district property. Judge Kurt agreed to temporarily bar striking teachers 
from blocking entrances to school sites and ordered them to remain in pairs 12 
feet apart. But Lewin refused to limit the overall number of demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement ends 18 months of maneuvering and disagreement, both between the 
union and the district and among various members of the school board. During 
this time, many parents and students saw themselves as innocent victims. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers saw much of the discord as a struggle between two men -- the 
school superintendent Britton and union head Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
In his previous post as head of the Dade County, Fla., schools, Britton had 
earned a reputation as a friend of teachers by backing their efforts to gain 
some say in school management. But soon after his arrival in Los Angeles two 
years ago, the UTLA began to ridicule Britton as an enemy who spent upwards of 
$90,000 a year-half of that in overtime-to pay for a driver and a man whose own 
salary of $141,000 was higher than that of the mayor or governor. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, meanwhile, antagonized some district officials for what they saw as 
baiting, unfounded attacks on them. They called Johnson's rhetoric 
inflammatory. 
</P>
<P>
The personality conflicts were complicated by political divisions on the school 
board, with much of the bickering played out behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
Although negotiations began for a new contract began in January, 1988, six 
months passed without success and the existing contract expired June 30. In 
September, the union began a boycott of unpaid, non-teaching duties such as 
some yard supervision and the following month, it rejected a district offer of 
a 17.4% pay increase over three years. Last December, a statemediator was 
brought in to help the bargaining along. 
</P>
<P>
Then in January, the union took a new tactic when it threatened to withhold 
first semester grades from the district and give union-produced report cards to 
the students. A wave erupted of large demonstrations by students fearful that 
their chances for college admission would be hurt. The district responded by 
ordering teachers to turn in their grades or have their pay docked. After a 
judge refused to intervene, the union backed down on the grade issue, only to 
repeat the tactic just the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
By February, the district had increased its offer to 20% over three years with 
the promise of an additional 4% if more state funds became available. But a few 
weeks later, union members by a nearly 9-1 margin authorized their leadership 
to call strike and later chose May 30 to walk out. 
</P>
<P>
Then this month, the UTLA rejected a new offer of 21.5% over three years. 
Britton ordered teachers to turn in grades early, by May 15, or face losing 
their May paycheck. The union moved up the strike date to May 15 and a 
last-minute effort to avert it failed. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, it was clear the strike was crippling the district. 
Hundreds of thousands of students simply walked off campuses and more than 
two-thirds of the teachers walked picket lines. The numbers of students dropped 
drastically in the first few days and then slowly began to rise, never reaching 
much higher than 50% of the total enrollment of594,000. Some striking teachers 
returned to their classrooms but never enough to staff schools properly. 
</P>
<P>
On the third day of the strike, the landscape changed dramatically with two 
events. A long-awaited state fact-finder's report on contract proposals was 
released and supported the district's position, among other things, that the 
teachers were well paid. 
</P>
<P>
But that news almost was lost in Gov. George Deukmejian's surprising 
announcement that state revenues would be $2.5 billion higher than anticipated 
in the next two years and that a good chunk of that would go to education under 
the rules of recently passed Proposition 98. At least $40 million would go to 
the Los Angeles district this year although not all could be used for salaries, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Formal negotiations resumed May 18 for the first time in four months and the 
two sides met for four consecutive nights at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel. 
Those talks exploded in rancor last Sunday as both sides accused the other of 
lying. 
</P>
<P>
A long strike seemed likely until legislators summoned the two sides to 
Sacramento Tuesday. After hours of talks with state legislators, the two sides 
agreed to this latest meeting and returned to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The strike was costly not only in terms of lost wages for teachers but also 
because the district stood to lose large amounts of state funds based on 
attendance figures. However, state officials said that those loses probably 
would be more than offset by the district's lower expenses during the strike. 
Britton said the district saved $12 million in unpaid salaries during the first 
week alone. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was certainly better for the union than the conclusion of its 
last strike, a 23-day work stoppage in 1970. At that time, UTLA was seeking its 
first contract and hefty raises but teachers ended up settling for the 
district's original 5% pay raise offer, and the average instructor lost about 
$1,100 during the strike. But the creation of school advisory councils and new 
reading programs was a victory for the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the union has been better organized and has broader support among 
teachers. About two-thirds of the district's teachers, nurses, counselors and 
librarians walked out last week, compared to about half in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Participants say some wounds never fully healed from that strike 19 years ago. 
The same may be true this time around. Faculty lounges are likely to remain 
tense for some time, particularly because strikers have said they resent the 
fact that the contract will benefit colleagues who never walked out. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the strike and the settlement will affect the June 6 run-off elections 
which could lead to a new majority on the school board. Of the two board 
members seeking relection, Julie Korenstein is viewed as pro-union and Alan 
Gershman as unfriendly to union interests.

BRADLEY, COELHO TARGETS OF U.S. CRIMINAL PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preliminary criminal investigations of both Mayor Tom Bradley and House 
Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced) have been opened by the Justice Department 
in Washington in connection with their financial dealings with Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Inc., The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Although details of the investigations are not known, a central question being 
examined is whether Bradley and Coelho, who have acknowledged that they made 
investments through Drexel, illegally received preferential treatment, 
according to two sources close to the investigation. The inquiry also is 
expected to examine whether Drexel offered investment opportunities to the two 
Democratic officeholders with the hope or expectation of receiving favored 
treatment in return. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, newly obtained records show that Bradley -- in a deal that was not 
available to ordinary investors -- purchased $100,000 in "junk bonds" through 
Drexel's high-yield department in Beverly Hills. The March, 1986, transaction 
suggests that the mayor had an unusual relationship with the junk bond 
department headed by Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley apparently lost most of his investment, a previously undisclosed 
purchase of Gibraltar Financial Corp. bonds, according to two independent 
sources familiar with the transaction. But his access to a private placement of 
the Gibraltar bonds by Milken's department appears to be inconsistent with the 
mayor's recent statement that he was "not aware" of receiving any investment 
opportunity not available to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor has refused to elaborate on his ties to Drexel, although he has 
acknowledged that he has an account with the firm. Asked to comment on the 
Justice Department inquiry, Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said Wednesday that 
"the mayor has no knowledge of any such investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, who earlier had declined to comment on the matter, late Wednesday night 
said: "I am confident that the report of a preliminary investigation is 
inaccurate. In Washington's current atmosphere, such stories based on rumor or 
leaks are perhaps inevitable but no less regrettable." 
</P>
<P>
The investigations of Bradley and Coelho are being conducted by the Justice 
Department's Public Integrity Section, a unit responsible for looking into 
allegations of corruption against judges and other political figures. The 
decision to open the probes came after an unusual disagreement between U.S. 
attorney's offices in Los Angeles and New York over whether facts in the case 
warrant such serious action, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sensitive Treatment 
</P>
<P>
Because of the sensitivity of even preliminary investigations of political 
figures, they normally are authorized only after a thorough study of the 
available facts and after the attorney general gives his approval. The Justice 
Department declined Wednesday to comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to open a preliminary investigation of Bradley represents a 
significant step beyond the decision last week by the U.S. attorney's office in 
Manhattan to subpoena records of the mayor's transactions with Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
That subpoena was issued in connection with a "broad-based" inquiry into the 
investment firm's dealings with politicians. Launching a preliminary 
investigation, by contrast, is the first official step in the Justice 
Department's formal procedure for deciding whether the facts warrant no further 
action or instead justify launching a full-scale grand jury investigation 
leading to possible criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Milken are acquaintances who have appeared together at Drexel's 
annual junk bond conference -- informally known as the "Predators' Ball" -- and 
at a variety of programs benefiting charity and nonprofit organizations. Since 
1983, Bradley has received at least $125,000 in campaign contributions from 
Drexel and its network of employees and associates. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, at Bradley's instigation, Coelho persuaded California's two 
senators and the Los Angeles congressional delegation to intervene on behalf of 
Drexel in settlement negotiations with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The agency was seeking to force Drexel to move its junk bond department from 
Beverly Hills to New York. 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, Coelho bought a $100,000 Drexel-issued junk bond with 
the help of a $50,000 loan from Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. that he 
failed to disclose as required by law. Columbia Chairman Thomas Spiegel, a 
close associate of Milken, also has acknowledged assisting Coelho by 
recommending -- and then helping finance -- the highly unusual junk bond 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Milken stepped down as head of the hugely profitable junk bond department in 
March, after he was indicted on federal racketeering and securities fraud 
charges. He has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's investment in the Gibraltar bonds -- technically referred to as 
senior subordinated debentures -- was revealed in records turned over to The 
Times by the mayor's office in response to a state Public Records Act request. 
Two sources familiar with the mayor's finances said Bradley invested in at 
least two other previously undisclosed junk bonds issued by Drexel, though it 
is not known whether the transactions were handled by Milken's unit. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's junk bond department normally dealt only with institutional investors, 
such as insurance companies, mutual funds and banks. Former Drexel employees 
said in interviews that the department maintained accounts for only a very 
select, limited number of individuals, primarily top executives at companies 
that did business with Drexel and friends and relatives of Milken and employees 
of the department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Good Advice' 
</P>
<P>
For the junk bond unit's preferred customers, "the most important thing you get 
is product (securities) that generally the average retail client does not see," 
said one former Drexel executive, who asked not to be named. "The other thing 
you get in the high-yield department is real good advice. These are the people 
who have put together the deal. . . . They are aware of the shortcomings or the 
advantages. That's the type of advantage you don't always get from a retail 
broker." 
</P>
<P>
The records obtained by The Times consist of a log of correspondence to the 
mayor from various Drexel officials. The letters and packages described in the 
log range from one official in the municipal finance department raising the 
possibility of new public financing methods to others sending paperweights to 
the mayor. Several of the 28 entries to Bradley from Drexel are marked 
"personal and confidential." 
</P>
<P>
The records show direct communications between the mayor and Milken's junk bond 
department, including a letter from an administrative employee in the 
department, Jillian H. Mendorff. The letter enclosed a form that the mayor 
needed to sign to authorize the sale of the Gibraltar bonds in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar Financial officials confirmed that its bonds were sold in March, 
1986, by Drexel under a private placement, which meant that they were not 
offered to the public. The bonds were available only to clients of the junk 
bond department and were not registered with the SEC for public trading until 
more than eight months later. 
</P>
<P>
Such private placements were not available to Drexel's regular retail 
customers, said one former Drexel retail broker. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way you could get those private placement bonds was to deal directly 
with the high-yield bond department," the broker said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, refused to discuss the Gibraltar offering. 
Wall Street traders, however, said the Gibraltar bonds were not considered a 
"hot issue," meaning that there was not an exceptionally high level of investor 
interest and that the bonds did not shoot up significantly in value after they 
began trading publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley sold the bonds in January after the ailing thrift's bond ratings had 
declined for months, said two independent sources familiar with the 
transaction. The mayor sold his bonds only days before the company disclosed 
that federal regulators considered the company's main subsidiary, Gibraltar 
Savings, "a troubled institution" operating in an "unsafe and unsound 
condition." 
</P>
<P>
A securities analyst familiar with the Gibraltar bonds said that, if the mayor 
sold them in January, he would have received only between 20 and 30 cents on 
the dollar for his original investment. The mayor, therefore, would have lost 
between $70,000 and $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Based on what is now known about the transaction, Bradley's purchase of the 
bonds does not appear to violate any rules or laws, although one SEC source 
said there may be a question about whether Drexel violated rules concerning 
private placements in selling to the mayor. The rules, in most cases, limit 
private placements to "sophisticated investors" who have substantial assets and 
a high degree of investment savvy.

A story in Thursday editions of The Times misstated the role that Rep. Tony 
Coelho (D-Merced) played when California's two senators and the Los Angeles 
delegation in the House intervened on behalf of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in 
settlement negotiations with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Acting at 
the request of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, Coelho persuaded Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.) to contact the SEC on Drexel's behalf, but there is no 
evidence that he enlisted any other members of the California delegation to 
participate in the effort.

<P>
CHINESE LEADERS FIGHTING AN EPIC BATTLE FOR CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conflicting official news reports Wednesday and early today -- some painting a 
rosy picture of the situation in Beijing, others stressing enforcement of 
martial law -- marked an epic battle for control of China raging through the 
top leadership, the media and the army. 
</P>
<P>
The country's three most influential news organizations -- the People's Daily, 
the New China News Agency and the national television network -- carried 
reports Wednesday describing Beijing as socially stable, with an upsurge of 
politeness between ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Such a portrayal of life in the capital -- largely accurate, although somewhat 
overdramatized -- directly undercuts the rationale behind a five-day-old 
martial-law order issued by hard-line Premier Li Peng. Li's order, which has so 
far proven unenforceable, declared that troops must enter the city to put an 
end to turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
By describing life in the capital as stable, the media reports provided support 
for reformist Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, 69, in a political 
struggle against Li, 60, and elderly leaders, including 84-year-old Deng 
Xiaoping, who want to use the army to crush a five-week-old student-led 
pro-democracy protest movement. 
</P>
<P>
Other reports, however, have reflected significant political and military 
backing for the attempted martial-law crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
In its morning newscast today, the local Beijing radio station reported a call 
by military authorities for troops to obey the orders of the party and to study 
recent statements by Li. 
</P>
<P>
"A small group of people are creating chaos with the aim of rejecting the 
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and rejecting the socialist system," 
the military statement declared. "In the face of this serious struggle, we must 
keep cool heads and a revolutionary attitude. No matter what serious situations 
arise, no matter what complex struggles we face, we must fulfill to the full 
the orders of the Central Military Commission." 
</P>
<P>
Deng, as chairman of that commission, is commander in chief of the armed forces 
and is believed to have personally approved the decision to impose martial law. 
Until the current crisis broke, it had been widely expected that Zhao, No. 2 in 
the commission hierarchy, stood a good chance of succeeding Deng as chairman 
sometime this year. 
</P>
<P>
The South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong English-language daily, reported 
Wednesday that Deng had branded Zhao "a traitor to the party . . . and a 
counterrevolutionary" during a two-day enlarged Politburo meeting in Beijing 
that ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Politburo was also said to have decided to purge officers and troops loyal 
to Zhao. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Morning Post, Politburo members, including Li, accused Zhao of 
four "crimes." One is that he gave support to the "counterrevolutionary" 
student movement; another, that he disclosed state secrets to Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev by describing the internal Chinese Communist Party 
decision to let Deng continue as the final arbiter of all party decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Third, the Morning Post said, the hard-liners accused Zhao of supporting 
radical reforms that they consider counterrevolutionary. And finally, the 
newspaper said, Zhao is accused of being an "official profiteer." The paper 
said that both Zhao and his two sons are alleged to have committed serious 
economic crimes. 
</P>
<P>
In today's editions, the Hong Kong newspaper said that unnamed military leaders 
promised Deng their support in exchange for a larger political role for the 
People's Liberation Army and a bigger share of the budget. The Morning Post 
also reported that Deng has formed a high-level "National Leading Group to 
Prevent Turmoil" within the Central Military Commission to take charge of the 
political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Deng and his supporters are attempting to strip Zhao of all his posts within 
the party, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
In another media-related decision favoring the hard-liners fronted by Li, 
satellite transmissions by foreign television networks -- which had been 
banned, then allowed again -- were again banned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The army has been blocked for five days at the outskirts of Beijing by 
residents who swarmed into the streets to erect barricades of buses, trucks and 
concrete pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Surprised by the fierce resistance of the capital's citizens -- and unwilling 
to use force against them -- almost all of the troops have now retreated a few 
miles to settle into nearby army bases. About 1,500 soldiers who arrived by 
rail Sunday at the central train station -- the only soldiers to have 
penetrated the citizens' defense perimeter -- endured a fourth day of waiting 
in their coaches Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the soldiers said two more battalions had arrived by train at Tongxian, 
nine miles east of the capital, United Press International reported. 
</P>
<P>
All of the troops -- now estimated to number anywhere from 20,000 to 70,000 in 
the outskirts of Beijing -- appeared to be waiting for the political struggle 
in the top leadership to produce a winner capable of issuing clear orders. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's edition of the Liberation Army Daily carried a letter addressed to 
soldiers responsible for enforcing martial law that had been written Monday by 
China's army command. 
</P>
<P>
"In this serious political struggle that affects the future fate of the nation 
. . . the troops will face every kind of difficulty and test in their task of 
ending the disturbance and restoring normal order," the army letter said. "An 
extreme minority of people are fanning the flames, creating turmoil, with the 
goal of negating the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the 
socialist system." 
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily -- a bastion of sentiment favoring Zhao -- projected a 
radically different view in its Wednesday article on the situation in the 
Chinese capital. 
</P>
<P>
"Public morale has been revitalized," said one man quoted by the official party 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen so many people being kind and considerate to each other," 
said another. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency, immediately after carrying these two quotes 
in a lengthy summary of the People's Daily article, went on to state: "The 
leading newspaper in China reported that their feelings are shared by many 
people who have come to the capital from other parts of the country, who find 
that they are no longer annoyed by the almost legendary slack service, rudeness 
or rigid attitudes of Beijing shop assistants. 
</P>
<P>
"The newspaper cites some small but revealing human interest stories to 
illustrate the newly appeared high morale of Beijingers, despite their concern 
for the future," the news agency report said. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily report describes how, as martial-law troops tried to enter 
the city early Saturday morning, students and residents blocked their path. 
</P>
<P>
"More than 20 military trucks were blocked by city residents at an 
intersection," the newspaper said. "Some young workers walked up in front of 
the military trucks and handed out cigarettes, gave them newspapers and 
enthusiastically and sincerely explained to the soldiers the large-scale 
petitioning movement that occurred in the capital over the previous several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"An old lady who at first had shouted, 'If you want to keep going, then drive 
over me!' ended up giving the soldiers steamed bread and drinking water." 
</P>
<P>
A report by the New China News Agency that ran in this same Wednesday edition 
of the People's Daily reported that in the previous few days, the air force, 
the navy and the Communist Party leadership of western China's Lanzhou military 
district and the coastal Jinan military district "seriously studied the 
speeches of Li Peng and (Chinese President) Yang Shangkun at the (May 19 ) 
party, military and government cadres meeting in the capital." 
</P>
<P>
These military units had "expressed support for the important policy of the 
central leadership, and determined to contribute to the maintenance of a 
political situation of stability and unity," the news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The military, however, is not united in support of the martial-law declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Since late last week, reports have circulated among some Chinese officials and 
party members that Defense Minister Qin Jiwei opposed the use of troops to 
quell the student-led demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters news agency Wednesday quoted an unidentified Western expert who 
expressed the view that Qin did in fact oppose the imposition of martial law. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the senior People's Liberation Army are thought to be in Qin's 
camp," Reuters quoted this source as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students still assembled in a makeshift squatters' camp in Tian An 
Men Square on Wednesday expressed determination to carry on their struggle in 
the face of the uncertain political situation and the continued threat of 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
Cai Ling, 23, a graduate student at Beijing Teachers University who on 
Wednesday morning was elected president of the independent student organization 
that has organized the protests, said the students have three basic demands for 
ending their occupation of the square: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The question of whether Premier Li can truly represent the government and 
the nation must be taken up by appropriate authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Martial law must be canceled and the troops ringing the city must be 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An April 26 People's Daily editorial severely criticizing the student 
movement must be retracted.

ROBBINS TESTIMONY CALLED FACTOR IN MONTOYA PROSECUTION

Sen. Alan Robbins, whose name has surfaced as a possible target in a federal 
investigation of political corruption, has been cooperating with prosecutors 
and testified before a grand jury about fellow Democratic Sen. Joseph B. 
Montoya, according to a legislative source familiar with the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins (D-Tarzana), who was secretly tape-recorded during the FBI's Capitol 
sting operation, was questioned before the grand jury about statements he made 
to an informant suggesting that Montoya's vote could be influenced by giving 
the Whittier Democrat an honorarium of $2,500 to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Records Subpoenaed 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' testimony about Montoya's willingness to accept money from special 
interest groups could be used in the prosecution of Montoya, who was indicted 
last week on 10 counts of racketeering, extortion and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
After Montoya's indictment, federal investigators subpoenaed a vast array of 
records involving Robbins and four public officials previously identified as 
subjects of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Among the documents sought by the grand jury were Robbins' campaign and 
personal financial records, extensive legislative files connected with the 
senator and the records of two special interest groups that have given him more 
than $48,000 in campaign contributions since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. David F. Levi, who is heading the investigation, refused to say 
whether Robbins is a target of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't discuss that kind of thing one way or another," Levi said. 
</P>
<P>
But sources close to Robbins said the senator believes that he is not a subject 
of the investigation and that federal officials will not uncover any evidence 
linking him to wrongdoing. Robbins is said to be turning over records and 
cooperating with investigators in the belief that the FBI is trying to 
determine his credibility prior to the Montoya trial. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say the investigation of political corruption, which began in 
1985, could go on for years. With each major development in the case -- such as 
the Montoya indictment -- investigators expect members of the public to come 
forward with new allegations of extortion and corruption, perhaps involving 
lawmakers who are not now targets. 
</P>
<P>
One source familiar with the investigation said that scrutiny of the 
Legislature could continue "until the well runs dry -- and if it doesn't, until 
the end of time." 
</P>
<P>
So far, federal investigators appear to have served nearly 300 subpoenas in the 
case, seeking financial and legislative records involving a wide range of 
issues and lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Since Montoya's indictment, investigators have also stepped up interviews of 
legislative staff members who formerly worked for State Board of Equalization 
member Paul Carpenter, a former Democratic senator from Cypress and a target of 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The other known legislative targets of the probe are Assembly members Pat Nolan 
(R-Glendale), Frank Hill (R-Whittier) and Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Montoya was indicted along with a former aide, Amiel Jaramillo, who was charged 
on three counts. Three of the counts against Montoya stemmed from the 
undercover sting operation, but the others are based on evidence obtained later 
from legislative staff members, lobbyists and special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, chairman of the Senate Insurance, Claims and Corporations Committee, 
was one of several legislators tape-recorded by the FBI when he spoke with 
undercover informant John Shahabian, a Senate aide who worked at one point for 
Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
According to one legislative source familiar with the probe, Robbins agreed in 
a taped conversation to Shahabian's request that he support a bill sponsored by 
a "company" set up by the FBI as part of its sting operation. However, when 
Shahabian offered Robbins money in exchange for his vote, the senator refused 
to accept any payment, a source close to Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
This apparently sets Robbins apart from the known legislative targets of the 
probe, all of whom have reported accepting money at one point or another from 
the FBI's undercover operatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Public Comment 
</P>
<P>
Robbins has repeatedly refused to discuss the case, saying: "I follow a policy 
of not commenting on any of these issues. I will be consistent in that regard. 
I made the comment long ago that I was the legislator who was offered money and 
declined it." 
</P>
<P>
When Robbins testified before the grand jury in April, he was asked to explain 
statements he had made in one taped conversation with Shahabian that Montoya 
would be likely to accept money in exchange for his vote on a bill, one 
legislative source said. In particular, prosecutors wanted to know what 
evidence Robbins had to indicate that Montoya could be influenced by 
honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, however, testified that he had no specific knowledge of Montoya 
trading votes for money and said that he had been talking simply about 
Montoya's reputation at the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
In one tape-recorded conversation with Shahabian, the undercover informant told 
Robbins that he wanted to become more influential in the Capitol and asked for 
suggestions about directing payments from outside interests to legislators, 
according to the source. Specifically, Shahabian asked how much money it would 
take to obtain the vote of Montoya, chairman of the Senate Business and 
Professions Committee. 
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, Robbins suggested that Shahabian could give Montoya 
honorariums as high as $2,500 to $3,000 without attracting much attention 
outside the Capitol, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
FBI undercover agents later gave Montoya an honorarium of $3,000 during a 
meeting over breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Before Robbins' grand jury testimony, prosecutors let him review transcripts of 
two taped conversations he had with Shahabian, according to the legislative 
source.

UC REPORT URGES SHIFT IN ADMISSIONS OF MINORITIES 
</P>

A faculty report on UC Berkeley freshman admissions policies that could lead to 
slightly more restrictive rules on admissions of blacks, Latinos and American 
Indians and slightly less restrictive ones on Anglos and Asian-Americans was 
submitted Wednesday to the school's Academic Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report by the nine-member Admissions and Enrollment Committee of 
the Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate, chaired by sociology professor 
Jerome Karabel, was couched in often complicated language with many uncertain 
terms, university officials termed its recommendations an important step toward 
a new admissions policy to take effect in the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The report is subject to review by Berkeley admissions officials and could 
undergo changes before the policies it advocates are put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
But two of its recommendations could, if adopted, have a significant effect on 
the balance of student admissions by ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
First, it says that "The proportion of the fall freshmen . . . selected by 
academic criteria alone should be increased from 40% to 50%." This probably 
would increase the number of Asian-Americans and Anglos admitted, because they 
account for a higher percentage of the best-qualified applicants, according to 
both school grades and scholastic aptitude test scores. 
</P>
<P>
Second, it would give UC Berkeley the option of following UCLA's lead this year 
and not automatically admit all blacks, Latinos and American Indians who are 
eligible by virtue of being in the top 12.5% academically of their high school 
graduating classes. 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley, as well as many other universities, have faced much controversy 
over their admissions policies. Asian-American groups have charged that 
Berkeley restricts admissions of members of their community below what their 
academic standing would indicate, while just this week a prominent Latino group 
called for increased admissions of Latinos to the school. 
</P>
<P>
For the 1989-90 academic year, UC Berkeley has had about 22,000 applicants for 
freshman positions but only about 3,800 positions to offer. 
</P>
<P>
In the total applicant pool, UC Berkeley already finds that it has far more 
applicants each year who are eligible by the UC system's 12.5% academic 
standard than it has openings in the freshman class. But up until now, it has 
admitted all of the academically eligible blacks, Latinos and American Indians 
while turning down many of the academically eligible Anglos and 
Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
But even while advocating some change in this arrangement, the report still 
contains many provisions for admitting students on the basis of cultural and 
ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, campus officials cautioned Wednesday that the report's precise 
effect on the ethnic balance of admissions is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
One campus official, who asked not to be identified, said the faculty report 
represents an assessment that "Berkeley has succeeded in diversifying its 
student body more quickly than we thought we would, and admissions policy must 
become more balanced as we reach parity between ethnic groups and their 
representation in the state's high school graduating classes.

JUVENILE CURFEW IN U.S. CAPITAL VOIDED BY JUDGE

<P>
A federal judge on Wednesday barred the District of Columbia from enforcing a 
juvenile curfew law aimed at curbing drug-related violence in the nation's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Charles Richey said that the law, which would have kept 
people under age 18 off the streets from 11 p.m to 6 a.m., violates the 
constitutional rights of thousands of the city's juveniles. The curfew would 
have begun at midnight on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Temporary Curfew Emergency Act of 1989 "subjects the district's juveniles 
to virtual house arrest each night" and "is a bull in a china shop of 
constitutional values," Richey said. "However laudable the objectives which 
motivated its adoption, the act is invalid on its face and may not be 
enforced." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Law Contained Exemptions 
</P>
<P>
The curfew statute, signed on April 14 by Mayor Marion Barry, would have been 
in effect for 90 days. It contained exemptions for teen-agers returning home 
from work, school or church-sanctioned functions and for those traveling with 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
The local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union obtained a temporary 
restraining order against the law on April 20, and the district government 
agreed to an extension until the court reached a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
The law "was more of a response to political pressure than it was a realistic 
approach to the problems," Arthur Spitzer, legal director of the local ACLU, 
said. Barry was not available for comment.

EX-U.S. ARMS CONTROL ADVISER NITZE HAILS LATEST SOVIET OFFER TO CUT TROOPS

Paul H. Nitze, a key Reagan Administration arms control adviser, Wednesday 
hailed as "extraordinary" a Soviet proposal to cut conventional forces and 
urged President Bush to work "hammer and tongs" to nail down a pact. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he ought to negotiate very seriously on it; the Soviets are moving 
toward our initial (arms control) initiative," Nitze said in response to 
questions at a National Press Club luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason for not going at this hammer and tongs to try to work out this 
conventional reduction and stabilizing proposal," Nitze said. "I'm sure they 
will do that. I don't see how they could refuse to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
Nitze, who advised President Reagan on a range of arms control matters, said 
the proposal made by Soviet arms negotiators at a closed meeting with U.S. and 
allied officials in Vienna on Tuesday nearly matches the one offered earlier by 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union proposed sweeping reductions in its military forces in Europe, 
including cutting 1.26 million troops and tens of thousands of tanks, artillery 
and armored vehicles.

SOVIET OFFER MAY SPEED CONVENTIONAL ARMS PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The latest Soviet proposal on force cuts in Europe, which the State Department 
welcomed as a "very positive development," significantly advances prospects for 
a new agreement on conventional arms reduction in the foreseeable future, U.S. 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Important differences remain, but the Moscow offer made in talks in Vienna 
coincides largely with a North Atlantic Treaty Organization opening proposal 
for limits on tanks and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, it accepts the NATO concept of limiting a single country's 
contribution to an alliance to 60% to 70% of the alliance's total war materiel, 
as well as limiting how much of a single country's materiel can be stationed 
outside home borders. The effect would be to curb Moscow's capacity to 
intimidate its East European allies. 
</P>
<P>
The new Soviet moves, according to U.S. officials, also should improve 
prospects for two other key sets of superpower arms negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"We view this as a serious and substantive proposal that is being received as 
such," said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. "We treat and 
accept this seriously, and it's a very positive development." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater echoed the enthusiastic 
evaluation. "Those are major, major concessions (by the Soviets) that put them 
more in line with the NATO proposal," he said. "It's an offer that's on the 
table. It's not a speech." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the conventional arms proposal made Tuesday could 
speed agreement on the prickly issue of the future of short-range nuclear 
missiles in Europe. That is now the subject of a major dispute between the 
United States and West Germany that threatens to mar next week's NATO summit 
meeting in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affects Other Arms Talks 
</P>
<P>
East-West talks on reducing the missiles, which West Germany wants, could begin 
sooner if the negotiations on conventional forces progress quickly, since the 
United States views the missiles as an important counterforce against the East 
Bloc's superiority in troops and non-nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the strategic arms reduction talks on cutting intercontinental nuclear 
arsenals in half could benefit, because some experts believed that the forum 
for those talks was getting too far ahead of the conventional force talks. 
</P>
<P>
Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, for example, had complained that 
reductions in nuclear arms could give Moscow new opportunities to exploit its 
overwhelming conventional superiority. An increased pace in the conventional 
talks would ease this concern. 
</P>
<P>
Although billed in some reports as a surprise, the ceilings proposed Tuesday by 
the Soviets on men and equipment had been disclosed to Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III during his trip to Moscow two weeks ago by Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler called the formal Soviet proposal laid on the table in Vienna an 
"elaboration" and a "fleshing out" of Gorbachev's comments. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department expert said that with the offer "the Soviets have basically 
accepted NATO positions already offered at Vienna. There will still be fights 
over whether to include manpower and aircraft in the first phase of reductions 
(over the next six or seven years), which we don't want to do but the Soviets 
do, and some other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's as if the Soviets decided numbers don't matter that much, that it's 
more important to reduce their overall defense burden, keep up the momentum 
toward agreement, improve their image, rather than squabble over 1,000 tanks or 
so," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The expert said that an accord on conventional forces, as well as strategic 
arms, may now be possible in "as early as a year for either or both." That 
could occur, he said, "if we get decisions at the highest political levels on 
which matters can be compromised," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet-initiated Warsaw Pact proposal does not meet directly with each 
point of the NATO proposal. On the other hand, it calls for cuts in some 
categories -- manpower and aircraft -- that NATO ignored. The NATO proposal, in 
contrast, calls for indirect manpower cuts -- through withdrawal of the 
manpower needed to operate tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery as 
that equipment is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
On tanks, NATO proposed 20,000 total for each alliance within Europe, from the 
Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains. No single country could have more than 
12,000 tanks. Of these, no country could have more than 3,200 tanks outside its 
own borders, that is, on the territory of an ally. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet proposal accepts the 20,000 total, but called for 14,000 tanks as 
the single nation maximum and 4,500 tanks as the out-of-country maximum. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancies may arise partly because the Soviets count small armored 
scout cars as tanks while NATO does not. Once that difference is eliminated, 
the gap between should be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, NATO would limit artillery pieces to 16,500 total, 10,000 for one 
country, with 1,700 maximum abroad. The Warsaw Pact proposed 24,000 total 
pieces, 17,000 for one country and 4,000 abroad. Here again, the two sides 
count differently, with the Soviet Bloc including 75-millimeter artillery and 
large mortars while NATO tallies only artillery of 105 millimeters and larger. 
</P>
<P>
NATO would limit armored personnel carriers to 33,500 total, 16,800 for a 
single nation, and 6,000 out of country. The comparable Warsaw Pact proposal 
was 28,000, 18,000 and 7,500, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the proposed manpower is not clear. The Washington Post reported 
that the Warsaw Pact would cut 1.26 million troops from its forces. Baker was 
told by Gorbachev that the offer was for equal ceilings of 1.35 million men for 
each alliance, a senior official said. Reuters news service reported that the 
Warsaw Pact had proposed a ceiling of 920,000 on any single nation within 
either alliance. 
</P>
<P>
NATO does not want to discuss cuts in fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. But 
the Warsaw Pact, contending that NATO has an advantage in both quantity and 
quality of these weapons, proposed a ceiling of 1,200 attack aircraft and 1,350 
helicopters for national forces, and 350 and 600, respectively, stationed on 
foreign territory.

CHINA'S POWER STRUGGLE LIKE A FAMILY SPAT; ELDERS TRY TO REPAIR SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD BREMNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chinese power struggle is a bit like a family squabble that spills out onto 
the front yard where all the neighbors can hear the arguments and insults. Amid 
the tumult, family elders are meeting in the kitchen, behind drawn shades and 
away from prying eyes, to try to patch things up and hold the clan together. 
</P>
<P>
Having watched earlier such outbursts, and knowing who controls the family 
checkbook, outsiders can guess how it will turn out. But with strong young 
people chafing at the old ways and demanding changes, the household patriarch 
may have to give way, and neighbors could find quite a different family living 
next door. 
</P>
<P>
It has been something like that for China specialists this week as they watch 
the struggle in China. The past is a guide, but not necessarily a blueprint, 
for tomorrow's China. 
</P>
<P>
As it has for 40 years, the Chinese Communist Party holds the reins in China. 
Its top leaders -- and their outlooks and loyalties to each other -- shape 
policy and the government that carries it out. 
</P>
<P>
The party in theory grows from the grass roots -- from party cells in local 
factories, farms and enterprises all the way up to the policy-making Politburo 
in Beijing. Formally, the National Party Congress is chosen by provincial 
congresses and meets every five years to select a party Central Committee, 
currently about 177 people plus 110 alternate members. A plenum of the Central 
Committee then is supposed to choose the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, specialists believe, it works from the top down. The party's 
Politburo makes sure that most of the right people get elected to the Central 
Committee by keeping a close eye on who gets into the provincial and local 
meetings that pick delegates to the National Party Congress. The process is 
somewhat like party bosses in a democracy giving bigwigs parliamentary seats in 
safe districts to ensure that they get elected. 
</P>
<P>
The day-to-day decisions of the party's 17-member Politburo are made by its 
five-member Standing Committee. This powerful group is nominally chosen by the 
full Politburo, but outsiders assume that the actual choice of members is made 
by China's preeminent leader, Deng Xiaoping, in consultation with other senior 
party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indirect Election 
</P>
<P>
Government bodies have a similar origin, with a National People's Congress -- 
China's Parliament -- picked by local assemblies. But in this system of 
indirect election, the Communist Party plays a large role in selection of local 
representatives, and thus of the National People's Congress. The NPC then names 
the State Council -- equivalent to a cabinet -- and the premier. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Oksenberg, professor of political science at the University of Michigan, 
notes that "this is the theory." 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that on the government side, there is a premier, a limited 
number of vice premiers (currently three), and a limited number of state 
councilors, a total of 10 or 15 people, and they are called the Standing 
Committee of the State Council. The Standing Committee of the State Council is 
the real decision-making body on the government side." 
</P>
<P>
The military, the third main element, is controlled by the party's Military 
Affairs Commission, headed by Deng. 
</P>
<P>
"The Military Affairs Commission is under the direct control of the party," 
Oksenberg said. "The key point is that the party controls the gun, and what's 
significant is that it's not the government that controls the gun. It's the 
Politburo, through the chairman of the military commission, who controls the 
army. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's Deng. He has kept that position, as Mao Tse-tung did until the 
end." 
</P>
<P>
Oksenberg suggests another way of looking at power and control in China. 
</P>
<P>
"In reality, I'd say, depending on how you count it, there are between 25 and 
35 leaders in China who are equivalent to the board of directors and management 
committee of a large American corporation." 
</P>
<P>
These two or three dozen include the preeminent leader -- Mao until his death 
in 1976, then an interregnum, now Deng -- plus the party chief (Zhao Ziyang), 
the premier (Li Peng), one or two vice premiers, and perhaps one or two more at 
the apex of the party. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the elite few dozen, Oksenberg said, are leaders of education and 
propaganda -- the "mouths of the party center" -- and a number of respected 
elders -- "elephants," some Chinese call them -- who do not owe their positions 
to the preeminent leader. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these veteran, respected party members find a spot on party bodies such 
as the Central Advisory Commission, which has no direct power but can heavily 
influence the outcome in key bodies such as the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, specialists note that some major decisions of the Chinese Communist 
Party are made at "expanded" meetings of party bodies and that the outcome may 
hinge on who is allowed to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's an expanded meeting of the Politburo or an expanded meeting of 
the (Politburo) Standing Committee doesn't make any difference," said Roderick 
MacFarquhar, professor of government at Harvard University and director of 
Harvard's Fairbank Center for East Asian Research. "All these people who are 
meeting are, as far as can be judged from outside, meeting as equals. All these 
terms (titles of bodies) are in a sense meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
"Decision-making is larger than the one or two people who are supposed to be in 
charge," MacFarquhar said. "The question always is who decides who attends what 
kind of meeting." 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a decision made by an amorphous body," he said, "a mix of Central 
Committee, Politburo and Central Advisory Committee, probably in proportions 
that enable the person calling the meeting to stack it in his favor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politburo May Meet Today 
</P>
<P>
Noting reports that the Politburo may meet today or Friday, MacFarquhar said 
that apparently means the top party leadership is ready to make known its 
decision in the current power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The party leaders have already held the expanded Politburo meeting, he said, 
"and probably have decided what to do, and the coming meeting of the Politburo 
will be the formalization." Oksenberg said that the past few weeks and the 
coming Politburo meeting show that the "struggle has clearly begun for who will 
be China's next preeminent leader. 
</P>
<P>
"The two contenders are Zhao and Li, and each is calling his assets into play," 
Oksenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"Deng, as head of the Military Affairs Commission, has thrown his weight behind 
Li, but not all military men have followed Deng. The outcome will be decided in 
the Politburo and the Military Affairs Commission." 
</P>
<P>
But China's seething social and political conflicts may not be settled by a 
party verdict handed down by a few top leaders. 
</P>
<P>
MacFarquhar sees a need for other steps, interim moves to defuse the crisis, 
followed by long-range changes to give more Chinese a sense of participation. 
</P>
<P>
"In a crisis like this, a real conflict between society and state," he said, 
"you want to temporize, take the pressure off, defuse the conflict. "So you 
could call a meeting of the National People's Congress. The actual summoning of 
the supreme organ of state would defuse the crisis and allow time for debate." 
</P>
<P>
"Second, as in Gorbachev's Russia, it's clear that having elections and 
breathing some life into moribund bodies is healthy, it blunts criticisms and 
gives society channels to make its voice heard." 
</P>
<P>
Communist leaders, he said, could add a bit of democracy by enlivening a 
peripheral organization called the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference as a forum for minor parties to speak out and voice criticisms of 
Communist policies.

ARAB LEAGUE FORCE FOR LEBANON DEBATED; 
</P>
<P>
CONTROVERSIAL PLAN TO REPLACE SYRIAN UNITS AIRED AT SUMMIT 
</P>

<P>
Arab leaders, heading toward what promised to be a major confrontation between 
moderate and hard-line states, debated a proposal Wednesday to form an Arab 
League peacekeeping force to replace Syrian forces in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was circulated by Jordan, over strong Syrian protests, during a 
series of bilateral meetings here on the second day of an emergency Arab League 
summit called to discuss the Lebanese crisis and the Palestinian question. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian issue, which was the subject of a heated debate during 
pre-summit meetings by Arab League foreign ministers, appeared to have been 
artfully handled by an Egyptian-authored compromise resolution. The resolution 
expresses the summit's support for Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman 
Yasser Arafat's political initiative without explicitly endorsing some of the 
more controversial concessions he has made over the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon remained the summit's most divisive issue -- the one with which an 
increasingly confident coalition of moderate Arab states, reinforced by Egypt's 
return to Arab ranks, was trying to put Syria and its radical allies on the 
defensive. 
</P>
<P>
The moderates, led by Egypt and Iraq, are "trying to pull the rug out from 
under Syria in Lebanon," one conference source said. "The Syrians are furious 
about it, but they can't really do anything now that the weight of Egypt is 
back in the Arab fold." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Place in History 
</P>
<P>
Even if it does nothing else -- and, in the struggle to achieve a consensus, 
there is still a strong possibility that it will end up doing little, if 
anything, about Lebanon -- this summit "has already earned its place in Arab 
history by restoring Egypt to full membership in the Arab League," one senior 
Arab diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Although most analysts do not expect Egypt to dominate Arab ranks the way it 
did 10 years ago, before its membership in the Arab League was suspended for 
signing a peace treaty with Israel, Cairo's return to Arab councils adds 
significant weight to what is being described as a new moderate axis also 
grouping Jordan, Iraq and, to a lesser extent, the conservative but politically 
timid states of the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"No one country can dominate the region any longer. It is a trio now -- Egypt, 
Iraq and Syria," the senior diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Covertly Capitulating 
</P>
<P>
Still, the effect of Egypt's weight on the Iraqi side of this regional scale of 
power is already making itself felt at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
After covertly capitulating on the issue of Egypt's readmittance to the Arab 
League, Syria was forced to accept the Egyptian compromise on the Palestinian 
resolution to be adopted at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it is also being forced, largely at Iraqi-Egyptian 
insistence, to fight a defensive battle over the question of its military 
presence in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Delivering the keynote address Tuesday night to the opening session of the 
summit at Casablanca's opulent Royal Palace, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 
threw down the gauntlet to the Syrians by calling for the withdrawal of "all 
foreign forces" from Lebanon. He urged his fellow Arabs to act decisively 
"before the fire takes away from our hands all possible elements of stability." 
</P>
<P>
After what was originally a suggestion by Iraq, a proposal to send a small Arab 
League observer force to Lebanon was expanded into a discussion about 
dispatching a full peacekeeping force that would be likely to include a large 
contingent of Egyptian troops, according to summit participants. 
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the force, whose size and composition have yet to be 
decided, would be to oversee the implementation of a four-point peace plan for 
Lebanon drafted in preparatory talks by Arab League foreign ministers earlier 
this week, conference sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The four points of the plan, contained in a ministerial committee report to be 
debated at the summit, include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Consolidating a cease-fire to halt the vicious artillery duels between 
Christian Lebanese forces and Syrian troops that have ravaged Beirut for two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Convening the Lebanese Parliament to elect a new president for the divided 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Instituting political reforms to which the new president, required by the 
constitution to be a Christian, would be committed. While the reforms have yet 
to be spelled out, the Arab League plan envisions a stronger role for Lebanon's 
Muslim premier. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Strengthening the authority of the Lebanese Parliament by giving it the 
power to override the president's veto of any Cabinet ministers chosen by the 
prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal for a peacekeeping force, Syria's 45,000 soldiers in Lebanon 
also would be gradually withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Because this would dramatically diminish Syria's role in Lebanon -- a role that 
has given it wide regional influence -- it is highly improbable that Syrian 
President Hafez Assad will agree to it. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution on Lebanon to be adopted by the summit "will try to consolidate 
the Arab League role there -- but, of course, there will also have to be a 
face-saving formula for Syria," another conference source said.

RABIN REJECTS U.S. CALL FOR CHANGE IN OCCUPATION POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin met with President Bush on Wednesday and 
bluntly rejected American calls for changes in Israel's controversial 
occupation policies in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel will not budge an inch" until Palestinians agree to Israel's formula 
for opening negotiations on the future of the occupied territories, Rabin said 
after the half-hour meeting with Bush. "In the Middle East there are no short 
cuts, no 'open sesame' solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Rabin specifically rejected a call by Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
that Israel allow schools on the West Bank to reopen. In a reference to the 
Palestinian uprising that began in December, 1987, he noted that the Israeli 
government three times has offered to allow schools to open if the Palestinians 
would pledge to "take the schools out of the violence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reach Out to Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Baker had called for the schools to reopen as part of a process 
designed to "reach out to Palestinians as neighbors who deserve political 
rights." Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejected Baker's speech, calling 
it "useless." Rabin seemed only slightly more conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be advisable to all parties," he said, to avoid focusing on issues 
where "we know we are deeply divided." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Rabin disclosed that the United States had conducted almost 30 troop 
exercises in Israel in the last five years. The maneuvers recently have 
expanded in scope, he added, and last month, for the first time, a full U.S. 
Marine battalion conducted war practice on Israeli soil with live artillery and 
attack helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the United States has conducted military maneuvers in Israel has 
been an open secret for years, but Rabin's remarks, made in a speech to the 
Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, was the first official 
statement to provide details of their size and scope. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maneuvers Increased 
</P>
<P>
Until a month ago, Rabin said, the maneuvers had been kept to the size of a 
company, roughly 180 soldiers. But at the request of the commander of the U.S. 
6th Fleet, Vice Adm. J. D. Williams, Israel had agreed to an exercise using a 
full battalion, roughly 900 troops. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, which generally has tried to keep the maneuvers out of 
sight, would not comment on Rabin's statement. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rejection of Baker's proposals, Administration officials put the 
best face on the meetings with Rabin, emphasizing areas of cooperation and 
calling Rabin's session with Bush "productive." 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that the United 
States is "wholeheartedly supportive" of Shamir's proposal for supervised 
elections on the West Bank to chose Palestinian leaders with whom Israel could 
negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was the strongest U.S. endorsement of Shamir's election plan. 
Elections would be the first step in a multi-year process of "confidence 
building" that would end in limited self-government for the Palestinians, but 
not in a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
And White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush "made clear his 
determination to provide Israel with the resources necessary for its security." 
</P>
<P>
"The military strength of Israel is a guarantee against the outbreak of 
hostilities," Rabin said. "The stronger Israel will be, the more risks Israel 
can take for peace."

'NATION OF DESTINY' NOTION A SENSITIVE ISSUE IN ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The stormy response to the U.S. secretary of state's attack on the "vision" of 
a greater Israel was due in part to his questioning, in unusually blunt terms, 
of the notion of Israel as a country of destiny. 
</P>
<P>
The view taken by Secretary of State James A. Baker III that it is unrealistic 
for Israelis to retain the West Bank and Gaza Strip forced Israelis to look 
inward and to consider whether, by forgoing control of these occupied lands, 
they are surrendering some immutable part of the national character. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the question has been posed openly: Is Israel a God-given place 
where no challenge is too great to overcome, or is it a country like any other 
with limits on its resources and resourcefulness? 
</P>
<P>
Even observers who agree with the substance of Baker's remarks believe that he 
may have been too forthright. Israel, they say, has not yet separated its 
dreams from realistic possibilities and needs to be brought along slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"The language he used was unwise," said Yaron Ezrahi, a peace activist and 
political theorist at Hebrew University. "It insulted Israelis at an emotional 
level. It is hard for anyone, Israeli or Palestinian, to give up his dreams. 
The question is not one of dreams. It is one of armies. We have to come to 
terms with limits." 
</P>
<P>
Political columnist Aryeh Naor, a frequent critic of government policy, said: 
"It (Baker's speech) was hard to accept on an emotional level. These feelings 
stem from deep within." 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of Baker's approach said the stakes had to be expressed clearly, lest 
Israelis, and Palestinians as well, be left to nurture destructive aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
"We resent it when Palestinians say that Israel is all theirs," Israeli 
philosopher David Hartman said. "Why should we do the same? We have to begin to 
celebrate the presence of the other." 
</P>
<P>
Hartman said the challenge on both sides will be whether the national movements 
depend on an absolute claim to the land. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the only way of ensuring loyalty to claim exclusivity to the land?" he 
asked. "Are we de-legitimized because we can't have it all?" 
</P>
<P>
On Israel's side, much of the difficulty in accepting limits depends on the 
view that the creation of Israel is the fulfillment of an ancient and divine 
pledge -- that Jewish exiles should some day be gathered into their ancestral 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The swift and spectacular victory over Arab armies in 1967 reinforced the 
feeling that Israel's creation and continued existence was special, that only a 
miracle could have wrought such a triumph as occurred in the 1967 war. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the messianic euphoria has been eroded over the years, first by the 
trauma of the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, the Yom Kippur War, then by the uproar 
over the war in Lebanon and now by the Arab uprising, in which Israel's 
well-equipped and motivated army is in the position of fighting off ragtag 
gangs throwing stones. 
</P>
<P>
In Israeli politics, the wear and tear on the image of Israel as destiny's 
darling has left a key split in the nation's politics. The two main political 
parties, Likud and Labor, are divided mainly over the question of whether 
Israel can -- by force of will if not just force -- digest the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, along with the 1.7 million Arabs living there. 
</P>
<P>
Likud, the party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, says yes, that Israel can in 
one form or another digest the land and its people. Labor says no, that keeping 
the land will force Israel into the endless, uncomfortable role of oppressive 
occupier. 
</P>
<P>
With the split unreconciled, each side has shied away from forcing the issue of 
whether to give up the land. A decision either way could bring down the 
laboriously constructed coalition government that embraces both parties. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of government cannot take up existential questions," theorist Ezrahi 
said. "At best, they can move forward ever so slowly." 
</P>
<P>
The element of the Likud Party that takes the hardest line has already taken 
Baker's comments as a weapon to attack the effort to reach an accommodation 
with the Arabs. Ariel Sharon, the fiery trade minister and architect of 
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, is campaigning among Likud politicians to 
reject Shamir's peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Shamir plan calls for elections among Palestinians to choose a peace 
delegation. The delegates would negotiate a five-year period of autonomy under 
Israeli rule, and the question of the land's final status -- the existential 
question -- would be left for later. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon views the election plan as a wedge that will separate the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip from Israel. In a showdown that may shed light on how much life is 
left in messianic politics, Sharon is expected to challenge Shamir's leadership 
next month at a meeting of the party Central Committee.

U.S. A-REACTOR PLANS 'UNREALISTIC,' PANEL IS TOLD

<P>
The Energy Department gave Congress "improper and unrealistic" estimates of the 
cost of building new military reactors in South Carolina and Idaho, federal 
auditors told House panel members Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the General Accounting Office also said the department had 
understated the time it would take to complete the reactors, which the Bush 
Administration says can be in operation within 10 years for $6.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before a special panel of the House Armed Services Committee, J. 
Dexter Peach, the GAO's assistant comptroller general, raised doubts about 
other key aspects of the Administration's plan, which was announced last 
August. The Administration is seeking $300 million in next year's budget for 
design work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought as Replacements 
</P>
<P>
The reactors would produce tritium, a radioactive gas used to make nuclear 
warheads. One is to be built at the department's Savannah River Site, near 
Aiken, S.C., and the other would be at the Idaho National Engineering 
Laboratory, near Idaho Falls. The department wants them in production by 1998 
as replacements for three 35-year-old Savannah River reactors that have been 
shut down for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Peach said recent breakdowns at the existing Savannah River reactors, which are 
the nation's only source of tritium, make the need for new reactors "more 
acute," but he raised doubts about new technology to be used at the new plants. 
</P>
<P>
He also questioned the Energy Department's cost calculations for the 18 
different options it considered. He said the department had taken cost 
estimates for full-sized reactors and "scaled them down" for use in figuring 
the cost of smaller reactors. 
</P>
<P>
"In our judgment, DOE's scaling assumptions were not realistic and resulted in 
improper and unrealistic cost estimates for the various options," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO says it would take at least 12 1/2 years to get a heavy-water reactor 
into production at Savannah River and 16 years to begin tritium output at a 
modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor proposed for the Idaho site. It 
disputed the department's $6.8-billion cost estimate for the reactors but gave 
no estimate of its own.

THE STRIKE AS SEEN BY 6TH-GRADERS

<P>
In the chaos of the Los Angeles school strike, some replacement teachers have 
taken to screening Daffy Duck cartoons and others have handed out dominoes. 
</P>
<P>
But Beverly Williams, a teacher's assistant at the 92nd Street Elementary 
School, is focusing her sixth-grade class on the strike itself. 
</P>
<P>
Says Williams: "The students had so many questions and feelings and they were 
really concerned. So I said, 'Why don't you write them down in a letter?' " 
</P>
<P>
Those missives, addressed to The Times, reveal a wide range of opinions toward 
the job action. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the owner decides to pay the teachers enough money so the strike can 
come to an end," declared Cecy Argueta. 
</P>
<P>
Lakesha Stewart, to the contrary, groused that teachers "are acting like 
immature kids." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Newman said she dislikes the strike because substitute teachers "make 
me sick." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Fajardo, on the other hand, harbors mixed emotions about the regular 
teachers. "I wish they would all come back," she wrote. "But sometimes they get 
on my nerves." 
</P>
<P>
One youngster signed his (or her) one-paragraph letter, "Talking for the 
teachers." 
</P>
<P>
While ungrammatical, it was certainly touching. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so sad because I don't have a teacher," the child wrote. "Without 
teachers their are no education for us the kids. I think they should pay them 
more money to the teachers to educate us. When I grow up I want to be a 
astronaut, but without teachers a can't reach my dreams. My mother wants me to 
be somebody in Life and I will be! They don't pay teachers enough and they give 
us something more important education." 
</P>
<P>
One sure-fire method for charting the strike's ebbs and flows is by dialing the 
prerecorded message on school board President Roberta Weintraub's home phone. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, hours after a bitter break-off in negotiations, Weintraub informed 
her callers that the day would be highly stressful. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, shortly before she left for Sacramento to meet with state 
legislators, Weintraub ebulliently declared, "This is Roberta and I feel 
great." 
</P>
<P>
After a seemingly successful day in Sacramento, her Wednesday message might 
have best been characterized as guardedly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Wednesday morning and I don't know what's going to happen but it looks a 
little better than it did yesterday. If you want to talk to me please leave 
your name." 
</P>
<P>
United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson, for his part, hasn't 
changed his phone message in months. 
</P>
<P>
"This is (district Supt.) Dr. Leonard Britton," the union chief says. "I find 
it hard to make ends meet on my $141,000 a year so I moonlight here at UT-LA 
while Wayne is not here taking his messages." 
</P>
<P>
When Weintraub and four other district officials arrived at Los Angeles Airport 
on Tuesday morning for their flight to the state capital, the board president 
took one look at her ticket and hit the roof. At $378 per person round-trip -- 
the standard business fare -- the party might as well be flying to Honolulu, 
not Sacramento, she reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
With minutes to spare until takeoff, Robert Booker, chief financial officer for 
the district, raced back to the counter with the tickets. Flashing a credit 
card, Booker managed to switch fares to a special government class rate of $76 
round-trip. PAUL FELDMAN

BRADLEY, COELHO TARGETS OF U.S. CRIMINAL PROBE

<TEXT>
<P>
Preliminary criminal investigations of both Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and 
House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced) have been opened by the Justice 
Department in Washington in connection with their financial dealings with 
Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Although details of the investigations are not known, a central question being 
examined is whether Bradley and Coelho, who have acknowledged that they made 
investment deals through Drexel Burnham, illegally received preferential 
treatment. The inquiry is also expected to examine whether investment 
opportunities may have been made available to the two Democratic officeholders 
with the hope or expectation of favored treatment from them in return. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to open a preliminary investigation of Bradley represents a 
significant step beyond the decision last week by the U.S. attorney's office in 
Manhattan to subpoena records of the mayor's transactions with Drexel Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
That subpoena was issued in connection with a "broad-based" inquiry into the 
investment firm's dealings with politicians. Launching a preliminary 
investigation, by contrast, is the first official step in the Justice 
Department's formal procedure for deciding whether the facts warrant no further 
action or instead justify launching a full-scale grand jury investigation 
leading to possible criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the sensitivity of even preliminary investigations of political 
figures, they normally are authorized only after a thorough study and after the 
attorney general gives his approval. The Justice Department treats such 
investigations with utmost secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary investigations of Bradley and Coelho are especially sensitive 
since they involve a Republican Administration examining the conduct of two of 
the nation's more prominent Democratic officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department declined to comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said that "the mayor has no knowledge of any 
such investigation." Bradley has regularly refused to discuss specifics of his 
holdings until the investigations into his conduct are completed. 
</P>
<P>
Coehlo was unavailable for comment, but a spokesman, Fred Hatfield, said that 
the congressman is certain he is not the subject of a preliminary 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome of the preliminary investigations, the decision to launch 
them is another political blow to both men, whose financial dealings have come 
under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The investigations are being conducted in Washington by the Justice 
Department's Public Integrity Section against the backdrop of an unusual 
disagreement between U.S. attorneys' offices in Los Angeles and New York over 
whether facts in the case warrant such serious action, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, U.S. Atty. Robert Bonner reportedly concluded that the 
available facts did not warrant preliminary inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
However, sources said that in New York, Acting U.S. Atty. Benito Romano 
concluded that facts developed in his office's long-running investigation of 
Drexel Burnham warranted inquiries into transactions with the investment firm 
by both Bradley and Coelho. But Romano's office lacked venue to pursue the 
investigations because the transactions involving the two Democrats took place 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
To resolve the issue, sources told The Times, the Public Integrity Section -- a 
Justice Department unit responsible for looking into allegations of corruption 
against judges and other political figures -- studied the two cases and 
concluded that it should take jurisdiction and conduct preliminary 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the outcome of these investigations, both Bradley and Coelho face 
other official inquiries involving their investments and public disclosure 
requirements that could cause political and legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who last month won an unprecedented fifth term as mayor of Los 
Angeles, faces several investigations. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission has reviewed records that indicate that 
the mayor may have received favored treatment on at least one occasion in 1986, 
when he invested in Worlds of Wonder, a Fremont-based toy firm whose stock 
jumped 50% on the first day it was sold to the public in June, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
An inquiry into the allegations against Bradley by City Atty. James K. Hahn 
revolves around tens of thousands of dollars in fees that Bradley collected for 
serving on the boards of Far East National Bank and Valley Federal Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn., both of which had dealings with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, as well as Coelho, also may face questions about financial dealings 
involving Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn., a Beverly Hills firm being 
investigated in connection with Drexel's indicted "junk bond" king, Michael 
Milken, a friend of Coelho's. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the mayor has said that the office of Columbia Vice Chairman 
Abraham Spiegel served as a conduit of information between Bradley and one of 
his stockbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel's son, Columbia Chairman Thomas Spiegel, a close associate of Milken, 
has acknowledged assisting Coelho by recommending -- and then helping finance 
-- a highly unusual purchase of a $100,000 junk bond issued by Drexel Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho has admitted that he bought the junk bond with the help of a $50,000 
loan from Columbia that he failed to disclose as required by law.

A story in Thursday editions of The Times misstated the role that Rep. Tony 
Coelho (D-Merced) played when California's two senators and the Los Angeles 
delegation in the House intervened on behalf of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in 
settlement negotiations with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Acting at 
the request of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, Coelho persuaded Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.) to contact the SEC on Drexel's behalf, but there is no 
evidence that he enlisted any other members of the California delegation to 
participate in the effort.

TALKS RESUME IN TEACHERS' STRIKE; END MAY BE IN SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With signs pointing toward a possible settlement, talks stretched from 
Wednesday afternoon into early today in an effort to bring the eight-day-old 
Los Angeles teachers' strike to an end and restore labor peace in the nation's 
second-largest school district. 
</P>
<P>
In his most optimistic statement yet, teacher union President Wayne Johnson 
said he hoped "we can get movement today and settle this thing. I don't think 
we are that far apart." 
</P>
<P>
Describing herself as "cautiously optimistic," school board President Roberta 
Weintraub said she was "just very hopeful that we will go into this bargaining 
session and emerge with a contract. . . . I hope we have conciliation rather 
than confrontation." Weintraub declined, however, to give details on what her 
side would propose. 
</P>
<P>
According to Johnson, the last sticking point before the strike can be resolved 
is the issue of restoring pay docked during job actions, such as withholding 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
Teams of three officials from each side entered the Westin Bonaventure Hotel 
downtown about 3 p.m. for talks under the supervision of a state mediator. The 
school board and the union's board of directors were put on call to quickly 
review a proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides attributed the newly upbeat mood to their trip to Sacramento on 
Tuesday and assurances from state legislators there that the district was to 
receive at least $40 million in extra state funds this fiscal year. However, 
still up in the air is how much of that money can be designated for salaries. 
</P>
<P>
According to Johnson, legislators "brought a sense of realism" to the 
situation. He particularly praised Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) 
with helping defray tempers. On Monday, the district and union swapped barbs 
about their respective bargaining positions and a quick resumption of 
negotiations appeared unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub said Wednesday that she hoped schools could be back to normal as soon 
as today. However, the union was planning for a possible ratification vote at a 
noon meeting today at the Sports Arena, which would keep teachers out of the 
classrooms until at least Friday even if a settlement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
In the days leading up to Wednesday's bargaining session, there had been some 
misdemeanor arrests and sporadic incidents of unruliness. On Wednesday, one of 
the most serious incidents occurred when a striking teacher at Andrew Carnegie 
Junior High School in Carson was arrested and held on suspicion of assault with 
a deadly weapon when he allegedly threw a rock at a car crossing a picket line 
and hit a 12-year-old student. A spokesman for the county sheriff said teacher 
David Torgersrud, 30, of San Pedro, was being held with bail set at $5,000. The 
girl was treated at a hospital for cuts and then released. 
</P>
<P>
School police said two other teachers were arrested in less serious incidents 
Wednesday, one of them for attempted trespassing at district headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the school district asked a Superior Court judge Wednesday to 
limit pickets at entrances to schools and other district property and to 
prohibit other striking teachers from picketing, marching or standing within 
100 yards of those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kurt Lewin agreed to temporarily bar striking United Teachers-Los Angeles 
members from blocking entrances to school sites, threatening those who cross 
picket lines and disrupting classes. Lewin refused to limit the overall number 
of demonstrators but did order the pickets to remain in pairs 12 feet apart. 
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of this order is that peaceful picketing is appropriate and 
necessary but that acts of vandalism and violence are not appropriate and not 
parts of peaceful picketing," Lewin said. His order will remain in effect until 
a June 12 hearing if the strike continues. 
</P>
<P>
More students and teachers continued to trickle back to the classrooms 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Student attendance rose to 305,029 at morning rolls, 4,085 more than on 
Tuesday, the district said. Wednesday's figure is only slightly more than half 
of total enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The district also reported that 10,390 regular teachers were at work Wednesday, 
390 more than the day before and 3,650 more than on May 15, when the strike 
began. But the union says about 20,000 teachers, librarians, nurses and 
counselors remain out of school. 
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday's session began, Johnson said the union would accept a pay 
offer of a guaranteed 24% raise over three years and would be willing to 
compromise on some other issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subject of Dispute 
</P>
<P>
Whether the district ever made such a pay offer, either formally or informally, 
on Sunday has been the subject of dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Before the latest negotiating session began, district spokeswoman Diana 
Munatones again emphasized that the district's current offer over three years 
is 21.5% to 24%, depending on the state surplus. Although district officials 
claimed they had offered the guaranteed 24% Sunday when talks broke off in 
bitterness, that amount was not slated to be the first offer discussed 
Wednesday, Munatones said, because the union had rejected it Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility of a hard 24%, but that possibility has to come from 
the people sitting in that room," she said. "All I know is that our formal 
position is a soft 24%." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he was willing to compromise on the docked pay. He said he would 
agree to half being paid back automatically and the rest earned back in extra 
duties if the 24% was on the table. Johnson also said there was room for 
compromise on the issues of the membership and power of proposed school 
governing councils, which would help decide scheduling and curricula. 
</P>
<P>
According to the district's chief negotiator, Dick Fisher, the district opposes 
paying teachers the full amount of the docked wages, which are estimated to be 
about $5 million, because it would encourage similar actions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of money but whether the district should pay for a partial 
strike," Fisher said. "They may still do it in the future but the district 
doesn't want to reward it. To let them work it off is a big concession." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson acknowledged that hostilities of the last few days probably have ended 
a few friendships. "I don't think there is any question," he said, that school 
board member Jackie Goldberg, Supt. Leonard Britton and Weintraub "hold an 
intense personal dislike for me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expresses Own Feelings 
</P>
<P>
"I will tell you honestly, I'm not crazy about them and wouldn't want to have 
dinner with them. . . . So much water has gone under the bridge. But I think we 
can work together on a professional level." Johnson conceded that his recent 
words about district officials may have been too personal "and not enough on a 
philosophical level" and said that he still regards many district officials as 
"decent, reasonable" people. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley offered Wednesday to mediate 
the strike should it continue, an offer he made several times earlier during 
the 15 months of maneuvering over the teachers' contract. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first outward signs that a compromise could be near came about 
midnight Tuesday at Gate 2 of the San Francisco Airport. 
</P>
<P>
After missing the last flight from Sacramento to Los Angeles because the talks 
with legislators had gone on longer than expected, district representatives 
took a short flight from Sacramento to San Francisco, where they could make a 
Los Angeles-bound flight. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and his aides were given a ride to the San Francisco Airport by a 
security guard who was on duty at the state Capitol. The two sides met at the 
gate, where Weintraub and Johnson sat back-to-back on plastic airport lounge 
chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Union official Enola Henry motioned district negotiator Fisher over to her 
side. The two talked briefly about one of the issues separating the two sides. 
It seemed the problem was wording of one sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"The area of difference is so narrow," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Henry answered, "I know. Let me sleep on it. I bet I can come up with 
something."

A missile designed to destroy enemy radar without being detected has undergone 
its second successful test, Air Force officials said. The AGM-136A missile, 
code named Tacit Rainbow, flew May 17 at the China Lake Naval Weapons Center 
test base. The missile was launched from a B-52 bomber and homed in on its 
target, even though the radar it tracks was shut off once during the flight, 
Air Force officials said. The missile is built by Los Angeles-based Northrop 
Corp., which also makes the B-2 stealth bomber. The AGM-136A is similar to 
present anti-radar missiles, which follow enemy radar waves to their source and 
destroy the installation. However, the new missile is designed to "loiter," or 
go into a holding pattern, if the radar is turned off, thus countering one 
defense that can be used against such missiles.

AETNA RESUMES SALES OF NEW POLICIES IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, the ninth largest seller of property and casualty 
insurance in California, said Wednesday it is resuming sales to new customers 
of auto, homeowners and commercial liability policies. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement ended a two-week moratorium on such sales while the company 
evaluated how the state Supreme Court decision upholding most of Proposition 
103 would be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman, Jason Wright, said Aetna had concluded from statements 
made May 11 by state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie that the state 
intends to allow the insurance industry a fair rate of return in California for 
each line of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Comfortable New' 
</P>
<P>
"Our halt in new sales was temporary, while we awaited a substantive statement 
on how the state intended to operate," said Wright from Aetna headquarters in 
Hartford, Conn. "We're more comfortable now." 
</P>
<P>
He said the company is particularly pleased that California will allow a profit 
on each line of insurance in deciding whether to exempt each company from the 
20% rate rollbacks from 1987 levels called for in Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Aetna will file for an exemption and for continuation of "pretty much" the 
rates it charges now, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous insurers have expressed satisfaction at Gillespie's decision to allow 
a profit for each line of insurance, while a number of consumer groups have 
criticized the decision on grounds that the industry had traditionally been 
willing to sell some lines at a loss in a move to induce customers to also buy 
more profitable lines. 
</P>
<P>
Aetna last year sold $103 million of private passenger auto insurance in 
California, $64 million of homeowners insurance and $451 million of commercial 
liability insurance. The moratorium on new sales affected only a small fraction 
of that business, since policies already in force continued to be renewed 
during the two-week period. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another leading insurer, USAA, confirmed reports that it has stopped 
paying safe-driver dividends to 170,000 of its California auto insurance 
customers, due to what a company spokesman termed "uncertainties surrounding 
Proposition 103." 
</P>
<P>
Although the initiative requires all companies to begin giving a 20% "good 
driver" discount after Nov. 8, the immediate effect of USAA's decision is to 
raise its safe drivers by about 10% on their premiums during the interim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exempted Californians 
</P>
<P>
The USAA spokesman added that the company had paid a special one-time homeowner 
dividend to its homeowner policyholders earlier in the year, but had exempted 
the 104,000 Californians who would have otherwise received it "due to 
uncertainties surrounding Proposition 103." 
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on what uncertainties he was referring to, although 
Gillespie has each company's rates under review pending her determination 
whether what companies, if any, will be forced to comply with the rate 
rollbacks called for by Proposition 103.

PANEL HEARS PARADE OF OFFSHORE DRILLING FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that federal policies are wasting far more energy than could ever be 
pumped from oil and gas fields off the California coast, a parade of witnesses 
Wednesday urged a task force appointed by President Bush to push for a national 
energy policy that stresses conservation and development of alternative energy 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
The strongly worded pleas, combined with opposition to offshore oil and gas 
drilling by most of the state's ranking constitutional officers, came as the 
President's Outer Continental Shelf Leasing and Development Task Force pressed 
its review of controversial plans to open up millions of acres of offshore 
tracts to oil and gas development. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Bush delayed oil and gas leases in three offshore areas -- 
the Southern and Northern California coastlines and off southern Florida in the 
Gulf of Mexico -- because of widespread environmental concerns. All three lease 
sales were previously scheduled to take place next year. 
</P>

Bush appointed the task force March 21 to review those issues and directed it 
to report back to him next January, in keeping with a promise made in last 
year's presidential campaign. The repeated calls Wednesday from a wide range of 
witnesses for federal action to take a long view at the nation's energy needs 
and energy's links with worrisome global environmental problems were additional 
evidence of growing support for a national energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has ordered a comprehensive review of U.S. 
energy programs and key congressmen have said they are cautiously optimistic 
that the Bush Administration may act. The Administration's decision to return 
to an original automobile fuel economy schedule abandoned by the Reagan White 
House has been seen as a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the availability of relatively cheap oil from overseas has worked 
against a comprehensive energy policy in the past and may do so again. There is 
little prospect in the immediate future that alternative or so-called 
"renewable" energy sources such as solar, wind and ocean energy will make 
significant inroads in meeting the country's energy needs. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), long an opponent of offshore oil development, 
said Wednesday that any decision by the President to proceed with oil and gas 
exploration off California would be politically costly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it costs him quite a lot," Wilson told reporters. "California cares a 
great deal about the coastal environment." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley told the panel, "The Los Angeles and Southern 
California message to President Bush . . . is the California coastline is one 
of our most prized treasures. . . . Our message in brief is: 'Don't muck it 
up.' " 
</P>
<P>
There was little doubt Wednesday that California political leaders saw a direct 
link between offshore oil drilling in California and national energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
"This region does not have the patience to endure offshore oil activity when 
our federal government does not have a comprehensive energy policy and has not 
supported energy conservation to the fullest degree possible," said Christine 
E. Reed, a member of the Santa Monica City Council, which Tuesday night called 
for a comprehensive energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a government policy that wastes more oil than we have in those 
(California) waters," added Robert Sulnick of the American Oceans Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Many witnesses contrasted the former Reagan Administration's push for 
exploiting domestic oil and gas reserves with decisions that they said undercut 
the very energy security they said they backed. 
</P>
<P>
"If President Reagan had not relaxed fuel economy standards to 26 miles per 
gallon from 27.5 miles per gallon he would have saved in the last three years 
as much oil as will be found off Orange County," Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. 
Gentry told the panel. Others said oil off California would meet the nation's 
energy needs for about a month. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, automobiles were supposed to average 27.5 m.p.g. as of 1985 model 
year, but the standard was weakened to 26 m.p.g. and boosted up to 26.5 m.p.g. 
over the four succeeding years. The Bush Administration has returned to the 
27.5 m.p.g. for the 1990 model year that begins this Oct. 1.

UCSD, SCRIPPS CLINIC TEAM UP TO HIRE TOP SCIENTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual move to grab a star scientist, UC San Diego and the Research 
Institute of Scripps Clinic have hired a noted organic chemist to become both a 
UCSD professor and head of Scripps' new chemistry department. 
</P>
<P>
Kyriacos C. Nicolaou, 42, will move to the two institutions in September from 
the University of Pennsylvania. He rejected an offer to join the faculty at 
Yale University to come to San Diego, said Murray Goodman, a UCSD chemistry 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
The jointly funded appointment represents an arrangement that is being tried 
for the first time by UCSD and Scripps. About a dozen Scripps researchers now 
also hold appointments at UCSD, but they receive no salary from the university, 
said Marjorie Javet, assistant vice chancellor for academic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Era of Cooperation" 
</P>
<P>
UCSD Chancellor Richard Atkinson said the joint appointment marks "a new era of 
cooperation" between the university and Scripps. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Edwards, president of the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, said 
he expects Nicolaou to bring "a formidable strength in the development of 
exciting and beneficial areas of scientific inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
Nicolaou is recognized in his field as brilliant at conceiving and carrying out 
new ways of synthesizing complex organic molecules, chemists say. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a phenomenal addition to the strength of organic chemistry in all of 
Southern California," said Francois Diederich, associate professor of organic 
chemistry at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
In a field constantly in search of new ways of cooking up biological molecules, 
Nicolaou is a "master chef," Diederich said. "His work is extremely elegant. It 
is unpredictably beautiful. That is, it's not reproductive. His work is always 
highly original." 
</P>
<P>
Nicolaou's work has produced 11 patents. He has concentrated on the synthesis 
of organic molecules involved in inflammatory processes in the body, and on 
figuring out how those molecules work to produce pain. Eventually, such work 
could lead drug companies to develop drugs that can block pain and inflammation 
better than current drugs do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cell-to-Cell Communication 
</P>
<P>
More recently, he has worked on synthesizing other molecules, including a group 
of molecules that cleave DNA, the chemical blueprint necessary for cell 
replication. When researchers know better how such compounds work, Nicolaou has 
written, they might prove useful as "warheads" against the body's most wildly 
proliferative cells -- cancer. 
</P>
<P>
His recent research also has looked at molecules important in cell-to-cell 
communication and the body's production of antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
The joint appointment was a natural outgrowth of the fact that both 
institutions were interested in Nicolaou, Goodman said. The university's 
Chemistry Department first began recruiting him about 2 1/2 years ago, then 
became aware about a year ago of Scripps' interest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, the situation became one of cooperation rather than rivalry for the 
same person, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come together because it felt natural," he said. "It's not that we did 
this because we couldn't do it the other way. It's that the opportunity 
presented itself seriously when Scripps and UCSD discovered that we were 
interested in the same person." 
</P>
<P>
Nicolaou will bring a research group of more than 20 people to San Diego and 
will have laboratories at both UCSD and Scripps. Initially, the labs will be in 
interim quarters. UCSD eventually will house his lab in a new Sciences 
Building. Construction of the building, next to Urey Hall, is to begin in July, 
1990. Scripps has plans for a Center for Chemistry across Torrey Pines Road 
from its existing facilities. It may be completed as early as August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolaou will spend half his time at each institution, each of which will pay 
about 50% of his salary. At UCSD, his salary will be $57,800, said Paul Croft, 
administrator for the chemistry department. His graduate students and 
post-doctoral students will also divide their time between the two 
institutions, Croft said. 
</P>
<P>
Details about how the two institutions will divide their interests in any 
patent revenues Nicolaou's work might generate are not final, but no 
difficulties are expected.

TRIAL ORDERED OVER THREATS AGAINST ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a bedroom of a house in Camarillo, amid hundreds of videotapes of a 
television comedy called "Family Ties," and thousands of photos of its star, 
Michael J. Fox, she sat at a Sharp typewriter and wrote letters, prosecutors 
say. 
</P>
<P>
In a year's time, prosecutors allege, she mailed nearly 6,000 of them. In June 
of 1988, 355 letters. In July, 816. Last January, 733. All addressed to Michael 
J. Fox. 
</P>
<P>
The letters landed in the mail room at Paramount Studios, at a post office box 
in Studio City, at Fox's public relations firm. In capital letters and rows of 
exclamation marks, they enunciated much the same theme: Michael, I will kill 
you. I will kill your wife if you don't divorce her. I will kill your unborn 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, there were no letters -- just boxes of rabbit droppings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Liked' Fox 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Tina Marie Ledbetter, a 26-year-old shipping clerk who kept 
rabbits in the garage, was ordered to stand trial on five counts of making 
terrorist threats to the actor, someone she allegedly told an investigator she 
"liked," and "wanted to get his attention." 
</P>
<P>
In court, at last, she had it. Tina Ledbetter, who had apparently never been 
any closer to Fox than seated invisibly in a studio audience during a taping of 
"Family Ties," was less than a dozen feet from him. 
</P>
<P>
He was on the witness stand, and she -- a pale woman in a blue jail-issue 
jacket and green cotton dress -- sat at a table, taking notes and only rarely 
glancing at him. 
</P>
<P>
No, said Fox, in a half-hour of testimony, he had never seen her before. But 
yes, he said, he "absolutely" took the threats seriously, after hearing about 
them from his secretary and seeing some letters for himself. "I believe someone 
intended to hurt my wife and myself and our child." 
</P>
<P>
Fox co-wrote a whimsical piece in the current issue of "Esquire" about his 
cloak-and-dagger efforts to evade the tabloid press at his wedding last year, 
but it was clear Wednesday that there were grimmer underlying concerns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quite Distraught' 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, his then-fiancee, co-star Tracy Pollan, phoned him in Thailand 
"in the middle of the night . . . crying" and "quite distraught" about the 
letters, Fox testified. 
</P>
<P>
"Primarily I was concerned for Tracy's safety, but also I was concerned for 
myself as well." The threats "changed my life style extensively." He hired a 
security agency, got extra security on the set. Pollan traveled under a false 
name, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Ledbetter was not staring at the 27-year-old Emmy-winning actor, almost 
everyone else on the crowded courtroom benches was -- along with others who had 
to be content to peek in the courtroom windows. 
</P>
<P>
Fox sighed as he flipped through five loose-leaf notebooks of letters, a 
fraction of the total, each containing photocopies of the same missive, often 
dozens a day. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Gruber noted that they charted a yearlong crescendo of 
venom, from telling Fox to return to his old girlfriend to letters outraged at 
his marriage and then furious that Pollan was pregnant. They "became a lot more 
specific . . . a lot more angry and more threatening," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Divorce Tracy' 
</P>
<P>
"You are a total (expletive) for marrying Tracy!" one letter went. Then, 
"Divorce Tracy or you are dead! I am coming after you with a gun and I am going 
to kill you if you don't divorce Tracy immediately!" And after she was 
pregnant, "I'm going to kill you and that (expletives) bitch and that 
(expletives) baby!" 
</P>
<P>
"It got very frightening," Fox acknowledged. Afterward, Fox left as he had 
come: through the judges' private corridor, in the company of two bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators had traced the parcels of rabbit feces, and district attorney's 
investigator Gary Schram arrested Ledbetter in February, at her office in 
Westlake Village. She "did admit she wrote the letters to Mr. Fox," Schram 
testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Inside her house were thousands more letters, Schram said. Postage for what she 
had already sent cost at least $1,500. "She indicated she wanted to get (Fox's) 
attention as her reason for sending the letters." 
</P>
<P>
She said "that she hated (Pollan). She said she'd been becoming more angry week 
by week, month by month . . .," Schram testified. "She did think about getting 
a gun and shooting Tracy but never actually thought out how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Rand Schrader ordered her held for trial without bail. Gruber 
agreed that Ledbetter's entering a psychiatric facility as a condition of bail 
is "certainly a viable alternative." Ledbetter, who has never been arrested 
before, is in the psychiatric unit at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Mitchell Young called it a "difficult" case, one of the first 
under a new law primarily drawn to stop gang intimidation of witnesses. The law 
allows prosecution of anyone who makes a verbal threat of death or great bodily 
injury, regardless of any intent to carry it out. Before, the law required 
prosecutors to prove intent. No weapon was found.

PROJECT RESCUE; 
</P>
<P>
PROTESTERS WANT POLICE TO STOP USING NUNCHAKUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Complaining of broken bones, dislocated shoulders, torn tendons and nerve 
damage to their wrists, more than a dozen anti-abortion protesters Wednesday 
called on a police advisory board to recommend that San Diego officers no 
longer use nunchakus and other pain compliance techniques on peaceful 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, who have been arrested at recent weekend rallies, also 
criticized many police officers for seeming to enjoy hurting the members of 
Project Rescue who refused to obey a court order and stop blocking the front of 
abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rousen said many of the officers were "sneering, mocking and full of 
laughter" as they injured the protesters to force them to abandon their 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Bell of Escondido added: "I feel like a lot of the police officers had a 
personal vendetta. I saw one man thrown into a police car, and I saw one 
officer smile and say, 'Go ahead and hurt him. He just loves it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Citizens' Advisory Board on Police/Community Relations took no immediate 
action on the recommendations from the group. Andrea Skorepa, acting chairwoman 
of the panel, said it was the largest public gathering to address the board in 
its four-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The board has only advisory authority, but according to city officials more 
than 90% of its recommendations have been adopted by police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Committee to Study 
</P>
<P>
But the panel did form an ad hoc committee to study the issue of pain 
compliance by police officers, and the full board is expected to vote on the 
matter when it meets again next month. 
</P>
<P>
George Penn, an assistant to the city manager, read a letter from City Manager 
John Lockwood in which he defended the use of pain compliance against civil 
demonstrators who refuse to obey lawful orders. 
</P>
<P>
"Pain compliance techniques are neither bizarre nor cruel and rarely result in 
injury," the letter said. "The amount of pressure applied is directly 
proportionate to the amount of resistance offered." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief Manuel C. Guaderrama, a member of the advisory board, also 
defended the use of nunchakus, a relatively new police tool that is applied to 
a person's wrist or arm and then twisted to inflict pain. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a responsibility as a Police Department to make sure that laws are not 
violated," he said. "And we are only going to use the amount of force we 
believe is absolutely necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Penn said several of the protesters have filed formal complaints alleging 
excessive force with the department's Internal Affairs unit. He also said that 
several protesters have filed monetary claims against the city. 
</P>
<P>
But exactly how many protesters were injured, and how serious those injuries 
actually were, remained unclear. None of the protesters speaking at the 
Wednesday meeting were wearing arm bandages, casts or slings. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Phelps, a spokesman for the group, said 30 to 40 people were severely 
injured and required medical attention, including one Fallbrook doctor who 
suffered a broken bone in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been unable to practice surgery for three weeks or so," Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Youngkin, another Project Rescue activist, said she saw an officer twist 
a woman's arm behind her back, causing a dislocated shoulder and severe damage 
to the nerves and tendons on the woman's arm. 
</P>
<P>
"Now she is permanently damaged," Youngkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bell of Escondido said he witnessed another woman's arm being broken. 
"She tried to walk, and they were dragging her," he said. "Another police 
officer came up and said, 'Let up, you're going to break her arm.' But it was 
too late. Her arm was already broken." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used When Necessary 
</P>
<P>
Police said the officers have used the pain compliance method only after 
protesters repeatedly refused to obey verbal orders to move away from clinic 
doors and entryways. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those speaking to the advisory panel suggested that police instead use 
stretchers and wheelchairs to remove protesters. They also said officers should 
pick up protesters or drag them away. 
</P>
<P>
Police said such strenuous activity could cause injuries to the officers, such 
as straining their backs. But the protesters discounted that argument. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're hurting their backs, then they're not in shape to be police 
officers," said Joanne Marsh of Santee. 
</P>
<P>
"A stretcher saves the policeman's back," added Sylvia Sullivan of Lemon Grove. 
"And his public image." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the speakers were critical of the officers, a few in the 
audience stood to offer support for the Police Department's decision to use 
pain compliance. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Dempsey, an administrator of O &amp; B Medical Group Inc., said that, 
although the protesters pretend to be nonviolent, they actually pose a serious 
threat to medical patients who are trying to enter the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"What about the patients who want to get in the buildings for medical 
purposes?" she said. "We are the victims, and police should use whatever is 
tried and true to accomplish what they need to have to remove a crowd."

FLAMES SPELL AN END TO LAST WORD IN ART DECO 
</P>

<P>
The Pan Pacific Auditorium had flirted with death for years -- death from fire, 
death from neglect, death from bureaucratic indifference. 
</P>
<P>
It was not always so. 
</P>
<P>
From the day it opened on May 18, 1935, and for more than 35 years thereafter, 
the Pan was one of the biggest gathering places in Los Angeles, and the last 
word in Art Deco. Its western facade, 228 feet long with four upswept 
fin-shaped towers, was a magnificent piece of Streamline Moderne that 
epitomized a 1930s America enamored of flight, speed and dynamism. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Music Center, the Sports Arena and the Convention Center ever 
existed, it was the Pan that embraced in its cavernous hall the home and auto 
shows, the ice hockey games, the Ice Capades and political rallies. The 28-acre 
park included a theater, a bowling alley and an ice rink, the latter of which 
prompted a neighbor to sue for damages from the constant rumbling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Stokowski to Elvis 
</P>
<P>
In 1936, Leopold Stokowski conducted in its all-wood auditorium. Twenty-one 
years later, Elvis Presley played the Pan just before he entered the Army, and 
police reportedly warned him to keep his act clean. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, a dozen years after it was built at a cost of $125,000 to host a 
Depression-era national housing show, the Pan's stockholders -- among them Gen. 
James Doolittle, orchestra leader Kay Kyser and actors Walter Pidgeon, Dick 
Powell and Joan Blondell -- sold it for $2.25 million to auto magnate E. L. 
Cord, whose magnificent cars matched the Pan's sleek facade for aerodynamic 
chic. 
</P>
<P>
Ten thousand people showed up in 1945 for the broadcast of the radio program 
"Queen for a Day"; only 6,000 could be seated. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke 
to more than 20,000 people at the Pan, a month before the 1952 election that 
made him President. 
</P>
<P>
For Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who saw the fire from his home four blocks 
away, the blaze swept up pleasant memories. "I saw my first basketball game 
here, the Harlem Globetrotters, my first indoor tennis match, my first ice 
skating contest. 
</P>
<P>
"There are probably several hundred thousand people in Los Angeles County who 
grew up with this as the main indoor arena." 
</P>
<P>
By 1972, a year after the Los Angeles Convention Center opened, the Pan was 
closed, left behind as an outmoded shell. Behind the glorious facade was a 
less-distinctive and less-than-salable 100,000 square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Historic Register 
</P>
<P>
By 1978, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which did 
not seem to impress the vandals and drifters who hacked at it, painted it, set 
it on fire once or twice. Around Los Angeles, around the country, the Pan was 
more talked about than tended. Architectural historians lauded it, and managed 
to hold off the wrecking ball, but in the end, the Pan was a place many people 
talked about but few really did anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
Endless proposals came and went. The Pan seemed perpetually on the brink of 
being torn down, or perhaps just falling apart on its own. In 1981, its 
operating owner, Los Angeles County, solicited proposals for the space. The one 
they embraced would have made it a cultural and commercial center with 
theaters, a hotel, boutiques, and restaurants -- including a kosher kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
As late as last November, the Board of Supervisors was still trying to revive 
it, voting this time to negotiate with a developer to put in an ice rink, and 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Winter, co-author with David Gebhard of "Architecture in Los Angeles," 
which praised it as "probably the city's most photographed and painted 
monument," was in his office at Occidental College in Eagle Rock when he saw 
the faraway smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"What a disaster," he mourned when he learned the source. The Pan, he said, was 
"incomparable. . . . Nobody took it seriously because it was just a plaster 
facade, but it spoke of the '30s like nothing else I know."

PHOENIX INSTALLS DEVICE TO TRAP POISON GASES; LACKS REGULATORS' OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Without obtaining permission from local air-pollution officials, Phoenix 
Research Corp. on Wednesday began installing a pollution-control device that 
company officials claim will prevent the deadly gases they manufacture from 
leaking from their La Mesa plant. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix President Randall Kelley said installation of a $250,000, 40-foot high 
"scrubber" -- essentially a high-tech smokestack designed to catch arsine and 
phosphine gases before they reach the atmosphere -- began Wednesday and is 
expected to be completed by May 31, the date the company had promised La Mesa 
city officials it would have a back-up safety system in place. 
</P>
<P>
But use of the scrubber has yet to be approved by the Air Pollution Control 
District, and the company's decision to install the device once again puts 
Phoenix at odds with the agency in charge of regulating local air quality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Violation of District's Rules' 
</P>
<P>
"Installation of any air-pollution control equipment requires an 
authority-to-construct permit from the air-pollution control district," said 
APCD spokeswoman Lynn Eldred. "At this time, Phoenix Research does not have 
such a permit. Installation of the scrubber . . . would be a violation of the 
district's rules and regulations." 
</P>
<P>
A Phoenix spokesman, however, said the company tried to meet with APCD 
officials recently but was told they were too busy to talk about the scrubber. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one meeting with them, and there was the press of other matters and 
they couldn't deal with us at the present time," said Jim Secor, director of 
communications for Union Carbide's Linde Division, which owns Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
One environmentalist said Wednesday that installation of the scrubber is 
"little comfort" because the expensive device won't stop the escape of arsine 
or phosphine during an earthquake or an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"Phoenix Research has tried to make it seem like the scrubber is the only 
safety feature that was needed, but it is far and away not the only safety 
feature that is needed," said Diane Takvorian, executive director of the 
nonprofit Environmental Health Coalition. "The relocation of the facility is 
what's needed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Announcement After Protests 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix's announcement Wednesday came barely seven months before the 
beleaguered company has promised to leave its plant at 8075 Alvarado Road for a 
new home near Kingman, Ariz. The move was announced earlier this year after a 
new round of community protests erupted over the presence of the manufacturer 
of the deadly gas. 
</P>
<P>
The company makes arsine and phosphine, both acutely toxic and used in the 
semiconductor industry to alter the electrical characteristics of such 
materials as silicon. County records show that, at any given time, the La Mesa 
facility can have as much as 2,250 pounds of pure arsine on hand in several 
large cylinders. 
</P>
<P>
Federal limits for exposure to the gases are extremely low -- 0.3 parts per 
million (p.p.m.) for phosphine and 0.05 p.p.m. for arsine. A whiff of 500 
p.p.m. of arsine causes instant death by freezing the hemoglobin in the red 
blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uncovered by Times Story 
</P>
<P>
Despite the toxicity of the gases, Phoenix operated in relative obscurity until 
a Times article about the company in 1985 stirred the ire of La Mesa residents 
and public officials, who demanded that Phoenix leave its location near the 
Grossmont Shopping Center, other businesses and several residential 
subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the APCD ordered the Phoenix plant shut because it posed a potential 
health hazard, lacking adequate pollution-control devices in the event of a 
leak. Although the company successfully stalled the shutdown in court, it 
developed the scrubber that workers began installing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley said tests of the scrubber, which cost at least $250,000 to develop and 
will be moved to the new Phoenix facility in Arizona, showed the device is 
99.99% effective in removing up to 140 pounds of arsine or phosphine, should 
that amount be accidentally released through the company's exhaust system. That 
amount is contained in a cylinder and is the maximum amount handled by Phoenix 
employees at any one time, Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
The APCD, however, has yet to determine how effective the scrubber will be, 
said spokeswoman Lynn Eldred. Although personnel from the pollution control 
agency were invited to witness the two field tests, they are still sifting 
through scientific data, she said. 
</P>
<P>
And Takvorian, whose organization has helped organize community pressure on 
Phoenix, said Wednesday that the scrubber won't be any good in a number of 
disaster scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
"If a cylinder falls off a truck, if there is an explosion in the building that 
is going to blow out a wall, it's not going to take care of arsine gas," 
Takvorian said. "If there is an earthquake, which creates a hole in the 
building, the scrubber is not going to take care of that."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 INDICTED ON BRIBERY COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Orange County men were indicted Wednesday on federal charges of taking more 
than $7,600 in bribes from the operator of a security business while they were 
deputy marshals in the federal courthouse in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Gieniec, 43, of Santa Ana, who transferred out of the U.S. Marshals 
Service in 1986, and Gordon Tornberg, 59, of Tustin, who continues to work for 
that office, were accused of accepting gratuities in 1984 from Joseph 
Rydzewski, who owned a Santa Ana company that supplied security guard services 
to the marshals. 
</P>
<P>
Rydzewski, 33, of Santa Ana, was charged with paying illegal gratuities to 
Gieniec in 1984, and to Eugene Howell, who was a deputy marshal in 1986. Howell 
was not indicted. 
</P>
<P>
The federal grand jury indictment does not detail what the defendants did in 
exchange for the bribes, except to say that the payments, most of them by 
check, were made "because of official acts performed or to be performed." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment said Tornberg supervised seizures of property sought by the U.S. 
attorney's office. Gieniec often used personnel from Rydzewski's company, Lyons 
International Security, in those seizures and Tornberg reviewed and approved 
Lyons' billings, the indictment said.

INS RAIDS 2 HOTELS, ARRESTS 32 WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days before the start of the busy Memorial Day weekend, U.S. immigration 
agents arrested 32 undocumented workers Wednesday in raids at two large Mission 
Bay hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the apprehensions at the jointly owned Bahia and Catamaran 
Resort hotels were routine, except that the presence of 80 agents was required 
to seal off escape routes on the hotels' sprawling grounds. The operation began 
with a 9 a.m. muster at an armory in National City, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The simultaneous raids at the two hotels, which began at about 11 a.m., went 
off largely without incident, according to federal authorities, although one 
unidentified Bahia employee, a U. S. citizen, was arrested for assaulting an 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
James Turnage, district director for the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, said an effort was made to minimize interference with hotel 
operations. The need for a large-scale raid, Turnage said, was precipitated by 
the hotel's management's "flagrant disregard" for recently enacted laws 
outlawing the hiring of undocumented labor. Agents entered the premises with a 
federal court warrant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protocol Chief Involved 
</P>
<P>
Anne L. Evans, proprietor of the two family-owned hotels, accused the INS of 
"heavy-handed" and disruptive tactics that included the kicking in of two doors 
at the Bahia. She said hotel officials had cooperated with the INS. 
</P>
<P>
"The policy of the hotels is to verify to the best of our ability that persons 
working for us are eligible to do so," said Evans, who is one of two chiefs of 
protocol for the city of San Diego and who was at the Bahia when the arresting 
officers arrived. "We have no wish to circumvent the law." 
</P>
<P>
An INS official said at least one door at the Bahia had to be opened forcibly 
when hotel officials refused to provide a pass key. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. authorities are likely to propose a hefty fine on management of the two 
hotels, although the amount to be assessed has yet to be determined, said 
Turnage, the top INS official in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping reforms of U. S. immigration laws enacted in 1986 created a range 
of civil and criminal fines and potential jail terms for employers who 
knowingly hire undocumented workers. San Diego, home to more than 1,000 
employees of the INS and the U. S. Border Patrol, a uniformed arm of the INS, 
has led the nation in the number of such fines. 
</P>
<P>
On March 16, officials said, agents detained 14 undocumented workers at the 
Bahia. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent inspections indicated numerous violations, said Rudy Murillo, an INS 
spokesman in San Diego. Last month, Murillo said, the agency filed a subpoena 
seeking the hotels' payroll records. The documents have yet to be turned over, 
said Murillo, who noted that authorities plan to go to U. S. District Court to 
enforce the subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low-Paying Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Many hotels in California and elsewhere have traditionally relied on immigrant 
labor to fill low-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Some other area hotels have been served with fine notices of assorted alleged 
violations of the federal statutes outlawing the hiring of undocumented 
workers. In one of the largest cases, said Murillo, the INS spokesman, the 
Executive Hotel in downtown San Diego was assessed a penalty of $9,200 last 
September; it eventually settled by paying $5,650, Murillo said. 
</P>
<P>
Turnage said the proposed fine against the ownership of the Bahia and Catamaran 
will probably top the highest area total yet, a $27,000 penalty imposed on Big 
Bear Markets. The supermarket chain contested the penalty, and an 
administrative law judge later reduced it to $13,500, said Gene Smithburg, a 
spokesman for the Border Patrol, which conducted the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The two hotels employ about 600 workers, Evans said. The Bahia has 423 rooms, 
and the Catamaran Resort Hotel has 314 rooms, hotel officials said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JACKSON FILES CLAIM IN VIDEOTAPED ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Activist Don Jackson filed a claim this week against the city of Long Beach, 
asking for damages arising from a nationally publicized incident in which an 
officer allegedly pushed Jackson through a plate-glass window. 
</P>
<P>
The claim, received Wednesday by the city clerk, asks for unspecified damages 
after Jackson and a colleague, Jeffrey C. Hill, were "illegally detained, 
arrested, cited and criminally charged on fictional accounts in police reports 
and criminally prosecuted in bad faith." 
</P>
<P>
The claim stems from the Jan. 14 incident in which Jackson, a former Hawthorne 
police sergeant, and Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, were 
stopped by two officers as they drove along Pacific Coast Highway. They had 
come to Long Beach with an NBC television crew to conduct a "sting" amid 
reports that the city's police were racist and brutal. 
</P>
<P>
The crew videotaped Officer Mark Dickey as he appeared to smash Jackson's head 
through a storefront window and throw him onto the hood of patrol car. Dickey 
and fellow officer Mark Ramsey now face misdemeanor charges of filing a false 
report. Dickey alone is charged with assault. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey and Ramsey are among those named in the claim, which alleges that 
Jackson and Hill were deprived of their civil rights and subjected to false 
arrest, racism and brutality.

HOOVER DEFENSE SEEKS MISTRIAL OVER DOCUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arguing that prosecutors deliberately withheld "critical" statements by J. 
David (Jerry) Dominelli that could clear their client, lawyers for Nancy Hoover 
Hunter on Wednesday asked a federal judge to dismiss the 234-count indictment 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
In a written motion filed with the court, Hoover's attorneys cited transcripts 
of grand jury testimony and other documents in which Dominelli claimed that 
Hunter, his former live-in companion, was unaware of the illegal activity that 
led to the collapse of J. David &amp; Co., the La Jolla investment they 
operated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Wants Dismissal 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecutor's suppression of Dominelli's statements exonerating Hunter from 
involvement in major aspects of his fraud mandates the dismissal of the 
indictment," the lawyers said in the motion filed with U. S. District Judge 
Earl B. Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers, Richard Marmaro and Robert S. Brewer, based their motion on a 
federal court rule known as the Brady Doctrine, which requires prosecutors to 
turn over to defense attorneys all information favorable to the defendant, 
generally as soon as the material is discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Marmaro and Brewer have been engaged in an unusually bitter dispute with 
Assistant U. S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo over the production of documents since before 
the trial began nearly two months ago. The defense has made repeated motions 
for a mistrial, all of which have been turned down by Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
"On May 18, 1989, the prosecutor, in one fell swoop, topped all of her previous 
misconduct by disclosing heretofore suppressed Brady material which had been in 
her possession for years," the lawyers said in their motion Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is critical exculpatory material as well as evidence which could have 
been used by the defense to effectively cross-examine several of the 
government's witnesses who have already testified," the motion says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused of Suppression 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said there is "no plausible explanation or justification" for the 
prosecution's withholding of Dominelli's statements, and accused Hugo of 
deliberately suppressing the information. 
</P>
<P>
"She has stopped playing by the rules, and she has adopted a 'win at all costs' 
strategy, trampling along the way on court orders, due process rights and 
fundamental fairness," the motion says. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam is expected to hold a hearing on the motion today or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a gag order imposed by Gilliam last week, Hugo was not permitted to 
respond to reporters' questions about the new defense allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is charged with 234 counts of fraud, conspiracy, income-tax evasion and 
making false statements to a federal agent. The charges stem from her 
involvement as a top executive in J. David &amp; Co., which collapsed in 1984 
when nervous investors forced it into bankruptcy court. The ensuing 
investigations revealed a huge Ponzi scheme, in which money from new clients 
was used to pay off old investors and little or no trading was done. 
</P>
<P>
Dominelli pleaded guilty to federal charges and is serving a 20-year prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's lawyers are attempting to convince the jury that Dominelli alone was 
responsible for the $180-million fraud, and that Hunter was blinded by her love 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the mistrial motion are six documents dated from Feb. 15, 1984, to 
Jan. 28, 1988. The defense obtained the documents last week from the 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dominelli Interview 
</P>
<P>
In one of the documents, an FBI memorandum prepared April 16, 1985, an unnamed 
agent summarized an interview he had with Dominelli. 
</P>
<P>
"Dominelli advised that no one else involved in J. David &amp; Co. or J. David 
Banking Co. Ltd. knew of the fact that the business was a sham, including . . . 
Nancy Hoover or any of the salesmen. . . . He said no one ever knew of the 
financial trouble the company was in until the end because he discussed it with 
no one, including (Mark) Yarry, Hoover or anyone else," the memorandum says. 
Yarry was another top J. David executive. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the documents is a note written by Dominelli on Feb. 15, 1984, about 
the time the firm was collapsing. Referring to Yarry and Hunter, Dominelli 
said: "At no time were they aware of any actions I may have taken with regard 
to client funds entrusted to me or any of my companies. . . . I assume full 
responsibility for any and all discrepancies that may arise . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Also at issue is a transcript of Dominelli's testimony before a grand jury on 
May 20, 1986. During that session, under questioning by Hugo, Dominelli said 
that he, not Hunter, opened all the mail containing confirmation information 
about trades he made through brokerage houses. Hunter, he said, opened all 
other mail. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo had claimed in her opening statement to the jury that Hunter opened all 
the firm's mail. 
</P>
<P>
"This testimony is a direct rebuttal of the government's theory," Hunter's 
lawyers said in their motion. 
</P>
<P>
They also alleged that Hugo was guilty of "blatant lies" when she said in court 
more than a month ago that all so-called "Brady material" had been turned over 
to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
The trial continues today.

CITY URGED TO CHANGE PLANNING APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley on Wednesday borrowed an idea from an earlier era when city 
dwellers walked downstairs to the grocery store in their apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
Espousing a concept finding increasing favor with urban planners, the mayor 
proposed changing city law to allow development of so-called "mixed-use" 
projects to provide housing, commercial and parking facilities under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than having to drive several miles to the store, residents could walk to 
shopping or work in neighborhoods where apartments and shops are side by side 
or in the same building. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe (that) if we can encourage developers to provide housing, commercial 
use and parking facilities under one roof, we will improve the quality of our 
air and further reduce traffic congestion on our city streets," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zoning Laws 
</P>
<P>
Zoning and planning laws now discourage such mixed-use buildings and 
neighborhoods and promote the development of areas where residential and 
commercial buildings are separated. Grocery stores are banned, for example, in 
the typical Los Angeles residential subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
Mixed-use neighborhoods, city officials said, could help control the growth of 
traffic and air pollution while providing affordable housing close to 
commercial centers where most people work. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is one of many developed at the mayor's direction in recent weeks that 
have been held up while Bradley waited for an end to a storm over his personal 
finances. Now, in a change of strategy, the mayor is taking his proposals 
public in an attempt to relieve concern that his office is paralyzed by the 
continuing investigations into his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reversal in Policy 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would be a reversal in policy for Los Angeles, where the motor 
vehicle shaped sprawling development of housing subdivisions and shopping 
centers. In the Los Angeles pattern, a car is needed for a trip to the market 
or for a commute to work. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was joined in making the announcement by City Council members Michael 
Woo, Marvin Braude and Hal Bernson. Council approval will be needed for some of 
the changes. 
</P>
<P>
The council members pledged to work with the mayor and various city departments 
in eliminating existing restrictions to mixed-use developments and creating new 
rules and procedures that will smooth the way for their approval.

MOTHER-IN-LAW SAYS WIFE-BEATER SHOULD GET MEDAL, NOT JAIL

<P>
A New Zealand man convicted of beating his wife found an unusual supporter at 
an Auckland court -- his mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he deserves a sentence. He deserves a medal," she told Otahuhu 
District Judge David Harvey. "He has literally been through hell." 
</P>
<P>
The woman said her daughter had driven the 36-year-old man, whose name was 
withheld, to extremes and that if there was any trouble, "she would've asked 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, who conceded that the defendant was "the recipient of a considerable 
amount of verbal and psychological abuse," sentenced him to supervision for one 
year and ordered that he have anger and stress management counseling.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE;

<P>
1990 BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House passed, 241 to 185, the conference report on House Resolution 106 
giving Congress spending, revenue and deficit targets for the fiscal year 
beginning Oct. 1. The Senate followedsuit and HR 106 is now in effect. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal plan was developed by the Republican White House and Democratic 
Congress. It formalizes President Bush's pledge of no new taxes but projects 
$5.3 billion in largely unspecified new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The plan assumes spending of $1.17 trillion, revenue of $1.07 trillion and a 
deficit within the Gramm-Rudman law's $100-million target. All sides conceded 
it avoids tough fiscal decisions and that its goal of a $100-million deficit is 
wishful thinking. Members looking for a bright spot said the agreement shows 
the President and Congress can work harmoniously toward fiscal goals. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the fiscal 1990 budget.

FLORES OFFERS INTERIM LAW TO PROTECT HOMES IN SAN PEDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Going beyond the scope of what her citizens advisory committee recommended, Los 
Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores Wednesday proposed a measure that could 
severely restrict developers from razing houses to make way for apartments in 
San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' proposed interim control ordinance -- a temporary law that must be 
adopted by both the Los Angeles Planning Commission and City Council after a 
public hearing -- would prohibit developers from replacing single-family homes 
with apartments on blocks where single-family homes compose at least half the 
existing housing stock on both sides of the street. 
</P>
<P>
It is unknown how many blocks this would affect. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is intended to preserve neighborhoods that are single-family in 
character, and allow apartment development where the single-family flavor is 
"already gone," said Flores aide Mario Juravich. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal comes at a time when apartment development is the major issue in 
San Pedro. Last week, after several sessions of heated debate, a 25-member 
advisory committee studying the issue proposed its own restrictions, which were 
primarily aimed at discouraging developers from stringing together lots to 
build large apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protection for Neighborhoods 
</P>
<P>
But Flores, who included the committee's recommendations in her proposal, said 
she felt the committee did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It really needed to go a little further so that neighborhoods that are now 
primarily single-family would be protected," Flores said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' proposal, which would take effect July 1, was lauded by one of San 
Pedro's most vocal slow-growth advocates, Shanaz Ardehali-Kordich, who as a 
member of the citizens advisory committee had severely criticized that panel's 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really impressed that she goes farther than the committee did," said 
Ardehali-Kordich, although she added that she would like to see duplexes get 
the same protection as single-family homes. "I think she must have taken to 
heart the fact that people really don't want the town to be overdeveloped." 
</P>
<P>
William Lusby, vice chairman of the San Pedro Community Plan Advisory Committee 
and the author of its recommendations, said it is too soon to tell whether 
Flores' proposal would have any real effect on development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spoken Against Moratorium 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have very many blocks with 50% multiple dwellings on them, it 
could be almost like a moratorium on building," said Lusby, who has spoken out 
against a moratorium. "If we have quite a few blocks that have 50% or more 
multiple dwellings on them . . . well, that means you can go ahead and develop 
those blocks, which makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
The committee's recommendations did not address the razing of single-family 
houses on lots smaller than 6,000 square feet. Most lots in San Pedro fall into 
this category. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' plan would apply to such lots. 
</P>
<P>
For streets that are predominantly single-family, the councilwoman's plan is 
two-fold: It would temporarily ban replacing houses with apartments. But it 
would permit the demolition of residential structures as long as they are 
replaced with no more than the number of units torn down. If the number of 
units lost is more than the zoning allows on a lot, the developer would have to 
follow the zoning. 
</P>
<P>
For streets where apartment buildings make up the majority of the housing 
stock, Flores' recommendations are the same, for the most part, as existing 
zoning. Her plan would allow a maximum of three apartment units on lots that 
are smaller than 6,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Same as Committee's 
</P>
<P>
"I think I improved on what they did," Flores said. "I don't see this as going 
against what the committee did. I see this as enhancing it." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, on lots 6,000 square feet or larger, Flores' recommendations are the 
same as those of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's recommendations, as drafted by Lusby, an architect, targeted 
lots zoned for multiple-family developments, particularly those designated 
RD1.5, which permits an apartment unit for every 1,500 square feet. The 
recommendations, which are also in Flores' proposed ordinance, would provide 
that: 
</P>
<P>
* On lots 6,000 square feet or larger, apartment developers may build only one 
unit for every 2,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
* No single building may contain more than four apartment units, although more 
than one building may be permitted on a lot if the lot is large enough. 
</P>
<P>
* When two or more lots zoned differently are tied together into one lot, the 
more restrictive zoning shall apply. 
</P>
<P>
* Alleys may not be included in the size of a lot.

AVALON OFFICIALS UPSET BY SEWAGE DISCHARGE FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials in Avalon are upset over what they called a "grossly unfair" fine of 
$35,000 levied against the city for sewage discharge violations by the Los 
Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, even though the fine is less than 
the board initially recommended. 
</P>
<P>
In a March evidentiary hearing, the board had recommended a fine of $100,000 
but reduced that on appeal Monday, after considering the city's ability to pay 
and Avalon officials' stated intent to keep the Avalon waste treatment plant in 
compliance, said David Gildersleeve, the board's supervising engineer. 
</P>
<P>
The fine was levied despite explanations by city officials in March and on 
Monday that mechanical failures and employee turnover contributed to violations 
of the city's sewage discharge permit at the plant in November and December of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Monday session, city officials had offered a compromise settlement 
of $20,000 to the board, including $10,000 in penalties and $10,000 in staff 
costs, City Manager Chuck Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the facts indicated a much lower fine or no fine at all would have 
been reasonable," Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
The board's staff had recommended that it accept the $20,000 offer, 
Gildersleeve said, but the board felt the city had been noncompliant about half 
the time during the two-month period in 1988 and wanted to ensure the city 
adequately monitors its plant. 
</P>
<P>
The $35,000 fine is at the higher end of the $2,000-to-$40,000 range for fines 
levied by the board for first offenses by other cities and other public 
agencies with waste treatment violations, Gildersleeve said. The board began 
levying such fines in 1985, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon officials said the $35,000 fine is too high for their small city. 
</P>
<P>
Prince said the board did not adequately take into account either the small 
size of the Santa Catalina Island city, which has a population of about 2,200, 
or the city's ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Gildersleeve said the city has 30 days to appeal the regional board's decision 
before the state Water Resources Control Board in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said a decision on whether to appeal would have to weigh the 
cost of it against any benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith said the city is "not going to spend $50,000 (in 
legal fees) to get $35,000 back." 
</P>
<P>
Smith called the fine "an excuse for a big entity to jump on a little entity. I 
thought that they didn't listen to the facts and rationale and reasons behind 
the (excessive) discharge. I think the fine was excessive and the reason why 
the fine was even levied was unreasonable and unfair." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Avalon have maintained that the waste treatment plant has been in 
compliance except for two occasions when machinery broke down, and for several 
weeks in December, 1988, when a Gardena waste treatment management firm -- 
Operations Consultants Inc. -- permanently took over operation of the plant 
from the city, resulting in a period of high employee turnover. 
</P>
<P>
The plant underwent a three-year expansion, completed in October, 1988, which 
increased its capacity from 500,000 to 1.2 million gallons a day, Prince said. 
"To demonstrate a good faith effort to the board," the city began making 
$80,000 in repairs and improvements to the plant after the March hearing, 
Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
The plant is one of the few in the country that uses saltwater in the waste 
treatment process, which requires more careful monitoring than in fresh water 
plants, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A board report in March stated that the plant did not meet permit requirements 
on 29 days in November and December, 1988, when levels of suspended solid waste 
or biochemical oxygen demand exceeded amounts allowed in the permit. 
</P>
<P>
The permit allows for sewage discharge with an average of 20 milligrams of 
biochemical oxygen-demand per liter per month, and 30 milligrams of suspended 
solid wastes per liter per month, board engineers said. These levels were 
exceeded sometimes by a small amount and sometimes by 100%, according to the 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Biochemical oxygen demand is a measure of the amount of oxygen needed to break 
down sewage, board officials said. A higher oxygen-demand level deprives the 
water of oxygen, which is needed to sustain marine life. Suspended solid 
measures actual wastes in the discharge. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the board separately monitor discharge levels at the plant.

LAB OFFERS TO PAY FOR REANALYSIS OF PAP SMEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Tarzana medical laboratory that was shut down in April for allegedly 
misdiagnosing too many Pap smears Wednesday announced an offer to pay for 
reanalysis of millions of smears screened by the lab in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Central Diagnostic Laboratory, responding to demands by state 
health authorities, said they have sent letters to nearly 15,000 physicians 
advising them that the rescreening is available for their patients who want it. 
It will be up to individual doctors whether to notify their patients. 
</P>
<P>
Central Diagnostic's affiliate, Central Pathology Services Medical Group, 
closed its doors in April under pressure from state health officials after an 
inspection found that the lab had misdiagnosed 21% of a random selection of 
1,103 Pap smears. The Pap smear is a routine test used to detect medical 
abnormalities in women, including cervical cancer, which kills an estimated 
7,000 U.S. women per year. 
</P>
<P>
Before its closure, Central Pathology screened nearly 700,000 Pap smears a 
year, more than half of the total in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials demanded on April 17 that the firm offer free 
rescreening and gave Central Pathology thirty days to comply. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement makes moot a portion of a state lawsuit filed May 18, 
the day after the deadline expired against Central Diagnostic, Central 
Pathology, and four related defendants. In the Los Angeles Superior Court suit, 
state officials sought a court order requiring the firms to offer free 
rescreening. The state continues to seek more than $3 million in damages for 
alleged deficiencies at Central Pathology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Recognized Their Duty' 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Wendi A. Horwitz, who filed the Department of Health Services 
suit, said she could not comment on specifics of the company's offer. But she 
said the health department "is pleased that Central Pathology . . . and Central 
Diagnostic Laboratory have recognized their duty to notify the affected women." 
</P>
<P>
In its letter, Central Diagnostic said it is important that doctors, medical 
laboratories and the government "all work together to restore the confidence of 
the public in the various procedures involved in an early detection and 
treatment of cervical cancer." 
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, each rescreening will be done by "a Pap laboratory 
fully licensed" by the state and "not affiliated with" Central Diagnostic or 
its officers. Patients wishing to take advantage of the offer should ask their 
doctors, who should write Central Diagnostic, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the lab retained smears for five years as required by law, few office 
visits should be needed to take new smears, the letter said. If an office visit 
is required because a Pap slide is broken or unreadable, Central Diagnostic 
will pay for the visit, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Labs 
</P>
<P>
Since the April shutdown of Central Pathology, Central Diagnostic has been 
sending Pap smears to other labs that the firms neither own nor manage. 
</P>
<P>
But one lab being used by Central Diagnostic, DeKalb Laboratory near 
Philadelphia, was purchased by Central Diagnostic in 1986, according to records 
on file with Pennsylvania health authorities and the federal Health Care 
Financing Administration. According to a disclosure form filed in 1988, DeKalb 
was then taken over by Tarzana-based American Medical Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
American Medical's owner is Oscar Harris, an Atlanta, Ga., architect and half 
brother of the head of Central Diagnostic, Dr. Allen Levy. In federal 
disclosure forms, American Medical gave its address as 19528 Ventura Blvd., a 
commercial mail drop operated by Mail Boxes Etc. USA, from which American 
Medical apparently rents a mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
Central Diagnostic spokesman Martin Cooper said Harris bought DeKalb on the 
recommendation of Levy, who has no ownership interest in and "nothing to do 
with" running DeKalb. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is an affiliate relationship in which DeKalb utilizes some 
expertise from Central Diagnostic. For example, Cooper said, an executive of 
Central Diagnostic recently helped DeKalb set up an accounting system, for 
which DeKalb was billed. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said DeKalb is also licensed in New York, which he said has some of the 
toughest certification standards. 
</P>
<P>
Josephine Bartola, supervisor of medical laboratories for Pennsylvania, said 
there is nothing unusual about DeKalb. They "may have some deficiencies just 
like any other . . . but they're as good as most."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TASK FORCE URGED FOR INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance City Councilman Tim Mock has requested that city staff form a task 
force to draft a proposed March ballot measure that would tighten controls on 
all hazardous chemicals in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mock said Tuesday that he wants the measure to require industries to obtain a 
conditional-use permit to use and store hazardous chemicals. A panel of experts 
would review the safety of a chemical's use on a case-by-case basis before 
issuing a permit, Mock said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed measure would also provide voters with an alternative to an 
initiative proposed by Councilman Dan Walker, which is only intended to 
restrict the use of acutely hazardous hydrofluoric acid at the Mobil Oil 
refinery, Mock said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Walker has said he expects to collect enough signatures within the next three 
weeks to get his initiative on the March ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Mock stressed the need for tighter restrictions but also said he feared that if 
Walker's initiative succeeds, it will tie up the city in a court battle for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"I would do almost anything to stop Walker's initiative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said that he is concerned that Mock's proposed measure will be a 
"back-door attempt" to derail his ballot measure and may confuse voters. 
</P>
<P>
Mock's proposal would require approval by the City Council to place it on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
A series of fires, explosions and gas leaks at the Mobil refinery have killed 
three people and seriously injured at least 12 others since March of 1987, 
prompting the city to file a suit in Los Angeles Superior Court. The suit asks 
that the court declare the refinery a public nuisance and give the city the 
power to regulate it.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA TOUGHENS PARKING-SPACE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council approved tough regulations requiring more 
parking spaces in new commercial and residential developments, despite 
objections from developers who said the standards would raise construction 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The parking regulations, unanimously approved late Tuesday night, also require 
larger parking spaces. The width of a standard parking space will increase from 
eight feet to nine feet, exceeding the Los Angeles County standard of 8 1/2 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
Council members praised the new ordinance, saying a shortage of parking spaces 
is inconvenient for thousands of Santa Clarita motorists. "It's a nightmare," 
Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance creates a variety of parking standards for commercial buildings, 
medical facilities, hotels, fast-food restaurants and residences. The standards 
generally call for more parking spaces per square foot of construction than had 
been required. 
</P>
<P>
Eva Goetz, community affairs director for the Building Industry Assn., urged 
the council to reject the new standards. She said the regulations would raise 
development costs and reduce the availability of affordable housing.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRING OF OFFICER AFFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance Civil Service Commission has affirmed the firing of Timothy 
Pappas, the police officer dismissed last year because he allegedly lied to 
superiors about the circumstances surrounding the shooting of an unarmed 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
The commission made its decision Monday after three nights of closed hearings 
conducted this month. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Donald Nash fired Pappas after he shot construction worker Patrick 
J. Coyle last May. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year Torrance police veteran and Mark Holden, a fellow officer accused 
of lying to superiors about the incident, are awaiting trial on criminal 
charges of obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden said the shooting, which left Coyle 
partially paralyzed, appeared to be accidental. Pappas is charged with lying 
about the shooting to make it appear that he fired his .45-caliber pistol in 
self defense, Darden said. Pappas allegedly told superiors that he shot Coyle 
when he reached toward his waistband, as if for a weapon, according to police 
reports. Pappas later admitted that he "tensed up" and accidentally pulled the 
trigger, the reports say. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas has not decided whether to appeal his termination to the City Council, 
said his lawyer, Michael Norris. Pappas and Holden pleaded not guilty to the 
charges.

POLICE OFFICER FIRED FOR ASSAULT ON UNARMED MAN IS REINSTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego police officer fired for kicking, beating and using Mace on an 
unarmed man was reinstated Wednesday by the Civil Service Commission, which 
cited the testimony of a police instructor who said "a much higher level of 
force could have been appropriate and justified." 
</P>
<P>
However, the commission also levied a three-month suspension against Allen A. 
Stovall, noting that the beating last year was the second action brought 
against him for alleged misconduct since joining the Police Department in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier incident occurred in 1987, when Stovall was suspended two days for 
striking a civilian with the butt of a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
In the more recent case, the 28-year-old officer was fired in December for 
assaulting Jose Gonzalez in March, 1988, when the man began asking police about 
a drive-by shooting in his Harbor View neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Told Panel of Beating 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez told the commission that, while Officer Frank Almond Jr. held him to a 
street sign, Stovall kicked him repeatedly in the groin, struck him in the ribs 
with his police baton and sprayed Mace in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, at the time a mistaken suspect in the drive-by shooting, was arrested 
for being drunk in public and obstructing a police officer in the performance 
of his duties. But city officials said the 35-year-old man was never 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said it considered "several critical, mitigating factors" in 
reaching its decision to overturn the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
The panel noted that the assault occurred while the officers were trying to 
handcuff Gonzalez as the man's wife said: "Get their guns, shoot them, kill the 
officers!" 
</P>
<P>
The commission said Stovall did not deliberately set out to harm Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diffusing 'Dangerous Situation' 
</P>
<P>
"The force used by the appellant was not precipitated by anger or retaliation, 
but rather to control, handcuff and remove the still-resistant and struggling 
subject as quickly as possible to diffuse a dangerous situation," the panel 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said it "seriously considered" the testimony from Sgt. Donald L. 
Fasching, who teaches defensive tactics at the Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
Fasching, the commission said, "stated that, based on the woman's verbal 
threats and physical actions and continued resistance of the suspect, the 
resultant force used by the appellant was minimal, and that a much higher level 
of force could have been appropriate and justified." 
</P>
<P>
But the commission also noted that the Stovall case suggested a marked 
difference between the level of force taught to police officers and the amount 
of force tolerated by police management.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A third teen-ager was sentenced Wednesday to a maximum of 365 days at the 
county's juvenile camp for his part in a series of Escondido school fires and 
vandalism of a church. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, who recently turned 18, changed his plea to guilty in an arson that 
caused $55,000 damage to an Escondido High School outbuilding March 10 and to 
vandalism of an Escondido Roman Catholic church in mid-February. He was not 
charged in three school fires set March 18 that caused about $1.2-million 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Probation staff had recommended that the youth be sent to a California Youth 
Authority prison, where he could have been held until his 21st birthday.

ONCE SCOFFED AT BY PEERS, POLICE EXPERTS IN OCCULT CRIME NOW ARE FRIGHTENINGLY 
IN DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the time, police officer Sandi Gallant recalled, maybe even she didn't truly 
comprehend the dark lure of the occult. 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1981. The case was eerie, weird in a grotesque, spooky kind of 
way. Even for San Francisco, where cops are not easily surprised by sensational 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Black male, probably a street person, found murdered in Golden Gate Park. 
</P>
<P>
The guy's head had been cut off. And it was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives found some strange clues. There was the headless chicken, for one. 
Part of the bird's body had been stuffed inside the dead man. Some kind of 
ritual seemed to have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Expert of Sorts 
</P>
<P>
Homicide didn't know what to make of it, so investigators called Gallant, who 
works intelligence. After her involvement in the aftermath of the Peoples 
Temple mass murder-suicide in Guyana, she'd become an expert of sorts in the 
realm of spiritual wackos. 
</P>
<P>
She had begun studying up on cults, brainwashing, the sick powers of 
persuasion. From there came an exploration of "alternative" belief systems, 
witchcraft, Santeria and Satanism. 
</P>
<P>
Gallant had been looking for explanations. Increasingly, it seemed, the occult 
was leaving its marks in crime. 
</P>
<P>
So now this. What did Gallant think? Homicide wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
Gallant and her partner said it looked like Santeria, a religion involving 
animal sacrifice that slaves from the West African Yoruba tribe imported to the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Gallant refines that a little. She says it was probably Palo Mayombe, a 
similar, albeit darker religion brought to the Caribbean by Bantu-speaking 
slaves from the Congo. 
</P>
<P>
It was Palo Mayombe, too, that Mexican and U.S. investigators say was entwined 
with the gruesome deaths of at least five of the 15 people murdered in 
Matamoros earlier this year as part of a drug and religious cult. 
</P>
<P>
But Gallant didn't know that much then. She was taking an educated guess, 
testing out a theory. 
</P>
<P>
"We literally were laughed at by our homicide investigators, and our chief of 
detectives," Gallant recalled. "It was like, 'Give me a break. This stuff 
doesn't happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
So Gallant went out on a limb, laying out a bizarre blueprint for murder not 
much different from the others she now routinely dispenses at seminars. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is that now those who listen to her theories are far more likely 
to furrow their brows than crack a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Gallant is a leading expert among the small but growing number of police 
officers who have carved out a specialty in crimes connected with the occult -- 
everything from the centuries-old practice of devil worship to a relative 
newcomer known as chaos magic, a combination of Satanic teachings with an 
emphasis on mutilations with steel objects. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1981, such were the theories of radicals, if not psychotics. 
</P>
<P>
In 42 days, Gallant told homicide, the dead man's head would be returned near 
the spot where his body was found. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, for the first 21 days, the religion's practitioners would use 
parts of the man's brains, perhaps even his ears and his eyes, blending them in 
a caldron to make a ritual brew. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of those 21 days, if the priest deemed it appropriate, he would 
actually sleep in an area with this head and with this caldron for another 
21-day period," Gallant said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then on the 42nd day he discards the head . . . in close proximity to where he 
took it from. To him, that was a sacred way of returning the head." 
</P>
<P>
And that, apparently, is exactly how it happened. 
</P>
<P>
The head was returned on the 42nd day not far from where the body was found. 
But no one from the San Francisco Police Department was there to see, let alone 
arrest, whoever returned it. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem was, even though our homicide detectives didn't buy it, my partner 
and I weren't out there doing surveillance on the 42nd day either," Gallant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think looking back on it, we had a real difficult time, too, believing that 
something like this could happen. Even though it was our theory." 
</P>
<P>
The baffling case of the beheaded transient remains unsolved. Today, though, 
Gallant takes her theories seriously, and so do law enforcement agencies across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got a call yesterday from a state on the East Coast and the 
investigator had gotten a call . . . about a father who went into his son's 
room and found a human head underneath the kid's bed," Gallant said in a recent 
interview. "It appears that it was dug up from a cemetery. But he found a human 
head. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That's really an extreme case, but I've had other cases where kids have gotten 
into real bizarre types of activity like multilating birds, animals, and really 
graphic drawings of dismembered bodies, and parents don't even recognize that 
this is a disturbed child. They think that this is normal for a 14- or 
15-year-old kid to be doing these things. And it's not normal." 
</P>
<P>
Like the public in general, some police officers flat out don't believe that 
such strange, often gruesome occult practices exist. Others, usually those with 
strong Christian fundamentalist beliefs, see the devil's work virtually 
everywhere. They talk of conspiracy and mayhem, of Satanic child abusers and 
women who breed babies for Satanic sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Often there is no evidence that will stand up in court. It is just too weird, 
prosecutors say. No juror in his right mind would buy it. 
</P>
<P>
And putting aside rumors that may never be proven, there are still no 
statistics, or even any reliable estimates, to document the magnitude of the 
problem. Some law enforcement officers say California seems to be a hotbed for 
crimes of the occult. 
</P>
<P>
But others say that's nonsense, that the trappings of the occult are turning up 
at crime scenes across the country without any discernible pattern. 
</P>
<P>
What that leads to in the conservative world of law enforcement is official 
ambivalence. Although there are several recognized experts in so-called occult 
crimes -- those connected with an occult belief system -- no U.S. law 
enforcement agency currently has an officer assigned exclusively to such 
criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
Those that hold seminars, consult and train other officers on the demonic 
netherworld do it on their own time or squeezed among their other duties. 
</P>
<P>
But they are doing it. Police forces want it. And so do other government and 
community organizations. The evidence that crimes -- everything from animal 
mutilations, to rape, to murder -- increasingly are being committed under the 
guise of occult beliefs is just too strong. 
</P>
<P>
"In the '60s, the cutting edge was drugs," says Washington journalist 
</P>
<P>
Larry Kahaner, whose 1988 book, "Cults That Kill," has won wide favor among 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"In the '70s, it was computer crime. In the '80s, it's terrorism. Occult crime 
is really the crime of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Patrick Metoyer, 23 years with the Los Angeles Police Department, a 
bomb expert and watch commander for the criminal conspiracy section, is not 
somebody inclined to go in for the far out. And he doesn't. He just keeps an 
eye on it, and then tries to sort it out. 
</P>
<P>
For him the fascination started during the three months he guarded Linda 
Kasabian, a witness at the Tate-La Bianca murder trial of Charles Manson, the 
man who had convinced her and other cult members that evil was good. 
</P>
<P>
"She was totally dependent on Manson," Metoyer says. "Here was a person with 
the ability to mesmerize people, which is no different than Jim Jones, who was 
able to command about 900 people to drink poison. It's this phenomenon of 
brainwashing." 
</P>
<P>
Then, slowly, Metoyer began noticing another link. The profile of a cultist 
seemed very similar to that of the young people who were dabbling in Satanism. 
</P>
<P>
They were looking for something, hoping to fill a personal void. And, as 
evidenced by the trappings of Satanism at crime scenes, they were increasingly 
acting outside of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Metoyer has captured the grisly evidence in a horrifying slide presentation 
that he shows to other law enforcement officials trying to understand what 
could motivate a person to commit such acts. 
</P>
<P>
There are mutilated animals. Satanists may use their body parts in rituals and 
drink their blood. 
</P>
<P>
There is a slide of a nude woman, her body painted with Satanic drawings, who 
is masturbating with a black candle. She was the companion of a man arrested 
for sexually abusing children. 
</P>
<P>
Another slide shows the left hand of a corpse. Satanists, who believe that the 
left hand gives them the power of evil, apparently hacked it off. 
</P>
<P>
And still another slide shows a man having sex with a cadaver, apparently part 
of a ritual associated with the practice of necromancy. 
</P>
<P>
As repulsive as such practices may be, police officers stress that not all of 
them are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The right to practice one's religion, regardless of what that might be, is 
protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution. Police say that only 
when the practice of that religion violates the law -- posession of a human 
skull, for example, is a felony -- do they become involved. 
</P>
<P>
But such is a distinction that the public, and even some police officers, may 
not always appreciate. The very nature of Satanism, the antithesis of 
Judeo-Christian ethics, is especially threatening to most people. 
</P>
<P>
Says Kenneth Lanning, the FBI's chief expert on ritualistic child abuse: "If I 
went into the room of an alleged child molester and I see a crucifix on the 
wall, am I going to seize it? I may, if I believe it has something to do with 
the crime, but only if it has something to do with the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"The same thing is true, in my opinion, about a pentagram on the wall. Just 
because it is there, doesn't mean that you just take it." 
</P>
<P>
Metoyer gives another example. 
</P>
<P>
Anton LaVey, who founded the Church of Satan in 1966, invited Metoyer to the 
Satanic baptism of a 6-week-old girl during a ritual in Van Nuys about three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
LaVey, whose "Satanic Bible" is a perennial best seller among self-styled 
teen-age Satanists, sent down a high priestess from his base in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"They showed me all the trappings," Metoyer says. "I didn't think for one 
minute that they were going to do anything illegal. I told them I would arrest 
them if they did." 
</P>
<P>
So what Metoyer says he saw, and felt, was the bone-chilling devotion of some 
25 people who had committed their lives to Satan. 
</P>
<P>
The Satanic sanctuary, painted entirely in matte black, was a single room in a 
suburban house. Illuminated only by the twinkling of a revolving strobe light, 
Metoyer says, it gave him a floating sensation. Eerie music played in the 
background. The room seemed to have no corners. 
</P>
<P>
A huge portrait of Satan looked down at the participants, all of them dressed 
in black robes. 
</P>
<P>
On the west wall was the altar. The black candles were on the left, 
representing the path of damnation, and a single white candle stood on the 
right, representing the path of righteousness. 
</P>
<P>
There was a dagger, a chalice, a crucible, a bell, an upside-down cross, a 
silver baphomet -- a pentagram with the head of a goat imposed on it -- a gong, 
salt (a purifier), incense and a grimoire, a manual for invoking demons and the 
spirits of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
The baby's mother held the child away from her, while the priestess invoked 
demons and placed the dagger over the baby's heart. The baby was not cut. But 
she may still be a member of the Church of Satan. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Emon, a police sergeant with the city of Baldwin Park, says that what law 
enforcement officials don't realize when they begin investigating occult crime 
is that bad things may mysteriously befall them. 
</P>
<P>
"You want a personal experience?" he says. "Quite frankly, I got obsessed with 
researching this. I started reading 'The Satanic Bible' and 'The Satanic 
Rituals' and I brought all this garbage into my house... 
</P>
<P>
"Then one of my sons had ear infections for nine solid months. We went through 
five different antibiotics. We had accidents in the family. I had difficulties 
at work. Then one day, I came home and found a pentagram on my carpet. It 
looked like someone had taken the tip of a pencil and drawn it. . . . I just 
looked at my wife. I stepped on it. I vacuumed it. It wouldn't come off." 
</P>
<P>
It was only after he prayed on top of the pentagram -- "There was an evil 
presence that I could just sense" -- that Emon says it disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Emon, who became interested in occult crimes with the arrest of Night Stalker 
suspect Richard Ramirez, exemplifies perhaps the most controversial breed of 
occult investigators: Christian fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
He is director of Christian Occult Investigation Network, based in West Covina, 
and also teaches a course for law enforcement officials, certified by Police 
Officers Standards and Training, called "Occult Crimes Investigations." 
</P>
<P>
In the eight-hour course, complete with photographs, objects used in Satanic 
rituals, literature and the occasional reformed Satanist, Emon offers what he 
calls his "secular presentation." 
</P>
<P>
"I teach," he says. "I don't preach." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Jones, president of Cult Crime Impact Network and a lieutenant in the 
Boise, Idaho, police force, whose bimonthly newsletter has 1,750 subscribers, 
says that he has heard the criticism of him and other born-again Christians who 
investigate occult crimes: that their religious beliefs cloud their 
objectivity, that they give credence to mentally disturbed "survivors" of 
Satanic cults, that they fuel hysteria and throw common sense to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, give me a break," he responds. "What do psychologists across the country 
have to gain by brainwashing their clients? That doesn't really hold water. 
</P>
<P>
"We have confessed Satanic murders across the country. Ritually killed bodies, 
from infants to older folks. Matamoros. I mean, what do we need? The fact of it 
is there. The magnitude is what is under question. . . .And the ones who are 
supposed to keep track of this don't even believe that it exists. So we are 
kind of at an impasse." 
</P>
<P>
Jones believes that organizations such as his will eventually persuade the nay 
sayers that the devil's hand in occult crime is really nothing to be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are killing themselves and their friends," he says. "We got a problem. We 
need to be better investigators. This is no different a new field than child 
abuse investigation was in the 1970s. Back then, nobody believed it was 
happening. But it had been going on for decades." 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest problems in a field as sensitive as the investigation of 
occult crimes is a definition of terms. 
</P>
<P>
Several cases of ritualistic child abuse have been prosecuted, and won, after 
evidence of Satanic trappings was brought out. Other cases, however, have been 
tried without any mention of devil worship because prosecutors felt it could 
jeopardize the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors often find such practices impossible to believe, especially when young 
children are the ones telling the horrifying tales. 
</P>
<P>
Convicted teen-age killers, in California, Oklahoma, Missouri, New Jersey and 
elsewhere, have told investigators and jury members that they killed their 
victims as a sacrifice to Satan. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, only one case in the United States, that of ex-waiter Clifford St. 
Joseph in San Francisco, has been prosecuted as a human sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph, 46, was sentenced last year to 34 years to life in prison for 
murdering a male drifter, who is still unidentified. The victim's chest had 
been carved with a pentagram and police said he had been chained, his blood 
drained into a chalice and drunk, and that one of his testicles had been cut 
off and eaten in a ritual. 
</P>
<P>
But the FBI's Lanning, for one, doesn't believe even the St. Joseph case 
qualifies as a Satanic sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
"I would define a Satanic murder as one committed by two or more individuals -- 
you have to have at least two people to have a cult -- who rationally plan the 
crime and whose primary motivation is to fulfill a prescribed Satanic ritual 
calling for the murder," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been involved in a case where a woman was sexually assaulted, stabbed 
30 to 40 times, and a Bible was tied to her chest. Now are we going to say that 
this is a Christian crime?" 
</P>
<P>
Gallant, who gets some 25 calls a week from investigators trying to decipher 
occult trappings at crime scenes across the country, says that in San 
Francisco, three cases have been classified as ritualistic homicides: the '81 
case of the beheaded transient, the St. Joseph case, and another in 1983 
involving a decapitated woman who was mutilated and dismembered. Like the '81 
case, that murder is still unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were the cases that we can verifiably say were ritualistic," Gallant 
says. "There may have been others. There was a case here 19 years ago, with two 
boys, 7 and 9, who allegedly kidnaped a child that was about a year and a half 
old. They took him to a garage and crucified him...They actually had a little 
crown on his head and a cross that he was tied to. It was kissed off as just 
being real bizarre, because the 9-year-old had a plate in his head, he was 
brain-damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"Now looking at it 19 years later, knowing what I know, I would scrutinize that 
much more carefully. Was it just the 7- and 9-year-old boys that did this? How 
would they know to do the things that they did in this kind of murder? . . . 
There was something, but what? You can't go back 20 years later and put it 
together. So I'm sure there are a lot of cases like that that have slipped 
through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
But to leap from there to the conclusion that whoever committed such a crime 
had to be under the influence of Satan is something that Gallant and most other 
occult investigators say they are simply not willing to do. 
</P>
<P>
The stories may be true, they say, but they remain unproven. Even the existence 
of the devil, or God, or Mohammed, or any other deity, has so far been 
impossible to prove. 
</P>
<P>
"For most of us," Gallant says, "and I can give myself as an example, what we 
tended to do in the beginning was we started to hear these things and first of 
all, we disbelieved it. Then we felt guilty about disbelieving it when it 
appeared that there might be something there. And then from there perhaps we 
got a little hysterical in the way we responded, too. 
</P>
<P>
"And then, hopefully, we get to a point where we go, 'Ah ha. I've seen both 
sides of the issue, and now let me sit back and be very objective and weigh 
each side and come to a conclusion as to what the reality is.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's where I've been for about the last 3 1/2 years, where I'm not 
out trying to prove anything. And I'm not necessarily out to disprove anything. 
I'm just trying to find out the truth about what's going on."

WHO ISN'T WRITING HOLLYWOOD'S STORIES; 
</P>
<P>
WRITERS GUILD STUDY CLAIMS HIRING PICTURE STILL POOR FOR WOMEN, MINORITIES, 
OLDER WRITERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Writers Guild of America, West on Wednesday released a sweeping study of 
employment practices in Hollywood, showing that job opportunities and pay 
scales for women, minority and older writers have remained stagnant or worsened 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The union's report, based on members' employment records and data from 
producers between 1982 and 1987, claimed that the wage gap between male and 
female writers is widening, that minorities continue to constitute only 2% of 
employed writers, and that employment opportunities for writers over age 40 are 
dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest surprise is that the situation is not improving, and in some cases 
it's getting worse," William Bielby, who conducted the study with his wife, 
Denise, said in an interview. "I can't think of another industry where there's 
been such a trend." 
</P>
<P>
The Bielbys, both sociologists at UC Santa Barbara, conducted a similar study 
for the Writers Guild in 1987, covering the period 1982 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Wednesday's report, the Alliance of Motion Picture and 
Television Producers questioned the validity of some of the findings -- but 
declined to cite specifics -- and shifted the blame for the problem to the 
guild. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Steinberg, spokesman for the alliance, said that in the TV industry, it is 
primarily writers -- who also have responsibilities as producers -- who hire 
other writers. "It's in their power to change things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance also charged that in the past, the guild has rejected its 
proposals to expand opportunities for women, minority and older writers. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Wednesday, Brian Walton, the Writers Guild's executive 
director, called the results of the study "somewhat puzzling. . . . Ours is not 
an industry shackled by declining profits." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the poor showing by minority writers was the result of racism, Walton 
said, "It's difficult to come to a contrary conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
But when asked about remedies, guild officials had little to offer beyond 
seeking the voluntary cooperation of producers. Under contract language won 
during last year's strike, the guild has the right to "explore new affirmative 
action programs" with the companies. Already two Warner Bros.-produced TV 
shows, "Growing Pains" and "Just the Ten of Us," have agreed to examine scripts 
the guild submits from women, minority and older writers. So far, that effort 
has yielded free-lance assignments for two minority writers, according to Rich 
Reinhart, co-producer of "Just the Ten of Us." 
</P>
<P>
Walton did not rule out the possibility of more adversarial avenues, such as 
class action suits. But, he said, such lawsuits are expensive, their 
effectiveness is questionable and they would polarize the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The gap in pay between male and female writers widened during the five years 
covered in the report. Whereas in 1982 women writers earned 73 cents for each 
dollar their male colleagues earned, by 1987 that figure had dropped to 63 
cents, it said. (During the same period, overall median income of the guild's 
membership increased.) 
</P>
<P>
Women have the most success landing jobs as in-house writers at TV networks, 
where pay is the lowest in the TV industry, the report said. They are least 
likely to land jobs writing scripts for feature films: At the major studios, 
the percentage of writing jobs going to women declined from more than 17% in 
1982 to 15.5% in 1987. Overall, women as a percent of total employment in the 
entertainment industry increased slightly during the five years from 19% to 
21%. 
</P>
<P>
The status of minority writers remained static during that same period. They 
composed 2.1% of employed writers in 1982, and again in 1987, during a period 
when total employment of Hollywood writers increased. 
</P>
<P>
The guild, where writers are eligible for membership only if they have actually 
sold scripts, has only 185 minority members out of a total of about 6,400 
writers. On average, fewer than 75 of those minorities were employed each year 
throughout the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bielby argued that a window of opportunity opened for minority writers in the 
1970s, but has since closed. Those minorities who do find work in Hollywood, he 
said, tend to be clustered at TV shows with minority casts. 
</P>
<P>
The report also documented the worsening opportunities for men over 40. As 
recently as 1982, these more experienced writers made more money than their 
younger counterparts. By 1987, though, they were making only 84 cents for every 
dollar earned by the average white male. The study also showed a dramatic drop 
in employment for these writers from age 41 on. 
</P>
<P>
"TV and films are the domain of young white men," Allan Manings, a 65-year-old 
writer whose credits include "Laugh-In" and "One Day at a Time," said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference Wednesday, guild president George Kirgo said he was 
recently told by a producer that he was too old to be hired as the writer on a 
TV movie. "It is now felt that older writers can't write love scenes," he said, 
and then added jokingly, "Some of us have kept diaries." 
</P>
<P>
As it did in its last report, the Writers Guild study cited specific studios 
with poor records in hiring women, minorities and older writers. Both Disney 
and MTM, which has produced such shows as "St. Elsewhere" and "Hill Street 
Blues," were repeatedly faulted in the latest study for low numbers in these 
areas. Those same companies also were cited in the 1987 study. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Frank, president of Walt Disney Studios, disputed some of the report's 
data. But he acknowledged that "there is a problem," particularly in the TV 
industry. "We do have to address those numbers," he said, "but it has to be the 
guild, the networks and the producers. . . . We're happy to try to do something 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
In the area of feature film production, Frank said, "We just pick the best 
material." The race and age of the author, he noted, is not identified on the 
scripts the studio reads. 
</P>
<P>
MTM declined comment on the study. 
</P>
<P>
The report also faulted the hiring practices of the feature film operations at 
Fox, Paramount, MGM, Warner and Universal (though Universal was commended for 
its women and minority hires on the TV side.) The percentage of white males 
hired at these studios ranged from 79% (Fox TV) to 86.3% (Disney film studios). 
</P>
<P>
Officials at these studios either declined comment or their officials did not 
return calls. But Steinberg of the producers alliance insisted that 
decision-makers at the film studios do not discriminate against women, minority 
or older writers. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a good story, it's a good story," he said. "There's nothing on the 
cover (of a script) saying it was written by a black, a white, a male, a female 
or someone in polka dots." 
</P>
<P>
Among the companies with the best records in hiring minorities, the study said, 
were Carson Productions, Carsey-Werner, Columbia (both film and TV), Embassy, 
HBO, Landsburg and Universal Television. 
</P>
<P>
William Bielby attributed the low numbers of women and minority hires partly to 
the fact that hiring practices haven't been "monitored closely in Hollywood." 
In the 1970s, he said, major companies in other industries began to change 
their hiring practices because they "faced losing government contracts or 
(becoming the targets of) class action suits." 
</P>
<P>
Film and TV production companies don't rely on government contracts, and their 
artists are reluctant to sue them for fear of being "blacklisted or labeled as 
difficult," Bielby said. 
</P>
<P>
He also cited the informal nature of doing business in Hollywood as an obstacle 
to women and minorities gaining access. "You have to put together teams on 
short notice, so you rely on the people you know," he said. "It's not a system 
that lends itself to complete access and equality." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Bielby cited a reluctance by film and TV producers to try anything new 
or risky as an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
Daryl G. Nickens, a black writer whose credits include "A Different World," 
said minority writers lose opportunities because they aren't often invited to 
socialize with white colleagues. "This is such a social industry," Nickens 
said. "There's not a lot of interaction between black and white Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Minority writers such as Nickens and Delle Chatman say the most difficult 
aspect of working in Hollywood is gaining the initial access. Chatman recounted 
an episode in which a white TV producer read her script for a dramatic series 
and later confessed to being appalled: How could this young white guy have the 
arrogance to write about the sensitive racial issues that were central to the 
story? 
</P>
<P>
To Chatman, a black woman, that producer's assumption -- which he subsequently 
recounted to her -- says much about the attitudes of Hollywood's 
decision-makers. "That's how far out of their minds minority and women writers 
are," Chatman said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of discrimination, many Writers Guild members contend, goes beyond 
employment opportunities. It also affects the content of the shows on TV and 
the movies that make it to theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood is a dream doctor," said Chatman. "When you have control of TV, you 
have control of the dreams of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was more of a mix of different people, then different perspectives 
would be examined. It's hard for a homogenous society to live off its own 
imagination indefinitely," she added.

CRITIC AT LARGE: SOVIET JAZZMEN AND DIXIE MELODIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Leningrad Dixieland Band first toured the United States two years ago, 
playing a glad-notes variation on glasnost in the form of such ancient folk 
melodies as "Maple Leaf Rag" and "The Memphis Blues." 
</P>
<P>
The nine-man group is back again for a six-week tour that began in British 
Columbia and centers on appearances at the annual monster rally of traditional 
music, the Dixieland Jazz Jubilee in Sacramento over Memorial Day weekend. The 
tour will end in Washington on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, in town for a Wednesday taping of the Johnny Carson show (they 
appeared on the program with great success in 1987), the band played a rousing 
set at At My Place in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The gig was organized by Allen Rosenthal, a banjo-strumming real estate lawyer 
who feels music is the key to world harmony and who dreams of a kind of 
Dixieland satellite teleconference, with the saints marching in simultaneously 
all around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
From the opening strains of "The Jazz Me Blues" Tuesday night, it was obvious 
that the Leningrad players had studied and absorbed the American strain but had 
gone beyond imitation to find their own ebullient voices. 
</P>
<P>
David Goloshokin, who doubles on fluegelhorn and amplified violin, plays the 
fiddle with a raucous, driving bite that sounds like a Stephane Grappelli 
interpretation of bluegrass. 
</P>
<P>
The band's leader and arranger, Oleg Kuvaitsev, plays alto in an elegant style 
that owes more to Ellington's New York than to New Orleans. Some of his charts 
venture well away from the traditional book, to the likes of "Tico Tico," a 
best-selling record as an Ethel Smith organ solo years ago. The band takes it 
fast, in the light, crisp style of West Coast jazz. Traditional jazz is at very 
least a lighthearted, high-energy musical vaudeville, enjoyed for the 
familiarity of the tunes and even, occasionally, for famous solos repeated note 
for note. 
</P>
<P>
At its enduring best, traditional jazz is a term embracing everything from 
straight-ahead Dixieland to the upriver Chicago, New York and California 
evolutions. It is an apparently endlessly renewable resource, a showcase for 
great instrumentalists spinning magical improvisations and for collaborative 
efforts as well -- experiments in voicings, interwoven free-form melodies, 
call-and-response chases, intricate rhythms behind the soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement of watching and listening is, not least, in seeing the musicians 
respond to each other with surprise and delight. A Leningrad Dixieland Band is 
an exotic import, but there was only an occasional accent to suggest the 
players had not wandered in from Kansas City for the night. 
</P>
<P>
The Leningraders are nothing if not showmen. Drummer Alexander Skrypnik, who 
plays with the unmussed urbanity of the American Buzzy Drootin, also does an 
amazing imitation of Louis Armstrong on "You're a Woman, I'm a Man." Banjoist 
Boris Ershov is a virtuoso performer and also a fine clown, a sort of 
hyperactive mime. 
</P>
<P>
For the night the band stayed largely with uptempo material; it remained to be 
heard how they handle slow blues. 
</P>
<P>
The original group first took form, as amateurs meeting for fun, in 1958. It 
became a professional group in 1962. The originating inspirations, the band 
members have said, were tours of the Soviet Union by Sidney Bechet and Louis 
Armstrong, the radio broadcasts of American jazz on Armed Forces Radio and, 
especially, Willis Conover's jazz shows on the Voice of America. 
</P>
<P>
"Before 1970 it was not easy to get records of American music," leader Oleg 
Kuvaitsev says. "Now you can. Count Basie, Charlie Parker, almost everybody." 
In addition, many more U.S. jazzmen have toured the Soviet Union, including 
Benny Goodman in the '60s. "Tommy Newsome, Zoot Sims, Joe Newman, Mel Lewis," 
Kuvaitsev recites, like a litany. 
</P>
<P>
Kuvaitsev joined the band in 1980, having previously played in a big band. "Big 
bands are not popular any more in the Soviet Union, like here, too," he says 
sadly. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the members started out to be musicians. Trumpet player Vladimir 
Voronin trained as an engineer, as did Kuvaitsev himself. Trombonist Anatoli 
Chimiris, who has played in be-bop groups as well, is also an independent film 
maker whose work has won prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Yuri Miroshnichenko, one of the surviving members of the original 1958 
group, studied architecture. Clarinetist Alexander Usyskin, who is blind, 
founded The Seven Dixieland Boys, one of the first traditional groups in the 
Soviet Union, in 1959. He plays in a cool style reminiscent of Buddy de Franco. 
</P>
<P>
The band has been touring and recording for years: six months a year on the 
road, usually; five albums on Melodiya. Since Jan. 1 it has also had its own 
nightclub in Leningrad, the Dixie Swing Club. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Kuvaitsev says, there are probably a half-dozen organized 
traditional jazz groups in Leningrad. There are also a couple of local jazz 
festivals in Leningrad and others throughout Eastern Europe. The recent Dresden 
festival, an annual event, drew 80,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Still many people don't know what jazz is," Kuvaitsev says. "But when they 
hear it they like it." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a universal fraternity of the music," says Allen Rosenthal. "It has 
nothing to do with politicians. What we need is a Dixieland sit-in, to get the 
politicians working together."

STAGE WATCH: NEW PLAYS, NEW MONEY TO SPARK CTG/AHMANSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plays by Edward Albee, August Wilson, Alan Ayckbourn and Neil Simon will make 
up Center Theatre Group/ Ahmanson's first full season in the organization's 
temporary home at the Doolittle Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
And CTG/Ahmanson has received an infusion of money from the Ahmanson Foundation 
-- $1.5 million as a working capital reserve fund and $100,000 for a study of 
the potential physical reconfiguration of the Ahmanson Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements of the 1989-90 season and the "unprecedented and unique 
grant" were made this week by the organization's new producing director, Gordon 
Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
He also announced a "pre-season bonus option" for Ahmanson subscribers: Derek 
Jacobi as Lord Byron in the American premiere of Jane McCulloch's two-actor 
show, "Byron -- Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know." Isla Blair will play all the 
women's roles. Subscribers can buy discounted tickets to "Byron," scheduled for 
Aug. 23-Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The season itself will open Oct. 5 with a revival of Albee's "Who's Afraid of 
Virginia Woolf?" directed by the playwright and starring Glenda Jackson and 
John Lithgow. It will play through Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope and expectation is that we will then do it in London," said Davidson. 
"I want to create an exchange between here and there." Next season Davidson's 
other theater, the Mark Taper Forum, will present the American premieres of 
three plays previously staged in London. 
</P>
<P>
Next up at the Doolittle is Yale Repertory Theatre's production of Wilson's 
"The Piano Lesson," Jan. 18-April 1. The play "will be re-rehearsed and 
re-worked" by Wilson and director Lloyd Richards, said Davidson. "They want to 
do it one more time before they take it to New York." The current version of 
"The Piano Lesson" is at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, closing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson announced "The Piano Lesson" as part of the Mark Taper Forum season 
two years ago, but then pulled it from the schedule at the request of its 
producers. It had been conceived for a proscenium stage and "they didn't want 
to re-stage it for (the Taper's) thrust stage," said Davidson. The Doolittle 
has a proscenium stage. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson will direct the season's third offering, Ayckbourn's "Henceforward . . 
.," scheduled for April 19-July 1. A comedy set in a high-tech future, 
"Henceforward . . . " was initially staged at Houston's Alley Theatre before 
becoming a hit in London. This will be the play's return to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The touring company of Simon's latest Broadway hit, "Rumors," will appear at 
the Doolittle July 12-Sept. 23, 1990, Gene Saks directing. The farce was first 
presented last fall at the Old Globe. Five earlier Simon plays had their 
premieres at the Ahmanson, and Davidson said he hopes Simon will resume that 
tradition at the Doolittle and/or the Ahmanson. 
</P>
<P>
Simon will be the only local playwright represented in either the 
Ahmanson/Doolittle or the Taper mainstage seasons this year. Asked about this, 
Davidson replied, "Give me a break." Then, assuming a more serious tone, he 
continued: "Now that I've got two seasons set, we can deal with (play) 
development. I'll be on the lookout in the Taper Lab for new work that could be 
done at the Doolittle as well as at the Taper." 
</P>
<P>
As previously announced, "Jerome Robbins' Broadway," a dance musical opening in 
November at the Shubert Theatre, will also be offered as part of the Ahmanson 
season. Selected seats will be reserved for Ahmanson subscribers during eight 
of the first 12 weeks of the run -- and for former Shubert subscribers during 
the other four weeks. A Shubert spokesman said the order of which weeks will be 
assigned to which subscription list has yet to be determined. But for Ahmanson 
subscribers, an attempt will be made to match the location of their seats at 
the Shubert with their seats at the Doolittle. 
</P>
<P>
Does the expansion of Davidson's realm to the Shubert mean that his title is 
now: artistic director-producer of Center Theatre Group/ Mark Taper Forum and 
producing director of the Center Theatre Group/Ahmanson Theatre at the UCLA 
James A. Doolittle Theatre and the Shubert Theatre? 
</P>
<P>
Just asking . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Ahmanson Theatre itself hasn't been forgotten. Davidson said he hopes the 
$100,000 from the Ahmanson Foundation for "exploratory work" on the potential 
Ahmanson remodeling will result in specific proposals within the next six to 
nine months -- with the goal that "on the day 'The Phantom (of the Opera)' 
closes, we'll be able to move in there (and begin reconfiguring)." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the new season would have worked at the Ahmanson, Davidson 
replied that "the Ahmanson would probably be too large for all the shows in 
this season. Each is eminently suited for the (1,021-seat) Doolittle; they may 
or may not have worked at the (2,071-seat) Ahmanson." 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5-million reserve fund from the Ahmanson Foundation "lifts a tremendous 
weight off our shoulders," said Davidson. "No more will we have the feeling of 
'one false move, and we're dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ahmanson subscribers will actually be able to see something at the 
Ahmanson next season, too -- "The Phantom of the Opera." Next year's 
subscribers will be offered a chance to buy four "prime location seats" to "The 
Phantom" -- in addition to the "Phantom" tickets that were part of the Ahmanson 
package this season. Dates for the new set of tickets will be after Nov. 26 -- 
the last date for which tickets are currently being sold. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of "The Phantom," alternate Marcy D'Arcy will play Christine at the 
next two Saturday matinees and then regularly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Dale 
Kristien plays the role at all other performances.

The remaining members of the Allman Brothers Band will be traveling men again 
as they take off on a 20th-anniversary reunion tour. Tour dates will be 
announced in the next few weeks, they said this week. "It's like a 20-year high 
school reunion thing," Gregg Allman said at drummer Butch Trucks' recording 
studio. "The timing was right and it just happened. It was a collective idea." 
The Macon, Ga.-based band, which formed in 1969, last performed together in 
1982. Claudia Puig

Billy Idol, Dwight Yoakam and others will perform Sunday in a concert to 
support Teen Canteen, a Hollywood shelter for teen-age runaways and homeless 
youths. The rock concert, sponsored by Paul Mitchell Systems, will be held at 
Victoria Station in Universal City, and will feature several local bands as 
well. Roy Sciacca, of the band Sciacca who will open the show, said he's 
performing in the benefit because he had been a teen runaway himself and "the 
teen-age runaway situation is a major problem and we hope that our 
participation will draw attention and raise the consciousness of people and 
organizations who can help." Claudia Puig

Malibu business leaders who elected Martin Sheen honorary mayor last month, 
looking forward to a little high-profile promotion, are now talking about 
"impeaching" him and replacing him with Johnny Carson. The Malibu Chamber of 
Commerce picked Sheen last month to promote its "Shop Malibu" campaign and to 
make appearances at civic affairs. Instead, the actor, known for his liberal 
activism, declared Malibu a nuclear-free zone. The recall drive gained momentum 
when Sheen called for the beachside haven of the stars to become a "sanctuary 
for aliens and the homeless." Meanwhile, the roadside marquee for the Malibu 
Inn and Restaurant, which last week urged "Dump Martin Sheen," read earlier 
this week: "Johnny for Mayor." Carson says he's not interested in any 
mayorship, honorary or otherwise. Claudia Puig

The Chicago Sun-Times has dropped a gossip columnist who reported a rumor 
involving television talk-show host Oprah Winfrey. Columnist Ann Gerber's 
column was discontinued over "basic differences" with Kenneth Towers, vice 
president and executive editor, "involving the journalistic standards used in 
producing her column," the newspaper said Tuesday night. Gerber's "On the Town" 
column was run on a free-lance basis. This month she reported a rumor that 
Winfrey had returned home unexpectedly and caught her boyfriend in a tryst with 
her hairdresser. Winfrey issued a strongly worded denial on her nationally 
syndicated show. Gerber reportedly said in a subsequent television interview 
that she had no confirmation for the rumor but ran the item because it was 
being talked about. Claudia Puig

HOWARD ROSENBERG: NEWSCASTS TOOTING THEIR OWN HORNS -- THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

All the news that's fit to air? 
</P>
<P>
Shame on KABC-TV Channel 7 and KNBC Channel 4 -- one for reporting non-news, 
the other for non-reporting. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, Channel 7 has taken a back seat to no Los Angeles TV station 
when it comes to blatantly using its news programs to promote its entertainment 
programs, especially in such ratings sweeps months as May. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition was again served Sunday when Channel 7 carved out a chunk of its 6 
p.m. newscast for a purported story on "Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica 
McClure," that night's movie on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was less a story than an outright promotion that featured excerpts 
from the movie and interviews with some of the stars, including Pat Hingle, who 
promised viewers that Jessica's was a terrific story. Hold the presses for that 
objective critique. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 7 later followed through with the second half of the equation by also 
using its 6 p.m. newscast to advertise interviews with Jessica's parents and a 
feature on the making of "Everybody's Baby" -- all scheduled for its 11 p.m. 
newscast following the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Newscast plus movie plus newscast equals ratings: You use your newscast to 
advertise your movie and your movie to advertise your newscast. Very cute. 
</P>
<P>
And very cynical. 
</P>
<P>
That same night, meanwhile, Channel 4 ran an extensive story on the local Emmys 
-- its local Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 4 did lead the pack, picking up 13 awards. Among the awards that it 
omitted reporting, however, was the most coveted one of all, the one that 
KCBS-TV Channel 2 won for the best regularly scheduled local newscast. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, however, Channel 4 does earn the award for dishonest, infantile 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
That Channel 2 ranks third in the local news ratings -- despite being ranked 
first in local news by the Emmy voters -- is not surprising. TV news continues 
as a celebrity medium, primarily living or dying by its news faces, not by its 
news coverage. Channel 4 rose to No. 1 in news ratings by rising to No. 1 in 
news entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Channel 2 doesn't also play the news faces game, only that its news 
faces are not winning the popularity contest. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe May Co. senses the profitability of popular news faces -- witness its 
print ad campaign featuring the beaming faces of Channel 4 anchors, so far 
including John Beard, Kelly Lange, Linda Alvarez, Kent Shocknek and Carla 
Aragon. The anchors peer at readers from TV sets. They aren't named, but May 
Co. seems to be counting on their familiar faces needing no identification. 
</P>
<P>
A Channel 4 spokeswoman insisted that the ad does not imply an endorsement of 
May Co. She called the ad a "reciprocal promotional arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
Also very cute and cynical. TV anchors are used to sell TV sets and VCRs, and 
in return, Channel 4 and its anchors use May Co. to advertise themselves. News 
personnel, in effect, becoming commercial spokespersons? That's always been an 
unwritten no-no. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is no law against tackiness, the anchors are doing nothing 
illegal. If they want to allow their news reputations to be tied to product 
advertisements, that's between them and their employer. 
</P>
<P>
Well, you expect tackiness from some quarters. You don't expect it from 
anything involving Linda Ellerbee, one of the most genuine and genuinely 
likable people in the communications business. 
</P>
<P>
Ellerbee also is one of the brightest, funniest, most distinctive talents 
anywhere, electronic or print. Her commentaries on CNN are incisive, wittily 
irreverent and acutely on target. 
</P>
<P>
Her commentaries you look forward to. Her coffee commercials you don't. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. Among her multiple endeavors, Ellerbee is now also starring in 
commercials for Maxwell House coffee, paired in part with Mr. Dignity himself, 
Willard Scott of NBC's "Today" program. 
</P>
<P>
Ellerbee is in that gray area occupied by quasi-journalists still thought of as 
full-time journalists and consulted about journalistic issues. No longer 
regularly employed by a news organization (as she once was by NBC and ABC), 
however, she's ethically free to do what she wants. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is one of form. The problem is that Ellerbee doing a commercial 
here sounds a great deal like Ellerbee doing a commentary (a la Paul Harvey 
juxtaposing the two on radio). And when commercial and commentary run in 
reasonably close proximity on CNN -- as they sometimes do -- there's real 
potential for confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Not by accident, surely, for Maxwell House is no dummy. It didn't hire Ellerbee 
hoping she would be mistaken for Mrs. Olson. On the contrary, it hoped her 
credibility as a journalist/social commentator would rub off on its product. 
</P>
<P>
Reached in New York, Ellerbee was in a fighting mood, accusing her critics of 
"arrogance" in assuming that only they among viewers can distinguish between 
Ellerbee the journalist and Ellerbee the commercial spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell House had wanted to shoot the spots in a news setting, and only at her 
insistance did the company agree to switch to a set meant to resemble a talk 
show, Ellerbee said. "I've never done news on a set that looks like that," she 
said. "I guess I should have sat in a truck." 
</P>
<P>
Ellerbee said she signed with Maxwell House "for money. And it's worked out so 
well," she added, defiantly, "that I've just signed a long-term contract with 
the Khmer Rouge." The cosmetics people? 
</P>
<P>
News anchors, at least, have been seen as living, breathing, huffing celebrity 
advertisements for years: advertisements for the newscasts they front. 
</P>
<P>
The point is proved by Randy Reiss, executive vice president of the Walt Disney 
Studios, which is considering turning its recently acquired KHJ-TV Channel 9 
into an all-news station in prime time. That could make it a bright light. 
</P>
<P>
But around whom will an expanded Channel 9 news be built? 
</P>
<P>
Disney first thinks about hiring reporters, producers, editors, directors and 
other editorial personnel, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong! Disney first thinks about hiring anchors, those camera-tailored swells 
who have the least to do with shaping newscasts, but -- judging by their 
salaries -- the most to do with shaping ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Disney officials have been meeting with Channel 7 superanchor Jerry Dunphy and 
former Channel 7 anchor star Christine Lund, Reiss said recently. "You have to 
have the talent to staff those shows," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The light dims.

'SEA SHADOW,' 'REFLECTIONS' BY JOFFREY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Connoisseurs of cloying lyricism ought to adore the new Joffrey Ballet program 
of revived home-grown divertissements. 
</P>
<P>
Introduced Tuesday in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the bill provides a 
gallery of Terpsichorean goo, from the subaqueous kitsch of Gerald Arpino's 
"Sea Shadow" (1962) through the neoclassic platitudes of Arpino's "Reflections" 
(1971) to the leaden nostalgia of Robert Joffrey's "Remembrances" pas de deux 
(1973) -- plus the familiar overkill of Arpino's inescapable "Suite 
Saint-Saens" (1978). 
</P>
<P>
In each ballet, there's a fatal disassociation between sight and sound -- 
between hectic, flashy and arbitrary dance patterns and music that is much 
slower and which builds more steadily, seamlessly, organically to its crest. 
</P>
<P>
"Sea Shadow" was originally set to the second movement of Ravel's Piano 
Concerto in G, but when the Ravel estate refused to permit choreographers to 
use works not composed for dancing, Arpino substituted a commissioned score by 
Michael Colgrass. This season, the Ravel accompaniment has been restored, but 
the piece looks as unmusical as ever -- with the barechested Tom Mossbrucker 
uncurling under a pier to discover Valerie Madonia in a unitard, her hair down, 
desperate to be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Their exploratory relationship and the liquidity of the movement style suggest 
Robbins' "Afternoon of a Faun" with an undertow of Ashton's "Ondine." But the 
restless, generalized swoopings and surgings are hallmarks of nobody else but 
the terminally glib Gerald A. 
</P>
<P>
Mossbrucker and Madonia can't be faulted; they expertly deliver every gymnastic 
feat in this swoony charade, just as the three couples and four subsidiary 
women in "Reflections" endow the vacant bravura choreography with a sense of 
high occasion. But in this formal showpiece to Tchaikovsky's "Rococo" 
Variations, the emotionalism of the duets looks forced, superimposed in the 
same way that the virtuoso step combinations appear reflexive or off-the-rack. 
</P>
<P>
New to the previously reviewed "Remembrances" excerpt, Jodie Gates and Ashley 
Wheater danced with great freshness and fluidity. John Miner conducted 
authoritative performances of the Ravel and Tchaikovsky scores, with Stanley 
Babin the capable pianist in the former and cellist Nils Oliver superbly 
accomplished in the latter, except for the rough finale. LEWIS SEGAL

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: TRIPLE FEATURE IN FRENCH SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The French Revolution Bicentennial series, running at UCLA's Melnitz Hall, has 
a truly strange and enjoyable triple feature today. 
</P>
<P>
To begin at the bottom: Richard Pottier's 1951 "Caroline Cherie" is a naughty 
travesty, but an interesting one. Based on the Cecil St. Laurent best seller, 
and scripted by French playwright Jean Anouilh, it's another of those 
heavy-breathing tales where a loose heroine in a tight bodice sleeps or flirts 
her way all through a historical epoch, until true love rears its unlikely 
head. As aristocrat teen-ager Caroline, Martine Carol -- whose reign as 
France's premier blonde sex kitten preceded Brigitte Bardot's -- pouts and 
slithers, strips to a chemise and rolls provocatively under the sheets, while 
dastardly rebels and fat cads keep trying to seduce or guillotine her. 
</P>
<P>
The 1949 "The Black Book" sounds formidable. Anthony Mann -- master of the 
moody '40's gangster film before he turned to Westerns in the '50's -- 
reconceived the Terror as a gangland war, and shot it as a period film noir. 
Aiding him were the nonpariel noir cinematographer John Alton ("T-Men," "Raw 
Deal"), scenarist Phillip Yordan ("Johnny Guitar") and, in an amazing casting 
coup, Richard Basehart as Robespierre ("Don't call me Max," he threatens, 
memorably.) 
</P>
<P>
In his day, Sacha Guitry's work was damned by cinema purists as stagy and 
static. No film is more susceptible to that complaint than the 165-minute 1954 
"Si Versailles m'etait Conte" ("Royal Affairs at Versailles"), shot almost 
entirely at Versailles, with a huge all-star French cast as most of the 
luminaries who, for several centuries, trod its halls: Jean Marais (Louis XV), 
Jean-Louis Barrault (Francois Fenelon), Orson Welles (Benjamin Franklin), 
Gerard Philippe (D'Artagnan), and Guitry himself, constantly seated or in a 
wheelchair, as the older Louis XIV. (Even Bardot shows up, as a 
lady-in-waiting.) 
</P>
<P>
Later Guitry admirers, such as Alain Resnais, tend to dislike the historical 
films; this version of "Versailles" is indeed constructed oddly. The Louis XV 
and Louis XIV scenes are taken out of sequence and placed at the end, for no 
sensible-looking reason. But there's still some fascination here. Guitry was a 
legendary actor-playwright of the French stage, and a fantastically prolific 
film maker as well. Even here, at 69, he retains his easy elegance. And, for 
its views of Versailles, for the astonishing cast members (with their carefully 
modulated, theatrically crisp readings), even for such weird moments as Edith 
Piaf, as the Woman of the People, storming the Bastille with song, the movie 
becomes a charming museum piece.

'POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST' CITED; 
</P>
<P>
BIG INVESTOR IN 1ST EXECUTIVE QUESTIONS SALE OF N.Y. UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major investor in First Executive Corp. expressed concern Wednesday about 
"potential conflicts of interest" in the Los Angeles-based firm's recent 
agreement to sell its New York insurance subsidiary for $460 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rosewood Financial Partners, leader of a Dallas group that controls 9.3% of 
First Executive, also questioned an "apparent inadequacy" of the price and said 
it might make a competing bid. 
</P>
<P>
Rosewood, a private investment concern, manages oil heiress Caroline Rose 
Hunt's nearly $1-billion fortune. Since last fall, Rosewood has been considered 
a potential suitor for First Executive, an insurance holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Its questions about the New York sale may foreshadow a lively annual meeting 
for First Executive on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered to First Executive's board, Rosewood said the 
relationship between First Executive and Medco Containment Services and their 
chief executives presented the potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
While the letter did not detail the relationship, public records show that 
First Executive owns 17% of Medco, whose chief executive is Martin J. Wygod, 
one the two buyers of New Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Wygod's partner in the purchase, is Leo M. Walsh Jr., former chief operating 
officer of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Carr, chief executive of the parent First Executive, commented Wednesday 
that the sale agreement announced May 3 contains a provision that allows for 
higher bids. He said Rosewood or anyone else is "welcome" to buy the New York 
firm at a higher price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May 30 Deadline 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the conflict-of-interest question, Carr said his firm's Medco 
holding is a matter of public record. He said the investment in Medco "turned 
out to be terrific" for First Executive. Asked if he knows Wygod well, Carr 
replied: "Yes, I do." He did not comment further on the Rosewood letter. 
</P>
<P>
Rosewood's letter noted that the New York sale agreement allows First Executive 
to terminate it if the company's board fails to approve it by May 30. Rosewood 
urged the board not to approve the transaction without obtaining a fairness 
opinion as to the price and other terms, conducting "a full and fair auction" 
for the property and "investigating fully any possible conflict of interest to 
make certain that all special relationships are fully disclosed." 
</P>
<P>
Rosewood said after reviewing the company's public report to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission on the sale, it does not believe that the company has 
disclosed all information needed to understand the proposed transaction. 
Rosewood asked for additional documentation. 
</P>
<P>
The letter asked a number of specific questions, including whether there were 
other bidders. In view of the significant amount of financing being provided to 
the buyers by First Executive, the letter asked if any consideration was given 
to an all-cash sale. 
</P>
<P>
Rosewood also said it believed that the proposed sale would be an appropriate 
matter for review by a stockholder committee that would be established under a 
stockholder's proposal. It is to be voted on at the June 30 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive is listed among the top 15 U.S. life insurance firms, with 
$17.7 billion in assets. It has been the subject of controversy because of its 
large investment in high-risk "junk" bonds obtained through Drexel Burnham 
Lambert, which has pleaded guilty to criminal violations of federal securities 
laws.

Idled Acres Go Back to Work: Farmers are putting millions of idled crop acres 
back to work this year, according to sign-up figures for 1989 commodity 
programs announced by the Agriculture Department. Under this year's programs, 
farmers will idle 29.2 million acres, little more than half of the 54.2 million 
acres contracted to be taken from crop production under the 1988 programs, 
officials said. Despite the decline from last year, the prospective 1989 idled 
acreage would represent an area larger than the state of Pennsylvania.

A total of $8.77 billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling $27.78 
billion.

Big Award by Panel: The National Assn. of Securities Dealers said an 
arbitration panel has ordered that Nancy L. Cooper, 42, of Atlanta be paid $1 
million by broker D. Elliott Dahle Jr. and $2.1 million by Shearson Lehman 
Hutton Inc., his former employer. Cooper charged that Dahle traded in her 
account to generate commissions -- a process called "churning" -- and breached 
his fiduciary duty, purchased stock on credit without her permission and bought 
investment products that were unsuitable.

ZALE, IN SEARCH OF NEW MARKETS, WILL BUY GORDON JEWELRY CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Zale Corp., the nation's largest jewelry chain, moved Wednesday to conquer new 
regions and younger markets, saying it will buy No. 2 Gordon Jewelry Corp. for 
$310.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Privately held Zale is offering $36.75 a share for Houston-based Gordon, a 
chain with more than 600 stores. The new company will have more than 2,000 
stores and annual sales of $1.3 billion, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon shares shot up $6.375 to $36.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, a gain 
of 21%. The stock was already trading at record levels because of takeover 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
The deal will enhance Zale's status among young buyers and in different 
regions, analysts said, citing Gordon's younger customers and its presence in 
states where Zale is weak, including Minnesota, Indiana and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of Gordon's stores sell modern, moderately priced jewelry, 
almost exclusively in shopping malls. The remainder are traditional, upper-end 
stores that operate under different names in each market. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a positive move for Zale -- a good strategic move to grow their business 
in highly fragmented industry dominated by independents," said analyst Nancy 
Self of Burns Fry Ltd. in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the world's largest jewelry retailer must fight on a mall-by-mall basis," 
Self said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$900 Million in Sales 
</P>
<P>
The merged company will also have greater clout in purchasing jewelry and more 
freedom to cut overhead costs, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, in terms of numbers, they will be able to capitalize on their market 
position," said George Hartman, an analyst in the Toronto firm of Brown 
Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
Zale, based in Irving, Tex., has more than 1,300 stores and annual sales of 
more than $900 million, analysts said. Zale is equally owned by Toronto-based 
Peoples Jewellers Ltd. and Switzerland's Swarovski International Holding AG. 
</P>
<P>
Zale officials were not available to comment on the fate of Gordon stores that 
compete directly with Zale. 
</P>
<P>
"My inclination is to expect them to use the Gordon stores under the Gordon 
name to compete in different segments," Self said. "The Gordon stores attract a 
different customer." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon earned $6.2 million on sales of $389.6 million last year. The company 
said April 10 that it was considering options to enhance shareholder value, 
including a possible sale. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Chief Executive Daniel Gordon said in a statement: "We believe the 
transaction provides excellent value for our stockholders and are extremely 
pleased with the result." 
</P>
<P>
Zale already owns about 4.2% of Gordon and will launch a tender offer for the 
rest of the company. Owners of about 54% of Gordon's shares have already agreed 
to sell to Zale, Gordon said.

<P>
The stock market shook off an early slump as a modest, late rally just overcame 
the investor profit taking that had held stocks lower for most of the day. The 
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed up 5.86 points at 2,483.87. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 8 to 7 in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 178.60 million shares, down from 
187.69 million in Tuesday's session. 
</P>
<P>
Blue chips began the day lower as investors took profits on the market's recent 
rally and only started to edge onto higher ground in late afternoon trading 
following a rally in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts expressed surprise at how little the stock market has sold off 
following last week's climb, which took the Dow industrials above 2,500 for the 
first time since October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a consolidation day," said Philip Roth of Shearson Lehman Hutton. "Given 
the fact that the market has had such a big run, it's not giving up a lot of 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the market is holding remarkably well," said Trude Latimer of 
Josephthal &amp; Co. "It should be coming down, but it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market was trendless for most of the day, with some investors 
taking profits amid mostly balanced buying and selling. Late in the day, 
however, traders said selling dried up. 
</P>
<P>
"The market was pretty uneventful overall," said Eugene Peroni, technical 
analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. "The perceptions were mixed with respect 
to what the Fed is going to do." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the interest was in stocks thought to be potential takeover targets," 
Peroni said. "But there really was not any one focal point for the market 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's session focused on activity in the currency markets, with stocks 
declining amid speculation over whether the Federal Reserve would push U.S. 
interest rates lower to stem the rising dollar or whether Japan would raise its 
discount rate to support the falling yen. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts said Wednesday that despite earlier concerns that the dollar 
might be rising too fast -- which could have negative implications for the U.S. 
trade deficit -- the market continued to view the stronger dollar as an overall 
positive. The dollar strengthened further against the Japanese yen and major 
European currencies on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Market activity is expected to slow over the next two days going into the long 
Memorial Day weekend and then resume an upward trend next week, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
208.58 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Avon Products added 1 1/8 to 35 7/8 
on speculation that the cosmetics company may be the target of a hostile bid 
from Irwin L. Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Oil stocks also showed broad-based gains, with Texaco up 1 to 55 5/8, Exxon 1/8 
higher to 43 3/4 and Chevron up 7/8 to 56. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of Gordon Jewelry jumped 6 3/8 to 36 1/8 after Zale Corp. said it signed 
a definitive merger pact to acquire Gordon for $36.75 a share in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Merck continued to decline, losing 1 1/8 to 68 7/8. Other weaker drug stocks 
were Eli Lilly, off 3/8 to 55 7/8, and Warner-Lambert, down 1/4 at 88. 
</P>
<P>
IBM gained 1/4 to 109 3/4, Prime Computer rose 1 to 16 3/8, and Digital 
Equipment slipped 2 1/2 to 92 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Communications, meanwhile, fell 1/2 to 51 3/8, Ford fell 3/4 to 47 3/8, 
and Union Carbide lost 1/8 to 27 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stock prices closed mixed in sluggish trading as investors awaited a 
rise in the discount rate to counter the dollar's recent surge. Despite the 
worries, the Nikkei 225-share index closed up 35.21 points at 33,851.82, after 
dropping 251.25 points Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices fell sharply on the London Stock Exchange following a rise in key 
British lending rates. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 18.9 points, or 
0.9%, to close at 2,132.7. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar resumed its climb against all key currencies except the British 
pound and Swiss franc, breaking the 143-yen level overseas and hitting a 1 
1/2-year high against the Japanese currency in domestic trading. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a train. You can't step in front of it or you'll get run over," said 
one investment banker, Jay Goldinger of Beverly Hills-based Capital Insight. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gold prices were up domestically after losing in Europe and rising 
in Hong Kong. Republic National Bank of New York said the late bid for an ounce 
of gold was $362.40, up 55 cents from Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said trading was volatile here and overseas, with the dollar 
starting out weak after a mixed performance Tuesday but ending stronger in the 
absence of significant central bank intervention or signs of policy changes 
geared toward stabilizing exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
The British government boosted interest rates, which helped the sagging pound. 
But dealers said there was no indication that either West Germany or the United 
States would change their rates, and they said that helped strengthen the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the dollar firmed after reports of West German Bundesbank 
officials dismissing speculation that they would hold an emergency 
policy-setting meeting to possibly raise interest rates to support the mark. 
</P>
<P>
After concerted central bank intervention Tuesday and dollar selling by the 
Bank of Japan on Wednesday, no central bank besides the Bank of England was 
evident in the European open market Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures prices climbed on the New York Mercantile Exchange, reflecting 
increased confidence that the OPEC nations will agree on production quotas for 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, grain and soybean prices drifted lower, precious metals 
finished mixed, and livestock and pork prices plunged. 
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation in the energy market that the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries would be unable to agree at its June meeting on 
production quotas for the second half of the year. There is greater confidence 
now, reflected in prices, that an agreement will be reached, said Robert Baker, 
an energy analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 44 cents to 62 cents higher, with the 
contract for delivery in July at $19.66 a barrel; heating oil was 1.75 cents to 
2.11 cents higher, with June at 49.61 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 
1.13 cents to 2.59 cents higher, with June at 66.83 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures drifted lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain 
continued to fall in growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of the new-crop corn and soybeans were reflecting enhanced soil 
moisture," said Ted Mao, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures suffered as some private forecasts suggested that the National 
Weather Service 6- to 10-day outlook will indicate above-normal rain in crop 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat prices were up with news from exporters that Egypt bought about 300,000 
metric tons of U.S. soft red winter and soft white wheat. 
</P>
<P>
Corn prices were down but higher than the day's low because of technical 
support and spillover from a rally in soybean futures. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices edged lower in what analysts called a technical consolidation in 
response to the market's recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 1/8 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 in 
face amount, while its yield, which moves inversely to its price, rose to 8.62% 
from 8.61% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The market has to sort of consolidate at these new levels and maybe give a 
little ground before it can move higher," said Nancy Vanden Houten, a money 
market economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brusca, chief economist with Nikko Securities Co. International, said 
that despite the small decline, the market showed continued strength. 
</P>
<P>
"The bond market started out the day sort of in the hole, but for the most part 
it dug itself out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brusca noted that both the credit and stock markets have been strong lately, 
"and we're seeing bonds and stocks holding up at very high levels." 
</P>
<P>
Both analysts said bond traders largely shrugged off a new round of interest 
rate hikes in Britain. The Bank of England increased its key lending rate a 
full percentage point to 14%, and British commercial banks subsequently raised 
their prime lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.75%, up from 9.68% late Tuesday.

Crude oil futures prices rose sharply in brisk trading Wednesday, a reaction to 
tight inventories reported by the American Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West Texas 
Intermediate, the key U.S. crude, ended at $19.66 a 42-gallon barrel, up 62 
cents after a 43-cent gain Tuesday. The June contract expired Monday and 
finished at $20.93, with a gain of 33 cents from Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of crude oil contracts for delivery after July all posted sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale home heating oil for 
delivery in June rose 2.11 cents to 49.61 cents a gallon after rising 0.52 cent 
on Tuesday. The June contract for unleaded gasoline rose 2.59 cents to 66.83 
cents following Tuesday's gain of 0.34 cent. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said prices rallied early on the inventory figures, which were 
released after the market closed on Tuesday. The API reported a 
3.13-million-barrel decline in U.S. crude oil inventories in the week ended May 
19, indicating high demand and usage. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline stocks fell 2.61 million barrels and heating oil inventories declined 
1.58 million barrels for the week, the institute reported. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. said supply reductions from the North Sea due 
to high winds that hindered repair work on rigs boosted the London market 
Wednesday and carried over to New York. He said North Sea supply was off 31% 
for the week ended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices were given a boost by added demand as the Memorial Day holiday 
weekend approaches, said Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E. D. &amp; F. Man 
International Futures Inc.

The European Parliament on Wednesday adopted proposals for a law that would cut 
the number of U.S. television programs shown in Europe, despite intense 
lobbying from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law will most likely be adopted by the governments of the 12 
European Community members at a meeting in Luxembourg June 14. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was designed to coordinate broadcasting regulations in the EC and 
includes provisions to reserve a majority of transmission time to European 
works and to limit the amount of advertising allowed on television. 
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians adopted a strongly worded amendment to try to ensure that at 
least 50.1% of entertainment programs broadcast be European-produced by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Carla A. Hills, the U.S. trade representative, sent a letter to Lord 
Plumb, president of the European Parliament, to express Washington's strong 
objections to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"The enactment of such a measure is unjustifiable and would almost certainly 
have a disastrous effect on the U.S. industry's substantial European earnings," 
Hills wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever benefits this television directive might promise to bring to Europe 
will undoubtedly be outweighed by its extremely negative impact on our 
bilateral trade relations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hills warned that if the measure were adopted, she would "have no choice but to 
consider how to proceed in response to it under . . . 'Super 301' provisions." 
</P>
<P>
These provisions allow the United States to issue a list of nations that have 
erected the most harmful barriers against U.S. products. The Administration 
would have 18 months to negotiate the removal of the barriers, and, if it 
failed, it could slap 100% levies on imports from these trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the U.S. delegation said legislators had listened to their arguments 
but said the TV law was "a matter of political concern." 
</P>
<P>
The measure is part of steps being taken by the European Community in its drive 
to form a single market by the end of 1992.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
1990 BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House passed, 241 to 185, the conference report on House Resolution 106 
giving Congress spending, revenue and deficit targets for the fiscal year 
beginning Oct. 1. The Senate followed suit and HR 106 is now in effect. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal plan was developed by the Republican White House and Democratic 
Congress. It formalizes President Bush's pledge of no new taxes but projects 
$5.3 billion in largely unspecified new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The plan assumes spending of $1.17 trillion, revenue of $1.07 trillion and a 
deficit within the Gramm-Rudman law's $100-million target. All sides conceded 
it avoids tough fiscal decisions and that its goal of a $100-million deficit is 
wishful thinking. Members looking for a bright spot said the agreement shows 
the President and Congress can work harmoniously toward fiscal goals. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the fiscal 1990 budget.

FAA DRAWS CRITICISM IN AIRLINER NEAR-MISS; 
</P>
<P>
AGENCY FAILED TO FIX TRAFFIC CONTROL PROBLEMS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO O.C. 
INCIDENT, NTSB SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Government safety officials said Wednesday that the Federal Aviation 
Administration's "failure to address and correct" air traffic control 
deficiencies and problems contributed to a narrow miss between two airliners 
over Orange County last February. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board said an investigation of the Coast 
Terminal Radar Approach Control, or TRACON, facility at the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air station showed that FAA management personnel had verified and 
documented these problems over the last 3 years, but had taken no remedial 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"The FAA's quality assurance and safety oversight of the (air traffic control) 
system . . . is inadequate and ineffective," the NTSB concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB also noted that an El Toro air controller's failure to alert Los 
Angeles air traffic controllers of an approaching airliner led to the narrow 
miss of the two aircraft over Westminster in February. 
</P>
<P>
While not responding specifically to most of these criticisms, the FAA stated 
Wednesday that it has already undertaken a series of projects designed to 
correct any problems at Coast TRACON. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County facility helps direct traffic to and from Los Angeles 
International, Ontario, John Wayne and Long Beach airports through some of the 
most heavily traveled air corridors in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB investigation was launched in response to the incident over 
Westminster about 7:10 p.m. on Feb. 13. Radar data showed that a British 
Airways Boeing 747 jetliner with 286 passengers on board was climbing out of 
LAX, en route to London, when it passed within 2 miles of an American Airlines 
BAe-146B jet flying to Ontario at the same altitude with 70 people aboard. FAA 
rules require 3 miles of horizontal separation and 1,000 feet of vertical 
separation. 
</P>
<P>
A controller at Los Angeles TRACON, which had been tracking the 747, warned the 
British pilot that there was other traffic in the area and the pilot made a 
quick turn to avoid the other plane. Both aircraft continued on to their 
destinations without incident. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB concluded that the near-miss occurred "because of incomplete and 
misunderstood coordination between controllers at LAX Center and Coast TRACON 
and because . . . controllers at coast TRACON failed to comply with provisions 
of letters of agreement between Coast TRACON and adjacent facilities." 
</P>
<P>
The board singled out the Los Angeles controller for praise, commending his 
"immediate and decisive actions" to warn the 747 pilot. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the board noted that the Coast TRACON controller cleared the 
American Airlines plane to fly into airspace delegated to the Los Angeles 
facility without properly notifying Los Angeles controllers that he had done 
so. 
</P>
<P>
The unnamed controller was temporarily removed from his or her post, retrained, 
retested and then returned to the same position, where the controller was 
closely monitored for 30 days, according to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
Among the "numerous deficiencies and problems" cited by the board were 
"inadequate controller staffing, excessive use of overtime . . . and inadequate 
size and poor physical condition of the operational quarters" at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"Specifically, the facility is run down, noise from military jets is a problem, 
rotary phone equipment is out of date and inadequate and the facility manager 
questions the health hazards of the environmental control system," the NTSB 
said. "Controllers have been working scheduled overtime since 1985 (and) 6-day 
workweeks are required 66% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Error Rates Compared 
</P>
<P>
During 1988, seven controller errors were committed by Coast TRACON personnel, 
which worked out to 1.31 errors for every 100,000 flight operations. By 
comparison, the NTSB said, error rates during the same period at other 
facilities included 0.56 at Seattle TRACON, 0.56 at Ontario TRACON and 0.17 at 
Sacramento TRACON. 
</P>
<P>
The board concluded that these safety problems warrant "immediate action and 
corrective actions by the FAA to prevent a diminished level of safety in the 
high traffic density of the Southern California Basin area." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Ferrar, an FAA spokesman in Washington, said Wednesday that his agency 
already has begun a long-range program, "planned and developed over the past 
several years," to renovate and modernize the Coast TRACON facility. 
</P>
<P>
Admitting a "significant staffing problem," which he said was largely due to 
the high cost of living in the Orange County area, Ferrar said the FAA has 
begun a concerted recruitment program to attract more controllers. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Moore, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. local at 
Coast TRACON, was in Washington on Wednesday preparing his testimony for a 
congressional panel investigating air safety. 
</P>
<P>
Moore agreed that part of Coast TRACON's inability to attract more controllers 
is the high cost of living in Orange County, and he said he supports an FAA 
plan to pay a 20% salary bonus to controllers at 11 FAA facilities around the 
country, including Coast TRACON. 
</P>
<P>
Moore added that "it's no coincidence" that the FAA has announced a delay in 
two air safety projects involving Coast TRACON due to a lack of controllers at 
the same time the NTSB findings were made public. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that the two air safety projects -- one creating a radar control 
zone around John Wayne Airport and the other rerouting air traffic throughout 
the region -- would increase the workload at Coast TRACON from 530,448 flight 
operations in 1988 to more than 1 million a year by mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
"The NTSB did not exaggerate the problem," Moore said. "We are understaffed. 
The manager at Coast TRACON recently picked 10 new controllers from 25 
applicants, and I know that eight of the 10 won't take the job unless they get 
the extra 20% pay incentive." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said the FAA remodeled the employee lounge at the facility 2 years ago, 
but the NTSB still found it intolerably small. 
</P>
<P>
Now, said Moore, the FAA is planning to install a 24-by-60-foot trailer next to 
the existing facility, to be used as an employee lounge and for two small 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Said Moore: "It's better than nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory overtime remains a problem, although it is not as bad as it was a 
year ago, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong. Overtime is great for the paycheck," he said. "But it's 
rough on family life."

SHORTAGE OF CONTROLLERS DELAYS WAYNE SAFETY ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Enforcement of a new air safety zone around John Wayne Airport has been delayed 
at least 2 months to allow time to hire more air traffic controllers at an 
already understaffed controllers' facility in El Toro, Federal Aviation 
Administration officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the new Airport Radar Service Area, or ARSA, in which pilots 
must be in two-way radio communication with air traffic controllers, is being 
postponed from July 27 to some time after Sept. 21, according to FAA 
spokeswoman Elly Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, most aircraft fly through the area using "see and be seen" visual 
flight rules. 
</P>
<P>
Working conditions at the FAA's Coast Terminal Approach Radar Control facility 
in El Toro were strongly criticized Wednesday in a report by the National 
Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB staff conducted a 3-month study of 
near-misses blamed on controller errors, including a Feb. 13 incident in which 
a British Airways jumbo jet nearly collided with an American Airlines jetliner 
over Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Coast TRACON has been understaffed for several years, with controllers there 
working mandatory overtime shifts. There has been a national shortage since the 
air controllers strike in the early 1980s. But Orange County, in particular, 
has had difficulty attracting people because of the high cost of living. The 
FAA proposes to remedy that with a proposed 20% salary bonus to controllers at 
11 FAA facilities around the country, including Coast TRACON. 
</P>
<P>
FAA officials announced plans for the new ARSA requirements last summer over 
the objections of some small-aircraft pilots, who said that they should not 
have to be in two-way communication when passing through the area. However, 
some pilots said that they appreciate controller guidance when flying through 
the area, but that requests for such assistance often are turned down due to 
controllers' lack of time. 
</P>
<P>
The new ARSA will cover a section of sky extending 10 miles north and south of 
the airport. The section's width varies from about 4 miles at its northern 
boundary, between Anaheim and Tustin, to about 15 miles at its southern 
boundary off the coast between Huntington Beach and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Various sectors within the section will have their own maximum and minimum 
altitude requirements. For example, within a 5-mile radius of John Wayne 
Airport, pilots must maintain two-way radio communication with air traffic 
controllers when flying at altitudes below 4,400 feet. But 7 miles west of the 
airport, the requirement applies only to pilots flying at altitudes ranging 
from 2,500 feet to 5,400 feet. 
</P>
<P>
An ARSA is not as restrictive as a Terminal Control Area, in which pilots must 
have permission from air traffic controllers before entering specific zones 
that are identified on pilots' air navigation charts. 
</P>

contact vary in different sectors of the zone, as shown. THOMAS PENIX / Los

CAPITOL BARGAINING ON HIGHWAYS FAVORS O.C. TOLL ROAD PLAN

<P>
Allowing private companies to build and finance toll roads in California has 
become a new option in legislative negotiations over a 10-year plan for easing 
congestion in the state's highway system, possibly including two tollway 
projects aimed at relieving congestion on two Orange County freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said that, as a concession to Republicans, 
Democratic negotiators are considering offering their support for a measure by 
Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville) which would permit private groups to 
build and operate transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we're looking at and it's a serious consideration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials said Wednesday that Baker's proposal is linked, in 
part, to recent interest among authorities in Los Angeles and San Bernardino 
counties who have been promoting two potential toll road projects to relieve 
the severely congested Orange and Riverside freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Those same Orange County officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
that Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum and a San Bernardino County 
official have been trying to garner private support for toll roads into Orange 
County. They said Schabarum favors a route through Tonner Canyon, while San 
Bernardino County prefers Soquel Canyon. Both are in Chino Hills north of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said the toll road proposal would be part of an overall agreement that is 
being hammered out by legislative leaders and Gov. George Deukmejian on a plan 
to finance $20 billion in transportation improvements over the next decade. The 
plan includes proposals for a gasoline tax increase and a hike in truck weight 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, private construction and operation of toll roads as part of the 
state highway system has been prohibited by California law. In 1987, the 
Legislature authorized three toll road projects in Orange County but specified 
that two newly created local government agencies would oversee both the 
construction and financing. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said his proposal would allow the California Department of Transportation 
to enter agreements with private business to construct and lease transportation 
facilities which could include everything from bridges to roads and urban 
interchanges to elevated traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"We've left it open," he said. "I don't have a specific project in mind." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would be limited to authorizing only three projects -- one each 
in Northern and Southern California and a third in an area yet to be specified. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the project, Baker said it would have to be built to state 
specifications and with specific approval by Caltrans because "we wouldn't just 
want a road to nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Private companies entering agreements with the state, he said, would be 
permitted to impose tolls on the new facilities to pay for construction and 
provide them with a "reasonable" profit. 
</P>
<P>
Although he anticipated that tolls would be the most popular method of paying 
for the projects, he said the companies could propose other financing schemes. 
The private companies would operate the facilities for 35 years, at which point 
they would revert to the state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said private involvement is needed in state transportation projects 
because there is not enough public money to pay for all the projects needed. 
</P>
<P>
Such a plan for toll roads in northern Orange County would provide badly needed 
"relief valves" in an area where the borders of the three counties meet, an 
area for which little or no state highway money is available to build new 
highways, Orange County officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, they said that they have not been asked yet to support either the 
Tonner or Soquel Canyon projects, nor have they been approached by Orange 
County businesses interested in funding or building either link. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission already is studying the feasibility 
of building a proposed extension of the Orange Freeway as a toll road. But the 
study is not aimed specifically at the possibility of building the project with 
private funds. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway currently ends at the Garden Grove Freeway near Anaheim Stadium and 
would be extended along the Santa Ana River to the San Diego Freeway in 
Fountain Valley, at a cost exceeding $1 billion. No money is expected to be 
available for the project from the state or federal government, because such 
sources already have been tapped for other traffic improvements, including the 
massive Santa Ana Freeway widening project. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials said that although the Orange Freeway extension has not 
come up in discussions with Los Angeles and San Bernardino County officials, 
and is in no way connected with Wednesday's legislative developments, some 
talks have been held with Orange County developer Henry T. Segerstrom and the 
Reason Foundation, a Libertarian think tank in Santa Monica, about building the 
extension as a toll road. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the county transportation commission, 
said Wednesday that he welcomes the Assembly proposal, although he added that 
he has not discussed it with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no resistance to private toll roads," he said. "We need every kind of 
innovative funding technique we can get in this county. We should carefully 
look at the (Orange Freeway) extension and a new connection to San Bernardino 
County or Los Angeles County."

Orange County, added, "There are some areas where private financing may be the 
only way to build new highways. The location of those (proposed) routes -- 
Tonner Canyon and Soquel Canyon -- are in places where there is a great need 
but no money to do anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baker's legislative proposal has the strong backing of the 
Deukmejian Administration through Robert K. Best, director of Caltrans, who has 
argued that it would "give us the flexibility to supplement governmental funds 
with the resources and talent of private industry to bring additional projects 
in line." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), chairman of the Senate Transportation 
Committee, said that while he has consistently supported the "use of toll roads 
in theory," the plan may face strong opposition from some Democrats in the 
Senate.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
MAN, 18, ARRESTED IN STORE CLERK'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old Santa Ana man has been arrested in the death of a grocery store 
clerk who was shot and killed when he stepped out of a storeroom while a 
robbery was under way, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police said Anthony Onnett was taken into custody Tuesday afternoon 
and charged with robbery and one count of murder in the May 15 slaying of Jose 
Banda, 22, also of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Banda, a stock clerk at the Lucky Center Market on West 5th Street, was shot 
once in the head and killed instantly when he inadvertently walked into a 
robbery in progress, said police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Onnett allegedly walked into the grocery store armed with 
a sawed-off .22-caliber rifle, robbed the owner at gunpoint and then demanded 
money from the cash register. As the robbery was in progress, Thomas said, 
Banda came out of the back room and was shot at a distance of about 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said Onnett escaped on foot but was spotted Tuesday by a police officer 
in downtown Santa Ana. He was arrested at 3:30 p.m. and the alleged murder 
weapon was later recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said Onnett was also wanted for robbery in Garden Grove and that he was 
an escapee from an Orange County juvenile facility. Onnett was being held in 
Orange County jail.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRVINE; 
</P>
<P>
CITY WANTS TO APPEAL DENIAL OF ROAD FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has directed the city attorney to begin exploring an appeal of 
the county's recent decision to deny Irvine its $4-million share of county 
highway funds. The council also directed the city manager to set up a meeting 
between county and city officials to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors last week voted to deny Irvine its share of 
state gas tax money because county officials say the city's road improvement 
plans are not compatible with the county's master plan for roads. Laguna Beach 
is the only other Orange County city to have been denied gas tax money by the 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Agran defended the city's improvement plans Tuesday night and said 
the county decision was unfair. "I don't intend to beg Supervisor (Thomas F.) 
Riley in this matter," Agran said. "The county made a mistake. I'll help them 
rectify it. . . . I don't intend to sit there and listen to the county berate 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Agran added that he would like to meet with County Administrative Officer Larry 
Parrish, who criticized the mayor personally in the dispute. City Manager 
William Woollett Jr. offered to meet Parrish in Irvine, where the county 
official lives, and jokingly added, "We have already cut his water off."

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GARDEN GROVE; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S TIME FOR A MERRY OL' BERRY FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The strawberry fields that once transformed Garden Grove into a green patchwork 
quilt every spring have given way to urban density, but that heritage will be 
celebrated this week at the 31st Annual Garden Grove Strawberry Festival. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, which draws about 250,000 visitors each year, begins at 1 p.m. 
Friday at Village Green park near the Civic Center and continues through Monday 
evening. It offers free entertainment, 40 carnival rides and more than 100 
food, game and commercial booths and exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
California's largest strawberry shortcake will be carved up and served to 
several thousand visitors Friday evening. On Saturday morning, the annual 
Strawberry Festival Parade will feature television celebrities and will be 
broadcast live on KHJ-TV Channel 9. A strawberry-pie eating contest will be 
held Sunday and a "Redhead roundup," in which prizes will be awarded for the 
reddest hair and the most freckles, is set for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The event has raised $1.5 million for charities since 1966, festival president 
Dick Miller said. Last year, the festival gave $100,000 to the city for the 
restoration of the Mills House, a civic art gallery and community meeting 
place. The festival also donated $25,000 each to the Grove Theatre Company of 
Garden Grove and Ronald McDonald House in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Although strawberry cultivation in Garden Grove -- once promoted as the 
strawberry capital of the world -- has dwindled to only 44 acres, strawberries 
continue to be an important crop in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 20 years, strawberry acreage has increased from 1,372 acres in 
1967 to 2,498 acres in 1987, said John Ellis, deputy agricultural commissioner 
for Orange County.

PHYSICS PROGRAM TO AID HIGH SCHOOL INSTRUCTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An intensive physics program designed to help high school instructors teach the 
principles of superconductivity, fusion, lasers and other technologies will 
open June 26 at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The teaching institute, paid for with a $475,500 grant from the National 
Science Foundation, will be directed by Roger Nanes, physics professor; John W. 
Jewett, acting chairman of the physics department at Cal Poly Pomona, and 
William H. Leader, physics teacher at Loara High School in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two teachers from Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties will participate in the 2-year program to enhance their knowledge of 
modern physics and sharpen teaching skills. The teachers will attend 4-week 
sessions during 1989 and 1990 and take part in monthly lecture sessions and 
three conferences during each academic year. 
</P>
<P>
"The project is aimed at helping to alleviate the severe problem that exists 
nationwide in high school physics today," Nanes said. "Most high school 
instructors who teach physics have little or no formal training in the subject 
and so are struggling to get by in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, many students who have taken high school physics classes 
arrive at college poorly prepared for higher-level work, Nanes said. 
</P>
<P>
Each teacher will receive a $1,380 annual stipend for attending the institute.

FURTHER USE OF KRAFT'S LIST ATTACKED; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE SAYS JURY WILL JUST ASSUME HE KILLED 8 OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A defense lawyer argued Wednesday that the jury automatically will assume Randy 
Steven Kraft is guilty of eight more murders if prosecutors are allowed to 
introduce any new entries from his handwritten list. 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution won't need to present any other evidence," William J. Kopeny 
said. "The jurors already believe that it is a death list." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution, which calls the list Kraft's "score card" of his victims, was 
permitted to introduce 13 of its coded entries when Kraft was convicted two 
weeks ago of 16 Orange County murders. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown wants to use more items from the list in 
seeking a death verdict at Kraft's upcoming penalty hearing. They are part of 
the evidence he wants to use to prove Kraft committed six murders in Oregon and 
two in Michigan between 1980 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Link to 45 Murders 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have linked the 44-year-old Long Beach computer consultant to a 
total of 45 sex-related murders of young men, partly by connecting them to the 
list found in his car. But Brown has elected to introduce just the out-of-state 
murders -- plus those for which Kraft was convicted -- at the next hearing. 
</P>
<P>
At a penalty phase, prosecutors are allowed to introduce into evidence other 
acts of violence they claim that a defendant has committed, even if he has 
never been convicted of those crimes. Jurors are instructed that if they are 
not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed these 
acts, they are to put them out of their minds in deciding the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
But because this jury is already sold on the prosecution's theories, Kopeny 
argued, the mere introduction of these murders is all the prosecutor needs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is totally ridiculous to assume that those jurors could put it out of their 
minds" in a case this unique, Kopeny argued. 
</P>
<P>
Kopeny called the list "the centerpiece of the prosecution's case" at the guilt 
trial. It was the key reason Kraft was convicted on every single murder in the 
charges, Kopeny said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unfair and Prejudicial' 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer argued that even if Kraft's lawyers could convince the jury 
that the new entries do not represent the Oregon and Michigan victims, the 
damage would be done. Since the jurors already believe that it is a death list, 
he said in his court papers, then the jurors will think that Kraft must have 
killed eight more people somewhere, even if it was not in Oregon and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"It is simply unfair and prejudicial," Kopeny stated. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, whom prosecutors say could be the most prolific serial killer in the 
country, shook his head Wednesday when Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin 
suggested that prosecutors were doing him a "favor" by not trying to put the 
entire list -- with its 61 entries -- into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin began hearing a battery of defense motions Wednesday on issues to be 
settled before jurors return June 5 to hear evidence. Kopeny filed four 
separate motions on the issue of the so-called death list alone. Most of the 
other motions are aimed at preventing Brown from introducing evidence of any 
more murders at all. 
</P>
<P>
Kopeny claims in his court papers that prosecutors are guilty of "piling on" by 
adding the eight new murders, since the jurors "are already convinced Mr. Kraft 
is a serial killer." 
</P>
<P>
"The jurors have already accepted 90% of Mr. Brown's theories about this case," 
Kopeny told the court. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty phase motions will continue today, then will resume again on June 1 
and 2.

ROOMMATE SAYS RAZO PROBABLY WAS AT HARVARD DURING HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Harvard University basketball player testified Wednesday that Jose Razo, his 
former roommate, was on the Cambridge, Mass., campus the day that one of the 10 
Orange County holdups that Razo is accused of committing occurred. 
</P>
<P>
However, under cross-examination, Neil Patrick Phillips acknowledged that he 
could not be positive that Razo, the alleged Ski Mask Bandit, was at Harvard on 
Feb. 1, 1987. Phillips testified in Superior Court in Santa Ana that to "his 
best recollection," Razo was still in Massachusetts on the date in question. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Harvard were taking a few days between semester finals during late 
January and early February, 1987, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm practicing (for the Harvard squad) during those winter months, and that 
day was the only opportunity I had to play basketball with Joe. He was very 
good, and we made notice of it," Phillips testified. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who is from Germantown, Md., roomed with Razo in 1986-87 during their 
sophomore year at Harvard. Phillips' testimony came during the 3rd day of the 
defense portion of Razo's trial, which began May 5 in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has charged Razo with committing 10 robberies, netting about 
$27,000 during his vacations and summer breaks from Harvard. Razo, 22, who was 
a football star and honors student at Anaheim's Servite High School, won an 
academic scholarship to Harvard and also played football there. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, Razo confessed to La Habra police that he had held up about a 
dozen stores in Orange and Los Angeles counties. All of the robberies coincided 
with times that Razo was known to be in California except for the Feb. 1, 1987, 
holdup. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravinder Mehta said Wednesday that it was possible that Razo 
flew back to California during the brief lull between semesters at Harvard in 
early February, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Razo, who spent his third day Wednesday on the witness stand, has repeatedly 
denied committing any of the robberies to which he has confessed. He said he 
was deranged from taking PCP -- phencyclidine and usually referred to as "angel 
dust" -- when he made the 1987 confessions. All of the crimes were committed by 
a childhood friend, Richard Longoria, Razo testified. Razo said Longoria told 
him the exact details of each robbery. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony on Wednesday, Razo said he falsely accused himself of robberies in 
1987 because he felt guilt for being successful while many of his Chicano 
friends were not. 
</P>
<P>
"In hindsight I now see that I was feeling very guilty about my Harvard 
experience -- my comfortable life style," Razo said. "I was feeling alienated 
from my family at home and Mexicans in general. I wanted to be accepted in a 
normal, everyday type of way in terms of the neighborhood and friends I had 
known. 
</P>
<P>
". . . I was wanting to truly identify with Richard (Longoria). I wanted to 
feel like him, like his type. . . There was a time I did believe I was the 
robber, and it didn't seem absurd to say that." 
</P>
<P>
Mehta has said outside of court that he believes that Razo "was reaching for a 
scapegoat" by naming Longoria as the real Ski Mask Bandit. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta said that investigators are trying to locate Longoria and that he may be 
subpoenaed to testify.

4 FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTORS TOPS LIST FOR U.S. ATTORNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four former federal prosecutors -- two of them Superior Court judges -- are 
considered the top contenders for possible nomination as U.S. attorney, the top 
federal law enforcement position in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to a special screening committee for U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.) said Wednesday that the four contenders are among a list of eight 
lawyers and judges that will be submitted to replace U.S. Atty. Robert C. 
Bonner, who was confirmed last week to a federal judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys Terry W. Bird, 43, and Donald C. Smaltz, 52, together with Judges 
Lourdes Baird, 53, and Alexander Williams III, 45, are believed to be at the 
top of the list about to be forwarded to Wilson, who makes recommendations on 
presidential appointments in California. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney oversees federal prosecutions and government legal actions 
throughout Los Angeles and the seven-county surrounding region, supervising a 
staff of 121 lawyers and handling prosecutions ranging from securities and bank 
fraud to narcotics, espionage and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Bonner, 46, had brought unprecedented visibility to the office since his 
appointment in 1984, personally overseeing the trial of the first FBI agent 
ever accused of spying and unleashing a wave of white-collar crime and defense 
procurement fraud prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to take the bench by late summer, after U.S. District Judge 
Pamela Ann Rymer's elevation to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. However, 
Justice Department officials said it is not likely that a permanent replacement 
will be confirmed until fall. In the meantime, the department will appoint an 
interim U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the screening process said the committee narrowed a larger 
list of applicants for the office to eight "serious" candidates, only four of 
whom were believed likely to win Wilson's endorsement: 
</P>
<P>
* Bird, a partner with the Westwood law firm of Bird, Marella, Boxer, Wolpert 
&amp; Matz, was an assistant U.S. attorney from 1972 to 1977, overseeing a task 
force that prosecuted fraud and corruption in federal housing programs. He left 
the office to head an investigation into cost overruns on the Alaskan Pipeline, 
then returned to Los Angeles to launch a law firm that now handles criminal and 
civil 
</P>
<P>
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
* Smaltz is a veteran trial lawyer with the firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; 
Bockius. An assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles from 1964 to 1966, Smaltz 
stayed on as a special assistant for another 2 years before moving to private 
practice. In his most recent high-profile case, he represented California 
Overseas Bank, under indictment in New York with former Philippine President 
Ferdinand Marcos for allegedly using funds embezzled from the Philippine 
treasury to buy U.S. real estate. 
</P>
<P>
* Baird is the only Democrat among the leading contenders for what is normally 
considered a political appointment. However, the fact that she is a Latina -- a 
native of Ecuador, she is fluent in Spanish -- makes her an attractive 
candidate, some sources said. A juvenile dependency judge on the Los Angeles 
Superior Court bench, Baird was hired as a federal prosecutor in 1976 and left 
to enter private practice 8 years later. In 1986, she was appointed to the 
Municipal bench, and elevated to the Superior Court last September. 
</P>
<P>
* Williams headed the narcotics unit for the U.S. attorney's office from 1975 
to 1979, then took over the Justice Department's narcotics and dangerous drug 
section. He returned about a year later to Los Angeles as chief assistant U.S. 
attorney, and served there until 1984, when he was appointed to the Superior 
Court. He now oversees criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
The screening committee also evaluated more than 30 applicants for the 
remaining federal judgeship in Los Angeles, to fill the vacancy left by U.S. 
District Judge Ferdinand F. Fernandez's recent elevation to the appeals court. 
</P>

PADRES NOT MAKING A HIT WITH THEIR FANS; 
</P>
<P>
THEY LEAD THE MAJORS IN STRIKEOUTS AFTER 13 MORE IN A 3-0 LOSS TO THE METS

<P>
Call it what you want. A fan, a whiff, a big fat K. The Padres are doing it in 
near-record numbers, and they are being booed for it. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres struck out 13 more times Wednesday night in a 3-0 loss to the New 
York Mets in front of a surly crowd of 26,766 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
It was the Padres' sixth shutout loss, second worst in baseball, but here's 
something worse than that: It was the Met pitching staff's first shutout since 
last Sept. 11, a span of 61 games. 
</P>
<P>
The futility clincher: The Padres lead all of baseball with 296 strikeouts in 
47 games. This puts them on a pace to strike out 1,018 times, or just a few bad 
hacks off the club record of 1,164 set in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Last season -- a happier, more relaxed time -- they struck out just 892 times. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing with strikeouts is unbelievable," Rob Nelson said after striking 
out twice. 
</P>
<P>
"Dumb, dumb," John Kruk said after striking out twice. "I don't know if we're 
trying to do too much or what. For me, it's just stupid hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst wasn't much happier. He threw another decent game 
Wednesday, allowing just two runs on seven hits over seven innings. He has a 
decent 3.66 ERA. But he has a 4-3 record and has not won since May 6, mostly 
because the Padres have averaged 3.3 runs per start, including two shutouts in 
the 10 games in which Hurst has pitched. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it was a 0-0 game, and their guys held them, and I didn't," said Hurst, 
who was beaten with Howard Johnson's RBI double in the fifth and the first 
homer of the season by rookie pinch hitter Mark Carreon in the seventh. The 
Mets scored their final run off reliever Greg Harris on Kevin McReynolds' fifth 
homer in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"The bats will come," Hurst said. "I've got to do my job." 
</P>
<P>
It's just that in doing their jobs, Met pitchers Ron Darling (seven strikeouts) 
and Rick Aguilera (six) had a little help from Padre hitters. 
</P>
<P>
What's the big deal about a strikeout? First let Nelson tell you. With runners 
on first and second in the sixth against Darling, Nelson ended the inning with 
a strikeout. In an attempt to get something going in the ninth against 
Aguilera, he struck out. Nelson now has 14 strikeouts in 40 at-bats, one every 
2.9 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a lack of concentration, and it's terrible," Nelson said. "You put 
the ball in play, three things have to happen for them to get you out. They've 
got to field it, throw it and catch it. That's three chances that they can boot 
it. When you strike out, you have no chance." 
</P>
<P>
What's the big deal about a strikeout? Ask Jack Clark, who had two more 
Wednesday. Both were in key situations, as they usually are simply because he 
bats cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the first, Tony Gwynn hit an apparent omen, a deep fly to 
center field that popped free from the outstretched glove of a running Mookie 
Wilson. A potential great catch turned into a great Padre break, a Gwynn 
triple. But up stepped Clark, and down stepped Clark with an inning-ending 
strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
Darling gave Clark trouble again in the fourth, after Gwynn hit a one-out 
single and moved to second on Darling's wild pitch. Clark worked the count to 
three and one but then swung and missed the next two pitches for another 
strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
All of this misfortunes dropped him into a zero-for-10 funk, which later became 
zero for 11 when he grounded out with two out and Gwynn on first in the eighth. 
Clark is now hitting .193 with six homers and 24 RBIs after 47 games. 
</P>
<P>
He is on a pace for 21 homers and 83 RBIs, which would probably please the 
Padres. And with runners in scoring position, he is still hitting 15 for 49 
(.306) with 15 RBIs, good numbers. 
</P>
<P>
But, oh, those strikeouts. He now has 54, which puts him on a pace for an 
186-strikeout season, three short of the major league record of 189 set by 
Bobby Bonds of San Francisco in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"I am just kind of lost to a certain point," said a disconsolate Clark 
afterward. "I've never been in this prolonged a slump. I've tried everything I 
know, and I'm still not there. All I can do is keep swinging." 
</P>
<P>
What's the big deal about a strikeout? Ask Gwynn who, although he was one of 
only two Padres (with Roberto Alomar) not to strike out Wednesday, felt the 
fury of the fans in center field. In the eighth inning, he needed to kick away 
a smoke bomb that landed near him. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to play baseball, I don't want to be a groundskeeper," Gwynn said. 
"I didn't want to get near it. When I went over there I said, 'What if this 
thing exploded?' But I booted it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Not only were there bombs Wednesday, there was also a baseball that came 
dangerously flying out of the stands in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that those were our fans or their fans," Padre Manager Jack 
McKeon said, noting the large number of Mets fans in attendance. "That stuff 
doesn't normally happen at our game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gwynn: "A smoke bomb in San Diego? You don't see that. Not here. Not from 
our fans. If they were our fans. There was a lot of stuff going on out there, 
there were a lot of Mets fans, and they were getting rowdy, and our fans were 
getting rowdy on them." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former Padre pitcher Keith Comstock, now with the club's triple-A Las Vegas 
team, has always been known as a prankster. But he recently outdid himself by 
posing for one of the most unusual baseball cards ever. In his card, which is 
part of the Las Vegas Stars' package, Comstock is pictured standing at the 
mound, arms outstretched, face scrunched up in pain -- with a baseball hitting 
him in the groin area. Yes, this is a real, circulated baseball card. "Don't 
laugh, I went to a lot of time and effort to put that together," Comstock said 
Wednesday night from Las Vegas. "I had to paste and glue the baseball on to 
that spot. Then I had to get the photographer to shoot it. He said he would, 
but he said it probably would never get printed. He was wrong." Comstock, 
already somewhat of a cult hero in the Padre clubhouse because he has been 
released by 10 different teams in five different countries, can now been seen 
pasted to several Padre lockers. In case you're wondering, Comstock is having a 
pretty good season -- 4-1, 3.21 ERA with team-high six saves entering Wednesday 
-- but says he hopes to be traded by late summer to an organization that would 
be interested in bringing him to the big leagues. At this point, the Padres are 
not. . . . The word out of Seattle is that the Mariners are going to do 
something soon with pitcher Mark Langston. But unless things quickly change, it 
looks as if that something won't be with the Padres. Mariner sources say that 
they no longer will take minor league catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. for Langston. 
They want starter Eric Show, plus two other starters, which few teams can 
afford to give up. Seattle is so disinterested in the Padres that nobody from 
the organization has even told Manager Jack McKeon what they will take.

POLES APART FROM SOFTBALL POLLS; 
</P>
<P>
VIRTUALLY IGNORED, MARINA'S VIKINGS REACH QUARTERFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of the softball season, Marina High School was not mentioned in the 
Southern Section 5-A polls while Sunset League co-champion Fountain Valley, 
which lost twice to the Vikings, made every poll and was ranked as high as 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Marina finally appeared in the final week of the poll, ranked No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley dominated the Orange County coaches' softball poll, holding 
down the top spot until the last week of the season, when it was bumped to 
second by Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Marina? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the Sunset League co-champion with Fountain Valley didn't appear in that 
poll until the final week, when the Vikings were ranked eighth, five spots 
below No. 3 Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Marina defeated the Monarchs, 2-1, in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Marina travels 2 1/2 hours north to Ventura County to take on 
fourth-seeded Thousand Oaks (24-5) in the quarterfinals at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Marina Coach Susie Calderon said she is unfazed that Marina (18-9) has not 
gained much respect in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem to bother the kids any either," she said. "I know to a lot of 
other coaches that really means a lot. I just tell the kids not to worry about 
it and to play our kind of ball, and if we happen to be on that list, fine. If 
not, we are not going to lose any sleep over it, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
If the Vikings lost any sleep, it was this morning. The team, holding with 
tradition, planned to have breakfast at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had this superstition with us," Calderon said. "When we played 
Fountain Valley, both times we went out to breakfast. But it is not by popular 
demand." 
</P>
<P>
That they have to travel more than two hours is, believe it or not, a good omen 
for Marina. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 playoffs, Marina traveled even farther, taking on Dos Pueblos in 
Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the Vikings traveled nearly 200 miles to Santa Barbara County to play 
Righetti of Santa Maria in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We always seem to lose the flip on those long rides," Calderon said. "The 
funny thing about it, though, is that against Righetti we went 19 innings and 
against Dos Pueblos it was 20 innings. We won both of them one-zip." 
</P>
<P>
Marina was hampered early in the season by injuries, which might account for 
its poor showing in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing with nine people for a long time and it was really scary," 
Calderon said. 
</P>
<P>
Backup pitcher and designated hitter Julie Muche (.230) missed the first half 
of the season with ligament problems in her elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Sandra Ross was sick on and off and had back problems. Left 
fielder Susan Walters broke her left leg sliding into third in nonleague play, 
and first baseman Annie Presutti started the season with a cast on her right 
foot from a basketball injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say we got over those injuries approaching halfway through league and 
things started to all fall together," Calderon said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all healthy now and the kids have a great attitude, great spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Marina is led by sophomore pitcher Willa Parchen (17-7), who has an earned-run 
average of 0.28 with 200 strikeouts and 60 walks in 162 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Ross leads the Vikings' offensive, batting .309, but third baseman Becky Toler 
(.193) has been coming on strong, getting key hits to start rallies for Marina. 
</P>
<P>
In other 5-A games today, Fountain Valley (19-6-1) plays at second-seeded 
Righetti (25-2). 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A, three of four South Coast League teams have survived the first two 
rounds of play. Mission Viejo (16-8), which upset top-seeded La Mirada Tuesday, 
plays at Montclair (23-4). San Clemente (19-12) is at Ramona (21-7), and 
third-seeded Irvine (20-7) is at home against Saugus (19-7).

CANYON HELD TO SINGLE HIT IN 4-0 LOSS TO DIAMOND BAR

<P>
Bonnie Ebenkamp pitched a one-hitter and Diamond Bar High School scored four 
runs in the ninth inning to defeat Canyon, 4-0, in the second-round of the 
Southern Section 4-A softball playoffs Wednesday at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar (23-2) was limited to three hits through eight innings by Canyon's 
Sara Roberts (10-3). Then in the ninth,Pam Barr lead off with a single to left. 
Barr beat Roberts' throw to second after Julie Hensel's bunt. Barr then beat 
Comanche third baseman Krissy Kyriazis to the bag on a fielder's choice to load 
the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Coach Lance Eddy then replaced Roberts with Kristin Heizer, who walked 
Theresa Zalweski to force home a run. Laura Kreps and Mindi Bloomenstein 
followed with one-run singles, and the fourth run came on second baseman 
Dalynne Large's throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (20-12), which got its only hit in the second inning on Maureen Del 
Mazzio's bunt single, got runners as far as second base three times in the game 
before Ebenkamp (12-1) shut down the Comanche threats. 
</P>
<P>
Ebenkamp, who struck out 12, walked only one. Three Comanches reached base on 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar, the 4-A's second-seeded team, will play Garden Grove, which 
defeated Crescenta Valley 2-1 Wednesday, in Friday's quarterfinals.

SUNNY HILLS TAKES STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sunny Hills High School boys' tennis team had advanced to the quarterfinals 
of the Southern Section 3-A playoffs for the past two seasons, a notable 
achievement to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
But this season, Sunny Hills is already one step beyond. The Lancers (21-1) 
play at Laguna Beach (20-3) in the semifinals at 3:15 p.m. today. The winner 
advances to the championship match next Wednesday against the winner of the 
Woodbridge-San Marino semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
"Figure we've been to the quarters two years in a row, it was just a matter of 
time," Sunny Hills Coach Steve White said. 
</P>
<P>
White hopes this will signal a return to the glory days of Sunny Hills tennis. 
In the 1970s, the Lancers were routinely among the best in the 4-A division. 
They were the 4-A runners-up in 1976 and '77. 
</P>
<P>
The past two Lancer teams were good, but when Hans Erkelens showed up before 
the school year, it gave this season's squad added depth. Erkelens, a senior 
foreign exchange student from Holland, plays at No. 2 singles and also has 
played doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that the unexpected improvement from doubles players James Choi and Brad 
Bosari and Sunny Hills has been able to advance to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"The other kids have been expected (to play well)," White said. "(Choi and 
Bosari) have filled in really well for us. They've given us some real balance 
in doubles." 
</P>
<P>
The "other kids" are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Glenn Henderson, the No. 1 singles player who "has lost three or four sets 
all year," according to White. He has been the No. 1 player for four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ryan Henderson, a sophomore and Glenn's younger brother, plays at No. 3 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Andrew Duncan and Jason Klingsberg play at No. 1 doubles. Choi and Bosari 
are at No. 2 doubles and Nathan Winn and Sameer Gavankar are at No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Doubles will be the Lancers' strength against Laguna Beach, which has one of 
the toughest singles lineups in the playoffs, regardless of division. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Leach, a sophomore, is Laguna Beach's No. 1 player and is the defending 
Southern Section singles player. He is 54-0 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just too powerful at singles," White said. "That's six points almost 
automatically." 
</P>
<P>
In the other 3-A semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
San Marino (20-3) vs. Woodbridge (18-4) at North Lake Tennis Club, Irvine: 
Top-seeded Woodbridge plays host to San Marino, the two-time defending 3-A 
champion. Singles players Randy Ivey and Alex Steinhart of Woodbridge have 
reached the semifinals for the second season in a row. Last season, the 
Warriors were beaten by Los Alamitos, which was beaten by San Marino in the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A semifinals: 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills (17-3) at Santa Barbara (23-0): Santa Barbara is top-seeded and 
unbeaten. Dana Hills tied with Newport Harbor, 9-9, in the quarterfinals and 
won on games, 73-72. The Dolphins are playing without top singles player 
Esteban Saba, who was suspended from the team for disciplinary reasons. Still, 
they've managed to get this far. Good doubles play, particularly from the No. 1 
team of Chris Stevens and David Roditi, helped Dana Hills get past Newport 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (19-4) at Beverly Hills (17-6): The Sea Kings also counted games 
to get past their quarterfinal opponent. They tied Camarillo, 9-9, but won on 
games, 92-88. Rich Han and Doug Schulein, the No. 1 doubles team, lead Corona 
del Mar. Beverly Hills, the second-seeded team, is led by No. 1 singles player 
Billy Wright and the No. 1 doubles team of Danny Roberts and John Parker.

RIVALS IN RUNNING TO EARN A MASTERS; 
</P>
<P>
NIELSEN WILL LINE UP AGAINST LAVELLE AGAIN IN FORMIDABLE 1,600-METER FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, Mike Nielsen played on the Mater Dei High School freshman 
basketball team with a tall, gangly kid named Eddie Lavelle. 
</P>
<P>
Lavelle transferred to Corona del Mar after his freshman year and became one of 
Nielsen's biggest rivals. Not on the basketball court, but on the track. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at 7:45, Lavelle and Nielsen will line up along with seven other 
runners for the boys' 1,600-meter final at the Southern Section Masters meet at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
The field is a Who's Who of Southern California prep distance-running talent, 
including Agoura's Bryan Dameworth, the 1987 state cross-country champion; 
Burbank's Todd Lewis, who won the 3-A title last Saturday in 4 minutes 11.44 
seconds -- the fastest time of the day, and Carpenteria's Coley Cadaele, who 
won the 1-A 800 and 1,600 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lavelle and Nielsen, along with Corona del Mar's Greg Shryock and Capistrano 
Valley's Neil Stevenson, are expected to represent the county well. 
</P>
<P>
Not that representation is the main idea. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen, who also will compete in the 3,200 approximately two hours after the 
finish of the 1,600, said, "I'm just getting on that line to win." 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps, to prove a few things. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen, normally a soft-spoken, amiable fellow, said he wasn't happy when he 
learned last fall he had been left off the all-county cross-country team, one 
that is selected by a vote of coaches at a meeting of the Orange County 
Cross-Country Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I was overlooked," he said. "I think that's what was driving me (to 
train hard) during the winter time." 
</P>
<P>
And now, after beating Lavelle twice in the past two weeks -- in the 3,200 at 
the Southern Section preliminaries May 13 and again in the 3,200 final last 
Saturday -- Nielsen said he has the confidence necessary to run with the very 
best. 
</P>
<P>
And if he, like other Masters competitors, finishes among the top five of his 
event, he will advance to the state meet June 3-4 at Cerritos College. But 
Nielsen says that is not his first priority. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going just to qualify," said Nielsen, whose best times are 4:14.36 in 
the 1,600 and 9:15.62 in the 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
"The big goal is to win." 
</P>
<P>
If that happens -- and if Nielsen runs faster than Lavelle's county-leading 
time of 4:11.94 -- he will no doubt take a major step toward proving himself 
the best miler in the county this season. It is a goal both Nielsen and his 
coach, Dave Zeitler, have sought for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"A 4:12 (for the 1,600), that was basically our goal for him," Zeitler said. 
"But I think Eddie's best time is 4:11.96 this year, so I think we'd like to go 
4:11.95. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to show that Mike's basically the best middle-distance runner in the 
county. Of course, we want to get to the state meet, but that would be the 
icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
And Lavelle was not at his best in the section finals Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1,600, he had to scramble from the back of the pack before finally 
overtaking Nielsen on the final straightaway for second in 4:13.86. And later, 
in the 3,200, Lavelle finished sixth in 9:25, 10 seconds behind Nielsen, who 
was second. 
</P>
<P>
But Lavelle, who will attend Notre Dame in the fall, should not be counted out. 
His 11 years of racing experience alone -- he won four national championships 
as an age-group competitor before high school -- lends a certain advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Though Nielsen did not race against Lavelle before high school -- he is one of 
the few Masters 1,600 meter entrants without any age-group background -- he 
said he has certainly heard plenty of his name and reputation. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't seem to bother Nielsen, though. He said he'd rather be the underdog 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, definitely, that's the way I like it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And for at least one more race anyway, that's the way it will probably be.

BONUS EVENTS POSSIBLE FOR NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
HAMPTON, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lolita Pile, Laural Isles and Lisa Gill of Cal State Northridge qualified for 
the NCAA Division II track and field championships in one event each, but they 
may compete in a second one before the three-day meet ends on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
For a variety of reasons -- poor weather in much of the country being the chief 
culprit -- only two women sprinters met the Division II championship standard 
of 24.10 in the 200, and only three met the 100-meter low hurdles standard of 
14.25. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to fill out the fields to a minimum of five athletes in those two 
events, qualifying races will be held during the meet among athletes who have 
qualified in at least one other event. 
</P>
<P>
So Isles, who qualified in the 100, and Pile (triple jump) might run in the 200 
meters and Gill (heptathlon) might compete in the 100 hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet," Northridge Coach Don Strametz said. 
"But there is a good chance that they'll run in those events." 
</P>
<P>
Strametz also has the option of putting together a men's 1,600-meter relay team 
-- there were only four entries in that event -- but he said he didn't think he 
would. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't have the personnel here to run a good 1,600," Strametz said. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of Northridge's entries are more concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy Arreola will attempt to defend her titles in the 1,500 and 3,000. She 
will not attempt a distance triple -- as Strametz had proposed several weeks 
ago -- because she intends to run the 1,500 at next week's Division I 
championships in Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she could have won three events," Strametz said. "But it wasn't worth 
it . . . I don't want her too tired for next week." 
</P>
<P>
The top two finishers in each event at the Division II meet -- who are juniors 
or seniors -- are eligible to compete in the Division I meet if they have met 
Division I standards. 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen and sophomores are not eligible because Division I schools passed a 
rule two years ago that will phase out Division II athletes running in the 
Division I meet. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, a junior, has met Division I standards in both the 1,500 and 3,000, 
and Pile, another junior, has met the standard in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
The school record-holder in the event (42 feet), Pile will attempt to improve 
upon her eight-place finish of 1987 and her sixth-place effort of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Jeffries and Walt Stewart will lead the Northridge men. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffries will run in the 110 high hurdles and the 400 intermediate hurdles as 
well as a leg on the 400 relay. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who cleared a personal best of 7 feet, 2 1/2 inches in the high jump 
at Cal State Los Angeles on Saturday, will compete in that event on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge juniors Paul Albers and Dan Youngberg will compete in the finals of 
the men's hammer throw today, and Arreola will run in a qualifying heat of the 
1,500.

THE JACK OF DIAMONDS; 
</P>
<P>
BENEVOLENT HOLLYWOOD AGENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN SPORTS BRINGS HIM THE ADULATION OF 
STARS AND A PLACE OF HONOR AT ENCINO LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Why don't sharks eat Hollywood agents? 
</P>
<P>
Professional courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
That's an old joke in Hollywood, where agents are perceived as only slightly 
more sensitive and moral than producers. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, not every agent fits the profile. There is one out there who 
actually gives agents a good name. Meet Jack Gilardi, probably the only agent 
in history who is high enough on the evolutionary ladder to have a Little 
League field named after him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not your average Hollywood agent," says O. J. Simpson, who has been 
represented by Gilardi for some 17 years on nothing but a handshake. "He's 
almost like a camp counselor." 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi, a senior agent at International Creative Management with a client list 
that ranges from Joan Collins and Faye Dunaway to the Fat Boys and Don Rickles, 
would not last long in shark-infested waters. He goes to church. He raises 
thousands of dollars for charity. He loves kids. He returns phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack is a class guy, a man well-loved in his profession," says Dodgers Manager 
Tommy Lasorda, who has been "friends for years" with Gilardi, meeting him 
because of the annual Hollywood Stars Night at Dodger Stadium. For 26 years, 
Gilardi, along with producer Joe Siegman -- Gilardi gets the celebrities, 
Siegman writes the gags -- has run the game, which benefits the Motion Picture 
Relief Fund. 
</P>
<P>
There is a black-and-white photo of Lasorda and Gilardi in Gilardi's cozy 
office on the seventh floor of the ICM building in West L. A. The office, which 
overlooks the Hollywood Hills, is filled with antique furniture, but the 
dominant feature is a collection of National Football League helmets, including 
one worn by Thomas (Hollywood) Henderson. There is also enough sports 
memorabilia to start a museum. Boxing gloves. Baseball caps. Score cards. An 
engraved bat given to him by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 (he won't give his exact age), Gilardi still has thick brown hair 
swept straight back, a movie-star complexion and a wiry, athletic build. He is 
a man with a reputation for fair play and honesty in a cutthroat profession. He 
hangs out with sports legends and Hollywood icons. He was married "for 18 
wonderful years" to Annette Funicello, one of the original Mouseketeers who is 
still his client, and they have three children. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Gilardi says, "I'm the luckiest guy in the world." 
</P>
<P>
A second-generation Italian, Gilardi wanted to be a doctor, not an agent, when 
he was growing up in Chicago. So instead of accepting a baseball scholarship 
from Notre Dame or Illinois, he says, he went to a small Catholic school, Loras 
College in Dubuque, Iowa, which didn't even have a baseball team. But his 
medical career ended when "I ran into organic chemistry -- or it ran into me," 
he says. He graduated with a degree in business and was drafted into the Army 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Stationed at Fort Knox, Ky., he got the break of a lifetime. A private, he was 
assigned to book entertainment -- Duke Ellington, Ray Anthony -- on the base, 
giving him a show-business education and innumerable valuable connections. 
Released from the service, he was offered jobs with three big entertainment 
agencies in the Midwest. But William Morris wanted him to start as a typist and 
the Music Corp. of America wanted him to wrap band posters in the publicity 
department. Only General Artists Corp. said that it would hire him as an agent. 
</P>
<P>
"But I didn't even know what an agent did," Gilardi said. 
</P>
<P>
He learned quickly. In 1958, GAC -- the forerunner of ICM -- transferred him to 
L. A. and put him in charge of the "cocktail department," meaning that he 
represented talent that performed in local nightclubs like the Melody Room on 
Sunset Strip. In two years, he was running the agency's entire West Coast 
nightclub department, a territory that included Las Vegas and Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Gilardi was spending a lot of leisure time at P. J.s, a West 
Hollywood club that was owned by a Chicagoan. Gilardi hung out with teen idol 
Frankie Avalon and Harvey Lembeck, the comic actor who played Cpl. Barbella on 
television's "Sgt. Bilko Show." They began playing pickup softball games at 
Roxbury Park against a team that included comedians Buddy Hackett and Shecky 
Greene. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden I got calls from other people in the business who wanted to 
play games against us," Gilardi recalls. Before Gilardi knew it, he was 
commissioner of the Hollywood Entertainment League, which became the center of 
the industry's social whirl. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the major stars of the early '60s had teams. There were Jerry Lewis' 
Clowns and Dean Martin's Dinos, James Garner's Gems and Pat Boone's Boones. 
Producers Aaron Spelling and David Wolper played. So did Jack Nicholson, Bobby 
Darin, Burt Reynolds and the Nelson boys, David and Ricky. Gilardi played on 
the United Jewish Italians, which was sponsored by a Union 76 station. 
</P>
<P>
After the league started up, both Gilardi and Avalon began dating Annette 
Funicello. Avalon, who was and still is a Gilardi client, got to do the "Beach 
Party" movies with her, but she married Gilardi, and when their first child, 
Gina, was born in 1965, Annette began showing up at softball games pushing a 
baby carriage. But by the mid-60s, the league began to change. Teams were 
bringing in top-quality players, circumventing a rule that limited rosters to 
players who worked in the entertainment industry by hiring ringers as extras in 
films. 
</P>
<P>
But when the caliber of play increased, the movie stars began to lose their 
enthusiasm. "Some of them couldn't compete that heavily," Gilardi says. "They 
just weren't that good." 
</P>
<P>
By the late '60s, Gilardi was spending his time with his young family and his 
burgeoning business and no longer could devote a lot of energy to running a 
10-team league, so in 1969 he announced his retirement as commissioner. The 
league went on for another year without him, then folded. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody else was willing to take on total responsibility," Gilardi said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi's involvement with the Hollywood Stars began in 1963. One of his 
clients was Nat King Cole. Cole had been captain and organizer of a celebrity 
team and asked Gilardi to take it over for him. Gilardi enlisted the help of 
Siegman, who had moved out from Chicago. Today, comedian Billy Crystal is 
captain of one team, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar heads another. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big deal to a lot of the stars," says Gilardi, who keeps a photo of 
Funicello standing in the shadows of Abdul-Jabbar. "You can't book Billy 
Crystal when there's a game. He'll block off those days." 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Gilardi, who lived in Encino at the time, signed up his son Jackie, 
then 8, in the Encino Little League. Five years later, his youngest son, Jason, 
began playing. Gilardi managed their teams. He got Annette to man the snack 
stand and Simpson to throw out the first ball. He was league president for a 
year. And aside from being the most popular manager, says former league 
president Bernie Paperny, Gilardi raised about $200,000 for the league. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the backbone of all fund-raising," says Paperny, who owns Paintcraft 
Supply and Hardware in L. A. "He worked countless hours and asked nothing in 
exchange." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Katofsky, a Palm Springs restaurateur who also is a past league 
president, remembers Gilardi's ability to elicit donations for the league's 
fund-raisers. "He even had a boat donated that we sold at an auction," Katofsky 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi has had a close relationship with the players, Paperny says. "He was 
like a father to all of them and made them feel good about themselves. 
Everybody wanted to play on his team. One year the kids elected him to manage 
the all-star team with 95% of the votes." To Gilardi, parents were not allowed 
to meddle and winning was not as important, Katofsky says, as the players' 
personal growth. "If his players lost, they had to be good sports," Katofsky 
says. "All he demanded of them was that they do their best and try hard." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Katofsky led a movement to name the main field at the Encino Little 
League complex after Gilardi. The announcement, made at a league banquet at the 
Sheraton-Universal Hotel, "was a complete surprise," Gilardi says. A photo 
above his office desk shows him standing on the field by a sign that says 
"Gilardi Field -- in honor of Jack Gilardi -- for his dedication to Encino 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi's largess and his extensive contacts have made him an easy touch -- he 
is known as the man to see for hard-to-get tickets to sports events and 
concerts. He even arranged a private tour of the Vatican for an associate. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack truly likes to help people," Siegman says, "and he's helped out an 
enormous number of people." 
</P>
<P>
But Gilardi will call in an IOU. "For every favor you ask, you have to give 
back two," he says. "So you better consider which one you ask for." 
</P>
<P>
In his office, Gilardi points to another black-and-white photo on his wall. The 
ICM softball team is playing archrival William Morris about 14 years ago. 
There's a brawl. Players square off. Except for one. "That's me," Gilardi says, 
pointing to himself. "I'm trying to break up the fight." And blow a chance to 
go for the jugular. No, Gilardi is not your average Hollywood agent.

ALEMANY'S BORQUEZ LEAVES FEARS -- AND RECORDS -- IN HIS WAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is the fastest sprinter in school history, but if not for fear of failure in 
another athletic endeavor, Tony Borquez might never have competed in track at 
Alemany High. 
</P>
<P>
The school record-holder in the 100, 200 and 400 meters, Borquez jokes about it 
now, but his fear of being cut from the baseball team was no laughing matter 
when he was a freshman in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
After playing on the freshman football team, Borquez intended to try out for 
the varsity baseball team as a pitcher, but he changed his mind at the last 
moment, going out for the track team instead. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I was afraid of what people would say if I didn't make the team," 
Borquez said. "I guess I was afraid of getting cut so I joined the track team." 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, the only ones with a phobia are opposing sprinters who have 
watched Borquez develop into one of the state's most feared 400-meter runners 
-- one who won the Southern Section 2-A Division 400 title last Saturday and 
will compete in the Masters meet Friday night at Cerritos College in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
The top five finishers in each event will advance to the state championships at 
Cerritos next Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we've been training for all year," Alemany Coach Jon Mack said of 
the state meet. "That's when he'll go all out to win. It's not important that 
he win at Masters, just qualify." 
</P>
<P>
Next week, however, Mack will pull out all the stops when Borquez makes his run 
at the state 400 title. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be ready to run a lot faster than he has," Mack said. "After tripling 
and quadrupling all season, his legs should be really rested for the state 
meet." 
</P>
<P>
The 2-A finals epitomized Borquez's rigorous workload: He anchored the Indians' 
400-meter relay team to victory in 42.62 seconds, won the 400 in 48.21, placed 
third in the 200 in a personal best of 21.97, and anchored the 1,600 relay team 
to a seventh-place effort of 3 minutes, 25.23 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's run three or four events a meet all season long because the team needed 
the points," Mack said. "But the team part of the season is over for us now. 
Now it's time for the individual part." 
</P>
<P>
For Borquez, that means a chance to run under 47.50 and perhaps challenge the 
47-second barrier. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I've still got some good races left in me," said Borquez, who has 
signed a letter of intent to attend USC in the fall. "It's just a matter of 
putting together all the pieces at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Borquez, who has run a wind-aided 10.6 in the 100 meters, never contemplated 
that in his first three years at Alemany because he had never before analyzed 
the 400. 
</P>
<P>
Now a devout student of the event, Borquez admits that he didn't know what he 
was doing in his freshman and sophomore years and only had a vague idea of how 
to run the 400 as a junior when he ran 48.29, finished third in the 2-A meet 
and placed eighth in the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty lost my first two years," he said. "But I started to learn a 
little bit about the event as a junior. As I ran faster, I started to 
understand more about the event. . . . This year, I feel like I'm finally 
starting to learn how to run the race." 
</P>
<P>
With that knowledge has come the realization that the 400 requires more than 
physical talent. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole race is so mental," Borquez said. "You can lose the race before you 
start it if you don't have confidence in yourself. You just have to have faith 
in yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"You just have to run your own race. If you get too nervous inside, you forget 
what you're doing out there and you won't run well. . . . It's a race that 
takes a lot of intelligence. That's what I like about it." 
</P>
<P>
Borquez's intelligence was evident on Saturday when Borquez gunned down David 
Stone of Arroyo Grande and Jerrald McCladdle of Centennial in the final 60 
meters of the 400. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran a great tactical race," Mack said. "He could easily have gone out with 
those guys in the first 200, but he would have died in the homestretch just 
like they did." 
</P>
<P>
Characterized by Mack as a good student (3.0 grade-point average) and an 
excellent listener, Borquez has watched videotapes of other top high school 400 
runners in an effort to improve his own performance. 
</P>
<P>
His father Danny filmed the 400 at the Arcadia Invitational in April -- which 
Albert Ransom of Montbello High in Denver won in 46.57 -- and Borquez has 
watched the tape several times. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Ransom) was so relaxed and strong the whole race," said Borquez, who 
placed third at Arcadia in a personal best of 47.96. "He showed me that you can 
go out strong and maintain that speed in the final 100. He showed me how to run 
the race." 
</P>
<P>
After running "51 something" in the 400 as a freshman and 50.2 as a sophomore, 
Borquez's transformation from a good 400 sprinter into an elite one came during 
last year's Mt. San Antonio College Relays in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the meet with a 50.2 best, Borquez ran a surprising 48.5 400 leg in 
the 1,600-meter relay on Friday night before winning the invitational 400 in 
48.79 the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really believe the relay split at first," Borquez recalled. "But when 
I ran under 49 in the open race the next day, I knew it wasn't a fluke. . . . 
That was probably the turning point for me as a sprinter. That's when I started 
thinking about getting a college scholarship. Until then, I wasn't sure if I'd 
ever be that good." 
</P>
<P>
Any lingering doubts Borquez might have had were put to rest when he qualified 
for the Masters meet and then the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything just kept falling my way," Borquez said. "I just kept getting 
faster and faster. I didn't really think I'd make it past Masters, but then I 
finished third. And once I got to state, I figured I'd get eliminated in the 
heats, but I won my race to make it to the finals." 
</P>
<P>
Content just to qualify for the state final last year, Borquez expects to 
accomplish much more as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to break 47.5 and be as competitive as possible," he said. "I want to 
be in the thick of things when we hit the final straight."

COACHES TO OFFER PLAN TO HOLD CITY PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an 11th-hour attempt to salvage the City Section 4-A Division baseball 
playoffs, a group representing boycotting coaches will propose a revamped 
tournament schedule to City officials at a meeting at 10 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness, who canceled the playoffs Tuesday, has 
agreed to the meeting, which is contingent upon a settlement of the strike 
against the Los Angeles Unified School District that would enable teachers to 
return to work by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Coach Steve Marden and Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano will represent 
the 16 coaches whose teams have qualified for the 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Under the coaches' plan, the first round of the playoffs would begin Friday and 
the second round would be played Saturday. The semifinals and final would be 
played as scheduled Tuesday and next Thursday. Marden, who devised the proposal 
Wednesday night, said that coaches would arrange for umpires and supervision 
and would prepare the fields in time for Friday's first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
Marden contacted 11 of the 16 coaches Wednesday night, all of whom supported 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what it takes on our part, whatever price we have to pay we will 
to make sure we have the 4-A playoffs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches that Marden contacted Wednesday night were Gary Donatella 
</P>
<P>
(Sylmar), Kevin Campbell (Monroe), Jerry Cord (Poly), Rich McKeon (Taft), Manny 
Alvarado (Kennedy), Mike Maio (El Camino Real), Tom Lucero (Grant), Russ Howard 
(Palisades) and Frank Cruz (University). 
</P>
<P>
A group of 18 4-A baseball coaches had voted to boycott the playoffs until the 
strike ends. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness announced the cancellation after a poll of the 16 schools whose teams 
had qualified for the playoffs revealed that only six were willing to field 
teams without the coach of record. District rules state that the school 
official coaching the team must be a credentialed employee.

WILSON DEFEATS NARBONNE TO ADVANCE TO QUARTERFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Amid the turmoil of the Los Angeles teachers' strike, the City 3-A baseball 
playoffs went on as scheduled. Unfortunately for the Narbonne Gauchos, they 
never got their bats and gloves to work and were eliminated by the Wilson 
Mules, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's Luis Mendoza (5-0) threw a complete game and allowed only three hits 
as the Northeaster League co-champions advanced to the quarterfinals to face 
the winner of the South Gate-Fairfax game. 
</P>
<P>
The shutout improved Wilson's record to 17-4, while Narbonne ended the season 
at 9-14. 
</P>
<P>
The visiting Gauchos went down in order to begin the game and then allowed 10 
Wilson players to bat in the bottom half of the first, allowing four runs. 
</P>
<P>
"They scored four runs in the first inning and the ball never left the 
infield," said Narbonne coach Nick Van Lue. "They got some infield hits and we 
didn't make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, Wilson right fielder Azar Yaver reached first base on a 
throwing error and moved to second on a Cesar Rubio grounder that was booted. 
</P>
<P>
Yaver then reached third on a passed ball and scored on an infield hit. Rubio 
scored on a Marty Romero infield hit to make the score 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Yaver tripled in the third inning to score Cesar Romero and make the score 7-0. 
It was the only Wilson hit to leave the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Both Van Lue and Wilson Coach Wayne Shiota cited the strike as a reason for 
their teams' erratic play. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't practice all last week," Shiota said. "That's probably why we didn't 
hit well today." 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne did not practice either, and their rustiness showed. The Gauchos were 
charitably credited with four errors, but could easily have made other plays 
that were scored as hits. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore left-hander Jason Donaldson relieved starter Bill Inman (4-4) and 
threw two no-hit innings. Narbonne's hitting never came around, however, and 
the team could not score despite the play of some spirited reserves. GREG

SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
EL CAMINO REAL ENDS BANNING HIGH SEASON WITH 11-INNING VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE VALENCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Going into the semifinal round of the L.A. City 4-A softball playoffs, Banning 
High had lost only two games in a 23-game season. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilots had lost to San Pedro and El Camino Real, two of the section's 
top-rated teams. They got a second chance Wednesday against El Camino Real at 
South Gate Park in a game that would send the winner into the city final. 
</P>
<P>
But again the result was the same as El Camino Real ended Banning's season with 
a 2-1 victory in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real will face San Pedro -- a winner over San Fernando in the other 
semifinal -- for the title Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most difficult part of the loss for Banning to swallow was the 
manner in which it was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Both of El Camino Real's runs were set up by Banning errors, the first coming 
in the first inning and the second (and eventual game winner) in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough way to lose," said Banning Coach Cathy Blankenship, whose team 
finished with a 21-3 record. "No one ever likes to give anything away. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think the pressure may have gotten to them and they may have gotten a 
little tired." 
</P>
<P>
Blankenship said she felt a little consolation in the fact that her team's only 
three losses came at the hands of two of the city's better teams. 
</P>
<P>
"If you lose," she said, "you want to lose to the best, Those teams are now in 
the finals." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real, the top-seeded team in the playoffs, scored the winning run in 
the top of the 11th on a single, a throwing error and a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
With one out and a runner on first, Banning pitcher Kricket Kern (16-3) fielded 
a sacrifice bunt but threw wildly to first base, allowing the runners to move 
to second and third. The groundout pushed over the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
After El Camino Real had taken a 1-0 lead in the first inning, Banning tied the 
score on an RBI triple by Claudia Delgadillo in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro 9, San Fernando 1 -- Jstone Vines had three hits and scored two runs 
and pitcher Meagan Moore threw a three-hitter while collecting three hits and 
one RBI to lead the Pirates in the semifinal round of the City 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro (20-5) will face El Camino Real in the final Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates scored a run in the first, two in the third, one in the fourth and 
put the game out of reach with five more in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Moore (18-4) struck out six and walked four. 
</P>
<P>
Hart 4, Hawthorne 3 -- The Cougars threw a scare into top-ranked Hart, leading 
3-2 at one point, but fell short in a second-round game of the CIF-Southern 
Section 4-A playoffs at Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 2-0, Hawthorne scored three runs in the fourth inning to take the 
lead. Tricia Waayers scored on an error and Katina Stallworth followed with a 
two-run double to left-center field. 
</P>
<P>
The lead didn't last long. Hart came back with two runs in the fourth, scoring 
on a triple by Kelly Kepplinger and an error by third baseman Jennifer Stone. 
</P>
<P>
That was enough for Hart pitcher Kim Weil (25-1), who finished with a 
six-hitter and nine strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Weil entered the game having allowed only one earned run in 165 innings for an 
0.04 ERA. Hawthorne's two earned runs are the most she had allowed all season. 
</P>
<P>
Waayers (16-3) went the distance for Hawthorne, giving up six hits. The Bay 
League champion ended the season with a 24-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (29-1) advances to Friday's quarterfinals.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: COACHES STRAIN TO FIND MERITS OF SOFTBALL TIEBREAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It led to a rather sleepless night, but Will Thurston, coach of the Moorpark 
College softball team, is thankful that the Lady Raiders were forced to play 
out what was eventually a 21-inning, 2-1 victory over Cypress College in the 
state junior college championship tournament last weekend at Golden West 
College in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Win or lose, Thurston says that he still would have been opposed to using an 
international tiebreaker rule to lessen the likelihood of marathon extra-inning 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. uses the tiebreaker, in which the player 
who makes the last out of the eighth inning is placed at second base to start 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like having a tiebreaker rule is an artificial solution to ending a 
game," Thurston said. "I think you just have to go on playing as long as it 
takes." 
</P>
<P>
In Moorpark's case, it took six hours and ended at 2:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge Coach Gary Torgeson also is opposed to the rule, calling 
it "a slam to women's sports." Torgeson contends that baseball and softball 
games should be settled in the same manner. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do something for the men and not for the women?" Torgeson said. "Play it 
out. Playing under the tiebreaker is like playing a whole different game." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was knocked out of last year's national tournament, losing in a 
tiebreaker to Lock Haven (Pa.) State. The Lady Matadors lost another key game 
this year under the tiebreaker format, losing a game in the West regional to 
Cal State Bakersfield, the eventual national champion. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, however, also has won its share of games using the rule, Torgeson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I see it and have been in it, the more I don't like it," he said. 
"I'm not sour-graping it. I'm saying it's a bad rule for women's sports. The 
rule does nothing for the game except end it." 
</P>
<P>
Torgeson said that he spearheaded a drive to eliminate the rule in 1984, 
shortly after it was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them to approach it on a Title IX thing," Torgeson said. "The men and 
the women should get the same treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Add marathon: De Dow had pitched both games of a doubleheader before, but even 
that didn't prepare her for Moorpark's game against Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Dow pitched all 21 innings of the game, in which a state record for innings 
played was set. Cypress held the previous record, a 20-inning affair played 
earlier in the tournament. The Lady Chargers had all of an hour to rest before 
playing Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
For Dow, it was an experience she won't soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all getting cold and my fingers were stiffening up," Dow said. "I 
remember somebody asked for the time when it started getting late and I didn't 
even want to know." 
</P>
<P>
Dow, the winningest pitcher in Moorpark history, pitched 28 innings in two 
games Saturday and picked up three victories at the state tournament to finish 
30-7. 
</P>
<P>
Re-staking her claim: Samantha Ford may have waited until just the right time 
to make her move. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, a senior pitcher at UCLA who played at Hart High, is 10-1 with eight 
shutouts and a team-low 0.16 earned-run average for the top-ranked and 
defending national champion Bruins, who are competing in the NCAA Division I 
softball championships this week in Sunnyvale, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Ford was 18-4, but this season she has been third in the rotation 
behind junior Lisa Longaker (17-1) and freshman Tiffany Boyd (16-2). 
</P>
<P>
After pitching in just five of the Bruins' first 27 games, Ford has come on 
strongly. Earlier this month, she struck out 15 while pitching a perfect game 
against Oregon State, the first by a UCLA pitcher since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend in the West regional at UCLA, Ford earned a win against Cal State 
Long Beach by pitching four innings of scoreless relief. She has not given up a 
run in her past 25 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Timely contributions: Three athletes from Valley-area high schools scored 
points for the UCLA men's track team last weekend in Palo Alto as the Bruins 
captured their third consecutive Pacific 10 Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Jay Bettinger, a 1988 graduate of Chatsworth High, took third in the 
pole vault, clearing a personal best of 17-0 3/4. Bettinger, who won the City 
Section title last year, cleared the same height as Washington State's Patrick 
Johansson, who finished second, but had more missed attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been anticipating that Jay would clear 17 feet soon. We feel he has a 
great future," UCLA Coach Bob Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA received more help from an unexpected source when David Bunevacz, a 
transfer from Glendale College, took third in the javelin with a personal best 
of 220-11. 
</P>
<P>
Bunevacz had not met the qualifying standard for the meet, but Art Venegas, a 
Bruin assistant, persuaded Larson to designate the the sophomore as UCLA's lone 
at-large entrant. 
</P>
<P>
"David taking third was one of the big turnarounds for us early on," Larson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
John Knight, a junior from Oak Park High, finished sixth in the hammer with a 
throw of 202-7. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Fleischman and staff writers Ralph Nichols, Mike Hiserman and Gary Klein 
contributed to this notebook.

TORREY PINES BIG FAVORITE IN GYMNASTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's a time to be silent and a time to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Torrey Pines gymnastics team was caught in between, able to do 
little more than whisper, when it finished behind Santana and Mt. Carmel for 
the San Diego Section team championship. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Torrey Pines is outspoken. The Falcons are favored to dethrone 
Santana today at the optional finals at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
So sure are the Falcons of this victory, they say they would have to 
self-destruct in order not to win. "And San Pasqual would have to have the meet 
of their lives," said Torrey Pines Coach Shawn Wirth. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons are first heading into the optionals after scoring a school-record 
109.40 points in Wednesday's compulsories. Santana is second with 104.75 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Said Torrey Pines' Lelli Hose, who won the compulsory individual all-around 
title with a school-record 37.0 points: "We haven't come this close in a long 
time. If we just keep doing what we've been doing all year, we'll do fine. 
We're all very optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
But San Pasqual Coach Laura Hadfield said not to count her team out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not that far behind them," she said. "All it takes is for them to have a 
bad day and us to be right on." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines became the section favorite based on its winning performance at 
the league championships. There, the Falcons outscored runner-up San Pasqual, 
216.65-210.05 -- both school records. Santana won the 2-A Grossmont meet with a 
205.00. 
</P>
<P>
Although scoring in usually difficult to compare, Wirth said there is parity in 
judging in San Diego because the judges are the same. 
</P>
<P>
"The point spread is the only reason we're favored," Wirth said. "If league 
finals are any indication of how we'll finish, we should be first, San Pasqual 
second, Santana third and Fallbrook fourth." 
</P>
<P>
Noteworthy in the order is the position of Santana, which has won 10 titles 
since the section began keeping records in 1974 and has finished no lower than 
second. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wirth, there is no county power shift -- Santana is merely having 
a down year. 
</P>
<P>
"Santana's just not as strong," Wirth said. "They graduated a lot of girls and 
lost some when they split with West Hills." 
</P>
<P>
"We lost all our optionals (performers), except one," said Becca Webster, 
Santana's first-year coach. "We're in a rebuilding year. We have no seniors." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Webster said the Sultans and the Golden Eagles should fight for the 
runner-up spot. 
</P>
<P>
"San Pasqual has a little lead over us score-wise, but it's a matter of whoever 
hits (their routines)," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines was undefeated in league tri-meets. Its only loss was early in the 
season to Santana, when the Falcons were without Tasha Taylor, defending 
section optional champion, and Julie Kawasaki. Both were competing with the 
Gymnastics Center of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"They beat us at the beginning of the year," Wirth said, "but we've beaten them 
in every invitational since." 
</P>
<P>
Scoring is divided between compulsory and optional rounds, and although 
optional gymnasts are more accomplished and perform their own routines -- 
compulsory gymnasts must perform uniform Class II and Class III routines -- the 
less-prestigious compulsories are of equal importance. 
</P>
<P>
"Their routines aren't as advanced," Wirth said, "but their scoring counts just 
as much." 
</P>
<P>
The top three scores from each team in four events -- 32 gymnasts from eight 
teams are competing for the title -- are totaled after today's competition to 
determine the team winner. 
</P>
<P>
While Torrey Pines' strength is its compulsory gymnasts -- two are juniors who 
have been doing the same routines for three years -- Wirth said they will be 
equally hard to beat in optionals. 
</P>
<P>
"My compulsory team is so much stronger than anyone else," Wirth said, "but 
frankly, I don't see anyone beating out my optional team, either." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Kawasaki are Wirth's top optional gymnasts. Because they joined the 
team late, after their club seasons were over, Hadfield said the Falcons have a 
distinct advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"If Shawn had kept her primary team, we would have been league champs," 
Hadfield said. "The team we have is the team we started out with." 
</P>
<P>
As long as a gymnast has participated in her league meet, she is eligible to 
compete in the section finals. It is a common custom in gymnastics for a club 
athlete to join her high school team late, but San Pasqual's athletic director 
wouldn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too late and unethical," Hadfield said. "I agreed with it. The girls 
should be in a certain number of meets to compete in CIF." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hadfield said many schools allow club athletes to compete high school, 
the majority of gymnasts are not from clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Hose plays field hockey and was a member of the 1989 Torrey Pines' section 
co-champion girls' soccer team. She is a part-time gymnast and said she hoped 
to finish well to prove that club competition isn't a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be excited (to win)," Hose said, "because most top gymnasts go 
year-round. It would be an honor to show people that you don't have to compete 
club." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who is favored to win her second all-around title, competes with a club 
but likes high school competition for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, you get to compete every week, and you get used to the 
pressure," she said. "The caliber of competition isn't as high, but I like it. 
The judging is more relaxed and you get more recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Kawasaki, Paige Peterman of Fallbrook, Santana's Jennifer Cooper and 
San Pasqual's Amy Sullivan and Ashley Orman will be attempting to keep Taylor 
from defending her title. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I wasn't expected to do well," Taylor said. "This puts a lot of 
pressure on me to win. I would feel weird if I won last year and didn't this 
year. CIF means a lot to me."

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / RICK HAZELTINE: UCSD GOLF EAGERLY AWAITS CS STANISLAUS' MOVE 
UP 
</P>

<P>
Nobody is going to be happier than Mike Wydra, the UC San Diego men's golf 
coach, when Cal State Stanislaus leaves NCAA Division III for Division II next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Wydra has been coaching men's golf at UCSD for 10 years and has led the Tritons 
to the national tournament in each of them. And three of the past four years, 
UCSD has finished second. 
</P>
<P>
It's not hard to guess who won. Stanislaus has had a hold on Division III men's 
golf, winning 11 titles in the 14 years there has been a national champion. 
</P>
<P>
It's no different this year. Stanislaus leads by five shots over Methodist of 
North Carolina after two rounds of the national tournament at the Panorama Golf 
Course in Panora, Iowa. Several teams are battling for No. 2, but after next 
season, Wydra and the rest of the Division III coaches figure they'll be 
battling for No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's looking forward to (Stanislaus leaving)," Wydra said. "It would 
really open things up." 
</P>
<P>
UCSD entered the tournament ranked No. 9 in the country and was in 11th place 
with two rounds remaining. The closest UCSD has been to a title was in 1985, 
when it finished two shots behind Stanislaus. 
</P>
<P>
Wydra is already looking forward to next year after signing five recruits; the 
Tritons will lose two players. Wydra said he has a blue-chip prospect in Dale 
Abraham, who turned down scholarships to Division I schools. Wydra, from 
Norcal, also expects a lot from Escondido's John Lovette, who transferred to 
UCSD from Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD is the only local golf team to advance to its national tournaments, but 
several individuals earned berths. 
</P>
<P>
Paul McGinley of U.S. International and San Diego State freshman Tim Todd 
advanced to the NCAA Division I men's West Regional at Texas El Paso, starting 
today. Sixteen teams and five individuals advanced to the regional; nine teams 
and one individual will move on to the national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
McGinley, a senior from Ireland, competed in 10 tournaments this season, 
finished no worse than 10th and won twice. He averaged 73.0 and has finished no 
lower than fourth in his past five tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Allison Shapcott will be competing on a familiar course for the NCAA Division I 
women's championship tournament that started Wednesday at the Stanford 
University Golf Course. Shapcott won the California Intercollegiate tournament 
three weeks ago, missing the tournament record by one shot with a three-round 
total 212 on the par-74 Stanford course. 
</P>
<P>
High jumper Dan Raatjes leads a contingent of 17 Point Loma Nazarene College 
athletes into the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletes national 
championships at Azusa Pacific today through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Raatjes jumped a national-best 7-feet-2 3/4 at the District 3 championships at 
Point Loma two weeks ago. Connie Navarro, who scored 50 points in eight events 
at the district meet, will limit her participation in the nationals to the 
heptathlon, javelin and 400-meter relay. Tommy Anderberg, rated No. 2 in the 
nation in the javelin with a throw of 220-3, and Anette Ronnerman, No. 3 in the 
800 at 2:11.33, are also expected to do well for the Crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
The top seven finishers in each event will be named NAIA All-Americans. 
Navarro, who also is an academic All-American, already has been named an NAIA 
All-American in volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State will be represented by hammer thrower Pat Thiss, Karl Von Mohr 
in the discus and Jim Cody in the high jump at the NCAA Division I track and 
field championships at Brigham Young beginning next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Four other Aztecs will try to qualify for the meet this weekend. Osmond 
Swanegan has a best of 51.19 in the 400-meter hurdles and needs 50.85 to 
qualify. Floyd Barco (46.80) needs a 46.20 in the 400 meters, and Will Foster 
(51-10 1/2) needs a triple jump of 52-10. Marla Runyon is two inches shy of the 
6-0 qualifier in the women's high jump. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Stanforth, the UC San Diego track and field coach, is making headway in 
his attempt to build a program. UCSD is sending six athletes, the most in 
school history, to the Division III national championships starting today at 
Naperville, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the Tritons is sophomore Shannon Quigley, who is expected to finish in 
the top three in both the shot put and discus. Also representing UCSD will be 
sophomore Rachel Beerman in the discus, sophomore Andrea Kouremetis in the 100 
and 200 meters and freshman Michelle Conlay in the 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sargeant, a freshman, will compete in the hammer, and senior Mark Lawler 
will participate in the pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
Four San Diego County athletes won titles at the state community college track 
and field championships in Fresno last weekend, including three from San Diego 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa's Jackie Anderson (Mt. Miguel High) won the triple jump with 41-6 1/2 and 
was fourth in the long jump at 18-7. Also winning events for Mesa were was Mary 
Akins (Kearny) with a 17:00.81 in the 5,000 meters (winning by more than 55 
seconds) and Larry Todd (Mt. Miguel) with a leap of 25-4 1/2 in the long jump. 
Sean O'Hara (Madison) was second for Mesa in the 3,000-meter steeplechase 
(9:23.85). Starla Ahu of MiraCosta won the women's shot with a throw of 46-6 
1/2. Mesa was fourth in the women's team championships, and the men were sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has said she will attend San Diego State next year. Akins is planning 
to attend Cal State Los Angeles, and O'Hara will compete at the College of 
Notre Dame in Northern California.

Domenic Mobilio scored four goals as the Baltimore Blast advanced to the Major 
Indoor Soccer League championship series against the Sockers with an 11-1 
victory over the Wichita Wings Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Ronson had two goals and two assists as the Blast, the regular-season 
MISL champions, won the best-of-seven semifinal series, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Games 1 and 2 of the championship series are scheduled for Monday and Tuesday 
in Baltimore. Games 3, 4 and 5 (if necessary) would be played in San Diego June

DETACHED HOME SALES IN O.C. DROP 26% IN APRIL AS SPENDING SPREE ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sales of existing single-family homes in Orange County plunged 26% in April, a 
sign interpreted by some market analysts as the official end of a yearlong 
spending spree that pushed the price of housing beyond the reach of many 
would-be buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the California Assn. of Realtors reported Wednesday that the median 
price of a detached house rose 2% to $243,485 last month, indicating that 
softening sales have not yet caused prices to plateau. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's month-to-month sales decline was the biggest in the state but 
the same pattern of falling sales and increasing prices was evident in almost 
all of the residential housing markets surveyed by the Realtors group. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the firmest evidence we have seen that things have slowed down," said 
David Hensley, director of California forecasting at the UCLA Business 
Forecasting Project in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of existing homes fell 14.1% across the state, the Realtors association 
said. It was the largest such decrease since January, 1987, when sales fell 
22.4% following implementation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide median house price topped the $200,000 mark for the first time, 
rising 2.5% to $200,784 in April from $195,815 in March. The statewide median 
has increased 25.8% since April, 1988, when it stood at $159,542. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents in Orange County substantiated the trade group's sales 
statistics. "Houses last year sold in less than 30 days. Now you're looking at 
90 to 180 days at least," said Sherry Powers, senior vice president of Grubb 
&amp; Ellis in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Economists explained the seeming contradiction of declining sales and rising 
prices by saying house prices do not respond as quickly to market forces as 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
"What we expect to see as homes stay on the market a little longer, the prices 
will start to level off," said Roger Cruzen, spokesman for the Realtors trade 
group. "We don't expect them to decline, certainly. But the level of price 
appreciation should moderate." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco was the state's most expensive housing market in April, with a 
median price of $261,520, the trade group reported. Ventura County was second 
with $249,847. Orange County's $243,485 median price ranked third. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in the Los Angeles area fell 2.6%, while the median price gained 3.9% to 
$215,871. In the San Diego area, sales fell 20.3%, and the median price 
increased 5.4% to $176,057. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside-San Bernardino area was the only surveyed region that experienced 
a decline in price. The median price in the Inland Empire fell 0.6% to 
$119,124, while sales were down 11.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Rising house prices and sluggish sales have caused a problem for homeowners 
trying to trade up to more expensive homes, because many are facing delays in 
selling their old homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Buyers are having to get swing loans and home equity lines of credit because 
the funds to buy a new home aren't available yet because they haven't sold 
their old house," said Bonnie Kalen, an Irvine loan representative. "There are 
buyers out there, just not as many as there were last year." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents said price increases have already started to taper off since 
April. "Sellers are not getting top dollars for their properties," Powers said. 
"They have to be realistic in their pricing or they just sit on the market." 
</P>
<P>
Joel Singer, economist for the real estate group, agreed. "There is more price 
undercutting in the marketplace now than there was 6 or 9 months ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate experts said the drop in sales was not unexpected because 
first-time home buyers have been sidelined by soaring house prices and rising 
mortgage interest rates, which have jumped nearly 2 percentage points during 
the last 6 months. 
</P>
<P>
While many buyers have turned to condos as prices of detached homes escalated, 
statewide sales of attached housing also slumped in April, falling 10.8% for 
the month. The median price of a condominium in California rose 2.8% to 
$136,575 from $132,847 in March. 
</P>
<P>
Based on April sales activity, it would take 5.6 months to deplete the current 
inventory of single-family houses listed for sale, the trade group estimated. 
April's inventory, up from 4.7 months in March, is the highest total since May, 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the inventory situation has improved dramatically," 
Singer said. "It's a pretty good sign that the sellers' market of the last year 
or so is moving toward a more balanced market." 
</P>
<P>
The real estate group surveys sales of existing residences listed with brokers 
in selected areas of the state. Its figures exclude new houses. 
</P>
<P>
But an earlier report covering all real estate transactions in Orange County 
detected the same trends as the real estate association. Earlier this month, 
TRW Real Estate Market Information said residential sales fell 19% in April, 
while the average home price rose 6% to $238,353. The TRW survey included both 
detached housing and condominiums.

<TEXT>
<P>
After the Argo Merchant tanker ran aground near Nantucket, Mass., in 1976, 
spilling 7.6 million gallons of oil, Congress expressed concern about the 
environmental hazards but never adopted major oil spill legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years and an even worse oil spill later, Congress is again considering 
legislation, which a congressional aide fears will suffer the same fate. But 
Rep. Gerry Studds (D-Mass.), whose district includes Nantucket, is a bit more 
hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in March -- which succeeded the Argo 
Merchant as the worst oil spill in U.S. history -- a House Merchant Marine and 
Fisheries subcommittee voted favorably Wednesday on oil spill proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Woodward, staff director for the fisheries and wildlife subcommittee, said 
Wednesday that he doubts that the bill will become law. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll pass the House (as it has in various versions several times), but I have 
been through this too often to be optimistic it will become law. Even after the 
Valdez," Woodward said, noting that the Senate has not approved bills that step 
on states' own spill legislation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Studds said he is less pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get it, it will be because of the Alaska incident, which makes inaction 
inexplicable. In Washington language, I guess you can say I'm hopeful," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the lessons is that if things are not done quickly now in response to 
the Valdez, we risk the chance that people will forget the tragedy," Woodward 
said. "Twelve years from now we could be dealing with this again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fisheries Affected 
</P>
<P>
The Argo Merchant was carrying about 7.6 million gallons of oil on Dec. 15, 
1976, when it ran aground 27 miles southeast of Nantucket, Mass., a resort 
island south of Cape Cod, and subsequently was torn apart by storm waves. 
</P>
<P>
The spill sent a slick more than 100 miles long across the rich fishing grounds 
of Georges Bank.

On March 24, the Exxon Valdez slammed into a reef off Valdez, Alaska, spilling 
nearly 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. The accident has 
fouled hundreds of miles of beaches, killing otters, sea birds and other 
wildlife and wreaking havoc on the area's herring and salmon fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
After the Argo Merchant accident, some legislation passed, including 
requirements for improved radar, improved crew training and segregated ballasts 
so that water used for ballast and eventually dumped would not be contaminated 
with oil. 
</P>
<P>
However, a comprehensive oil spill bill proposed in 1977 by President Jimmy 
Carter, Studds and Sen. Warren Magnuson (D-Wash.), never became law. 
</P>
<P>
The House subcommittee Wednesday approved yet another bill that may not pass 
Senate muster because it includes a controversial provision to prohibit legal 
action under state laws to recover damages from oil spillers. The Senate 
historically has refused to accept federal preemption of state laws on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
The provision, dubbed by opponents as a gift to polluters, would limit 
liability of oil companies for spill damages to provisions of the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Other measures proposed, but never adopted since the Argo Merchant accident, 
include requiring protective double hulls on oil tankers and having more oil 
spill strike teams. President Ronald Reagan cut back Carter's proposal of 11 
teams to two. The subcommittee Wednesday approved an amendment to finance two 
more strike teams.

WYOMING GETS UPBEAT NATURAL GAS REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Natural gas production in Wyoming could increase tremendously within a few 
years, said a report Wednesday by the state Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
Many favorable signs for increased production are cited in an article by Rodney 
DeBruin, Oil and Gas Division head with the Geological Survey of Wyoming. The 
report appears in the publication "Wyoming Geo-Notes No. 22." 
</P>
<P>
The article points out that the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission 
granted Union Pacific Resources' application to drill 100 additional gas wells 
in the Green River Basin of southwest Wyoming. Union Pacific plans to drill and 
evaluate 40 wells initially. The company estimates that each new well will 
produce 3.5 billion cubic feet of gas. 
</P>
<P>
Another favorable sign is the recent announcement by Enron Oil and Gas to 
double production from the Big Piney Field in western Wyoming. Enron has 
letters of intent for the transportation and sale of 50 million cubic feet of 
Big Piney gas per day this year, increasing to 100 million cubic feet daily by 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
DeBruin's article indicates Wyoming is in a good competitive position for a 
proposed natural gas pipeline to Kern County, Calif. A report by the California 
Energy Commission rates Wyoming's pipeline as the best among several 
alternatives. California could gain $14.6 billion from the pipeline, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal by Wyoming-California Pipeline Co. to build a Wyoming-to-California 
pipeline was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Approval of 
two other such proposals appears probable. 
</P>
<P>
Another positive sign for increased natural gas production is that Southern 
California Gas has lifted its opposition to the proposed Kern River pipeline. 
It is estimated that a pipeline from Wyoming to California would increase 
Wyoming's natural gas production by 180 billion cubic feet annually. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, DeBruin said the preliminary estimate of Wyoming's 
1988 natural gas production is 793 billion cubic feet, but he noted that as 
much as 120 billion cubic of that is carbon dioxide from Exxon's plant in 
southwest Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
A pipeline to California would help diversify Wyoming's markets for natural 
gas, DeBruin said. The current markets for Wyoming gas are other places outside 
Wyoming. "A lot of it goes back to the Midwest," DeBruin said. "Some of it goes 
to the Pacific Northwest. Not much of it stays in Wyoming because there's no 
(large) market for it."

SOCIETY: ALUMNI GATHERING MAKES FOR 'A SAN DIEGO STATE OF MIND'

Quite by chance, Le Meridien hotel helped the organizers of Saturday's 12th 
annual San Diego State University alumni awards gala with the thankless and 
typically tedious chore of herding VIPs from a private cocktail party to the 
general reception. 
</P>
<P>
The allures of the VIP reception, given in one of the hotel's plush villas, 
were sufficient to induce a feet-of-clay state in the gathering of university 
and Alumni &amp; Associates principals and honorees. The majority of the guests 
had gathered on a lawn that offered a particularly inviting view of the 
Coronado Bridge and the bay's obligingly cheerful waters, and seemed reluctant 
to move along to the hotel ballroom until the sprinkler system, activated by a 
timer, sent them jogging across the grass like a covey of startled quail. The 
scene was amusing to witness, and apparently amusing to experience, at least in 
the opinion of SDSU alumnus Tom Gable, who wisecracked, "At some parties, when 
they want you to move on, they dim the lights." 
</P>
<P>
Slightly damp but otherwise none the worse for wear, the VIPs ascended to the 
St. Tropez Ballroom, where they joined the rest of the 500-plus guests at the 
event's first sellout. According to alumni director Richard Talmo, the awards 
dinner is the most important annual fund-raising event on the alumni calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Blair, a 1973 graduate, chaired "A San Diego State of Mind" and arranged 
such happy details as the centerpieces assembled from campus memorabilia and 
the presence of the SDSU Jazz Ensemble, a collection of more than 20 musicians 
and singers who could easily outplay most of the city's professional 
orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
"I think SDSU was wonderful and nice to ask me to put this on, and I'm sure 
that one day I'll be rich and able to donate money back to the school," Blair 
teased. Her husband, San Diego Union columnist Tom Blair, served as master of 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
The program commenced during the dinner of roti de boeuf a l'Aztec and 
chocolate-marbled cheesecake. Outgoing alumni board President Bernie Rhinerson 
informed the audience that, at a strength of more than 100,000, the the local 
SDSU alumni association represents the largest nonprofit organization in the 
county. University President Tom Day then commented that May is a particularly 
pleasant time of year for the school's faculty and administration because 
"commencement is at hand, and we can all run for the hills." 
</P>
<P>
A thoroughly detailed, painstakingly produced video presentation introduced the 
event's nine honored alumni, who represented the seven SDSU schools, the 
Imperial Valley campus and the alumni in general. The roll included San Diego 
City Manager John Lockwood, businessman Jack Goodall, educator Ron Bolles, 
engineering whiz Russ Common, community activist Mateo Camarillo, Imperial 
Valley attorney Mercedes Zaragoza Wheeler, biologist Linda Maxson and 
entrepreneur Luis Nogales. 
</P>
<P>
The Alumnus of the Year award was given to banker Tom Carter, who received a 
standing ovation as he approached the podium. The San Diego native surprised 
the audience somewhat by extending his remarks beyond the usual words of 
gratitude to comment on problems facing the area. Among the solutions he 
suggested were combining the city and county governments into a single entity, 
and regarding Tijuana as important to the area's economic life as San Jose is 
to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Previous recipients of the Alumnus of the Year award include Old Globe Theatre 
executive producer Craig Noel, television personality Art Linkletter, Greater 
San Diego Chamber of Commerce President Lee Grissom and Richard T. Silberman, 
the businessman and chief of staff to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. who 
recently was indicted on money-laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 10 newsman Jack White conducted the traditional banquet-closing 
auction, at which symbolic footballs that entitle successful bidders to 
participate in interesting off-field proceedings at SDSU games sold for as much 
as $600 each. A baton, which the purchaser will use to lead the fight song at 
the Oct. 21 homecoming game against the University of the Pacific, also sold 
for $600. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included incoming Alumni &amp; Associates President Art Flaming 
and his wife, Gwen; Tracy and Tom Stickel; Cheryl Ayers with fiance Ron 
Kendrick; Lynn Stedd-White; SDSU Vice President for Academic Affairs Albert 
Johnson and his wife, Susan; Judy Carter; City Councilmen Ron Roberts and Bob 
Filner; Maureen and Emil Ghio; Linda and Mel Katz; Barbara Bry and Patrick 
Kruer; Betty Hubbard; university President's Council Chairman Norma Assam and 
her husband, Dr. Sam Assam; Richel and Tawfiq Khoury; Jo and Tom Hazard; Police 
Chief Bob Burgreen, and Patty and Bob Payne. 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO -- Part of the funds that enable the 338,000 client visits made 
annually to the 31 countywide Episcopal Community Services programs was raised 
at Saturday's May Faire, the 62nd anniversary dinner-dance and auction given by 
</P>
<P>
the charitable organization. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 ECS supporters, led by the Right Rev. C. Brinkley Morton, bishop of 
the Episcopal Diocese of San Diego, gathered in the San Diego Marriott main 
ballroom to bid on a silent auction of more than 100 unusual packages, 
including smocking lessons for four, a somewhat premature Christmas tree 
decorated with exceptional angel ornaments (an ECS dinner dance tradition), and 
a home-video package that, given the event's religious association, included 
tapes of "Ben Hur" and "The Ten Commandments" along with a sack of popcorn and 
a hot-air popper. 
</P>
<P>
"May Faire is given to help the least, the lost and the last," said chairman 
Joyce Pedlow, echoing the ECS motto. 
</P>
<P>
ECS spokesman Patt Casey described some of the services that will receive 
funding from the event. 
</P>
<P>
"ECS has the county's largest employment program for the homeless, and we're 
currently trying to expand our services to both homeless men and women. We've 
recently added a 'sheltered' workshop, at which a woman who's never had work 
skills can develop them, and we emphasize teaching what it requires to keep a 
job. This is a real problem for a lot of homeless people who want to be 
self-supporting and independent."

A TOKYO TALE: THE $2-MILLION BAMBOO-THICKET MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED HIATT, The Washington Post 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The $2-million mystery of the bamboo forest, after playing through the Japanese 
psyche like a dark subplot to Tokyo's continuing political scandal, finally has 
been solved. 
</P>
<P>
But as so often in Japan, the solution seemed only to deepen the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
It began April 11, when a humble seller of yakitori (grilled chicken), rooting 
through an urban bamboo thicket for some tasty shoots, stumbled across a wad of 
rotting, abandoned yen. 
</P>
<P>
Like any good Japanese, he took the money to the police. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the crumbling bills with some difficulty, they calculated that the 
39-year-old restaurateur had picked up the equivalent of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The gorudo rashu came next -- a gold-rush fever that brought hundreds of 
money-seekers swarming to the grove in Kawasaki, hoping lightning might strike 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
And five days later, a humble part-time laborer, 21, who was actually hunting 
for wild cress, tripped across another $700,000 in yen. 
</P>
<P>
The frenzy grew, as hundreds more searched for a "third installment." And the 
mystery of who would abandon nearly $2 million without even burying it, and 
then fail to claim the cash when it was found, seemed to obsess the nation, 
even more than the news of the political scandal shaking the government. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many observers saw a connection between easy money flowing through the 
political world and the mysterious cash of the bamboo forest. It helped 
headline writers, although not the embattled prime minister, that the first 
character of Noboru Takeshita's name means "bamboo" -- and that he had received 
about $2 million from Recruit Co., the conglomerate at the center of the 
scandal that has forced him to announce his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
But as Japan's press rushed forward with theory after theory -- each more lurid 
than the last -- to explain the unclaimed cache, the dark side of politics was 
but one rich lode. Mystery writers were interviewed, past murders rehashed, 
fantastic scenarios constructed around drugs and gangsters, blackmail and tax 
evasions. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the speculation reflected modern Japanese anxieties -- fear that 
unaccustomed prosperity is corrupting morals and dividing rich from poor, old 
from young. 
</P>
<P>
"The average Japanese cannot play the money game, and when these worlds 
collide, as they did in the bamboo thicket, public interest is immense," the 
newspaper Yomiuri said in an editorial. "It seems that recently the gap between 
the average citizen and the ultrarich has vastly widened . . . that our 
society's view toward money has become very distorted, and this causes great 
frustration for many Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
Many experts -- and nearly all Japanese depicted themselves as experts on the 
subject -- said the money was somehow connected to soaring land or stock prices 
that seem to be disrupting Japan's stable, middle-class society. 
</P>
<P>
While the press speculated and philosophized, police methodically investigated. 
Paper wrappers around the cash carried dates and the names of several credit 
unions in the Kawasaki area, outside Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the wrappers with bank records, police eventually focused on the 
president of a mail-order business, Kasuyasu Noguchi, 46, who had made sizable 
withdrawals two and three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Noguchi recently held a press conference and said, yes, the money belonged to 
him. Bowing deeply, he apologized to the people of the world for the trouble he 
had caused. 
</P>
<P>
But Noguchi's explanation, as provided to reporters and more fully to police, 
was "beyond comprehension," Yomiuri said. 
</P>
<P>
Noguchi said he actually had earned the cash in the early 1970s, speculating in 
stamps and other things. A thief had been stalking his office, he told police, 
so for years he carried the money in the trunk of his car. 
</P>
<P>
When Japan began printing a new type of cash, Noguchi exchanged the money for 
new bills -- thus the wrappers indicating withdrawals two and three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, his desire for the money lessened as friends were murdered or 
committed suicide in business-related matters. 
</P>
<P>
"My view of life changed," Noguchi told police. 
</P>
<P>
He resolved to give the money away, he said, but -- acknowledging that he had 
failed to pay taxes on the income -- he feared a tax audit if he donated the 
money in his own name. So, he said, in October, 1987, he left $2 million in the 
bamboo grove, hoping someone worthy would find it. 
</P>
<P>
He was "relieved" when someone recovered the money, he said. If he gets it 
back, he said he will donate it for research into children's diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they found the explanation puzzling but that they saw no basis for 
further criminal investigation. Tax authorities said they would investigate, 
but income earned so long ago would be beyond their reach. 
</P>
<P>
Seiei Sato, the grilled-chicken seller who found the first chunk of cash, said 
he, too, remained mystified by Noguchi's account, but might be willing to 
settle for a 20% finder's fee and go back to serving yakitori. "It's 
troublesome," he said. "My head is already in a chaotic condition." 
</P>
<P>
The elderly owner of the bamboo grove said he did not care about the money but 
he was unhappy that people were taking his bamboo shoots.

<TEXT>
<P>
Seventeen high school students from the San Fernando, Santa Clarita, Conejo and 
Simi valleys are among 1,800 recipients of National Merit $2,000 Scholarships 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit National Merit Scholarship Corp., founded in 1955, honors 
students based on superior academic and extracurricular accomplishments, 
reflecting their potential to flourish in college. 
</P>
<P>
A national 16-person committee, consisting of college admissions officers and 
secondary school counselors, chooses each state's winners in proportion to the 
size of the state's graduating class. 
</P>
<P>
Each student receives a single allotment of $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of National Merit Scholarships are: 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey A. Talvola of Agoura, Agoura High School; Michael P. Markmiller of 
Calabasas, Viewpoint School; Lynn E. Lapoe of Glendale, Glendale High School; 
Christina J. Dixon, Matthew L. Mayers and Mark L. Paskowitz, all of Granada 
Hills and Granada Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer J. Yem of North Hollywood, North Hollywood High School; Erica B. 
Palmer of Saugus, Saugus High School; Gregory Engel and Kathryn Lin, both of 
Sherman Oaks and the Buckley School; Omar B. Skulason of Simi Valley, Simi 
Valley High School; Grace S. Bhudhikanok of Van Nuys, Birmingham High School. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys residents Susan S. Huang, Van Nuys High School, and Gayle T. Isa, 
Ulysses S. Grant High School; Thousand Oaks residents Jennifer K. Connor, La 
Reina High School, and Stephen C. Yen, Thousand Oaks High School, and Marc 
Sarti of Woodland Hills, Taft High School. 
</P>
<P>
There are two other categories of National Merit awards: corporate-sponsored 
scholarships, which are offered to students who have qualifications of 
particular interest to a sponsoring corporation, and college-sponsored awards 
that are given to students who will attend colleges and universities that 
finance Merit Scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 Merit Scholarships, totaling about $24 million, are offered 
annually. The program is funded by more than 600 independent-sponsor 
organizations and institutions.

THE PETER PRINCIPAL; 
</P>
<P>
CATHY RIGBY HAS FOUND A STAGE ROLE, AND A SELF, THAT SHE'S HAPPY WITH 
</P>

<P>
For Cathy Rigby, it took a lot of growing up to play the boy who wouldn't grow 
up. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot, 90-odd-pound blond marvel on the balance beam, whom America fell in 
love with during the 1968 and '72 Olympics, spent nearly 12 years battling 
bulimia -- an eating disorder in which she binged on food, then used laxatives 
or self-induced vomiting to keep her weight down. She also weathered a divorce 
from former professional football player Tommy Mason, father of her two oldest 
children, Buck, 13, and Ryan, 9. 
</P>
<P>
Rigby never won an Olympic medal, but she won a dozen in international 
competitions between the Mexico City and Munich Games. 
</P>
<P>
At 36, and a still-tiny 100 pounds after recovering from bulimia, Rigby is 
married to Tom McCoy, president of their joint production company, with whom 
she also has two children: Theresa, 6, and Kaitlin, 3. Today, Rigby lectures 
about eating disorders. 
</P>
<P>
She also throws the same passion into theater that she once gave to gymnastics. 
When she makes her San Diego debut in Starlight Musical Theatre's "Peter Pan" 
at the Civic Theatre tonight through June 4, it will mark 15 years since she 
first tackled the part for NBC Entertainment in Sacramento. Rigby soared there, 
but only physically. The production used voice-overs. 
</P>
<P>
Intent on a stage career, Rigby took singing lessons during those 15 years, and 
was rewarded with another shot at "Peter Pan" at the Long Beach Civic Light 
Opera Assn. in 1986. Robert Koehler of The Times compared her favorably with 
the most famous actresses in the role, Mary Martin and Sandy Duncan. Rigby has 
also played in "Meet Me in Saint Louis" and "Paint Your Wagon" and was lavishly 
reviewed for her work as Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz" two years ago at the 
Terrace Theatre in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But Peter Pan is Rigby's favorite role, and she and her husband plan to take 
the show on a 29-city tour. They are booked at the Pantages Theatre in Los 
Angeles next May and they have their "fingers crossed for Broadway," Rigby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those shows that is perfect for me," Rigby said on a rehearsal 
break in Balboa Park. "The singing is perfect for the kind of voice I have. 
Having the athletic and gymnastic background makes it easier for me. And, 
because I'm so small, I look like one of the lost boys." 
</P>
<P>
Still, though her athletic background is definitely a plus in a role she 
equates with "running a 440 and singing with a vise around you" (the vise 
refers to the flying harness she wears for the part), she does not want to be 
known as the Olympic Peter Pan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough being an athlete walking in, even though I have done it for the 
last 15 years," she said. "I do a handstand here and there if it comes 
naturally. But I don't want people to think, 'This is Cathy Rigby, so we'll all 
have some gymnastics now.' " 
</P>
<P>
What Rigby likes best about Peter Pan is his confidence -- a quality that took 
her years to develop. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most telling connections between her athletic and dramatic careers 
is the way each has cracked and finally released her from the timid shell she 
had as a child. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of the shyest people in high school," Rigby recalled. "If anyone had 
asked me to sing, I would have turned away and cried, I would have been so 
embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
"But I did have confidence in gymnastics. . . . I learned that you might fall 
on your backside, but then you 
</P>
<P>
get up. You make a commitment and you go through with it. You may not be great 
at first, but you get through it, and then you get better." 
</P>
<P>
But confidence in gymnastics did not always carry over to the rest of her life. 
One thing Rigby said she had to learn was that, although striving for 
perfection in gymnastics might lead to success, striving for perfection in life 
was more likely to lead to disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I was still very shy until I made a life change and met my current husband," 
Rigby said. "I thought that (with) every bad move I made in life, people might 
be taking points off of me, just like in gymnastics. I never learned to express 
feelings and didn't even know what my feelings were. I was the image of Cathy 
Rigby who never had an opinion of her own, just what was given to her. 
</P>
<P>
"Then my husband said (that) as an actress you will never grow if you never 
take chances. He said it's OK to be human and to make mistakes. That's the only 
way you will build strength." 
</P>
<P>
She smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"It only took me 10 years to understand that. I was fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Does she miss athletic competition? 
</P>
<P>
She shook her head vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a lot more fun than the Olympics," she said. "When you get an 
opportunity once every four years to prove yourself, and you have to do what 
you can on this 4-inch piece of apparatus, it is pressured, it's exciting, it's 
anxious and there's a sigh of relief when it's over, especially if you've done 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to make the show as perfect as I can, but here it's not about being 
perfect as gymnastics is. It's about reaching out to the audience and holding 
them in the palm of your hand. You're trying to have a good time with it. 
</P>
<P>
"The closest parallel to the Olympics is opening night, because you have the 
critics there and you're self-critical instead of just letting go." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, she is not worried about this particular opening night. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel confident now. I've done this too many times not to feel confident. I 
know that sounds like Peter Pan saying, 'I'm pleased with myself,' but I've 
just gotten to that point where I know what the reaction will be." 
</P>
<P>
Rigby hesitated for just a moment, her brown eyes blinking as if unsure whether 
she should apologize for being so pleased with herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I love that feeling," she said, breaking into a grin, and looking like Peter 
Pan.

TROUPE DANCING TO ETHNICALLY TRUER DRUMBEAT

For 15 years, the Samahan Philippine Dance Company has been a bastion of what 
it thought was authentic dance from the Philippines. Under Lolita Carter's 
direction, the troupe showcased everything from primitive tribal rites to 
stately court dances in its attempt to bring the legends, ceremonials, folklore 
and social life of the Philippines to San Diego audiences. 
</P>
<P>
However, this weekend, when the troupe celebrates 15 years on the San Diego 
scene, the Samahan ensemble will be sporting a new look and dancing to a new 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, these innovations should bring the dancers closer to ethnic 
authenticity than ever before. And, as its founder stressed in a recent 
interview, the music makes all the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, the person who taught our percussion music was not 
truly authentic, so our dances were always kind of watered down," Carter said. 
"All we had to base them on was variations of variations that were handed down. 
Now we're learning the way it should be done directly from natives. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two people working with our group since January who are really 
experts," she said. "They're both world-class musicians. With their knowledge, 
we're trying to get away from the influence of modern dance and get into more 
of an ethnic look. There's a lot more theater in it -- with masks. But the 
basic difference is the music." 
</P>
<P>
Carter gives the credit for the company's return to its true roots to Danongan 
Sibay Kalanduyan, ethnomusicologist and master of the Kulintang, a rare musical 
tradition indigenous to the southernmost Philippine Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Kalanduyan, a Rockefeller Fellowship recipient in 1976, has committed to memory 
thousands of traditional musical motifs, phrasings and songs, and his influence 
on the company's repertory is substantial. 
</P>
<P>
Vocalist and composer Musiban Limbang Guiabar, a colleague of Kalanduyan, is 
another reason the Samahan is rethinking its Philippine identity these days. 
Guiabar will contribute his thick, throaty chants while Kalanduyan creates 
percussive patterns on the eight bronze gongs that make up the Kulintang. 
</P>
<P>
"When they were in San Francisco for five years, they weren't allowed to work 
with any other group," Carter said. "But we were the first company they called 
when they left because they had heard good things about us. Naturally, I 
invited them to come right down." 
</P>
<P>
With help from a COMBO grant and frantic fund-raising efforts, the Samahan 
dancers found the necessary support for the musical masters who inspired the 
troupe's new thrust. They're hoping to keep both around -- at least long enough 
for the musicians to pass on their art to the new crop waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe will perform at 8 p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday, and the program 
will be a major turning point for the troupe, as Carter pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting an entirely new repertory, and we'll be working with a smaller 
group. We'll really be going deeper into authentic ethnic dance and trying to 
get away from the big ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
"For our October concert, we'll be doing more duets and trios," she said. "No 
more flashy ensembles. This concert will still have a lot of our old repertory. 
But I have an idea of going on tour someday, and you can't tour with a big 
group." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's program will abound with visual spectacle. The ornately costumed 
"Singkil" is back on the bill, with veteran dancer Ruby Chiong stepping in and 
out of the crashing bamboo poles yet another time. This dangerous-looking 
dance, performed barefoot and at breakneck speed, requires split-second timing 
and the kind of fleet-footed precision that has been the hallmark of this 
delicate dancer for years. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been able to develop a professional group because you get kids that 
stay for a while, and then go off somewhere," Carter said. "It's hard to get 
support. But we have Ruby Chiong, who is 35 now but still looks 18, and we have 
Tony Salamat from the Philippines. And this group is one of the best I've had." 
</P>
<P>
Philippine dance is a melting pot of styles, but this weekend's program will 
concentrate on the dances of the southern Philippine Islands. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of influence from Indonesia," Carter said. "The hand movements 
are very much like Oriental, and there's a lot of head movements and 
off-centered positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got some small drums and gongs from the Philippines. When (Kalanduyan 
and Guiabar) saw the instruments we were using, they said, 'Throw them out,' so 
we replaced them with real authentic ones. They make the dances better -- more 
exciting -- now that we're dancing to really good music."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO;

<P>
SAX MAN'S SATISFACTION DAWNS AFTER 30 YEARS 
</P>

<P>
How long does it take to master the tenor sax? Joe Marillo has seen the 
Wanna-be's come and go, signing up for lessons with visions of blowing like 
Coltrane overnight. When they find out the kind of dedication it takes, they 
generally drop out in a matter of months. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike several of his ex-students, though, Marillo, 50, has continued his music 
for almost 30 years, and only recently has he begun to feel satisfied with his 
work, especially his improvisations. 
</P>
<P>
"I just recorded us a few weeks ago at Croce's, and I was thrilled," he said. 
"This was the first time where I listened to the playback, and I said, 
'Finally, I'm making sense.' It's the melodic line which has always been the 
hardest thing for me. I've always been scattered, and I wasn't one to sit down 
for hours and figure it out. I've always liked my feeling and expression, but 
never my melodic line." 
</P>
<P>
Marillo attributes the melodic breakthroughs in part to his second career the 
past six months as a cocktail-hour pianist at Vic's in La Jolla. The piano work 
has helped him hear fresh possibilities for the sax, he said. Another factor 
has been the presence of his brother, Tony, on drums for several of the recent 
Croce's dates. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a certain musical rapport," Marillo said. "I've never had a real 
commitment with a drummer." Marillo's current band also includes Steve Smith on 
bass and Forrest Westbrook on piano. 
</P>
<P>
Marillo was born in Niagara Falls, N.Y. He studied at Berklee School of Music 
and Granoff School of Music (John Coltrane's alma mater) before heading west. 
He worked with show bands in Las Vegas before moving to San Diego in 1972, 
where he was one of the first to book major jazz talent here, luring names like 
Stan Getz, Woody Herman, Carmen McRae and Sarah Vaughan to the Catamaran. He 
also played behind them. 
</P>
<P>
As a teacher, Marillo has taught a whole new generation of San Diego sax 
talents including Tripp Sprague, Steve Feierabend and Mark Lessman. 
</P>
<P>
Now that his sound satisfies him, he's eager to replace his casual self-made 
recordings with serious ones. He hopes to do a high-quality live session, 
possibly at Croce's, where you can hear him Saturday evenings and leading the 
Sunday night jam sessions through the month of June. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans sometimes overlook the stature of our local jazz talent. A reminder 
is visible in the new issue of Downbeat, the jazz magazine, which gives a 4 
1/2-star rating (out of five) to San Diego pianist Mike Wofford's new album on 
the Discovery label, a tribute to composer-arranger Gerald Wilson. "Wofford . . 
. is solid in his comping and subdued in his soloing," reviewer Fred Bouchard 
writes. "Wofford brings subtle, new harmonic extensions to Wilson's 
compositions with cohesive swing and energy." 
</P>
<P>
Local drummer Jim Plank is best known for his work in jazz, which he plays in a 
variety of settings, including the house rhythm section at Elario's, where he 
usually joins Wofford and San Diego bass player Bob Magnusson. But Plank is a 
double agent: he has also signed to a 37-week contract with the San Diego 
Symphony, handling percussion duties ranging from snare drum and cymbals to 
tympany. On some evenings during symphony season, he finishes his classical 
duties, then races to Elario's in time to play the last set or two. Plank is 
one of several musicians doing both San Diego Symphony work and jazz: others 
include bassists Don Hermanns and Jon Green, both session players based in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Plank, Magnusson and San Diego pianist Randy Porter have been tapped to back 
jazz singer Diane Schuur at her Humphrey's gig in August. San Diego sax player 
Benny Hollman and several members of his big band are also doing dates during 
Humphrey's summer concert series. They recently backed the Four Tops and the 
Temptations, and are slated to appear with Little Anthony on July 30, Lou Rawls 
on Aug. 9, and, if her canceled date is re-scheduled, singer Natalie Cole. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans suddenly seem surprised to find a minimum expenditure required at 
Elario's, the La Jolla jazz club. A recent letter to the Jazz Link, the local 
jazz paper, expresses one jazz fan's dismay at the cost. But Steve Satkowski, 
who books the talent at the club, said the minimum is nothing new. It has 
always ranged from $5 to $10 per set for drinks or food. And, he points out, 
Elario's still looks like a steal compared to clubs like the Blue Note in New 
York City, with its $10 minimum -- plus a cover charge of $5 to $25. Humphrey's 
is getting $20 for tickets to its summer concert series, which includes jazz 
players such as Schuur, guitarists Lee Ritenour and Earl Klugh, saxophonist 
Grover Washington Jr. and the brothers Ronnie and Hubert Laws. But, with 
Humphrey's focusing on light, so-called "contemporary" jazz, Elario's is still 
the only local venue offering a steady diet of top-notch straight-ahead jazz. 
</P>
<P>
SHORT RIFFS: The live "Club Date" series, jazz shows taped by San Diego public 
television station KPBS in collaboration with Elario's, are being marketed in 
Europe by CS Associates, based in Mill Valley, Calif. . . . Guitarist Joe Pass, 
who had balked at doing one of the shows because he wanted rights to the video, 
has agreed to a July 10 "Club Date" taping, with KPBS retaining all rights. . . 
. San Diego is increasing its stock of internationally known jazz talents. Sax 
player James Moody recently got married and moved to San Diego. Pass and 
pianist Kenny Barron have also been house-shopping here. . . . Trumpeter Miles 
Davis celebrates his 63rd birthday today. KSDS-FM (88.3) is playing his music 
in chronological order all day and giving away a copy of his new album, 
"Amandla," on the air every hour.

MONTEREY PARK BUDGET CRUNCH FORCES FEE HIKES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to what officials called an immediate financial crisis, the City 
Council voted 4 to 1 Monday for across-the-board increases of fees ranging from 
the cost of an animal license to tennis lessons in the parks. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came after City Manager Mark Lewis told a council meeting that for two 
years the city has compensated for shortfalls in its operating budget by 
drawing from what is essentially the city's savings account. 
</P>
<P>
"We have both a short-term and a long-term budget problem," Lewis said. "We 
don't want to send Monterey Park on a downhill track." 
</P>
<P>
To meet expenses for this year alone, Lewis said, the city will need to take $1 
million from its reserve account to shore up a $20-million budget. That will 
leave the city with only $1.4 million in reserves. 
</P>
<P>
The increased fees, Lewis said, should boost revenues by $1.2 million in the 
coming year. The increases will occur throughout all departments and involve 
scores of fees that the city charges. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis also has tentatively proposed sweeping cuts in expenditures, totaling 
$2.3 million for the coming year's budget. As an example, Lewis said, the staff 
travel budget would be reduced from $108,000 to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts and increased revenues, he said, should correct the financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
If the council took no action, Lewis told council members, the city would have 
to reduce its basic services. Lewis notified the council of the budgetary 
problems shortly after assuming his post last year. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved a series of new fees as well as increases in existing 
fees. In some cases, city officials said, fees have not been increased in a 
decade. In addition, they said, there has been no annual review of many fees 
that have become outdated. The changes went into effect with their passage. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new fees is one that allows the city to charge drunk drivers for the 
costs incurred in their arrests and from the accidents they cause. 
</P>
<P>
The council also instituted the use of parking meters. Parking on city streets 
now is free. 
</P>
<P>
But one councilman and dozens in the audience questioned using fees to solve 
the problem. "The bureaucracy in this city is going to slurp up (the fees) like 
a hungry animal," said Councilman Christopher Houseman, who cast the lone 
dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tight Restrictions' 
</P>
<P>
Instead of increasing fees, he proposed "very, very tight restrictions" on city 
expenses. He said city departments "should be put on a very short leash." 
Houseman cited the city's cost for legal advice as one example of an expense 
that needs to be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
And Marie Purvis, a Chamber of Commerce board member, told the council: "You 
better start thinking about the effects of this on the people you're getting 
the fees from." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, she cited business licenses. Under the approved changes, the 
cost rose from $63 per license to $75. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Chiang, administrator of the Best Western Monterey Park Inn, argued 
about another increase -- the room tax charged hotels and motel guests. He 
suggested a 10% room tax instead of the 12% tax that the council eventually 
approved. "I understand the city budget problems," he said, but he said a jump 
from 8% to 12% was too much. 
</P>
<P>
Increases in the room tax alone, Lewis said, will mean an additional $200,000 
in revenues in the coming year. And, he said, a 250-room hotel is in the 
planning stages for the city's Los Angeles Corporate Center. With a 12% room 
tax, that hotel is expected to add $150,000 in annual revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Barry L. Hatch and three of his colleagues said the fee increases were 
necessary. "We're not trying to stick it to anybody," Hatch said. "We're trying 
to keep this city afloat. Something has to give. And we're going to have to do 
some belt-tightening." 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope people understand how critical the situation is," Councilwoman 
Judy Chu said. "It would be completely irresponsible not to go ahead with some 
of these proposals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parking Meters 
</P>
<P>
And the city manager said the council chose to "focus the burden of these 
increases away from the residential taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
The council did respond to concerns from student leaders of East Los Angeles 
College, who were worried about the impact of 50-cents-an-hour parking meters 
proposed for streets around the school. 
</P>
<P>
"Please help us students out," said Juan Gaspar, student government treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to eliminate 265 parking meters planned for the school area. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of city finances came from the firefighters union, which earlier this 
month began negotiating for a new contract. The group's three-year contract 
expires in July. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the city is in dire straits," said union President Kevin 
Olinger. "But we're stuck in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Olinger supported the fee increases as a way "to pay your employees a basic 
competitive salary." 
</P>
<P>
He also said the union fully supported a proposal for the Fire Department to be 
consolidated into the Los Angeles County fire system, because it could save 
Monterey Park nearly $600,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposal Studied 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to start walking the streets and tell people that the city can't 
come close to competing with salaries and benefits that the county can offer," 
Olinger said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he is studying a proposal from the county Fire Department but that 
he has questions about whether it would be economical for the city to give up 
its department to the county. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters applauded Houseman when he asked how the contract negotiations 
were being handled by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Houseman also criticized Lewis for hiring an assistant city manager and an 
administrative intern just before Lewis announced budgetary problems last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch defended Lewis, saying that the city manager had done a great job in 
drawing the council's attention to the city's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch also said that Lewis had cleaned up City Hall. "Bribery was going on in 
this community for services rendered," Hatch said. "If you were one of the old 
boys, you got treated like one of the old boys. There was politics from one end 
of City Hall to the other." 
</P>
<P>
In interviews later, neither Hatch nor Lewis wanted to go into detail about 
these allegations. Hatch would only say: "(The bribery) is all water under the 
bridge." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis did disclose, however, that soon after he joined the city last August, he 
heard rumors about corruption in what was then called the city's Engineering 
and Building Division and ordered a Police Department investigation. A police 
report, Lewis said, concluded that one building inspector probably took small 
amounts of money from several developers in exchange for waiving certain 
requirements during the early 1980s. The inspector died in a car accident, 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be unfair to cast any aspersions upon any current member of the city 
staff," Lewis said. "This was an isolated individual, an isolated problem."

SANTA MONICA VOTES CURBS ON COMMERCIAL BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to slow a recent barrage of commercial development, Santa Monica 
has slapped an emergency moratorium on many kinds of non-residential 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
With several notable exceptions, the city is banning new office buildings, 
stores and hotels for the next 10 months and 15 days. Projects that were in the 
works as of May 2, however, are exempted. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium -- approved unanimously by the Santa Monica City Council on 
Tuesday night -- similarly exempts building on city- or state-owned land and 
along the downtown Third Street Mall, as well as projects that measure less 
than 22,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the moratorium will be used to conduct nine public workshops and 
four studies on topics ranging from traffic to building heights. In addition to 
outside consultants, three full- and part-time staff members will be assigned 
to the task, which City Manager John Jalili estimated will cost $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the council's meeting Tuesday, the moratorium clearly had the votes 
to pass unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
The only outstanding issue was whether the new law should include exemptions 
for so-called hardship cases, in which a property owner has invested 
considerable time, energy and money in a project but missed the cutoff date for 
submitting permit applications. 
</P>
<P>
After extensive debate, council members agreed to ask the city attorney's 
office to draft a separate ordinance to set up a procedure for entertaining 
hardship cases. That measure will return to the council next week. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a serious mistake not to recognize hardships," land-use attorney 
Christopher M. Harding, who represents several developers, argued before the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have any doubt that there may be a (hardship) case out there somewhere 
. . . you have to leave some flexibility in the ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
Council members heard from representatives of the Latigo Realty Corp., a 
Houston-based firm that late last year bought a lot on Wilshire Boulevard for 
$4.2 million and planned to build a three-story office building. 
</P>
<P>
Latigo Western Division Manager Gerald Chong said his company sought to "follow 
the spirit of development in Santa Monica" and spent several months meeting 
with neighbors to hear their complaints about the project and find solutions to 
potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
In so doing, Chong said, the firm was caught by surprise when the moratorium 
was approved and had not filed its application. The case appeared to draw some 
sympathy from officials because the developer had been working with 
neighborhood groups. 
</P>
<P>
But others cautioned that including a hardship provision would invite a deluge 
of last-minute claims of pending projects. 
</P>
<P>
"You're walking into a snake pit," Councilman David Finkel said. "This is a 
very big mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Finkel and Councilwoman Judy Abdo, who originally proposed the moratorium, 
voted against considering a hardship provision but were outnumbered by four 
votes in favor of it. A move to extend the May 2 cutoff date to the end of the 
month also failed. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was prompted by growing complaints from residents that an 
unprecedented boom in commercial development is leading to unmanageable traffic 
and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The city said that in 1987, a building permit was issued for a single 
commercial project totaling just over 1 million square feet. The next year, the 
amount of planned commercial construction nearly tripled, with the city issuing 
permits for 23 projects totaling 2.84 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
And as of May 10 this year, approvals had been granted for 12 projects totaling 
436,304 square feet, with applications pending for 31 projects totaling 3.5 
million square feet. All are exempt from the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
The surge is especially dramatic because Santa Monica is emerging from a period 
of relatively limited commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
"(Recent development) was too much, too fast," Abdo said. "A community can't go 
through that kind of change in two years. Everybody knows that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium has been criticized, however, for its numerous exemptions. Some 
slow-growth activists contend that the measure is an empty gesture because so 
many large projects in the works will be allowed to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most controversial exemptions are a 1.4-million-square-foot office 
and studio complex planned for city-owned land at Santa Monica Airport and a 
luxury hotel planned for the current site of the private Sand and Sea Club on 
Santa Monica's state-owned beach.

DOWNEY LOOKS AT PROPOSED BUDGET DURING WAGE TALKS

<P>
The City Council is considering a $52.4-million budget for 1989-90 while city 
officials negotiate new labor contracts with more than 400 city workers. 
</P>
<P>
The budget proposal submitted by the city manager is 9.2% greater than last 
year, while operating expenditures of $41.1 million, estimated to be mostly 
salaries, are up 7.2%. The budget increase will be financed by an expected rise 
in property and sales tax revenues, according to City Manager Don Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said there will be no increase in taxes in the budget, but there will be 
small increases in homeowner water fees to finance sewer maintenance and 
nominal increases in user fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fees to Cover Costs 
</P>
<P>
Lee Powell, director of administrative services, said the sewer-maintenance fee 
will increase water rates from $1.60 to $1.74 every two months. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not going to go up so very much. The idea is to have the fees cover more 
of the related cost of the service," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
User fees for building and plan checks, fire inspection and emergency 
transportation will be increased to more accurately reflect the cost of those 
services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said labor contracts with police, fire, maintenance, and general 
employees expire June 30. The city is negotiating a two-year contract with 439 
workers in five separate bargaining units. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the budget contains funds for pay increases, but he could not say 
how much money was earmarked for that purpose. "Hopefully, the level of funding 
is adequate, but we are currently negotiating with our employee groups, only 
time will tell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary budget gives top priority to police and fire services with the 
Police Department receiving 38.3% and the Fire Department getting 21.7% of the 
$41.1 million in operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the budget is fair and contains no reductions in city personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm comfortable with it. It is a balanced budget with no new taxes. There are 
some user fee increases, but we feel that they are reasonable," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improvements on Hold 
</P>
<P>
Several new positions are proposed, including a fire inspector responsible for 
enforcement of hazardous-material regulations, a principal building inspector, 
a second police officer to bring drug education to middle schools for the DARE 
program, two street sweeping enforcement officers, a maintenance worker to 
enforce parking regulation and a parking permit inspector to review 
applications for special permits. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues are expected to total $48,485,466 in 1989-90. More than half is 
designated for the General Fund -- $29,735,612, 8.6% more than last year's 
$28.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
A shortage of capital improvement funds will delay improvements in the 
Children's Library and the parking shelter at Fire Department headquarters.

ACTIVISTS HIT $10,000 GOAL TO SAVE EAGLE ROCK, AND THEY'RE STILL GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eagle Rock activists have raised $10,000 as part of an effort to persuade city 
officials to buy the 50-foot boulder from which the community gets its name. 
</P>
<P>
The mark was set as an initial fund-raising goal. But the activists say they 
are not stopping now. 
</P>
<P>
The Save the Eagle Rock Committee, a community group formed last year to fight 
a developer's proposal to build apartments on the land that includes the rock, 
is asking the city to create a public park on the 2.2-acre lot. 
</P>
<P>
The committee reached its self-imposed goal by selling paperweights in the 
shape of the rock and T-shirts with "Save the Eagle Rock" printed on them. The 
group also organized a pancake breakfast that drew city officials, including 
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we've found out how easy it is, we're gonna change the goal to 
$20,000," said Katie Smith, chairwoman of the committee. "You can tell 
everybody we're not stopping." 
</P>
<P>
The residents who formed the committee have said that if the city does not find 
the money to buy the property north of the Pasadena Freeway, they will buy it 
themselves. Their effort has gained widespread support in Eagle Rock and among 
residents groups throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said they will do everything they can to buy the land at a 
reasonable price. In November, the city hired an appraiser who estimated the 
value of the land at $500,000, said Brad Sales, spokesman for Councilman 
Richard Alatorre. The city Department of Recreation and Parks has set aside 
$230,000 to purchase the land, and a number of city officials have said they 
support the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are also exploring the possibility of swapping a city-owned lot 
for the land that includes the rock, Sales said. 
</P>
<P>
The southwest portion of the rock is a sheer cliff that looms imposingly above 
the Ventura Freeway. The cliff has an indentation in its face that produces an 
eagle-shaped shadow in the afternoon. The entire rock formation was declared a 
historical monument in 1982 by the city's Cultural Heritage Board but was not 
acquired by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the movement to save the rock has brought the Eagle Rock community 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"There were groups of people that wouldn't talk to each other before we got 
this thing started, but everybody will get together to raise money for the 
rock," Smith said. "I think as long as we've got something going that keeps 
people talking, we ought to be doing more of it. . . ."

GLENDALE TEACHERS TO DECIDE BETWEEN CONTRACT, STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale teachers will be asked next week to ratify a contract that provides 
for 22.7% in pay raises over three years or face a possible strike in the fall, 
union representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
A union council Tuesday set a vote for Tuesday and Wednesday on the contract 
after action was delayed two weeks to give teachers more time to study the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Noyes, one of three elementary school representatives on the union's 
executive council, said he is urging members to accept the contract. "A no vote 
on the contract is a strike vote," said Noyes, a former union president and 
member of the negotiating team. "I see more problems instead of solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the contract, which gives larger raises to teachers who are the best 
trained and have served the longest, have caused division in the union, members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The union in March declared an impasse in negotiations but agreed this month to 
put the district's offer to a vote of its members. The union has taken no 
official stand on the contract, said Mark Desetti, president of the Glendale 
Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Leinenweber, a union teacher representative at Crescenta Valley High 
School, said the salary restructuring will leave two-thirds of the teachers in 
the district with lower increases in the second and third years of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Only teachers who have earned a master's degree are eligible for the highest 
raises. "They are forcing many of us to go back to school to get a master's 
degree," Leinenweber said. "We are paying for this restructuring." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Duncan, district director of personnel and employee relations, said 
union representatives sought the restructuring option rather than 
across-the-board raises for all teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the proposed contract, all teachers would be granted an 8% raise 
this year, retroactive to Sept. 1. Raises next year would range from 6.5% to 
11.2% and, in the following year, from 5.75% to 11.93%. Teachers now are not 
eligible for raises after 12 years with the district. The new contract would 
grant raises after 18 and 22 years, providing a top salary of $54,301 by 
September, 1990 -- a 34.7% jump over the present maximum of $40,312. 
</P>
<P>
Starting salaries would increase from $22,536 to $27,411 during the same 
period. The average salary of $33,117 would climb to $41,000, placing Glendale 
salaries in the top third of the county's 43 unified school districts, Duncan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers would lose the raise this year if a contract is not approved by June 
30, he said.

TEACHERS FIND RESPITE FROM STRIKE WITH A FRIENDLY GAME OF SOFTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking a brief respite from the frustrating strike that has crippled Los 
Angeles schools for the second week, teachers from Venice and University high 
schools exchanged their picket signs for bats, balls and gloves and played a 
tough game of softball. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second game organized by what is referred to as the Westside 
District's Striking Teachers Softball League. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the game, said Sharon Gebhart, a striking Venice High School 
improvement coordinator, is to "give people a chance to blow off some steam, 
relieve some pressure and tension. Softball provides a good release." 
</P>
<P>
About 50 teachers and some student onlookers showed up Tuesday at the dusty 
playing field at Mar Vista Recreation Center. Most came directly from the 
picket lines. Signs reading, "No Contract, No Work" hung from the fence. Venice 
High teachers brought a banner proclaiming, "Venice High Striking Teachers 
Softball." 
</P>
<P>
There were coolers filled with beer, trays of fresh fruit and bagels and 
croissants. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to seem frivolous, but we are on strike, not dead," said John 
Reece, a University High School English teacher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Break From Tensions' 
</P>
<P>
Jim Blackwood, Venice High's social studies department chairman, said that he 
had come to see some "striking teachers strike out." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little break from the tensions of the strike," he said, echoing the 
sentiments of several teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Like most schools in the district, Venice and University high schools have been 
hard hit by the strike. Teachers at the two schools say more than 90% of their 
colleagues have been out, and student attendance is down. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Borenstein, an English teacher at University, said a game of softball 
gives teachers a greater sense of belonging. "We need to feel that we are not 
alone," she said. "Teaching is a very isolated profession. This builds 
camaraderie, it gives us a sense that we are not alone." 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Demopoulos, 17, one of about a dozen student spectators, said, "It is 
good to see them doing this and putting aside the pressures of the strike and 
not getting an income." 
</P>
<P>
The game was close from beginning to end. By the end of the third, the score 
was tied at 3. University picked up two runs in the fourth, but Venice tied the 
game on a towering home run by Kirk Alexander, Venice High's baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a high pitch, and I tagged it good," he said. "As one of my kids would 
say, I turned on it and powered it out. It was a lucky swing." 
</P>
<P>
By the ninth inning, University had once again pulled ahead 8 to 7. During 
Venice's last turn at bat, Grant Francis, a wood shop and theater arts teacher, 
led with a single. He made it as far as third base before the side was retired 
and the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
"I just died out there on third base, wishing and a hoping that I could see 
that plate under my feet, but it never happened," he said. "It was a good 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Reiko Ishimaru, a math teacher at University who made three spectacular catches 
in the outfield, including a game-saving grab in the ninth, was named most 
valuable player. A week earlier, she said, she felt like the team goat when she 
dropped the ball in a loss to Hamilton High School. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, the teachers began scheduling their next encounters on the 
baseball diamond. If the strike continues, Venice will try to redeem itself in 
a game against Hamilton this week. University will try to stretch its winning 
streak to two games in a contest against Palisades High.

SUPERVISORS VOTE TO EASE SOME BUILDING RULES IN OJAI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors this week relaxed construction rules in 
the Ojai Valley, bowing to protests from hundreds of landowners who claimed 
that a clerical error by planning officials had stymied their building plans. 
</P>
<P>
Despite strict limits on residential development for the area, the board on 
Tuesday ordered staff to prepare an ordinance that would make building permits 
available to anyone with proof that they had begun seeking approval for a new 
home before May 5. 
</P>
<P>
It was on that date that county planners discovered that they had mistakenly 
issued too many permits for the smog-prone valley and immediately ordered a 
freeze on construction there. 
</P>
<P>
To help remedy the situation, the supervisors last week agreed to allow 104 
residents who had already received clearance to proceed with their plans, even 
though their homes would exceed annual limits set by the county to curb air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
But that failed to quell the fears of another 100 to 200 prospective builders 
who contended that county planners had told them that there would be no problem 
in obtaining the necessary permits. 
</P>
<P>
In what the planning staff Tuesday called a "conscientious, reasonable" 
solution, landowners were given a list of 23 documents, any one of which could 
serve as proof that a builder had been seeking approval prior to the 
moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Those documents include grading permits, letters of commitment from a water 
company, sewage disposal reviews, payment of school district fees and flood 
control clearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine how frustrating it would be to go to the counter in October and be 
told there was no problem," Supervisor James. R. Dougherty said, "and then come 
back in November and be told, 'We're sorry.' " 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, there were 178 applications for Ojai Valley building permits on 
the county Planning Department's waiting list, but officials didn't know how 
many of those would qualify for permits under the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
At the board meeting, however, about two dozen builders -- who now might have 
to wait until 1993 to obtain permits -- complained that the proposed remedy did 
not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Many said they had sold their homes, purchased lots in the Ojai Valley and even 
obtained construction loans, but did not have any of the 23 documents required 
by the county. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a couple hundred thousand into a project and virtually have something of 
no value right now," said Brad Hughes, a real estate agent who plans to build 
on a vacant parcel he owns in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's morally fair . . . and I don't think it's legal," agreed 
Andrew Pollet of Oak View. "It was the error that prompted and encouraged 
people to buy lots and expend large sums of money." 
</P>
<P>
But many would-be builders would have been thwarted by the Ojai Valley Clean 
Air Ordinance anyway, said planning officials. 
</P>
<P>
Planners said they discovered the error May 5 after recalculating numbers 
during a routine discussion of the clean-air ordinance, which called for 156 
residential permits to be issued for the Ojai Valley in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number Exceeded 
</P>
<P>
When they realized that number had been exceeded, they immediately stopped 
issuing permits. Even so, 104 landowners in excess of the limit had already 
received clearance to build this year, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate those additional homes, officials said they will have to borrow 
from future allocations, which call for 94 homes to be built annually in the 
area for the next five years. That would entail using the entire allocation for 
1990, as well as a portion of the 1991 allocation, to absorb the excess permits 
issued this year. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodating any others who will qualify for permits under the new ordinance 
will probably entail borrowing from allocations well into 1992 and perhaps 
beyond, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Baggerly, a spokesman for Citizens to Preserve the Ojai and the Ventura 
County Environmental Coalition, conceded that there would be an adverse impact 
from the boom in construction over the next couple of years, but said it would 
level out over time. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there was a mistake," Baggerly said. "But they're doing their best 
to deal with the problem."

STATE BAR INVESTIGATES NOLAN OVER FAKE LETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The California State Bar has opened an investigation into possible ethical 
violations by Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) in connection with the forgery 
of former President Ronald Reagan's signature on campaign letters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Harker, the State Bar's assistant chief trial counsel in San Francisco, 
said Monday that Nolan, a lawyer, took "an oath and has the duty to obey all 
laws . . . and not to do anything deceitful or dishonest. And that's something 
we're looking at." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan said he did not have a reaction to the investigation because "they 
haven't contacted me. So how could I have a reaction?" 
</P>
<P>
The State Bar licenses and disciplines lawyers. The penalty for ethical 
violations ranges from a reprimand to disbarment. But Harker cautioned that he 
has no idea if any discipline would be sought against Nolan, whose 41st 
Assembly District includes Glendale, part of Pasadena, Eagle Rock and Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
In March, state prosecutors acknowledged that they had sought to indict Nolan 
for his role in the phony letters case but decided after presenting the case to 
a grand jury that they could not prove that Nolan had committed a crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forgery Count 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp obtained an indictment against 
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), with a single count of forgery stemming 
from the mailing of as many as 480,000 phony endorsements in six Assembly 
races, including the campaign of Republican Henry Velasco, who unsuccessfully 
challenged Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park). Lewis has pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Prosectors told a Sacramento County grand jury that Nolan and Lewis "knew prior 
to the letters being distributed that there had been no authorization from the 
President or the White House or the Republican National Committee." But no 
witness linked Nolan directly to the order to send the letters without White 
House authorization. 
</P>
<P>
Harker said his office opened its inquiry in November after receiving a 
complaint against Nolan and reviewing news articles on the attorney general's 
investigation of Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, investigators are reading copies of the 350-page grand jury 
transcript to determine if there is "any substantial evidence of ethical 
violations" by Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan, the former Assembly Republican leader, is one of five elected state 
officials targeted in a 3 1/2-year-old federal investigation into political 
corruption in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Harker declined to comment on whether his inquiry would focus on Nolan's role 
in the federal investigation.

FRIEDMAN RANKS FIRST IN 1988 ASSEMBLY OFFICE EXPENSES WITH $332,552 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) spent $332,552 -- more than any 
of the Assembly's 79 other members -- on his office expenses during the 1988 
legislative session, according to figures released by the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman's total was 19% higher than the Assembly average of $279,192 for the 
12 months ending last Nov. 30. It was $10,270 ahead of the $322,282 accounted 
for by the second-ranking spender, former Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-Big 
Bear). 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem with anyone examining the way every penny was spent because 
it was spent prudently," Friedman said. "There's no excessive salaries. There's 
no frivolous expenditures. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons cited by Friedman for his top ranking are the cost of renting 
his Sherman Oaks office, the cost of mailing newsletters to his Westside and 
San Fernando Valley constituents and a bookkeeping delay that caused some 1987 
expenses to be paid in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
43rd District 
</P>
<P>
Friedman's 43rd District includes Beverly Hills, part of West Hollywood, 
Bel-Air, Brentwood and part of Westwood in West Los Angeles and Studio City, 
Encino and Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The figures, released last Friday, are compiled annually and released by the 
Assembly Rules Committee. The totals include staff salaries, travel, cars, 
district office expenses, newsletters, postage, telephones, furniture, 
equipment, supplies, subscriptions and photocopying. 
</P>
<P>
The totals do not include staff and other costs connected with committee 
assignments. Some Assembly members who head committees have additional staff 
and expenses connected to their extra duties. Friedman, who is not a committee 
chairman, is a two-term lawmaker who easily won reelection last November. 
</P>
<P>
In reviewing his expenses, Friedman said his office rent is higher than rents 
in other parts of the state. He paid $20,833 a year for his Ventura Boulevard 
office, compared to the average annual local office rent of $15,863 for the 
Assembly's 80 members. 
</P>
<P>
"There ought to be an allowance for the prevailing rent in a particular 
district," Friedman said. "The fact is that it costs more to rent an office 
space in Sherman Oaks than it does in Norwalk." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Costs 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the expenses is the cost of newsletters -- $63,490 for 
Friedman. Karin Caves, a spokeswoman for Friedman, said $15,800 in newsletter 
costs incurred in late 1987 were not paid by the state controller until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Caves said Friedman's newsletter budget was higher than that of 
most other members because it was pegged to the number of registered voters per 
household. Friedman, with 103,568 households, is among the Assembly members 
with the most registered voters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But that expense has ended. Mass mailings by elected officials at public 
expense, including newsletters, were prohibited last June when voters adopted 
Proposition 73, which is being challenged in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The totals for the four other Westside Assembly members, all Democrats, were: 
Tom Hayden of Santa Monica, $295,477; Mike Roos of Los Angeles, $294,401; Gwen 
Moore of Los Angeles, $291,687; and Burt Margolin of Los Angeles, $277,030.

ATWATER VILLAGE TO LOSE ITS VIGILANT BUT TIRED PROTECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 20 minutes, slender, white-haired, hard-talking Ed Waite rolled out his 
tell-it-like-it-is monologue, the news from Atwater Village. 
</P>
<P>
He recited every zone change, every variance, every building permit, every 
demolition in the works since the last time his group got together. He added a 
word about crime and dispelled the inevitable rumors that pass through an 
aroused community. 
</P>
<P>
Last, he came to the rumor his followers were not prepared to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I am going to leave Atwater, leave Los Angeles," Waite said. "My house is 
up for sale. I divorced my wife." 
</P>
<P>
A flutter of gasps went through the Glenfeliz School auditorium. Whether they 
were for the weight of the news itself or the bluntness of the delivery was 
impossible to distinguish. 
</P>
<P>
Since Waite, now 62, founded the Atwater Village Homeowner Assn. in 1982, to 
block the construction of a church auditorium, he and his unyielding manner 
have been indivisible from its identity. 
</P>
<P>
To his followers, Waite's unexpected departure will be the loss of their eyes 
and ears, their voice in City Hall, their one, virtually unchallenged, 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
Riding his bicycle through the streets of the old and determinedly static 
residential community between Glendale and the Los Angeles River, Waite had 
monitored change with a vigilant eye. He spotted crime, zoning violations, 
abandoned vehicles and illegal construction. He reported all with equal zeal. 
</P>
<P>
In regular trips to City Hall, he tracked down the paper-work signs of coming 
development. He reported virtually every developer's move to the 100 to 200 
residents who consistently turned out at meetings. Those they didn't like, he 
fought. 
</P>
<P>
He kept the guard up to the end. 
</P>
<P>
"Over at 4040 Edenhurst you're going to have an eight-unit apartment house," 
Waite said in his final monologue last week. "The man doesn't seem to want to 
cooperate with the people in that area . . . We asked him to cut it down to 
four. He won't do it. He doesn't care about the community because he doesn't 
live here." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Waite made enemies along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Waite's opposition to a Los Feliz minimart owner's request for a city beer and 
wine license left permanent scars between Waite and leaders of the Atwater 
Village Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Ed Waite was an integral part of improving this community," 
said Gerald (Red) Meade, chamber president. "There were a lot of people who 
disagreed with him in the way he did it. I saw him persecute certain people and 
not persecute other people. 
</P>
<P>
"He never really helped the business community in any form," Meade said. 
"Whoever takes over, I certainly hope he fairly helps every part of the 
community and not just certain parts." 
</P>
<P>
Waite alluded to his detractors in his final monologue Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Councilman John Ferraro called and said, 'Hey Ed, I hear you're leaving town. 
They finally caught up with you, huh?' Well, I don't know who caught up with me 
yet. There hasn't been anybody come to my door with a shotgun." 
</P>
<P>
Waite simply pleaded fatigue as his reason for leaving the town he lived in 
since 1955. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had a vacation in 20 1/2 years," he said. "I've put in a lot of 
hours. I'm not complaining. I'm just saying I haven't had any life of my own. 
So I'm going to go and start over somewhere. I'll either go north or out of 
state." 
</P>
<P>
Waite told his followers that five people had already approached him about 
taking over the association after he is gone. He said he told them they would 
have to try it without his support because he didn't believe they were sincere. 
"That's the way I will protect the community of Atwater," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Someone from the audience asked if he might change his mind and come back some 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never return to Atwater once I leave," Waite said.

COUNTY PANEL REJECTS MALIBU HOTEL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second week in a row, the county Regional Planning Commission has 
rejected a major project in Malibu, voting Wednesday against construction of a 
410-room, five-story hotel in the Civic Center that commission members said 
does not fit into the rural character of the coastal community. 
</P>
<P>
"That's two wins in two weeks," said Sara Wan, who represented the 1,000-member 
Malibu Township Council at the hearing in downtown Los Angeles. "I think the 
commission is becoming more cognizant of the homeowners. Prior to this, they 
have just done anything the developers wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Since January, when the County Board of Supervisors approved construction of a 
regional sewer system in Malibu, "there has been almost a feeding frenzy" by 
developers hoping to get approval of their projects, Wan said. Developers seem 
to be trying to beat a vote on Malibu cityhood, which could be on the ballot as 
early as November, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, in a surprise move, the Planning Commission branded as 
"completely inappropriate" a proposal to build 62 single-family homes, a golf 
course and restaurant in the hills of western Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the commissioners refused to alter the Malibu land-use plan to allow 
construction of the luxury hotel on a hillside immediately east of the Civic 
Center. They said it would jeopardize the quality of life for property owners 
whose homes border the 18-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than testimony that the hotel should be on a hillside because the view 
is important, I have heard nothing about why we should approve a plan 
amendment," Commissioner Sadie B. Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Sewer System 
</P>
<P>
Comments of other commission members were harsher. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only premature, but -- I hesitate to use the word -- ridiculous" to 
propose the hotel without a sewer system being in place to serve it, said 
Clinton C. Ternstrom, commission chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Mahoney of Long Beach, who hopes to develop the hotel for three Florida 
businessmen, said he was not sure whether he would appeal the commission's 
denial to the Board of Supervisors, whose conservative majority generally has 
favored development in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of concerns," Mahoney said. "We were just sent back to the 
drawing board." 
</P>
<P>
His project, Mahoney had argued, would place 110 apartment-like "villas" on the 
bottom of the site, away from homes and include a 300-room hotel on a natural 
bowl-shaped slope. This design would block no homeowner views and would buffer 
some of the noise from the villas below. 
</P>
<P>
He noted in an interview that even without a change in the land-use plan, he 
can build a small hotel on the lower six acres of the cone-shaped hillside 
parcel and condominiums on the upper 12 acres, near existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Cheesy Motel' 
</P>
<P>
"Malibu could get a cheesy motel and 220 condominium units all over the 
hillside," said architect Larry Stricker, who designed the hotel project. 
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour hearing, project engineer Carl Hinderer argued that the 
county has approved three hotel projects for the Malibu area in recent years, 
including a 300-room facility by the Adamson Cos. on a nearby site. That hotel, 
however, cannot be built until a planned regional sewer system is in place. A 
smaller hotel is now being built near the Malibu Pier. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the crying needs in Malibu has been for (a) hotel," Hinderer said. 
</P>
<P>
But commissioners did not agree. They refused to allow the developer to show 
slides of the proposed project, then denied his request for a continuance of 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
They were especially disturbed by the developer's request for "bonus density," 
a county procedure that allows extra dwellings to be built if 20% are reserved 
for low- or moderate-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost can't believe what I'm hearing," Commissioner Lee Strong said. He 
said that the developer had presented a plan that was 100% commercial, 
inaccurately described his villa rentals as residential units instead of hotel 
rooms, "then asked us to bend the rules" to allow 110 villas instead of the 88 
possible under rules for residential development. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you are insulting my intelligence," Strong said. "How do you justify a 
density bonus?" 
</P>
<P>
The developer withdrew that request, and also agreed to build a small sewer 
plant for the hotel. But commissioners rejected the offer.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENA; 
</P>
<P>
SENATE OKS FREEWAY BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bill approved by the Senate on Monday to raise the state's gasoline tax 10 
cents a gallon includes an amendment by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) that 
could block efforts to build the Long Beach Freeway through South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), was approved by a 27-11 
margin and now goes to the Assembly, where further negotiations are expected on 
the controversial gas tax proposal. 
</P>
<P>
One lawmaker who is close to the issue, but who asked not to be identified, 
said he doubts that the Torres amendment will remain in the measure, partly 
because of opposition in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The one-paragraph provision inserted into the 28-page bill would prohibit the 
state from spending its funds on any state highway in Los Angeles County built 
through a historically significant site or through parks or recreation areas. 
Several routes that have been proposed for the freeway through South Pasadena 
would either require moving historic buildings or would cut through a parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Torres has said his goal is to force transportation planners to consider 
alternatives, including a light-rail line, increased utilization of surface 
streets or another freeway route.

WIDOW TO SEEK HUSBAND'S POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Pasadena City Council had the legal responsibility on May 17 to try 
to agree on an appointment to fill the vacancy left by the death of my husband, 
Councilman Joe Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, they were not in agreement. Now there will be an election for 
the vacant seat in November. This leaves the council short a fifth vote for 
more than six months. 
</P>
<P>
It is my intention to run for this seat. Joe completed exactly one year of his 
four-year term, and he wanted me to succeed him. I will work toward fulfilling 
some of Joe's plans for our town. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Crosby brought harmony to the council, and I would like to do the same. The 
first suggestion I would have is to immediately appoint Evelyn Fierro as mayor 
pro tem. She was the top vote-getter in the 1988 election and is in line for 
this appointment.

STORM-DRAIN LOAN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday tentatively approved a $710,000-loan 
from the county general fund to pay for improvements to a storm-drain system 
designed to prevent another devastating landslide on Big Rock Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The board declared its intention to forward the money to the account of a 
special drainage district whose bills must be paid by the owners of 331 homes 
and lots on the mesa. A hearing and final vote were set for June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Several mesa homeowners said in March that they were furious with the county, 
which oversees the drainage project, for approving in concept the large-scale 
expansion without estimating its cost. The $710,000 is expected to pay for part 
of the expanded system. 
</P>
<P>
The property owners must repay nearly $4.1 million that the county has spent 
since a 1983 landslide damaged or destroyed 250 homes on the mesa. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said they have had no reliable cost figures for the expanded 
project because the area's shifting geology has redefined the problem in recent 
months. But a figure should be available for a community meeting tentatively 
set for June 12, said Roger Burger, deputy director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. at Smothers Theater at 
Pepperdine University.

PAROLE OFFICE BILL ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bill by Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier) to regulate the placement of state 
parole offices has passed the Senate Judiciary Committee and will be heard by 
the Senate Appropriations Committee on June 5. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which grew out of a controversy over location of parole offices in 
the San Gabriel Valley, would require the state Department of Corrections to 
develop guidelines for choosing sites and would prohibit placement within 500 
yards of a school or park. The bill would also require the state to notify 
local governments 120 days in advance of the lease or purchase of a site. 
Current law requires notification 60 days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the bill would have blocked placement of parole offices within 
three miles of a school or park. Montoya amended the bill after corrections 
officials said it would be impossible to find suitable offices that were not 
within three miles of a school or park. 
</P>
<P>
The department has promised to close a controversial parole office in Alhambra, 
on the border with Monterey Park, and is seeking a site in Pasadena, but has 
run into strong opposition from residents.

COUNTY ALLOCATES GRANTS FOR HOMELESS PROGRAMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved $45,000 in grants for 
homeless programs in Long Beach and Venice. Another $5,000 will go to a food 
bank at a community and senior citizens center in east Compton. 
</P>
<P>
The allocations come from $50,000 set aside annually for homeless agencies in 
each of the five supervisorial districts. 
</P>
<P>
On Supervisor Deane Dana's recommendation, the Low Income and Elderly Community 
Assistance Center on Westminster Avenue in Venice was awarded $23,000, while 
the downtown Long Beach Homeless Shelter on Chestnut Avenue will get $22,000 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
The board also awarded $8,330 to the Long Beach Council PTA drug education 
program and $10,000 for the city of Lakewood to develop an anti-gang and drug 
video to be shown to community groups.

WATERS IS PARADE MARSHAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) will be the grand marshal of the 
1989 Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade June 25 in West Hollywood, officials of 
Christopher Street West, the parade's sponsor, have announced. 
</P>
<P>
Gary S. Jonker, president of Christopher Street West, said Waters was chosen 
because of her "strong voice for human rights" and her "support for the lesbian 
and gay community" since being elected to the Assembly in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Previous grand marshals have included actresses Patty Duke, Rita Moreno and 
Mamie Van Doren, county Supervisor Ed Edelman and Los Angeles City Councilman 
Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
The parade is a highlight of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Pride Celebration 
on June 24 and 25. This year's celebration marks the 20th anniversary of a gay 
rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar on Christopher Street in New York, 
commemorated as a key event in the modern gay and lesbian rights movement.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: CHILDBIRTH MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN EASIER BUT IDEAS ARE 
CHANGING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much has changed from the days when a father's role in the birth of a baby 
ended at the delivery room door, his path abruptly blocked by a stern matron in 
white who could say with her eyes alone: 
</P>
<P>
"This is our job now." 
</P>
<P>
Childbirth may not have gotten easier, but ideas about it are loosening up. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 women -- some expecting, others cradling their newborns -- gathered in 
a festive setting last week to dramatize that change. 
</P>
<P>
They were guests of Glendale Adventist Medical Center, where about 200 women 
give birth each month. Until a few weeks ago, they all did it the standard 
hospital way. They labored in a labor room, then were wheeled down the hall to 
a room full of bottled gases and electronic tools that yielded the first sights 
and sounds of a new child. 
</P>
<P>
In many places, the natural birth movement has brought fathers into the room as 
coaches. Specialty clinics, such as Glendale's Easy Birth Center, have offered 
Victorian bedroom settings. But big institutions found it hard to abandon old 
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier and faster if we keep Father out and do our own work," said 
the hospital's head delivery nurse, Ellen Hooker, who attended the party in a 
business suit. 
</P>
<P>
Now the hospital is making an earnest attempt to change, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to give back a lot of the power and control to the mother." Under a 
policy now going into effect, there are almost no rules. 
</P>
<P>
The mother can have anyone she wants with her during delivery -- even if it 
isn't the father. She can keep the baby at her side throughout her stay. She 
can decide who will visit and at what hours and who will hold the baby. 
</P>
<P>
With the change in attitude comes a change in hardware. The hardware is getting 
softer. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Glendale Adventist opened an LDR. That stands for Labor/Delivery 
Room. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a hotel," Hooker said. The room evolved into its present form. First 
it was an ABC, an Alternate Birth Center decorated with homey colors and 
furniture. The mother stayed there it was time to go home. Because the bottled 
gases and electronics were not included, it was only for the easy deliveries, 
Hooker said. 
</P>
<P>
Now all the equipment has been added, tucked into cabinets. Any mother can 
deliver there. 
</P>
<P>
The only limitation is that the hospital has built only the first of the five 
or six LDRs it has planned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's first come, first served," said Kathy Hirsh, who attended the party with 
her husband, Steven. She is expecting in a few days and will use the new room 
if it is available. 
</P>
<P>
Once a mother checks in, the room is occupied for up to two days. So Kathy 
Hirsh could end up doing it the old way. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Grant, carrying 9-week-old Allison, filled Hirsh in on what that would be 
like. She was overdue just as the finishing touches were put on the ABC. She'd 
call in frequently, hoping that it would be ready. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't. She had 24 hours and 45 minutes of labor and then a 15-minute 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to wheel me into the delivery room, which was not a lot of fun," 
Grant said. "There's so much distraction at the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
Grant, a Los Angeles kindergarten teacher, was supposed to be picketing. She 
played hooky with Allison to be part of a happier media event. It had balloons, 
cake, a puppeteer and staff handing out literature on prenatal and 
breast-feeding classes. 
</P>
<P>
Between interviews with reporters, Grant and the other moms and dads did manage 
to exchange information about other new things in birthing. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this your stroller?" Kathy Hirsh asked Amy Campos, who sat beside a sleek 
Italian import with gray plastic chassis and white quilted upholstery. "How do 
you like it?" 
</P>
<P>
"I love it." Campos said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the '89 model, isn't it?" Kathy Hirsh asked. 
</P>
<P>
"This is hot off the boat," Steven Hirsh interjected. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is it's got the adjustable handle," Kathy said. "This one has 
the wider wheel base." 
</P>
<P>
"Equipment is something we've researched to death," Steven said. He said they 
got their information from a baby expert, an adviser who helped them at the 
baby goods store. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the finest stroller," he said with finality. 
</P>
<P>
Campos smiled appreciatively. But she seemed more interested in the party than 
the theory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to get out and see other people in your situation, to know I'm not 
the only one with a cranky baby," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her 6-week-old son Michael, who rested placidly on her lap in a pinstripe 
Yankee uniform, was born the old way. His mom didn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't really matter," Campos said. "I just wanted him to come out." 
</P>
<P>
She tried to explain the feelings of the ninth month of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"Not being a woman, you wouldn't understand," she said at last. 
</P>
<P>
Some things never change.

Armed with a "Dear Abby" column, City Councilwoman Christine Reed is demanding 
that the city do something about crowd control at the Santa Monica Civic 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
A Sherman Oaks resident wrote to the advice columnist in early May, citing the 
dangers of a "churning riptide of humanity" at a concert in the auditorium less 
than a month after unruly crowds at a soccer match in Sheffield, England, left 
93 people dead.

PLANS FOR BEACH PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bus shuttle program, a traffic crisis management team and more beach access 
parking lots will be used to alleviate traffic problems in the Venice beach 
area this summer, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle, in its third season of operation, starts at the parking lot on 
Venice Boulevard near West Washington Boulevard. Rides will be scheduled every 
15 minutes from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends and holidays through Labor Day. 
The shuttle is free for those who pay $3 to park in the lot and 25 cents for 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter's traffic management team, on duty on summer weekends, will consist of 
a Department of Transportation traffic engineer who will monitor conditions in 
the most heavily congested areas and work with traffic control officers to 
direct traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, beach access parking lots will be posted, and negotiations are 
under way with the Los Angeles Unified School District to use parking lots at 
area elementary schools.

SKATEBOARD BAN AT CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skateboarders will be banned from the City Hall complex, under an ordinance 
adopted by the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The ban is intended to save curbs, steps and handrails from abuse by youths who 
turn the complex into a skateboard park on weekends, said Assistant City 
Manager Manuel Ontal. Steps have been chipped, and wide handrails have been 
damaged by skateboarders who use them as ramps, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which takes effect in 30 days, imposes a $100-fine for a 
first-time offense and a $200-fine if it is repeated within a year. The 
skateboard would also be confiscated until it is no longer needed as evidence.

OFFICER TO RECEIVE AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Agent Mark Kling has been selected as one of two officers in the county 
to receive this year's Los Angeles Community Protectors Award. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a record of outstanding contributions to the city, both on and off 
duty," Chief Kenneth G. Hickman wrote in Kling's nomination letter. "This 
officer sets the example for others to follow." 
</P>
<P>
The award honors those who are considered the top police officers, 
firefighters, sheriff's deputies, paramedics and Highway Patrol officers in the 
county. Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson and county Supervisor Michael 
D. Antonovich began the award five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Kling began his involvement with the department in 1970 as a police Explorer 
scout. A decade later he was hired first as a reserve officer and then as a 
full-time officer. Since then, he has been cited on numerous occasions for the 
high quality of his work. 
</P>
<P>
Kling will receive his award today during ceremonies in Universal City.

3.5% RENT INCREASE URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rent control officials are recommending that rents be allowed to go up 3.5% 
this year, slightly more than last year's increase but below the national 
average of rising rents. 
</P>
<P>
The 3.5% increase will be the subject of a public hearing tonight at 7:30 at a 
Rent Control Board meeting in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Under Santa Monica's strict rent control law, the board votes on an annual 
increase that landlords are allowed to begin charging in September. The 
increase last year was 3% and has averaged about 4% each year since rent 
control was enacted a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally over the same period, rents have risen an average of 6.5% per year, 
according to a 1987 study. 
</P>
<P>
The average rent in Santa Monica is $480, according to the rent control agency. 
</P>
<P>
If the 3.5% increase is approved, landlords must notify their tenants in 
writing and certify that there are no outstanding citations or uncorrected 
building code violations against the property.

CULVER CITY STUDIES TAX INCREASE, AUDITS TO AVOID BUDGET SHORTFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To avoid a $2-million shortfall in the $54.5-million 1989-90 budget, Culver 
City Chief Adminstrative Officer H. Dale Jones has proposed an increase in some 
taxes and fees, an audit to recoup back taxes and the use of about $528,000 in 
treasury reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the nearly 10% increase in expenditures over last year's operating 
budget is attributed to the addition of 20 city employees -- including four 
police officers -- a 20% increase in liability and workers compensation 
insurance premiums, a 19% increase in health care premiums and salary increases 
totaling $851,000. 
</P>
<P>
The budget also includes $71,000 to finance a new quarterly city newsletter, 
various brochures and an annual report to the community. 
</P>
<P>
Budget study sessions will be held May 31 and June 3. The City Council will 
hold a public hearing June 26 to adopt the budget. The budget must be adopted 
by the beginning of the fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second consecutive year in which proposed expenditures exceeded 
expected revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the budget was about $400,000 short in revenues. To make up the 
difference, the city increased the tax on local telephone calls from 9.5% to 
11% and imposed an 11% tax on long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
But the council reduced both taxes to 10% after the Culver City Chamber of 
Commerce and the city's four largest employers complained that the tax on 
long-distance calls was too high and unfairly burdened large companies. The 
council also placed a $15,000-per-year maximum on any one taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
Jones is proposing that the tax be restored to 11%, which is expected to 
generate an additional $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also believe an audit of state records will find an additional 
$400,000 in sales tax money that was not properly credited. The city hired an 
auditor to review state records to ensure that the city was receiving its share 
of the 6.5% sales tax collected in the county. Cities statewide receive 
revenues equal to 1% of all taxable sales. 
</P>
<P>
An audit of the city's utility taxes is expected to produce about $30,000 in 
back taxes owed the city. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed increase in business-license taxes would produce $550,000. About 
$255,000 would come from an increase in street-sweeping fees, and an increase 
in parking fines from $15 to $28 would produce an additional $155,000. 
Installation of 1,400 new parking meters could yield $317,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to using $528,869 from treasury reserves -- leaving a balance of 
more than $4.5-million -- the city is proposing the use of $155,740 of 
remaining federal revenue sharing funds for general fund expenditures. The 
revenue sharing program, which provided local governments with federal funds, 
was discontinued in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
City department heads were also asked to submit budget cuts of 5% from last 
year's level to give the City Council flexibility in balancing the budget. The 
budget also includes $7.6-million for capital improvements, including $2 
million in new projects.

HIGHLAND PARK ESTATE DECLARED HISTORIC-CULTURAL MONUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has voted to declare the 94-year old Albert H. 
Judson estate in Highland Park a historic-cultural monument, curtailing 
demolition efforts by its owner, a wealthy real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
The historic monument designation prevents owner Donna Harnsberger from 
demolishing or altering the 15-room mansion for a year. After that, Harnsberger 
can apply for a demolition permit, but the permit would have to be issued by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was seen as a victory by preservationists. They lobbied hard for 
monument status after Harnsberger surprised them by announcing at a Christmas 
party last year that she intended to tear down the house to build three 
apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Harnsberger's decision was seen as ironic by the preservationists. They watched 
in helpless dismay as the longtime Highland Park resident, who has been active 
in battles to save several historic homes in the area, removed molding from 
around doors and windows and uprooted two old palm trees on the estate's 
extensive, overgrown grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The estate, at 4911 Pasadena Avenue Terrace, was once the home of Judson, an 
attorney who in the 1880s subdivided and named Highland Park. The home was 
designed in 1895 by George Wyman, the architect who designed the historic 
Bradbury building in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Harnsberger has vowed to do everything in her power to tear down the house. She 
says that she doesn't believe that the house is historic and that she did weeks 
of research and compiled hundreds of documents to prove it. But when she 
brought her work to a Cultural Affairs Commission meeting earlier this month, 
commissioners said her research only bolstered the preservationists' case. 
</P>
<P>
Harnsberger has not returned repeated phone calls since the council vote. It is 
unclear whether she will seek a permit to demolish the house or eventually seek 
to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like her to restore the house," said Charles Fisher of the Highland 
Park Heritage Trust. "She lived there for years, and she has said she loved it. 
If she doesn't want to restore it, we want her to sell it to someone who will."

PLANS FOR FARMERS MARKET IN HIGHLAND PARK ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans to create a city-sponsored farmers market in Highland Park moved forward 
last week, with Los Angeles city officials naming Sycamore Grove Park as the 
site of the market. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had proposed Arroyo Seco Park as a site. But when homeowners in 
the residential area around the park objected, officials began looking for a 
new site. 
</P>
<P>
The farmers market will be run in its first year with a $25,000 budget approved 
by Department of Recreation and Parks officials earlier this month. It is 
scheduled to open in early August and will be the first farmers market 
subsidized by the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The market, proposed by Councilman Richard Alatorre, is to operate with city 
funds for a year under the Department of Recreation and Parks. It is a pilot 
for city-sponsored markets in other parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Recreation and parks officials will hire a part-time manager to recruit farmers 
and promote the market. As proposed, the market would eventually be run by a 
nonprofit community group. 
</P>
<P>
There are three open-air markets in the city where farmers sell their wares to 
consumers, but all are run by private, nonprofit groups. At least six other 
cities in Los Angeles County subsidize farmers markets. 
</P>
<P>
Since the plan to open the market became public last month, it has met little 
resistance. Community groups say they think that the market can help bring the 
diverse Highland Park community together by providing a safe and friendly 
atmosphere in which to buy produce and meet people. 
</P>
<P>
The only opposition to the plan arose when Alatorre suggested a corner of 
Arroyo Seco Park for the market. An association of homeowners living near the 
park opposed the proposal, saying it would increase traffic, noise and trash in 
a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
In response, city officials moved the site to Sycamore Grove Park, which is 
bordered by busy Figueroa Street on the west and the Pasadena Freeway on the 
east. 
</P>
<P>
The market is to be open for three to five hours one day a week, most likely 
Thursday.

DOCTOR LOSES PRACTICE AFTER HAND INJURY; 
</P>
<P>
JURY OKS $816,500-AWARD TO COMPTON DENTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles court jury has awarded $816,500 to a Compton man who lost his 
dental practice after his hand was injured during an altercation with a bill 
collector seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated eight days before finding Monday that Associates Financial 
Services Co., a large, Dallas-based firm, and its employee, Tom Reza, had acted 
negligently while attempting to pick up an overdue mortgage payment at dentist 
Theodore Shirley's central Los Angeles office in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors, however, assigned two-thirds of the blame for the incident to the 
defendants and one-third to Shirley. They also found the defendants not guilty 
of battery or intentional infliction of emotional distress, as was charged. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley, now 43, testified that his right index finger was sprained when Reza 
shoved him against a wall in his office after he refused to speak to a mortgage 
company manager on the telephone. The sprain never healed properly, Shirley 
argued, and a permanent, involuntary twitch of the injured finger has made it 
impossible for him to work as a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't able to practice for a couple of months," said Shirley's lawyer, 
Eric Ferrer. "Then he went back and tried, but was never able to resume his 
practice because of the emotional and physical injuries. . . . The finger 
movements prevent him from holding things in his right hand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Left-Handed Dentist 
</P>
<P>
Although Shirley is left-handed, he must be able to hold a mirror and dental 
equipment in his right hand, Ferrer said. A medical expert hired by Shirley 
testified that the twitching might be caused by a persistent irritation of a 
tendon in the finger, a spokesman for the defendants said. 
</P>
<P>
But medical experts for the mortgage company said a finger injury could not 
possibly cause such a jerk of the finger. Damage to the brain or spinal cord 
would be necessary for that, said Fred Harding, spokesman for the law firm 
defending Associates Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely what happened at Shirley's office was disputed during the four-week 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Shirley, two dental patients testified that they saw Reza push 
or hit the dentist, Harding said. One witness said Reza grabbed Shirley by the 
lapels and threw him into a wall, while the second said he saw Reza strike the 
dentist with his fist, Harding said.

But Reza testified that he never pushed or bumped Shirley. The jury, although 
rejecting a battery charge, perhaps "thought there was an unintentional 
brushing up of the two parties against each other . . . and that was negligence 
on behalf of Mr. Reza," Harding said. "But Mr. Reza denies even that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent to Collect Check 
</P>
<P>
Reza was acting only as a courier, not an enforcer, Harding insisted. 
</P>
<P>
"He was sent there just to pick up the check," he said. "The doctor's loan 
wasn't even through Mr. Reza's office. Apparently a manager of an Orange County 
office called to see if the doctor had dropped off the check (in Los Angeles), 
and suggested that Mr. Reza go down and pick it up. The doctor might have been 
too busy to drop it off." 
</P>
<P>
Shirley, now a law student, was about three months behind on payments on a 
$45,000 second loan on his Compton home, Ferrer said. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley's attorneys asked for more than $10 million in damages, including a 
large punitive award. The jury awarded for actual economic damages and pain and 
suffering, Ferrer said. Of the $816,500, Shirley will keep $546,000 after 
paying medical and legal fees, Harding said.

John Hemer, former director of housing and economic development, said Wednesday 
that one of the reasons he resigned in April was the City Council's growing 
involvement in day-to-day city affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"From my perspective, this is a blurring of the distinction between 
establishing policies versus day-to-day administration of the city," Hemer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not question the council's right to become more involved. 
"That's their prerogative," he said, adding that it's hard to say whether the 
council's growing involvement is a more effective way of running the city. 
Hemer added that the main reason he decided to leave was that his new job as 
director of real estate for the Los Angeles Redevelopment Agency was a very 
attractive career move. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, City Manager Ralph Webb resigned under pressure from the council. 
The council has appointed Administrative Services Director Michael Yelton as 
acting city manager.

PARTY SOARS THANKS TO AIR HANGAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Bye-bye, ballrooms, bye-bye. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as party planner Pamela Paul said: "My first thought was, 'I can't sit in 
another banquet room with another plate of rubber chicken.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her second thought was . . . airplane hangar! 
</P>
<P>
 "I pictured an airplane hangar with all these people dressed in black tie," 
said the chairwoman of Sunday's American Cancer Society benefit. "I didn't have 
a theme or anything, just that image." 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the early evening sunshine outside Tallmantz Aviation Hangar at 
John Wayne Airport, Paul watched the first wave of guests step through a gate 
in the hangar's chain-link fence and walk the strip of red carpet leading to 
the cavernous beige building. 
</P>
<P>
And the silk-suited, 7 months' pregnant Paul had to smile: The chairwoman and 
her 40 committee members had managed to turn her rather odd vision into a 
charming party scene. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed -- somewhat irrelevantly -- "The Spirit of St. Louis," the 
$50-per-person benefit drew more than 600 guests and raised estimated net 
proceeds of $70,000, according to Donna Blue, president of the South Coast 
Cancer League, a division of the Orange County chapter of the American Cancer 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
The huge metal box that served as a party house was filled with columns of 
black and silver balloons, rows of white-clothed tables and the booming beat of 
a cut-above dance band, the Wayne Foster Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
With rising aircraft rumbling just outside the open hangar doors, guests 
sampled buffet offerings from 20 restaurants, chose among more than 100 
varieties of wine and bid on silent auction items. 
</P>
<P>
First out on the no-frills cement dance floor were Harold and Ardiste Ladin. 
She headed the effort to round up 99 auction donations, including four seats at 
a Lakers game right behind star-fan Jack Nicholson and a guest shot as an extra 
on NBC series "The Golden Girls." ("I wanted to get things you can't buy," 
Ladin explained.) 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were Robert Stephan and Janet Norris, who work in the 
restaurant industry and said they came to the party "mostly for the food," 
according to Stephan. 
</P>
<P>
Noshing chicken tikka masala (chicken with yogurt and herbs), a traditional 
Indian dish served by Gandhi restaurant, Stephan pronounced the sampling 
"surprisingly good" and said that in Northern California, where he sometimes 
works as a consultant, "they think down here people go for the (restaurant) 
decor, not the food. 
</P>
<P>
"Wrong," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Right.

PHOTO EXHIBIT OF STATE'S ARCHITECTURE;

STUDENT LANDS LANDMARK PROJECT

<P>
For some college students, curiosity ends with the final exam. 
</P>
<P>
Not so for Mark Harris, a 32-year-old professional photographer who parlayed a 
history class at Moorpark College into a traveling photo exhibition on landmark 
architecture that opens today. 
</P>
<P>
Harris began shooting pictures of the landmarks that he visited while enrolled 
in a class called "California History on the Road," whose students travel to 
historic sites from San Diego to the Gold Country of Northern California. 
Afterward, he hit the landmark trail alone, photographing dozens more historic 
places. "It just sort of took over, and I went with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The result is "Architectural Images of California," an exhibition of about 200 
photographs of historic buildings, more than half of them in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The display traces the evolution of California architecture from the founding 
of the missions in the 1770s to the revival of the Mission style 150 years 
later in modest stucco homes with clay roofs and wrought-iron trim. 
</P>
<P>
Large photographs of such landmarks as the mission at San Juan Capistrano and 
the Olivas Adobe in Ventura hang beside small studies of an elaborate brass 
door-hinge in a Victorian house in San Diego, the wooden steeple of a Gothic 
Revival church in Ventura or the terra-cotta tiles over the fireplace at 
Thacher School in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Look at the Quirky 
</P>
<P>
While Harris focuses on such well-known Ventura landmarks as the Mission at San 
Buenaventura, the David C. Cook Mansion near Piru ("the best preserved and most 
lavish Queen Anne house still standing in Southern California," according to 
the exhibit), and the Camulos Adobe near Piru, he also chronicles the obscure, 
quirky and unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit features a 1927 Mission-style gas station, a 1931 residential 
replica of the Taj Mahal in Ojai and a simple, single-story 1874 house with 
board and batten siding on East Thompson Boulevard that could easily be 
dismissed as just another house. Yet the exhibition reveals that it is the only 
remaining example of Gothic Revival, the architectural style most popular at 
the time of Ventura's founding. 
</P>
<P>
Admitting that he still "doesn't know that much" about architecture, Harris 
received help from his former professor, Art Bettini; Judith Triem, a Santa 
Paula historian, and David Gebhard, author of "Guide to Southern California 
Architecture" and "Architecture in Los Angeles: A Compleat Guide." 
</P>
<P>
The group, which received a grant from the California Council on the 
Humanities, hopes that the exhibition makes a strong argument in favor of 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're growing too fast without much thought or appreciation for the people who 
came before us," Bettini said. 
</P>
<P>
In an unconventional move aimed at reaching a wider audience, the exhibit will 
be mounted in two shopping malls and a library. 
</P>
<P>
"Images" opens a four-day run today at the Esplanade shopping center in Oxnard 
and moves June 1 to Ventura's San Buenaventura Plaza for another four days. An 
informal discussion with the exhibition's organizers will be held at 7 p.m. 
June 6 at Ventura College and 7 p.m. June 22 at the Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mall approach has been used with success in the Midwest and East, 
the idea is novel in California, said Susan Gordon, a spokeswoman for the 
California Council on the Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mall Presentation 
</P>
<P>
"We're interested in seeing how successfully this idea plays out," she said. 
"If people are really delighted to have this kind of exhibit in a mall and 
somebody calls with a request, I would say, 'Have you thought of doing it in 
your mall?' " 
</P>
<P>
Nothing could have been further from Harris' mind when he enrolled in Bettini's 
class. A photographer for a defense contractor whose days are filled with 
"jets, gizmos and things like that," Harris thought that he had found an easy 
way to complete a history requirement for a bachelor's degree in communications 
or photography -- he hasn't decided which. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to submit them as a final term paper, Harris began shooting pictures of 
the landmarks that the class visited over weekends and holidays. Then he set 
foot in Villa Montezuma, an 1887 Queen Anne mansion in San Diego, and an 
assignment became an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they lived -- you could feel it," recalled Harris, who has installed 
photographs of the villa's elaborate stained-glass windows in the Thousand Oaks 
tract house that he shares with two roommates. 
</P>
<P>
Harris ended up turning in close to 400 photographs of Monterey ranch houses, 
Gold Rush hotels and the state Capitol. Bettini was wowed and managed to get 
the $7,500 grant. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Harris has traveled thousands of miles, tracking down landmarks 
almost every weekend. He often returned several times to the same sites, 
sleeping in his car to capture the morning light. On one weekend alone, he 
traveled 700 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"I was amazed," he said. "I didn't realize half this stuff was out there. 
Occasionally you drive by an old house and go, 'Oh, that's neat,' but there are 
literally thousands of these houses." 
</P>

GRAFITTI COULD SEE THE WRITING ON THE WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Grafitti is preparing for a journey into familiar territory. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time in his four years at Loyola Marymount, Grafitti and the 
Lions are in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball tournament. And 
just as he has done in his previous two trips into postseason play, Grafitti 
will begin the tournament from a familiar vantage point -- the Loyola bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had a three-year All-American career, but the friendships I've 
developed and the experiences I've had with the team have been great," said 
Grafitti, a backup catcher and first baseman who played at Hoover High. "I've 
been lucky enough to go through something 99% of the people in the world never 
get to experience." 
</P>
<P>
Grafitti graduated from Loyola two weeks ago with a degree in psychology. So, 
it's not surprising that throughout his collegiate baseball career, Grafitti 
has relied on the power of positive thinking to help overcome what some players 
might view as a series of major league disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who plays wants to be the guy to throw out the runner or hit the home 
run," Grafitti said. "But if you want to be part of a team, you do what you 
have to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Someday, you'll get your chance and you just gotta hope you make the best of 
your chance when you get it." 
</P>
<P>
In this, his final season, Graffiti is hoping for an opportunity to help Loyola 
win its first national title when the Lions open play Friday against Oklahoma 
in the West I Regional in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola (37-22), under first-year Coach Chris Smith, is ranked 18th and 24th, 
respectively, in this week's Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball-ESPN 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
Grafitti, 6-foot-2, 185 pounds, made the Loyola roster as a walk-on after 
batting .335 his senior year at Hoover. Under Dave Snow, who coached at Loyola 
before taking over the program at Cal State Long Beach this season, Grafitti 
said he got a quick indoctrination into the importance of preparation and 
mental toughness. 
</P>
<P>
"My freshman year was difficult but it made me a lot stronger person," said 
Grafitti, who earned a full scholarship this year. "I was one of a couple of 
guys that Snow was on every single day. If you quit he didn't want you, because 
you were weak and weren't going to be able to take it when you were faced with 
adversity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I got the chance to play for him because I think the things he taught 
me carry over to the working world, family -- everything." 
</P>
<P>
Grafitti, who is batting .274 with two home runs and 15 runs batted in in 84 
at-bats, has had his career slowed by two major obstacles: injuries and junior 
catcher Miah Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
Grafitti's physical problems began during his senior year at Hoover, when he 
underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee for ligament damage suffered 
during basketball season. The knee remains unstable and requires Grafitti to 
wear a brace when he is on the field. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Grafitti broke the thumb on his glove hand. Last season, he suffered a 
broken index finger and wrist. 
</P>
<P>
However, at 6-foot-4, 210 pounds, Bradbury has proven an even more formidable 
barrier for Grafitti than his own physical problems. Last season, Bradbury 
batted .345 with 10 home runs and 43 RBIs. This season, he is batting .409 with 
six home runs and 44 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mark could have started at most four-year schools, but unfortunately, 
from a baseball standpoint, he's playing behind a very gifted player," Smith 
said. "I think he recognizes that Miah Bradbury's don't come around very 
often." 
</P>
<P>
Said Grafitti: "A lot of people would have left when Miah came in and saw that 
they were going to spend their junior year sitting on the bench. I just liked 
the school and the friends I had here. That was more important to me than going 
somewhere I could play all the time."

A FLASH ON ICE; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY PLAYER HAS ALL THE RIGHT MOVES AT AGE 12; HE'S SO GOOD, IN FACT, THAT HE 
MAY HAVE TO MOVE TO COLDER CLIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
They call him "Flash," this 12-year-old from Rancho Palos Verdes touted in 
international hockey circles as the next Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Park's stick-handling and passing are so crisp that comparisons with 
the Los Angeles Kings' superstar are inevitable. He is no match for boys his 
age, and has dominated teen-agers four years older. Born in Korea and raised in 
Southern California, Richard is excelling in a sport long-dominated by Eastern 
and Canadian interests. 
</P>
<P>
"At his age he does things on the ice that I guarantee not all the pros can 
do," UCLA hockey Coach Jack White said. 
</P>
<P>
A center/defenseman, Richard recently led the Los Angeles Junior Kings to the 
California Pee Wee Division title in his first season. In one game he scored 10 
goals. In tournaments in the United States and Canada last winter he was so 
brilliant his picture appeared in International Hockey Weekly. His story has 
been told in French, Korean and English newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best 12-year-old I've seen in a long time," Junior Kings Manager Nick 
Racanelli said. 
</P>
<P>
An amateur hockey club in Chicago is trying to persuade Richard's parents to 
move him there. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid's a gem," said Al Thomas, manager of the Chicago Young Americans, a 
Triple-A amateur team composed of some of the best teen-age prospects from 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Richard is unique to hockey because of his heritage, size and the area in which 
he lives. There has never been a Korean-born pro hockey player. Only two or 
three Asians have ever played pro hockey, according to the National Hockey 
League. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-8, Richard is large for his age. "People think Koreans are always 
small, but that is just not true," said his sister, Christina, 20. 
</P>
<P>
And in Southern California where the Park family lives, hockey ranks up there 
in importance for most young people with homework and a new pair of snowshoes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pure Hockey Sense' 
</P>
<P>
"He has the pure hockey sense that you don't see very often in players from 
Southern California," said Dave Kizanis, his local coach. 
</P>
<P>
All the attention has been a little overwhelming for Richard. "Richard doesn't 
like the attention, he's really shy," Christina said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard's reputation precedes him. He was mobbed in Minnesota. In Quebec, young 
girls asked for autographs. In Washington state, he was credited with boosting 
attendance at a national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, "he's not a regular 12-year-old," Christina said. "He has had to 
mature real fast." 
</P>
<P>
Richard's mother, Jean Park, is not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she said when asked if she thought the pressure was too intense 
sometimes. "I think it does bother him." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time Richard just wants to hang out with friends at a shopping 
mall. "I get kind of tired of (the attention) sometimes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter and photographer showed up one recent Saturday afternoon at Bay 
Harbor Olympic Ice Arena in Harbor City to watch Richard practice with his 
team, the young player was less than thrilled. He fussed about posing for a 
photo with his mother and sister. When practice ended he hid in the locker 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Kizanis coaxed him. Richard tugged at his dark hair which protruded from under 
a Kings hockey cap. His shoulders rested against a cold concrete wall. He 
stared at the ceiling. An icy silence stifled the room. 
</P>
<P>
But when the talk turned to surfing, Richard's eyes suddenly lit up and with a 
youthful grin he spoke of his day, which had begun at 5 a.m. at the Manhattan 
Beach Pier with a borrowed surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I hurt my butt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Park family -- two boys, two girls, Jean and her husband Paul -- moved to 
the United States and settled in Brea almost eight years ago. Paul Park is in 
the import business. Christina took skating lessons soon after the family 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something I couldn't have done in Korea," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One day she took her little brother to the rink. "We gave him a lesson and the 
teacher told us that he was just too good, that he already had an ability to 
skate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lived Here Since Age 4 
</P>
<P>
When Richard was 5, the family moved to the Palos Verdes Peninsula. He wanted 
to skate every day. 
</P>
<P>
Richard said he sometimes feels the eyes of two nations staring at him. He has 
lived in the United States since he was 4 and considers himself a regular 
American kid. Christina said he wants to become a naturalized citizen when he 
turns 18, but he would still be eligible to play Olympic hockey for his 
homeland if he chooses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't speak Korean that well," Richard said. Yet the Korean work ethic that 
puts family and education ahead of all else is why he is so good on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Richard attends hockey camps around the country. There are weekly clinics in 
Burbank, Pasadena and Van Nuys. His mother said the money the family spends on 
hockey each year is substantial. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really like hockey," she said. "I just love to watch my son." 
</P>
<P>
She believes her son should treat hockey as a hobby. Education to Koreans is 
more important, and because Richard gets "only Bs" he is sometimes scolded by 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
"Without an education you are only a dumb hockey player," said Christina, a 
premed student at Loma Linda University. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Typical Teen-Age Reaction 
</P>
<P>
Richard describes himself as "kind of a smart ass" in his parents' eyes, but 
Christina says he is really a momma's boy. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom is too strict sometimes," Richard said. "When I ask her if I can go out 
with friends to the mall, she says no. My friends' parents let them go." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Park said she would do anything for her son. "I try to copy the American 
people," she said. "But school first, hockey second." 
</P>
<P>
If Richard wants to stay on top of his game, experts agree he will have to 
leave Southern California to play against better competition. The problem here, 
they say, is that there just aren't enough ice rinks. 
</P>
<P>
"In another year they'll have to be doing some serious thinking about getting 
him into an area where he can develop, an area where everyone is good," said 
White, the UCLA hockey club coach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Considers Moving 
</P>
<P>
Richard has been an exception to the rule among players here, said Racanelli, 
Junior Kings manager and a former Canadian. "The problem in Southern California 
is that you just don't get the good coaching," he said. "He'll have to leave 
here and go somewhere where everybody is good." 
</P>
<P>
Canada, the Midwest or Northeast are good bets for the Parks. They recently 
began discussing a move. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe in a year," said Jean Park, who said she will follow her son wherever he 
goes. 
</P>
<P>
Richard knows he must go, too. "Maybe one more year," he said. "But I would 
miss my friends." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Park left the rink to go to the coffee shop where Thomas, the coach in 
Chicago, wanted to discuss the possibility of having the young player move now. 
He promised more ice time and a $52,000 budget that would pay for most travel 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard was not interested at that moment. Nighttime was approaching, the 
hockey playoffs were on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he would go to the mall later with some friends.

$166-MILLION PLAN ALSO INCLUDES NEW STATION; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA BUDGET ADDS POLICE

<P>
Santa Monica officials, in an effort to beef up law enforcement, want to build 
a $12-million police station and add a dozen officers to the city's 150-member 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals are part of a $166-million budget being delivered to members of 
the Santa Monica City Council this week. Under the budget, spending for the 
1989-90 fiscal year is expected to rise by 5.8% -- or $8.5 million -- over the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the City Council will review the proposed budget in study sessions 
on May 31 and June 1, with a public hearing scheduled for June 27. The final 
budget would be voted on after that hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Projected income for the year is estimated at $149.9 million, and expenditures 
are put at $154.5 million, plus an additional $12 million for the police 
station that will be part of a supplemental budget added later. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Jalili said the city has a healthy balance in its general 
fund that will more than cover the difference between projected income and 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Jalili estimated that general fund reserves by the end of 1990 will be left at 
$4.5 million, which he said was the "minimum prudent" balance. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the $12 million allocated for the new police station would be financed 
with bond proceeds, Jalili said. 
</P>
<P>
The station would be built on what is now a parking lot, just east of the wing 
of City Hall where the Santa Monica Police Department is housed. The project 
will include subterranean parking to make up for the spaces lost when the 
station is built, Jalili said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget also includes about $1 million for 12 additional officers -- 
including a sergeant and one community service officer. Police officials have 
been lobbying for added staff in anticipation of increased crime as the city 
grows. Police have reported new crime outbreaks at the Santa Monica Pier and 
among the city's homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
Other big-ticket items on the budget include a half-million-dollar traffic 
management plan and a $300,000-environmental program that includes stepped-up 
monitoring of hazardous-waste collection. 
</P>
<P>
The city also plans to spend $230,000 on child care, $100,000 to keep the 
public library open on Sunday, and $50,000 on removal of graffiti and trash 
from city alleys. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also allocating $60,000 for its new Public Electronic Network, an 
innovative computer system that allows Santa Monica residents to sign on to 
their personal computers and retrieve public documents, information on city 
events and City Council agendas. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the city's income comes from property, sales and business license 
taxes. Additional revenue will come from increased parking meter rates and 
increases in the city's utility-users tax.

SUPERVISORS OK SWAP OF LAND IN OXNARD TOWN CENTER PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County officials agreed this week to swap a 14.7-acre plot of land 
crucial to the mammoth Town Center development in Oxnard for a larger plot 
northeast of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement approved Tuesday by county supervisors, the county will 
part with an equipment yard that stands in the path of a freeway improvement 
project that has to be completed before most of the Town Center can be built. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the project's developers, Buellton-based River Edge, agreed to 
give the county 22.5 acres of land in El Rio and build $4.5-million worth of 
buildings to replace the existing facilities. The deal also provides the county 
with a $2-million cushion against cost overruns on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good deal for everyone," said Richard Wittenberg, the county's 
chief administrative officer. "The Town Center gets built, and our 
responsibility that the taxpayer be protected has been fulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lahr, the president of River Edge, also expressed satisfaction over the 
deal, which clears the way for improvements to the intersection of the Ventura 
Freeway and California 1 near the project, which was begun in January. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of headaches between now and completion," he said. "But having 
this allows us to keep moving and to keep the momentum of the project." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optimism on Caltrans 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county officials expressed optimism that the state Department of 
Transportation would decide this year to fund a share of the $28-million 
freeway widening project that will improve the intersection of the Ventura 
Freeway and California 1 within the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very positive," said Richard Spicer, acting executive director of Ventura 
County's Transportation Commission, who attended a hearing this week to 
determine the budget for next year's State Transportation Improvement Program. 
</P>
<P>
He said the California Transportation Commission, based on testimony received 
Tuesday, will decide late next month whether to fund the project, which is 
considered a top priority by the Ventura County Transportation Commission and 
the Southern California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
The only cloud over the deal came from Supervisor Susan Lacey, who warned 
supervisors that residents in El Rio would be wary of increases in traffic 
caused by the relocated yard. 
</P>
<P>
"The county will have to jump through every hoop that a private person would 
have to do, and there's a chance that we might not be able to jump through them 
all," said Lacey, whose district includes El Rio. "Folks over there are 
concerned about traffic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Former Site of Dairy 
</P>
<P>
The equipment yard -- which houses county maintenance vehicles as well as the 
county's fleet of cars, including all of the patrol cars in the Sheriff's 
Department -- will occupy the former site of a dairy at Vineyard Avenue and 
Lambert Street. 
</P>
<P>
The $500-million Town Center project, which is the largest commercial 
development planned for Oxnard, will bring office buildings, hotels, a mall and 
a cultural arts facility to a 265-acre site in the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Under a development agreement with the city of Oxnard, only a quarter of the 
project can be developed before the interchange is improved. The improvements, 
which will widen the freeway between Johnson Drive and Vineyard Avenue, were 
also part of a settlement that Oxnard reached with Ventura in a lawsuit over 
the Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
Lahr said company officials had reason to believe that Caltrans eventually will 
condemn between six and 10 acres for the improvements, but they feared delays. 
River Edge also plans to retain up to four acres of the land for a parking lot, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lahr expressed relief over the county's acceptance of the deal, which he said 
was nearly five years in the making. 
</P>
<P>
"The county would say, 'We'd like this site,' " he said, "and we'd go out and 
try to make a deal and everybody would know that we were buying for the county 
so the price would go up. Then an official would decide they didn't want it."

ASK THE VET: DOG'S SPAYING ADVISED AFTER FALSE PREGNANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: I'd like your opinion on spaying our 8-year-old Maltese. We just had her 
checked by our vet because we thought she was pregnant. Her mammary glands 
became swollen, and she actually had milk. Our vet said that she was going 
through a false pregnancy and recommended that we have her spayed, but we fear 
she may be getting too old for anesthesia and surgery, especially since she 
seems to be doing well otherwise. What could happen if we don't have her 
spayed? 
</P>
<P>
A.L. Bronstad, Orange 
</P>
<P>
A: Since your pet has gone through false pregnancy, which is caused by a 
hormonal imbalance of the ovaries, it would be wise to follow your 
veterinarian's advice and have her spayed. Otherwise, the odds are that she 
would repeat these episodes and could develop an infection. Then, instead of 
having a relatively healthy dog for surgery, you would have a very debilitated 
and weak patient for what amounts to emergency surgery. With any surgery on any 
age patient, anesthesia is always a risk, but modern techniques have 
considerably reduced those risks. Your veterinarian will probably want to do 
some pre-surgery lab tests to make sure that she has normal kidney and liver 
functions as well as normal blood volume. Your veterinarian shares your concern 
for your pet's safety and health and will do all that is necessary to make sure 
that she will do fine while in surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have three cats at home, and the one male tends to be very dominant and 
aggressive toward the two other female cats. We had him neutered when he was 6 
months old, and yet he still will grab them on the neck and try to mount them. 
They have also been spayed. We have tried to spray him with a water bottle and 
chase him off when we catch him grabbing one of the girls. Is there anything 
else we can do? 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marni Carpenter, Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
A: Your male cat is obviously the more dominant and has a strong instinct to 
display it with his aggressive behavior. This could also result in his starting 
to spray in the house. It may be possible to start him on medication such as 
Ovaban (megestrol) or even phenobarbital at very low doses in order to reduce 
his behavior. This aggressive behavior may be very difficult to eliminate. I 
know of one incidence where the owners had to find a new home for the 
aggressive cat, where there were no others. 
</P>

County Life, The Times, 1375 Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Ericson,

SPORTSSCOPE: MUIR GIRLS SEND POWERFUL TEAM TO MASTERS TRACK MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After winning the CIF Southern Section 4-A Division title in girls track and 
field last week, Muir High of Pasadena will have the most athletes from the San 
Gabriel Valley in the CIF Masters Meet at 6:30 p.m. Friday at Cerritos College 
in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs have qualified seven individuals and two relay teams, led by 
sprinter Inger Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a junior, won the 100- and 200-meter dashes in the 4-A finals last week 
and posted the second-fastest qualifying time to Rio Mesa's Angela Burnham in 
both events. Miller won the 100 in 11.53 seconds and the 200 in 24.10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
She also ran the anchor leg on both relay teams, which posted exceptional 
times. The Mustangs had the fastest qualifying time, 3:47.47, in the 1,600 
relay and second fastest to Hawthorne in the 400 relay at 47.14 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Other Muir girls competing are Akua Sutherland in the triple jump and 100-meter 
low hurdles, Taminika Terry in the 100 and 200 meters and Staci Moore in the 
400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Walnut has five qualifiers headed by Juliana Yendork and Kimya Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Yendork has the top qualifying mark by far in both the long jump and triple 
jump. She set a Southern Section and 2-A record of 41-9 1/2 in the triple jump 
and a 2-A record of 19-8 in the long jump last week. She also qualified for the 
200 meters in 25.13 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips has qualified in the shot put and the discus, winning both in the 2-A 
finals. She posted marks of 39-1 1/4 in the shot and 134-2 in the discus. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte will compete in four events. The Falcons will have Phetima Woods in the 
100 meters and Jeanine Stewart in the 400 and also qualified its 400 and 1,600 
relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
Another top runner is Karen Hecox of South Hills in the 1,600 and 3,200 meters. 
Hecox easily won 2-A titles in both events last week and has the fastest 
qualifying mark in the 1,600. She posted times of 4:53.90 in the 1,600 and 
10:45.89 in the 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys division, the valley's best hope for an individual title may be 
high jumper Mark Wilson of Charter Oak. The senior, who will attend UCLA, 
posted the top overall qualifying mark of 6-8 in the 4-A finals. 
</P>
<P>
Other possible standouts are Rick Provenzano of Arcadia in 800 meters, Robert 
Nelson of Muir in 3,200 meters and Pasadena's 1,600 relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Senior catcher Chris Goldbach of Cal Poly Pomona, who led the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. in batting average and runs batted in, has been named 
the conference's Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
Goldbach carried a .387 average -- including a .405 mark in conference games -- 
with 53 RBI. He also posted the second longest hitting streak in Pomona history 
-- 30 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos placed four other players on the all-conference first team: senior 
shortstop Dave Hajek, junior outfielder Chris Butterfield, senior outfielder 
Brian Grier and senior utility player Dan Fouts. 
</P>
<P>
Grier finished .0003 behind Goldbach in the conference batting race at .3869 to 
.3872, had 35 RBIs and closed the season with a 17-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield batted .361 with a team-leading nine home runs. Hajek hit .354 with 
a team high of 56 runs scored and 16 stolen bases and Fouts batted .344. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos finished third in the CCAA at 17-13 and were 24-28 overall. Cal 
State L.A., which finished fifth in the conference and was 21-30 overall, added 
two players to the all-conference first team. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles landed junior outfielder Rex De La Nuez and senior third 
baseman Brad Mengel. De La Nuez led the team with a .362 batting average and 
had nine home runs, 45 RBIs and 26 stolen bases. Mengel was the second-leading 
hitter at .347 and had three homers and 40 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Second-team selections include pitchers Wayne Koklys of Pomona and Abdon Pinon 
of Cal State and second baseman Miccal Jackson of Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The University of La Verne, which won the conference baseball championship with 
a 15-3 record and was 20-20 overall, has placed four players on the 
All-Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference first team. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne landed sophomore pitcher Paul Janssen, senior infielders Ron Hubel and 
Eric Smith and junior outfielder Alan MacLeod on the 13-player squad. 
</P>
<P>
Hubel had an exceptional season. He tied for the SCIAC lead in home runs with 
10, finished first in runs batted in with 49 and was third in batting average 
at .389. 
</P>
<P>
MacLeod was also among conference leaders with a .362 batting average and nine 
home runs, and Smith led the SCIAC in stolen bases with 32. Janssen posted a 
4-5 record and 4.03 earned-run average -- sixth best in the conference -- as a 
starting pitcher for the Leopards. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, which finished second in the conference at 14-4 and was 
24-14 overall, added three players to the team: senior pitcher Scott Stallings, 
junior infielder Paul Urrutia and freshman designated hitter Marc Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings led the conference in ERA at 2.48, wins with nine and complete games 
with eight. He finished with a 9-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman and Urrutia finished among the conference hitting leaders. Sherman had 
a .363 batting average with 10 homers and 44 RBIs and Urrutia hit .364.

of 5,507 points in the heptathlon and 178-4 in the javelin. She will also 
compete in the high jump. Her top leap is 5-10. 
</P>
<P>
Another Pomona athlete expected to contend for a title is senior Jon Eagleton,

FAMILY SUES POLICE OFFICER WHO SAVED WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last November, a young waitress named Margaret Parkinson was run down by a 
drunk driver as she helped a friend unload a bicycle from a car on a 
fog-shrouded street in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson, 24, lost her lower right leg and nearly bled to death before two 
Torrance police officers saved her life by applying a makeshift tourniquet they 
fashioned from a rope and a buck knife. 
</P>
<P>
Since the accident on Redondo Beach Boulevard, Parkinson has emerged from a 
coma and is slowly recuperating at a rehabilitation center in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance police officers have been lauded for their efforts: Parkinson's 
father wrote a letter saying he was "terribly grateful" to Officer Devin Chase 
for saving his daughter's life. And the South Bay Police and Fire Medal of 
Valor Committee presented Chase and fellow officer Jerry Wallace with the 
Distinguished Service Award for their "courage and self-control" in rescuing 
Parkinson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$6-Million Suit 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for Parkinson, who was left partially paralyzed and brain-damaged 
by the accident, delivered a strikingly different message this month: a 
$6-million negligence claim that blames Chase and the city for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragic irony," conceded Parkinson's mother, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
Chase said he was floored when he learned of the claim. 
</P>
<P>
"You save someone's life," said Chase, 27, "and you are trying to do the job 
the best you can. . . . Down the road all these people come up, and 
unfortunately they are mostly attorneys, and they say how you are supposed to 
have done things differently." 
</P>
<P>
The claim centers on Chase's actions before the accident, not afterward, said 
Parkinson's father, Lucius (Jim) Parkinson. It alleges that Chase drove past 
Maggie Parkinson before the collision but failed to warn her not to stand 
behind her double-parked car on the fog-blanketed thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
"If my daughter is going to be crippled for the rest of her life and I can find 
compensation, I'm going to look for it," Parkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Finished Work 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 5, 1988, Maggie Parkinson and Ella Schwartz had just finished working 
their Friday night shifts as waitresses at the Cheesecake Factory in Redondo 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It was past 2 a.m. on Saturday morning when Parkinson, who had moved from her 
hometown of Carlsbad to Torrance two months before, stopped to drop Schwartz 
off at her apartment at 3920 W. Redondo Beach Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The women double-parked on the four-lane boulevard to unload the bicycle 
Schwartz had ridden to work, Nancy Parkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chase was driving west. A California Highway Patrol report on the 
incident says Chase recognized the danger of the two women standing, shrouded 
in fog, in the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
Chase stopped to make a U-turn to warn them but, before he could turn, a car 
driven by Eduardo Banda Hernandez passed in the opposite direction, said CHP 
spokesman Richard Richards. Just seconds later, Hernandez's swerving car missed 
Schwartz but slammed into Parkinson, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's leg was nearly severed and she stopped breathing. Chase could not 
find a pulse. But with the assistance of Wallace, Chase stopped the bleeding 
and kept Parkinson alive with CPR until paramedics took her to county 
Hrbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Parkinson wrote to Torrance Police Chief Donald Nash in March to say, 
"Maggie's life was unquestionably saved by (Officer) Devin Chase's competence 
after the accident and for that we are most terribly grateful." 
</P>
<P>
But attorney Robert Kennedy, hired by Jim Parkinson, said he questions what 
happened before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indications From Report 
</P>
<P>
CHP reports seem to indicate that Chase could have turned more quickly, and 
perhaps turned on his warning lights to alert the two women, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Chase denied that, saying passing cars prevented him from turning. "They 
basically say, 'You didn't have a crystal ball, so you screwed up,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
The claim against the city also says trees lining the boulevard had not been 
trimmed, blocking a street light that would have illuminated the road. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Parkinson, a retired petroleum geologist, said he had "some sense of 
misgiving" about filing the claim. "But my primary interest is my daughter's 
well-being, and she is never going to function like she did before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly $300,000 of a $1-million health insurance policy for his daughter has 
been used up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez pleaded no contest to a drunk-driving charge in February. He faced up 
to three years in prison, but he failed to appear at his sentencing in March, 
and authorities said they believe he has fled to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Parkinson said Hernandez had no insurance and that the family does not 
think it will be able to collect damages from him. He wonders how he will pay 
his daughter's bills when the $1-million coverage runs out. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Parkinson said she has left her job as an art teacher at Carlsbad High 
School to tend to her daughter, who lives at an Escondido rehabilitation 
center.

FISHING / DAN STANTON;

<P>
BARRACUDA, BONITO AND BASS SHOULD MAKE MEMORABLE CATCH

<P>
Anglers planning to go out over the three-day Memorial Day weekend should 
prepare for a fish fry. 
</P>
<P>
Name any fish you would like to catch and chances are it can be hooked, 
especially the three Bs: barracuda, bonito and bass. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest run continues to be barracuda with the biggest concentration 
outside Rocky Point. 
</P>
<P>
Yellowtail and white sea bass have broken wide open at Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
The Topgun, sailing from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing with a tank of live squid, 
found the hot spot early this week at Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers used light tackle and the white sea bass, all quality fish, weighed 18 
to 35 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Brandberry of Long Beach caught the whopper of the week with his 
35-pounder. Mark Gotto of West Los Angeles landed a 28-pounder as did Dave Van 
Hotten of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
With the one-fish limit on white sea bass filled, the Topgun had to leave the 
bite early. Capt. Bob Taft moved up the island to where the yellowtail have 
been tearing up tackle. 
</P>
<P>
It was the right move as 27 yellows went into the bulging sacks of sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
The King Harbor Marlin Club and Redondo Yacht Club's third annual Sadie Hawkins 
fishing tournament was a success as 28 women participated from eight boats. 
</P>
<P>
The top three catches went to Torrance women. The overall winner for the 
largest fish was Barbara Haynes with her 20-pound, 11-ounce thresher shark. 
Clinda Woodward placed second with a 9-pound, 13-ounce halibut. Dorrie Hensley 
finished third with a 6-pound sand bass. 
</P>
<P>
Returning Monday from fishing in the Marlin Gold Tournament in Hawaii, Alex 
Gonzales of Wilmington and John Stembridge of Long Beach reported landing big 
catches but failed to win prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales did battle for one hour to land a 559 1/2-pound blue marlin. 
Stembridge landed an 800-pound bronze shark in two hours with 80-pound test 
line. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Mark Larson of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Topgun at Catalina, used 10-pound 
test line and brought an 18 1/2-pound yellowtail out of the kelp. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Sutton of Gardena, on the Hitless Miss at Rocky Point, caught a 17-pound 
white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Auburn of West Los Angeles was at Catalina aboard the Pacifica and caught 
a stray salmon that weighed 16 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
John Ozaeth of San Pedro, on the Outerlimits at San Clemente, won the jackpot 
with a 15-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: 
</P>
<P>
Barracuda fishing is steady. The best area is from Marineland to Rocky Point. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina yellowtail and sea bass are biting on squid. The exotics' preference 
is squid. Bonito and calico bass catches remain steady with anchovies as choice 
bait.

MOUNTAIN BIKERS PATROL THEIR OWN ON THE TRAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The biker was cranking hard along a shady fire road toward a pair of older 
riders in Point Mugu State Park's Sycamore Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
A slight swerve by one of the slow riders forced the young man to sharply 
maneuver his 18-speed mountain bike off the road and back on. He pedaled away 
without a word. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Langton, coordinator of a group of mountain bikers who patrol Santa 
Monica Mountains park areas, saw the incident and caught up with the speeding 
biker. 
</P>
<P>
"You're in Sycamore Canyon, and you have to mellow out," Langton told the 
bicyclist. "You can't ride that way here." 
</P>
<P>
Operating on fire roads and trails in a number of popular biking areas since 
late December, the 25 volunteer members of the Van Nuys-based Mountain Bike 
Unit hope that their presence will serve to moderate the sometimes dangerous 
behavior of thrill-seeking fellow riders. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol's members, who underwent extensive National Park Service training, 
want to be ambassadors for their sport. They want to calm the fears of hikers 
and equestrians who see mountain bikers as a safety threat. 
</P>
<P>
They hope to demonstrate that mountain bikers also cherish the natural beauty 
of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly unregulated, many trails have been closed to bikers in recent years 
amid concerns by hikers about safety, trail damage and destruction of 
wilderness calm. 
</P>
<P>
By improving the image of mountain bikers, members of the patrol units and the 
Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Assn. -- the patrols' parent organization -- hope 
to regain access to back-country trails. Although substantial barriers remain 
to achieving that goal, CORBA has won some converts during its 18 months of 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
"We have, if nothing else, put a face on the mountain bike riding community," 
said Langton, an editor at a Woodland Hills-based off-road biking magazine and 
a member of CORBA. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude and the climate toward mountain bikers has improved. We're not 
faceless marauders. We're a group of individuals . . . concerned about the 
environment as well as with enjoying the aesthetics of the area." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, partly as a result of CORBA's efforts, the Santa Monica Mountains 
Trails Council, a longtime opponent of mountain bikers, has endorsed opening 
three trails to the bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy plans to supply equipment 
for CORBA to expand its patrols into conservancy territory, and CORBA intends 
to recruit additional volunteers. The expansion would be a prelude to giving 
bikers access to most of the roads and trails on conservancy property, a 
conservancy official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their presence in our parks is good for their image, and our image," said 
Carolyn Barr, a project analyst for the conservancy, a state agency that 
acquires and manages parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol units can "explain to people why they need to be polite," Barr said. 
If mountain bikers behave irresponsibly, other groups will question their 
presence in the back country, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the state Department of Parks and Recreation and the National Park 
Service -- which together control 56,000 acres in the mountains -- welcome the 
bike patrols, each has strict limits on where bikes can go. Essentially, the 
agencies allow bikes only on fire roads. 
</P>
<P>
A state parks department policy, which became effective in January, allows 
district park superintendents to grant exceptions to the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, said several longtime Santa Monica Mountains hikers, is not the 
behavior of mountain bikers, but the sheer numbers of them. Practically unknown 
five years ago, riders of the durable, fat-tired, multispeed bicycles have 
become the largest and the fastest-growing recreation group in the mountains, 
parks officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A ranger in Point Mugu State Park, one of the most popular biking areas, 
recently counted 700 bikers in Sycamore Canyon during a single day. Also 
popular are Malibu Creek State Park, Topanga Canyon State Park and trails in 
the Cheeseboro Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the newest, fastest-growing user group out there and that isn't making 
the other two groups very happy," said Peter Heumann, a Woodland Hills bike 
rider who helped form CORBA. The other major groups are equestrians and hikers. 
"They don't see us as legitimate back-country users. They see us invading their 
privacy." 
</P>
<P>
The CORBA patrols, modeled after the Mounted Assist Units organized by 
equestrian groups, have been trained by the National Park Service to give first 
aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to keep their unofficial standing in 
mind when dealing with the public. The two-person bike patrols are equipped 
with emergency radios, first-aid kits, repair kits and maps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Official Power 
</P>
<P>
Patrol members stressed that they have no power to enforce laws; they can only 
remind park users of rules and provide directions, maps, advice or emergency 
water. On a recent patrol that Langton said was typical, he helped repair a 
bicyclist's gears, informed someone clutching a bouquet of wildflowers that 
picking flowers is against the law, advised another visitor that dogs are not 
allowed in the park and reprimanded a fellow biker for riding too fast. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that you should never go fast, but you should always be in control of 
yourself," Langton said. "There are plenty of places you can go flat out, with 
no regard for people going slow." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, Sycamore Canyon, which stretches in a sometimes steep slope from 
Newbury Park to the Pacific Coast Highway, is not one of them. That message 
seems to be getting out. 
</P>
<P>
"Most mountain bikers we encounter any more are courteous and they either slow 
down or stop for horsemen," said Ralph Bauer of Chatsworth, an equestrian who 
recently encountered one of the CORBA patrols in Sycamore Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only so many trails, and we know we have to share them," added his 
wife, Elodie Bauer. "If we don't all work together, we're going to lose these 
trails." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed by their zeal and their sincerity," Dan Preece, Santa Monica 
Mountains state park district superintendent, said of CORBA members. 
</P>
<P>
But issues remain, he said. "We are determined to keep an open mind, but 
basically we have been concerned by the things we've seen on the trails with 
bikes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints Continue 
</P>
<P>
Hikers and bikers are often injured in collisions, he said, although he could 
supply no statistics. And park rangers continue to hear complaints about 
speeding bikers. "Our concern is that bicycles do move down steep inclines at a 
high rate of speed in silence, so there is very little warning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Preece said he also worries about the difficulty of enforcing any policy change 
that opens some state park trails while keeping others closed. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Webster, who builds trails in the Santa Monicas for the Sierra Club and the 
conservancy, once praised CORBA's efforts. But he had a change of heart when, 
on a recent hike, a large number of bikers peddled past and he felt besieged. 
</P>
<P>
"I go into the parks, personally, for peace and solitude," he said. "I felt 
they were seriously infringing on my ability to enjoy the parks in that way." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he said, he will urge that all state parks, including their fire 
roads, be off limits to bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
But Linda Palmer, president of the Santa Monica Trails Council, plans to 
support the reopening of three trails for use by bikers: the Bent Arrow Trail 
in Topanga State Park; the Yearling Trail at the Reagan Ranch in Malibu Creek 
State Park and the La Jolla Loop Trail near the western end of the Santa 
Monicas. Palmer said the trails council's stand is a departure from past 
positions. She said the change "is probably a good deal due to CORBA's 
educational efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The mountain bicycles are probably with us to stay, and it is such a large 
user group that they do need places to ride," she said. "It is a legitimate 
recreational pursuit, and there must be a way of working it out."

WAVES BASEBALL COACH MAINTAINS WINNING TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before Pepperdine began its baseball season, first-year Coach Andy Lopez said 
that he didn't expect to revolutionize the school's program -- and he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
He simply maintained the same sort of power over the West Coast Athletic 
Conference that his predecessor, Dave Gorrie, usually exerted before he retired 
after last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves made four straight NCAA tournament appearances in Gorrie's last four 
seasons, won another WCAC title this season under Lopez and will be making 
their fifth straight NCAA appearance, their seventh since 1979, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine (41-17-1), is seeded fourth in the NCAA West II Regional at Fresno 
State's Belden Field and will open against third-seeded Michigan (46-14), the 
regular-season Big 10 Conference champion, at 3:30 p.m. in the 
double-elimination regional. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the winner of the Pepperdine-Michigan game will face the winner of 
Friday's game between second-seeded Fresno State (42-17) and No. 5 Notre Dame 
(47-17), and the loser will meet the winner between top-seeded Wichita State 
(58-14) and No. 6 Portland (32-22). 
</P>
<P>
Like Pepperdine, Michigan has dominated its conference in recent years. In Bud 
Middaugh's 10 years as coach, the Wolverines have won 462 games, six 
regular-season Big 10 championships and five conference tournament titles. 
</P>
<P>
This year Michigan finished in first place in the Big 10 at 21-6 but lost the 
conference tournament final, 2-0, to Illinois, which had tied Iowa for second 
place in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves and the Wolverines overcame what was viewed as a lack of pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Michigan's top four starters in 1988 signed contracts with major 
league teams, including ace Jim Abbott. Abbott went on to star with the U.S. 
Olympic team and is in the starting rotation of the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine lost its top two starters from last season. Doug Simons, who was 
11-3 with a 2.42 earned-run average, was a ninth-round draft choice of the 
Minnesota Twins. Dennis Burbank, who was 11-2 with a 3.75 ERA, transferred to 
Cypress Junior College. 
</P>
<P>
But both teams managed to find good pitching, much of it right on their 
rosters. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan's top pitchers have been left-hander Ross Powell and right-hander Mike 
Grimes. Powell, the team's best relief pitcher in 1987 and 1988, replaced 
Abbott as Michigan's ace, and Grimes, the other starter from last year, also 
had an excellent season. 
</P>
<P>
Powell (9-0, 2.05 ERA, 87 2/3 innings) became only the second pitcher to lead 
the Big 10 in conference victories (seven), strikeouts (53) and ERA (1.53). The 
first was Tom Fletcher of Illinois in 1962. Powell has 192 career strikeouts, 
surpassing Abbott's school record of 186. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes, picked as a preseason All-American by Baseball America magazine, was 
8-3 with a 4.12 ERA and fanned 66 batters in 74 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine's best hurler has been right-handed junior Britt Craven. Last year 
Craven was 5-3 with 28 strikeouts and a 5.26 ERA in 65 innings; this year he is 
10-3 with 85 strikeouts and a 2.84 ERA in a team-high 126 2/3 innings. He was 
named the WCAC Pitcher of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, the WCAC Coach of the Year, also received strong pitching from three 
other right-handed juniors: Sean Casey, who played for Pasadena and Santa Rosa 
junior colleges; Wayne Helm, who was 4-2 with 35 strikeouts and a 2.92 ERA in 
37 innings last year, and John Kuzmic, a transfer from Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
This year Casey pitched 83 innings and was 7-2 with a 3.14 ERA and 37 
strikeouts, Helm went 102 2/3 innings and was 6-4 with a 4.12 ERA and 99 
strikeouts, and Kuzmic was 7.4 with a 5.45 ERA and 36 strikeouts in 62.7 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
The leading relief pitchers for Lopez have been junior righty Randy Hacker, 
right-handed sophomore Jeff Graham and lefty Rick Hirtensteiner, better known 
as the team's center fielder and this year's WCAC Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Hirtensteiner led Pepperdine with a .371 batting average and 12 home runs, and 
four other Waves hit well above .300: junior left fielder Richard Barnwell 
(.354), senior second baseman Matt Howard (.346), senior first baseman Scott 
Shockey (.342 and a team-high 61 runs batted in) and sophomore right fielder 
Jalal Leach (.325). Hirtensteiner, Barnwell, Howard and Leach each knocked in 
more than 40 runs. Shockey also had 11 homers and Barnwell 10. 
</P>
<P>
Barnwell led the team in stolen bases with 27, and Howard had 24 and Leach 22. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan's top hitters have been All-Big 10 second baseman Matt Morse (a 
team-high .358), freshman third baseman Tim Flannelly (.343 and a team-leading 
50 RBIs), designated hitter Kourtney Thompson (.340, five home runs) and right 
fielder Phil Price, who topped the squad with seven homers and hit .322 with 41 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, whose team won 24 of its last 29 games, thought before the season that 
it would be difficult for Pepperdine to get this far. "We didn't have a lot of 
people on the pitching staff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But as the season wore on I would have been more surprised if we (hadn't). 
Things have worked out OK. I think, for the most part, we started playing well 
at the right time, which made it a lot easier for things to be taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
He said that either Craven or Helm will start against Michigan and that the 
other will pitch the second game.

A TRUE-BLUE BRUIN; 
</P>
<P>
SPRINTER MIKE MARSH, NURSING SORE HAMSTRING, SHOWS HIS COMPETITIVE SPIRIT TO 
KEEP UCLA UNDEFEATED STREAK INTACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN FLEISCHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best way to sum up Mike Marsh's senior year at UCLA was the series of 
events that took place April 15 at Drake Stadium during the meet against 
Houston and Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
All season, Marsh has had to balance his commitments to the Bruin team with his 
career as a world-class sprinter who competed in the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, a graduate of Hawthorne High, and teammate Steve Lewis, the Olympic gold 
medal winner in the 400 meters, had entered the Drake Stadium meet nursing sore 
hamstrings and were not expected to run. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, the Bruins would still have been in good shape, but their 
sprinting corps has been depleted this year with the loss of Danny Everett, the 
Olympic bronze medal winner in the 400 meters who turned professional, and 
Henry Thomas, another Hawthorne graduate who decided to redshirt this season. 
</P>
<P>
So with Marsh and Lewis watching from the sidelines, the early lead that UCLA 
built against LSU in the field events gradually dwindled, leaving the Bruins' 
four-year dual meet winning streak in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve and I talked about it and we decided that if it came down to the mile 
relay, we'd run," Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the last event, the mile relay, UCLA trailed LSU, 77-72, and Marsh 
and Lewis decided to give it that old college try and run. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, they had to convince their sprint coach, John Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"John said no at first," Marsh said. "Steve did all the talking. We sat him 
down and told him we wanted to do this. This is our track team, our home and we 
wanted to keep the streak alive. This was a decision that we made. He said OK." 
</P>
<P>
So Marsh ran a 45.6 second leg and Lewis a 46.4 anchor leg as the Bruins won 
the event and tied the meet at 77-77 to extend the unbeaten streak to 42 (it 
has since been extended to 43). 
</P>
<P>
"I'd gone into the meet thinking I'm not going to run," Marsh said. "And I sat 
around for a while. But them emotions get to flying and all of the sudden it's 
like, 'Well, (the hamstring is) not that bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Marsh's hamstring problems have continued to plague him and he has 
been used sparingly, with his last race on April 28 against USC. Marsh and 
Smith said that by running to keep the streak alive, Marsh might have 
reaggravated the injury, putting his other goals -- such as running on the 
professional circuit in Europe this summer -- in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"We saved the unbeaten streak, but I did irritate my hamstring a little bit. 
That might have something to do with the problems I'm having now," Marsh said. 
"But I make no excuses. That's the decision I made. I'm not bitter about it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "If I had to do it again, I wouldn't let them run. But I have a lot 
of respect for what they did. That's why they're here. . . . It was something 
they felt they needed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the LSU dramatics, Marsh's only other notable success during this 
injury-plagued year has been a school-record 10.07 in the 100 meters in the 
Gainesville relays when he took second to Olympic teammate Dennis Mitchell of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend at the Pacific 10 Conference finals, Marsh decided against running 
in the 100 or 200 meters (he would have run in the finals of the 400-meter 
relay if the team hadn't been disqualified in a preliminary race) but took 
second behind Lewis in the 400 meters. In qualifying for the 400, Marsh had a 
lifetime best of 46.21. Marsh also ran the second leg of the winning 
1,600-meter relay and the Bruins will try to qualify for nationals in both 
relays this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want Mike to come blasting out of the starts in the 100 or 200 where 
he could reinjure himself," said UCLA Coach Bob Larsen, who guided the Bruin 
men to their third consecutive conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh placed sixth in the 100 meters at the U.S. national trials in 
Indianapolis, earning a spot on the 400-meter relay team. The U.S. team, 
however, was disqualified for an illegal baton exchange in the first qualifying 
round, leaving Marsh a spectator for the remainder of the Games. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed that the team got disqualified, but things like that 
happen," Marsh said. "The thing with Seoul was the whole international scene. 
You saw a spirit of competition that was tremendous. Everybody came out on top. 
You're already a success being there." 
</P>
<P>
Marsh is setting his sights on the national championships May 31-June 3 in 
Provo, Utah. Last year Marsh finished fourth in the 100 meters and ran on the 
400-meter relay team that took second. As a sophomore, he finished third in the 
100 meters and fourth in the 200 meters. He still hopes to race in Europe this 
summer, then plans to return to UCLA to get his degree in history with a 
business emphasis and possibly attend graduate school. He also has his eye on 
the 1992 Olympics, which will be held in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"Seoul's given me a bigger perspective on the things I want to do in track and 
field," he said. "I want to go into Barcelona and be one of the best. That's 
what I'm setting up to train for."

UCLA IN GOOD SPOT TO KEEP SOFTBALL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everything seems to point toward victory for the defending national champion 
UCLA women's softball team in the NCAA Division I College World Series, which 
ends Sunday in Sunnyvale. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Bruins (43-4) have won 11 straight games, their top pitchers are 
peaking and their hot hitters are getting hotter. In addition, UCLA Coach 
Sharron Backus' teams have won five national titles (including four in the last 
six years) and have posted two second-place and two third-place NCAA finishes 
in her 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that might hamper the Bruins would be complacency, and Backus 
seems likely to prevent that. A tough field should also keep the UCLA women on 
their toes. UCLA opened play Wednesday against South Carolina (45-10) in the 
double-elimination tournament at the Twin Creeks Sports Complex. Other teams in 
the tournament are Oregon (52-16), Cal Poly Pomona (42-21), Fresno State 
(55-14), Arizona (45-18), Toledo (35-21) and Oklahoma State (44-4). 
</P>
<P>
In last week's Northwest Regional at UCLA, the Bruins defeated Cal State Long 
Beach, 5-1 and 3-0. In the first game, Samantha Ford (10-1) pitched four 
scoreless innings in relief of ace Lisa Longaker (17-1) to pick up the win and 
extend her streak of scoreless innings to 25. In the second game, freshman 
Tiffany Boyd (16-2) pitched a seven-inning shutout, extending her 
scoreless-inning streak to 23. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin senior third baseman Janice Parks is in the midst of adding to her 
hitting records, and freshman outfielder Yvonne Gutierrez, a Culver City High 
School graduate, has hit in 10 straight games. Sophomore infielder Missy 
Phillips had four hits (including three doubles) in five at-bats against Long 
Beach, knocking in three runs and scoring twice. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA men's heavyweight varsity crew, which won its third straight Pacific 
Coast Rowing championship and set a course record in its last outing, will 
compete June 1-3 in the Intercollegiate Rowing Assn. Regatta at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pacific Coast competition at Lake Natoma, the Bruins won in 5:45.35, 
nipping Washington (5:45.52), which had entered the race as the West Coast's 
top-ranked crew. Only the Huskies had ever won three straight Pacific Coast 
titles before, and the Bruins championships have all been under Zenon Babraj, 
who became UCLA's head coach in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Ace Thayer is UCLA's varsity coxswain, and the crew includes stroke Mike 
Farrell, Marc Batchelder, Eric Kowal, Mike Stralka, Teo Bielefeld, Simon 
Outhwaite, Stefanos Volianitis of Greece and bow Brad Marquardt. Thayer and 
Volianitis are juniors, Marquardt is a sophomore, and the others are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
After the Syracuse regatta, UCLA will compete in the national championships on 
June 17 at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA women golfers Jean Zedlitz and Christy Erb are competing in the individual 
NCAA championships, which end Saturday at Palo Alto. Zedlitz, a junior, is 
ranked sixth nationally and has averaged 75.7 strokes this season. Freshman Erb 
has averaged 77.3 and is ranked 28th in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Names in the News 
</P>
<P>
Ken Barone, basketball coach at Newbury Park High School for the last 11 years, 
has been named a volunteer assistant at UCLA, announced UCLA Coach Jim Harrick. 
Barone's Newbury Park teams have advanced to the CIF-Southern Section playoffs 
six times and reached the semifinals in 1975 and 1981. They also won two 
Marmonte League championships and he was twice named league coach of the year. 
He holds a bachelor's degree from Western State College of Colorado and a 
master's degree from Arizona State. Previously, he coached three years at St. 
Mary's High School in Phoenix, seven years at Oxnard Rio Mesa High and four 
years at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
University High School senior Brian Townsley, a wide receiver and outfielder, 
was awarded a $500 scholarship from the West Los Angeles Lions Club for 
academic and athletic achievement. Townsley will attend UC Berkeley in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Moe Chavez shot a 72 for 18 holes to win the A flight at the Penmar Men's Golf 
Club tournament at Willowick Golf Course. Other flight winners and their gross 
scores were John Griffin, B, 79, and Jim Hookstratten, C, 81.

MOORPARK PLAYS 21 IN SOFTBALL GAME;

<P>
MARATHON VICTORY HELPS LADY RAIDERS TO THIRD-PLACE STATE FINISH 
</P>

It was a record De Dow could have done without. 
</P>
<P>
Dow, the winningest pitcher in Moorpark College history, would have been 
content to end her career with school records for wins in a season (30) and a 
career (48). 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore right-hander came away from the state junior college softball 
championships at Golden West College in Huntington Beach last week with one 
more school record, however. She pitched the longest softball game in Moorpark 
history -- a 21-inning, six-hour marathon Saturday night against Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Dow picked up the 2-1 victory over Cypress to keep Moorpark alive in the 
double-elimination tournament. The Lady Raiders went on to finish third in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the game ended at 2:30 a.m. Sunday, Dow felt relieved more than 
anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"The cold weather was starting to get to me and my hand was getting a little 
stiff," Dow said. "And I was hungry." 
</P>
<P>
A 21-inning game was an unusual experience for everyone involved. So unusual it 
was a state record for innings. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way to describe the emotions that you go through when you're in a 
game that late," Coach Will Thurston said. "It was at the point where it was 
almost like a fantasy was going on." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress, which played a 20-inning game earlier in the day, and Moorpark both 
wasted numerous scoring opportunities. The Lady Raiders had a chance to win in 
the 19th when Rosa Jimenez hit a leadoff triple. The Chargers got out of 
trouble when Julie Myers flied to right and Jimenez was thrown out trying to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
"We had so many chances to score," Dow said. "It was so up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark finally won in the 21st as Gina Duarte scored from third on an infield 
grounder by Myers. 
</P>
<P>
Dow, who pitched 28 innings in two games Saturday, was selected to the 
all-tournament team along with Jimenez, Duarte and Paula Allen. Dow picked up 
three victories at the state tournament to finish the season 30-7. 
</P>
<P>
After Dow pitched two games Saturday, Thurston decided against starting her in 
Sunday's semifinal game against Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been great to have used De, and all indications were that she 
would have done great," Thurston said. "But when we finished at 2:30 in the 
morning, there was no doubt who I was going to throw." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton scored three runs against Jimenez in the fourth inning of the 
semifinal match-up and made them stand up for a 3-0 victory to eliminate 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez (6-5) pitched a four-hour marathon Friday night as Moorpark lost, 1-0, 
to Palomar in 13 innings. Moorpark dropped into the loser's bracket and rallied 
to defeat College of San Mateo, 3-2, Saturday before facing Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar defeated Fullerton, 2-0, to win the state title. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's third-place finish caps the Lady Raiders' best season ever. Moorpark 
set a record for wins in a season (38), won its third consecutive Western State 
Conference title and became the first Moorpark team to reach a state 
championship tournament.

COMMERCIAL TV IN CLASS 'BAD DEAL' FOR SCHOOLS, HONIG SAYS IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State schools Supt. Bill Honig today delivered a negative report card for 
Channel 1, a controversial, satellite-delivered television show that introduced 
commercials into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Our students' minds aren't for sale," Honig said in Anaheim as he announced 
that public schools would not be allowed to collect state money for the time 
that students spent watching the commercial television. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle Communications had introduced a pilot program into five schools 
nationwide, including Gahr High School in Cerritos. The five-week pilot program 
ended in April. Students watched a 12-minute news and public affairs program 
that included two minutes of commercials for such products as Snickers, Levis 
and Ford automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
"California law protects our youngsters against forced commercialization in 
school," Honig said. "On the whole, it's a bad deal for kids, a bad deal for 
education, and it sets a terrible precedent." 
</P>
<P>
Honig and Betty Lindsey, president of the California PTA, said they believe 
that California is the first state to take a position against Whittle's plan to 
expand its program nationwide.

NBC won the May television sweeps, matching its own record for the widest 
margin of victory ever, it was announced today. CBS came in second and ABC was 
third. 
</P>
<P>
The TV sweeps, during which the ratings companies measure viewing in about 200 
local markets, form the basis for local advertising rates and to a lesser 
degree influence network prices. NBC had a 24% margin of victory over CBS and 
28% over ABC, matching its own record margin over the second-place contender a 
year ago, said Gerry Jaffe, NBC vice president for research.

A Folsom Prison inmate was stabbed to death and several others were shot and 
wounded by guards during a brawl this morning on the prison's main exercise 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 inmates were injured during the fight, which erupted about 10 a.m., 
said Lt. Cammy Voss, a spokeswoman for the prison. About 1,000 prisoners were 
outside when the fight broke out, but it was not immediately known how many 
were involved in the melee. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour, guards had cleared the exercise yard and placed the entire 
prison into lock-down, where all prisoners are confined in their cells.

BLAST BURNS 10 HOMES; 2 DIE;

GAS EXPLOSION AT CRASH SITE OF RUNAWAY TRAIN

<P>
At least two people died and 25 were injured this morning when a fireball from 
a ruptured gasoline line engulfed homes and outraced fleeing children in the 
same low-income neighborhood where a killer, runaway freight train ripped 
through a row of houses two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ten homes were leveled in Thursday's new tragedy in the Muscoy section of 
western San Bernardino. Six people have died and 21 homes, most of them on 
Duffy Street, have been destroyed in the neighborhood since the morning of May 
12. 
</P>
<P>
The gasoline leak and fireball erupted about 8 a.m. in what used to be the yard 
of a house on the west side of Duffy Street, one of 11 homes destroyed when a 
speeding freight train jumped the tracks on a curve. The rubble had been 
cleared and the west side of the street fenced before this morning's fire, 
which destroyed homes on the east side of Duffy that were unscathed by the 
train derailment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Train Passes By 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said today's firestorm, which sent thick black smoke towering 300 
feet and forced evacuation of several blocks, whipped through the neighborhood 
moments after a freight train roared past on the repaired tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"The train went by, and then I heard this loud bang. I just started running," 
said Leah Thomas, 10, who was waiting for her school bus when the fireball 
erupted. "My backpack fell off, and I got burned on my arm by the heat. I was 
screaming. There was smoke and flames." 
</P>
<P>
While she was being treated by paramedics, Thomas reflected on the last 14 
days. "I just want to leave this place," she said. "I don't want to live here 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
When the fire erupted, firefighters at a nearby station felt the concussion. As 
they boarded their trucks, a car pulled up carrying six burned people. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were unclear if the passing train sparked the fireball. They 
speculated that sparks from a three-car accident on nearby Highland Avenue may 
have set off a cloud of gasoline fumes, but there were no firm clues to the 
cause immediately. 
</P>
<P>
John Montgomery, a planner for the city of San Bernardino, said today that a 
gasoline odor had been reported by people in the area in the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-inch, steel gasoline line owned by the Cal-Nevada Pipeline Co. was 
carrying unleaded fuel 250 miles to Las Vegas. It was under high pressure to 
push the fuel up the El Cajon grade into the upper desert. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unaware of Line 
</P>
<P>
Residents said they were unaware of the gasoline line running beneath their 
properties until the train wreck. The pipeline is a major conduit that moves 
about 3 million gallons of gasoline daily and supplies 90% of the gasoline sold 
in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
After the May 12 derailment, residents were evacuated while the train cars and 
locomotive were removed and the fuel line inspected. Residents returned to 
their homes and fuel resumed flowing the week after the derailment.

TEACHERS VOTE TO END STRIKE -- FRIDAY RETURN EXPECTED; 
</P>
<P>
PACT SETTLES NINE-DAY WALKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Striking Los Angeles teachers approved a three-year contract at the Sports 
Arena this afternoon, paving the way for classrooms to return to normal after a 
wrenching nine-day strike. 
</P>
<P>
In a voice vote, a majority of roughly 12,000 teachers at the session shouted 
that they favored the contract. Union Vice President Frances Haywood then 
declared: "The contract has been accepted." A written ballot, considered a 
formality, is to be taken later today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Unified School District board was meeting in a 
closed session and was expected to decide to accept the pact as well. If that 
happens, the teachers are likely to return to classes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Under a compromise agreement announced early today by union and district 
officials, teachers will receive a 24% pay hike over three years. Teachers in 
Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest school district, currently earn 
salaries ranging from $23,440 to $43,319 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The pact also called for teachers to receive half of the pay they were docked 
for refusing to hand in grade reports before the strike. The rest can be earned 
back through extra work. 
</P>
<P>
Before the ratification vote this morning, the union's board of directors had 
decided to make no recommendation on the proposed settlement to the full union 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Dale Johnson, a member of the roughly 50-member board said, "We took a 
'no position' because we have faith in the ability of our membership to make 
the ultimate decision. They're the ones who carried the strike. They're the 
ones responsible for the decision." 
</P>
<P>
UTLA President Wayne Johnson said directors took the neutral stance because 
many teachers are "furious" about the district's refusal to restore all of the 
docked pay. "The docked pay is the fly in the ointment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials had fought to dock the teachers to set a precedent in case 
of future job actions. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for the elimination of mandatory playground 
supervision by elementary school teachers and the creation of 
shared-decision-making councils at schools, two issues that also had divided 
the union and district during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
The bitter strike has crippled classroom instruction in the huge district, with 
two-thirds of the regular teachers walking picket lines and about half of the 
students also staying out of school.

U.S. CITES JAPAN, BRAZIL AND INDIA FOR UNFAIR TRADE

<P>
The United States today cited Japan, Brazil and India for unfair trade 
practices, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
High Administration officials briefed Congress on President Bush's decision. A 
formal announcement was being held back until the affected nations could be 
informed. 
</P>
<P>
Washington cited the unfair trade practices of Japan for wood products, 
satellites and superconductors, Brazil for licensing and services, and India 
for investment, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The congressional sources said the United States notified five other countries 
that they will become priorities for investigation of unfair trade practices 
involving intellectual property rights. 
</P>
<P>
Another 25 countries will be placed on a "watch list" for possible 
investigation of unfair trade. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills and Commerce Secretary Robert A. 
Mosbacher had urged Bush to cite Japan for unfair trade practices, but key 
foreign policy advisers had argued that Tokyo should be spared because it is a 
loyal ally in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, which had a $52.1-billion trade surplus with the United States last 
year, was a key target of congressional proponents of the 1988 Trade Act, which 
requires Hills to list countries believed to have significant barriers against 
foreign goods by May 28. 
</P>
<P>
But the decision, under the law's so-called "Super 301" provision, was actually 
made by Bush after listening to heated debate at a Monday meeting of his 
Economic Policy Council. 
</P>
<P>
The nations cited must agree to end the restrictions within 18 months or face 
retaliation, which could include 100% tariffs on their exports. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and businessmen from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have repeatedly 
called on Congress and the Administration to keep their names off the list.

SLUMP IN SMALL CAR SALES FORCES FORD TO IDLE ESCORT PLANT IN N.J.

Slumping sales of small cars prompted Ford Motor Co. to idle its Edison, N.J., 
Escort plant this week in the robust auto maker's first U.S. layoffs since 
1983, the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the shutdown reflects an industrywide decline in small car sales 
that is due mainly to economic uncertainty on the part of car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Ford spokesman Raymond Windecker said the auto maker does not know when the 
Edison plant, which employs 1,500 workers, will reopen. He said a decision will 
be made on a week-to-week basis. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of Escort models are down 8% this year and Ford has a 100-day supply of 
the cars, compared with the 60- to 65-day supply considered the ideal inventory 
level.

NAKASONE TELLS OF HIS ROLE IN JAPAN SCANDAL

Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone emerged virtually unscathed today after 
testifying before Parliament on his role in Japan's biggest postwar political 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone, who had initially refused to testify, took the stand in a crowded 
parliamentary committee room where he coolly shrugged off questions, as well as 
some bitter jibes from members of his own ruling Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
He revealed for the first time that he received about $325,000 in illegal 
political donations from Recruit publishing and telecommunications company 
while in office. 
</P>
<P>
The Recruit shares-for-favors scandal occurred during his term as premier 
between 1982 and 1987 and Japanese tradition calls for a leader to take full 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
In answer to one question, Nakasone said he felt deep responsibility for his 
role in the scandal but would continue as a member of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
His words were almost drowned out by an interruption from fellow LDP member 
Koichi Hamada. "We ourselves are in deep trouble because of him," Hamada 
shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Other LDP members jeered throughout the session, sometimes making it hard to 
hear Nakasone.

Cornell University has suspended a graduate student who created a computer 
"virus" that jammed a nationwide computer network last year, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Tappan Morris, 23, was informed in a May 16 letter by the dean of the 
Cornell University Graduate School that the university's Academic Integrity 
Hearing Board recommended that he be suspended until the fall semester of 1990, 
the New York Times said. 
</P>
<P>
The virus entered about 6,000 computers at universities, corporations and 
military installations last November and replicated itself until systems 
nationwide were jammed.

The first competitively elected Soviet Parliament convened today and chose 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the sole candidate for president after rejecting 
demands that he first report on his accomplishments and failures. 
</P>
<P>
Maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin withdrew his nomination bid. A little-known 
Leningrad deputy, Alexander Obolensky, offered himself as an alternative to 
Gorbachev, but two-thirds of the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies 
rejected him. 
</P>
<P>
Obolensky, who is not a member of the ruling Communist Party, said he knew that 
he had little chance of winning the nomination but wanted to "set a precedent 
of an alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, whose anti-Establishment campaign for Parliament garnered 90% of the 
vote in an election in Moscow, took himself out of the running, saying simply, 
"I'm withdrawing myself." He said that as a member of the Communist Party's 
Central Committee, he was bound by the committee's decision to support 
Gorbachev for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov said he would not take part in the 
secret balloting for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Votes Against Him 
</P>
<P>
"We can't let these elections just be a formality," the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize 
winner said. Sakharov was one of four deputies who abstained when the congress 
voted to place Gorbachev's name on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
No one voted against Gorbachev's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Estonian activist Marju Lauristen offered Gorbachev her vote on condition that 
he answer some tough questions first. For instance, she wanted to know who in 
the ruling Politburo knew of plans to use troops to break up a pro-independence 
demonstration in Soviet Georgia, and how soon Gorbachev learned of the plans. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen people died in the ensuing clash. 
</P>
<P>
Others demanded explanations of privileges enjoyed by Soviet leaders and of a 
decree banning statements that discredit authorities. 
</P>
<P>
As the inaugural session opened, the congress plunged into spirited debate over 
its agenda and powers. The lack of parliamentary experience showed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pledge Not to Abuse Power 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev led the proceedings, sitting behind two microphones with a giant 
statue of Vladimir I. Lenin at his back. He arbitrarily called for votes on 
some procedural issues while ignoring others. Only a few deputies objected. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the Soviet president took the microphone for 20 minutes, and in 
one of his most impassioned political speeches, pledged not to abuse power if 
reelected. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first deputies to take the floor was Sakharov, who was banished from 
Moscow until December, 1986, for human rights activities. 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov praised Gorbachev for changing the face of Soviet society and said he 
should be reelected president but demanded that Gorbachev first give the 
congress an account of the mistakes and achievements of his reform efforts.

Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens denied having sex with a teen-age girl but did 
offer her mother a job during a telephone conversation secretly recorded by the 
FBI and police and played for the jury today. 
</P>
<P>
On the tape, played on the fourth day of Lukens' trial on charges of 
contributing to the delinquency or unruliness of a minor, Lukens told the 
girl's mother that her daughter had been calling, and he asked that she stop. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the misdemeanor, the 58-year-old Republican could be sentenced 
to six months in jail and fined $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
During the Nov. 11 conversation, Anna Coffman told the congressman that her 
17-year-old daughter, Rosie, had confessed to her that she had sex with Lukens 
on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"She was there with Mercedes. What Mercedes and I did was private. Your 
daughter had nothing to do with it," Lukens replied, according to the tape. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes was the name used by Rosie Coffman's friend, Michelle Foster, then 19, 
who had invited her to Lukens' apartment that night. 
</P>
<P>
Lukens also asked Anna Coffman whether she was still "interested in the job." 
The mother testified earlier that Lukens made her a job offer during a meeting 
at a Columbus fast-food restaurant earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Rosie Coffman testified that she had sex with Lukens on the eve of 
her 17th birthday and lied to Lukens, telling him she was turning 19 years old.

Allegheny International Inc., maker of Sunbeam and Oster home appliances, today 
said it has stopped pursuing a merger with a subsidiary of the New York 
investment banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Allegheny International, which filed for bankruptcy last February, said that it 
does not anticipate achieving expected levels of domestic operating profit for 
fiscal 1989 and that the failure to achieve the profit would prevent the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
The company had been told by the DLJ subsidiary that the domestic operating 
profit results were critically important to the subsidiary's ability to raise 
the financing required under the merger agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Allegheny International also said it intends to file with the bankruptcy court 
a separate plan of reorganization for its Sunbeam Corp. subsidiary to permit it 
to emerge from bankruptcy in the near future while AI continued its own 
reorganization case.

The Dixie Brewing Co., the Deep South's last major independent beer maker, has 
filed for bankruptcy protection to keep city tax officials from closing the 
82-year-old brewery. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapter 11 petition filed late Wednesday will apparently allow the company 
to continue operating while it reorganizes its finances. Workers were seen 
entering the brewery this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Dixie received a letter Tuesday from the city giving it 24 hours to come up 
with $375,000 in overdue sales and property taxes or shut down.

Half the editorial staff of a New York-based Chinese newspaper quit after the 
publisher demanded that they print his commentary urging the use of troops to 
restore order in Beijing, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Four reporters, two editors and the editor in chief walked out of the Center 
Daily on Wednesday, two hours before the paper's 10 a.m. press time, the New 
York Times said. 
</P>
<P>
The Center Daily's publisher, Chaochu Fu, called on typists and graphic editors 
to compose the front page to include his article, to which the editor in chief 
and others had objected, saying it was reactionary. 
</P>
<P>
The chaos created by the walkout at the Center Daily led to the paper's 
Wednesday editions being printed in two sections instead of the usual four.

The chairwoman of the Interstate Commerce Commission resigned in tears today, 
saying "the White House and I have concluded it was not in our interest to 
fight the Senate Commerce Committee." 
</P>
<P>
Heather J. Gradison, a member of the commission since 1982 and its chairwoman 
since December, 1985, offered no further explanation at a meeting attended by 
about 100 commission employees. They applauded when she finished her brief 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Her five-year term was up last December, but she had remained on the job. An 
Interstate Commerce Commission source who declined to be identified said 
Democratic Sens. Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and J. James Exon of 
Nebraska have expressed strenuous opposition to her renomination. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time to move on," said Gradison, wife of Rep. Bill Gradison 
(R-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
Insiders said the dispute with the Senate Commerce Committee goes back to last 
year when a bill to re-regulate the railroad industry was defeated 11 to 10 in 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Gradison is a strong advocate of deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a different agency today than we had seven years ago," she said. "We 
have far fewer employees. . . . We have a healthy rail industry. We have a 
competitive motor carrier industry." 
</P>
<P>
The commission source said that when Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV 
(D-W.Va.) introduced a bill last year to re-regulate the railroad industry, 
Exon voted against it and that "it was understood that the deal cut by Exon was 
that the bill would not come up again if new people came on to the commission." 
</P>
<P>
The source said because of the opposition to Gradison, the feeling was that if 
her name were sent over for renomination by President Bush, there would be a 
difficult fight.

FITZSIMMONS COACH OF YEAR

Cotton Fitzsimmons, who directed the Phoenix Suns to a 27-game improvement over 
the previous season, today was named NBA Coach of the Year for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy, honored and excited to be recognized," Fitzsimmons said. "The award 
is great, but I have to share it with everybody. Without all that help from the 
players, assistant coaches and the organization, no way I can win it. This 
award is just a reflection of the type of season we had. Winning brings the 
spoils." 
</P>
<P>
In becoming the fourth coach to win the award twice, Fitzsimmons received 36 
1/2 votes from a national panel of 85 media members who regularly cover the NBA 
-- three from each competing city and 10 representatives of the national media. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nelson, who coached the Golden State Warriors to a 23-game improvement, 
finished second with 26 1/2 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Wilkens of Cleveland was third with nine votes, followed by Chuck Daly of 
Detroit with five, Wes Unseld of Washington four, Rick Pitino of New York two, 
and Del Harris of Milwaukee and Pat Riley of the Lakers, one each. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons, 57, who was named coach of the Suns last summer, led Phoenix to a 
55-27 record, after a 28-54 mark in 1987-88. The Suns are currently playing the 
Lakers in the Western Conference playoff finals. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons, who coached five NBA teams between 1970 and 1986, including the 
Suns from 1970 to '72, also won the coaching award in 1979 when he led the 
Kansas City Kings to a division title. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine must be my number," he said. "But don't plan on me winning it in '99. I 
have no more comebacks planned." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons, who left the front office in May, 1988, to take over the Suns, 
plans to turn the team over to assistant Coach Paul Westphal in 1990-91 and to 
concentrate solely on being Phoenix's director of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Other two-time winners of the award, which was instituted in 1963, were Nelson, 
Bill Fitch and Gene Shue.

Detroit Tigers' right-hander Jack Morris was placed on the 21-day disabled list 
for the first time in his 13-year career today because of an elbow injury. 
</P>
<P>
Morris has an "injury to the support structure of the inner side of the elbow" 
said Dr. David J. Collon, a team physician. 
</P>
<P>
It is unknown when Morris suffered the injury, but the 34-year-old pitcher 
approached the team doctor after being shelled for four home runs in Monday's 
7-3 loss to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Morris opened the season with six straight losses and now is 2-7 with a 4.94 
ERA. He is baseball's winningest pitcher of the 1980s with 158 of his 179 
career wins coming in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers called up right-hander Randy Nosek from their Class AA farm club at 
London, Ontario.

DOCTOR BLAMES JOHNSON FOR FAILING DRUG TEST;

<P>
Ben Johnson was probably to blame for failing his drug test at last year's 
Seoul Olympics by taking steroids in addition to those prescribed for him, his 
doctor testified today. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jamie Astaphan told a government inquiry into the use of drugs in sport 
that he did not believe Johnson was honest with his handlers after he was told 
he had failed a drug test and would be stripped of his 100 meters gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Verifying testimony given by other witnesses earlier in the hearing, Astaphan 
said he repeatedly asked Johnson whether he had taken any banned substances 
other than those given to several Canadian athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Did you take any pink tablets from anyone?' " Astaphan said. 
</P>
<P>
"From the look on Ben's face, I knew he was lying," said Astaphan, who has 
admitted providing anabolic steroids to Johnson since 1984. "He had a sheepish 
look . . . as though he had done something." 
</P>
<P>
The doctor said he asked about pink tablets because that is what stanozolol 
would look like, not from any other suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan told the inquiry that he injected Johnson with the steroid furazabol 
as late as Aug. 28. But he denied that diuretics, a honey and vinegar beverage 
and mechanical treatments ordered afterward were to speed the cleansing of the 
steroid from Johnson's system. 
</P>
<P>
"I know about anabolic steroids and the way to beat any test," Astaphan said. 
"I can do it quite legally." 
</P>
<P>
He said seven prescription drugs available in Canada could have been used to 
mask the steroid if that had been necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan also said he did not believe Johnson's coach, Charlie Francis, when he 
called with the news of a positive test. 
</P>

"I thought Charlie was just up to some high jinks," Astaphan said. "He said he 
wasn't kidding. . . . I told him that's impossible."

Astaphan was staying at the Hilton in Seoul, several rooms away from Johnson's.

Earlier, Astaphan said Johnson and other Canadian track and field stars went on 
a crash program of banned substances to build them up for the Seoul Games.

Astaphan, in his second day of testimony, said Johnson, sprinters Angella 
Issajenko and Desai Williams and hurdler Mark McKoy needed steroids and human 
growth hormone, both banned, to regain their strength after a rigorous summer 
schedule.

THEY TOOK CHALLENGES IN STRIDE

This was a year of challenges for sophomore Kerri Pegues and her track coach at 
St. Bernard High, and, judging from latest results, both have adjusted 
spectacularly. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's CIF 2-A Southern Section finals, Pegues took first place in the 
200 meters in 24.98 and 400- and 1,600-meter relays. 
</P>
<P>
And for Barbara Ferrell Edmonson her girls finished second in team scoring in 
her first year of high school coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Pegues finished fourth in the 100 in a wind-aided 12.37 and was 
fourth in the 200 in 25.52 but eagerly sough out her new coach's opinion on 
which were the best events for her to run this year. Pegues knew Edmonson 
understood track. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonson, as Barbara Ferrell, was a silver medalist at 100 meters in the 1968 
Mexico City Olympics and co-world record holder at the distance and twice set 
American records in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
And when it was suggested that Pegues move up to the longer sprint, she 
grudgingly agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was ever going to run the quarter because I didn't feel it 
was my race," said Pegues, who is 5-1 3/4 and 102 pounds. "I thought it was too 
long for me. It is a hard race to run. 
</P>
<P>
"I think anybody who is a sprinter should run a quarter," Edmonson said. "I 
convinced her. Usually if you get one kid that goes out well, it's kind of easy 
to bring the others into it. They just hate to work for it." 
</P>
<P>
The sprinters now train with over-distance workouts from 300 to 600 meters, and 
it has paid rich dividends. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the workouts we've been having that helped us in the mile relay," said 
sophomore Lisa Moxley, who leads off both relays. "We worked on doing the 600s, 
so we'd have more energy at the end when we raced a 400. Coach says you get 
what you put in your workouts." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonson was impressed with the attitude of the girls. "They're very coachable 
kids, which makes it easier for the coach who wants to spend a little more 
time. You don't have to fight for workouts." 
</P>
<P>
She has managed this with a demanding schedule of her own, which will soon 
include training her daughters, Malika, 10, and Miya, 6, who both may have 
potential based on their parents' abilities. Father Warren Edmonson, a Los 
Angeles police officer, was an NCAA champion at 100 meters for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
After completing a coaching stint at West Los Angeles College, Barbara Edmonson 
was encouraged by a friend to come out of retirement and later agreed to take 
on the position at St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hired in February on the 20th and the first meet was on the 27th, and I 
almost had a heart attack," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Another surprise was the unusual dimensions of the track at the Playa del Rey 
campus. It is a 353-yard configuration, about 4 7/8 laps per mile. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never worked with anything but a 400-meter track before," Edmonson said. 
"It took quite a bit of adjustment to get workouts together." 
</P>
<P>
She has also managed the adjustment from athlete to coach. 
</P>
<P>
"As a competitor I never worried about anything because I had a coach whose 
responsibility was to worry about what you're going to do. I just got out and 
did what I had to do. As a coach, I don't feel the pressure there because it's 
for the kids. You're so wrapped up in what the kids are doing, and what event 
is next, that you don't even think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Her background and her openness in sharing her experience have made a 
difference with the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It really helped us a lot because she's been on the other side of it, being an 
athlete," Moxley said. "So she knows how we feel during workouts." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonson brings a steadying influence to the girls at St. Bernard, according to 
Tony Veney, who coached at the school until 1982 and is now an assistant coach 
at Cal State Northridge. "She's a good one to have just from the standpoint of 
the experience she brings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When she would tell us about the good things that have happened to her, it 
makes those who are serious about track want to go further at the state 
qualifying Masters Meet. Friday at Cerritos College Pegues will run in her two 
individual races and the 400 relay with Moxley, junior Kim Williams and junior 
Nikki Davis, and in the 1,600 relay with Moxley, Davis and senior Bonnie Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"If they stay healthy and keep their heads together, they may go all the way to 
the finals," Edmonson said." And after getting a little experience under the 
belt, they'll be even better next year."
