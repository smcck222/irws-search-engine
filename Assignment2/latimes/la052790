Noteworthy films, with mini-reviews by Times critics. 
</P>
<P>
Tequila Sunrise (Cinemax Monday at 8 p.m.): Writer-director Robert Towne draws 
upon his wry Chandleresque view of Los Angeles, as he did in his script for 
"Chinatown," to define a keenly observed contemporary tale of timeless moral 
ambiguity, involving a disturbingly complex and equivocal drug dealer (Mel 
Gibson), his high school pal, now a cop (Kurt Russell) and a beautiful 
restaurateur (Michelle Pfeiffer). 
</P>
<P>
The Offence (A&amp;E Friday at 6 p.m., again at 10 p.m.): A splendid, unjustly 
neglected 1973 British film in which Sean Connery, at his very best under 
Sidney Lumet's direction, plays a veteran police sergeant, haunted by years of 
contact with terrible crimes, who's on the brink of a total breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Disney Friday at 7 p.m., again at 2:30 a.m., TMC at 11 
p.m.; TMC Saturday at 12:30 p.m., again at 9 p.m.): Dense, satisfying, 
feverishly inventive and a technical marvel, this 1988 live-action/animation 
blockbuster hit is a sort of inked-in film noir with outrageous sight gags. Bob 
Hoskins stars as a seedy gumshoe, and the film's mystery plot involves a last, 
great roundup of cartoon stars. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, with Oscar winner 
Richard Williams serving as director of animation. 
</P>
<P>
When the Legends Die (Channel 9 Saturday at 11 a.m.): This splendid 1972 film 
provided Frederic Forrest with his first major role and Richard Widmark with 
one of the finest roles of his career. Forrest plays a Ute Indian rodeo bronco 
rider exploited by Widmark's colorful aging cowboy despite their father-and-son 
relationship. A complex work, directed with simplicity by Stuart Miller from 
Robert Dozier's fine adaptation of a Hal Borland novel. 
</P>
<P>
Rustlers' Rhapsody (Channel 13 Saturday at 1 p.m.): Hugh Wilson's 1985 comedy 
is a sadly overlooked joy, a sweet, affectionate spoof of old low-budget 
Republic and Columbia Westerns. Tom Berenger is perfectly cast as Rex 
O'Herlihan, the Singing Cowboy, who with his Wonder Horse Wildfire, made 52 
Westerns "before the lights sort of went out." Kevin Thomas

The Wages of Fear (TNT Sunday at 7 p.m.): One of the most suspenseful movies 
ever made, this 1952 H.G. Clouzot classic involves four men hauling 
nitroglycerin on primitive South American highways. Yves Montand and Charles 
Vanel star. (2:20) 
</P>
<P>
Deadline U.S.A. (Cinemax Wednesday at 11:30 a.m.): Richard Brooks' prophetic 
1952 film is one of the best movies ever made about the newspaper business. 
Humphrey Bogart is the editor and Ethel Barrymore the publisher of a crusading 
metropolitan paper struggling to survive in the new era of TV. (1:30) 
</P>
<P>
Rasputin (Bravo Thursday at 6:30 p.m.): Distinguished Russian director Elem 
Klimov's 1976 film is as mesmerizing as its subject, rich in the kind of 
atmosphere and detail necessary in bringing alive its bizarre yet riveting saga 
of the self-proclaimed holy man whose hold on the Russian royal family helped 
bring about the revolution. Alexei Petrenko's Rasputin is so convincing as to 
be downright scary. (2:00)

COVER STORY: THEY SAID IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN: CNN TURNS 10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before there were controversial reenactments of news stories, before there were 
stand-up prime-time news shows and long before comedians moonlighted as weather 
reporters and home video clips became commonplace on national newscasts, 
somebody came up with a really bizarre idea for TV news. 
</P>
<P>
A nonstop newscast. Seven days a week, 24 hours a day. To be broadcast around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
When media magnate Ted Turner announced his ambitious Cable News Network 10 
years ago, he was roundly laughed at. Not surprising, considering the 
announcement came from a man whose TBS "superstation" in Atlanta used to 
fulfill its federal broadcasting requirements with a pie-throwing anchorman who 
once invited a German shepherd to co-anchor his newscast. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the pending cable TV explosion had barely started to crackle. 
Still, Turner forged ahead, his sights set on unsettling the Big Three 
networks, which he compared to dinosaurs. "You know why they're not here 
anymore?" he said in 1980. "Because the mammals ate their eggs. I'm a mammal." 
</P>
<P>
CNN's beginnings were less than auspicious. During the Republican National 
Convention in Detroit a decade ago, CNN's slipshod broadcasting booth was 
located in the rafters above the band, so that every time the band played 
"You're a Grand Old Flag," anchor Bernard Shaw was drowned out. 
</P>
<P>
In time, however, Turner would sue the Reagan Administration and the three 
networks for CNN to be included in the White House press pool. The network's 
paltry audience of 1.7 million U.S. households would swell to more than 50 
million. Its broadcasts would reach -- indeed span -- the globe to about 90 
countries. And CNN's continuous live coverage of breaking news events would 
become a reliable trademark that no broadcast station could match. 
</P>
<P>
The Times asked some CNN veterans to briefly reminisce about their early 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner, president, CNN: "I came up with the idea for CNN back in 1975, when 
TBS first went up on satellite. Home Box Office was already in existence. Since 
they had the new movies and we had the old movies and non-network sports on 
TBS, I thought the next channel that would be convenient would be an all-news 
channel. That's where I got the idea. Even though I did not have the money and 
did not know anything much about the news business, I just figured the concept 
was good enough to go ahead and give it a shot. 
</P>
<P>
"The networks pooh-poohed us a little bit at first. But I really cannot say 
that I minded in retrospect." 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Shaw, Washington anchor: "In 1980, I was dissatisfied with the new 
contract I was being offered at ABC as senior Capitol Hill correspondent. I was 
tired of the network pool I had been swimming in. (ABC News president) Roone 
Arledge spent an hour in his office warning me it would be very bad for my 
career to go do something called CNN. When I left, most people weren't even 
trying to conceal their derision, their snickers. My attitude when I walked 
into CNN was the same attitude I had at Marine Corps boot camp the first day. 
'I'm here. Let's get on with it.' 
</P>
<P>
"The moment I knew we were really onto something was when we carried Reagan's 
speech before a labor group at the Washington Hilton Hotel. During a break, we 
were monitoring the Secret Service radios. Suddenly someone said, 'They're 
shooting at the President.' We turned up the audio and you could hear agents 
running, screaming and cursing. I said, 'Let's get on the air,' and we didn't 
get off until 10 hours later. We stayed with the story, no commercials. Our 
coverage of the assassination attempt convinced me that we were onto something. 
I wasn't making as much money as Dan (Rather), Peter (Jennings) or Tom (Brokaw) 
-- I still don't -- but I knew I was in the right place." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Alice Williams, anchorwoman, NBC's "Sunday Today" (Williams left for NBC 
last year after nine years as a CNN anchorwoman): "In the industry, CNN was a 
quiet revolution. But the fact is there was nothing quiet about it. On June 1, 
1980, we went on the air at 6 p.m., Eastern time. Our lead story was live. 
Vernon Jordan had been shot, and we showed President Carter walking out of the 
hospital where Jordan was staying. At 6:30 p.m., Eastern time, the broadcast 
networks went on with their evening newscasts, and their lead story was Carter 
walking out of the hospital, and the footage said 'Courtesy of CNN' in the 
corner. That was our first night on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It never occurred to us that we couldn't make this thing happen. In January of 
1981, when we welcomed the hostages back at West Point, we set up cameras all 
along the bus route where they were arriving. But we didn't have a switcher to 
cut between cameras. I was standing on top of this building in the freezing 
cold with an engineer, and the buses were coming. I said, 'How do we do this? 
We have to switch between cameras!' He said, 'No problem,' and he pulled some 
wires out of this box and touched them together, and the pictures switched. 
Nobody told me or him that it wouldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"That was our mentality. The networks had a giant generator truck, and we were 
manipulating wires by hand. We had one small minicam van, and we had to use a 
topographical map and drive to the highest point of land in the area just so we 
could get our broadcast out. I knew then that our can-do attitude could 
overcome anything." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Kenyon, senior entertainment correspondent: "When I first walked into the 
Washington bureau, it was like going backstage at a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland 
MGM musical. They were still building the bureau about three weeks before air 
time. George Watson, a giant in journalism, was testing a microphone. Producers 
were literally hammering the sign of the bureau into place. And Daniel Schorr 
was walking around saying, 'This is just what CBS was like after World War II.' 
As a young journalist, I felt like this big ship was leaving, and I knew I had 
to be on it or get left behind."

What a wonderful surprise "Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again" was. 
Christopher Rich as Archie was an absolute delight -- the perfect incarnation 
of red-haired, freckle-faced ingenuousness. 
</P>
<P>
As a fan of Archie comics for over 20 years, I found the entire production 
impeccably cast and well-written, faithfully capturing all the charm and humor 
of the comic books.

Why has Fox moved "Booker," one of its best shows, to the 10 p.m. time slot on 
Sundays? Doesn't it realize most of the show's fans have to get up and go to 
school Monday mornings? Fox, please ax "The Outsiders" and move "Booker" back 
to 7 p.m. "The Outsiders" is a lame excuse for a TV show anyway.

Fangoria magazine has been sinking its teeth into horror films for 11 years -- 
with reviews, interviews and behind-the-scenes coverage. So "it seems only 
natural," says publisher Norman Jacobs, for the magazine to try some 
moviemaking of its own: 
</P>
<P>
* "Mindwarp," the first title in Fangoria Films' three-pic deal with 
RCA/Columbia ictures Home Video, is in post-production, due at Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Starring Bruce Campbell and Angus Scrimm, the post-apocalyptic pic was filmed 
for under $1 million by longtime Roger Corman associate Steve Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
* "Children of the Night," about vampires, starring Ami Dolenz, Karen Black and 
Peter DeLuise, directed by Tony Randel ("Hellbound: Hellraiser II"), begins 
shooting June 11. 
</P>
<P>
* "Army," about a genetic formula that replicates body parts, resulting in an 
"army" of menacing arms, is set to film in August with Damon Santostefano 
making his directorial debut. Casting's not set. 
</P>
<P>
Co-executive producer Steve Jacobs -- son of the publisher -- says there are 
also plans for a fourth film to begin shooting in October. Actor Jackie Earle 
Haley ("Breaking Away") will write/direct "The Restless Dead." 
</P>
<P>
All Fangoria films will feature plenty of special effects, traditionally 
covered with relish by the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fangoria is preparing to shoot a pilot for a horror/sci-fi/fantasy 
trivia game show set in a dungeon. Title: "Gore Zone." Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: 'KNEE' SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John M. Wilson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noted author Michael Herr ("Dispatches," the just-out "Walter Winchell") has 
signed on to rewrite "Wounded Knee," which producer Christopher Mankiewicz at 
one time hoped to have in theaters by Dec. 29. That's the 100th anniversary of 
the infamous confrontation between the 7th U.S. Cavalry and Sioux at Wounded 
Knee Creek on South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation, which left 153 Indians 
dead, many of them women and children. 
</P>
<P>
But the WGA strike and other circumstances intervened, and Mankiewicz tells us 
he'll now be happy to be in production by that date. 
</P>
<P>
Tab Murphy (who co-wrote "Gorillas in the Mist") wrote the first script, 
telling dual stories: the 1973 occupation of the historic battlefield by 
American Indian Movement militants, who were under siege by government troops 
for 71 days; and a risky airlift of supplies to the stranded activists by a 
bunch of "average white guys" from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Mankiewicz calls Murphy's draft "a first-rate action adventure script" that 
needs a more serious, socially conscious tone -- Herr's task. "We're trying to 
use the overall structure of Murphy's script but emphasize the Indians' story . 
. . re-balancing to the Indian point of view. It's a drama of a culture trying 
to survive and maintain its identity, a struggle that continues today." 
</P>
<P>
The Warner Bros. feature, one of a number of films in development focusing on 
American Indian culture, is not related to author Dee Brown's "Bury My Heart at 
Wounded Knee," a project that Marlon Brando and others have tried 
unsuccessfully to turn into a film over the years. John M. Wilson

OUTTAKES: IN SEARCH OF . . . DIANE MCBAIN

"I was born under a lucky star," actress Diane McBain once told an interviewer. 
The Glendale High School beauty queen was signed to a Warner Bros. contract at 
18 and immediately starred in a series of colorful melodramas, including "Ice 
Palace" (1960), "Parrish" (1961) and "Claudelle English" (1962). 
</P>
<P>
She played Daphne Dutton, a wacky, yacht-bound socialite, on the 1960-62 TV 
series "Surfside Six." 
</P>
<P>
But suddenly, in the mid-60s, her lucky star dimmed. "Pretty people were low on 
the totem pole," McBain recalls. McBain's option was not renewed by Warners, 
and she stumbled unhappily through mediocre exploitation pictures such as "The 
Mini-Skirt Mob" (1966), right through the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, as McBain was making a comeback on the daytime soap, "Days of Our 
Lives," she was brutally raped by two men outside her West Hollywood apartment. 
They were never caught. 
</P>
<P>
"The shock of what happened caused loss of memory, inability to concentrate, 
and I'm still startled out of proportion," she says. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the attack, McBain made a significant change in her 
priorities. For the last five years, she's worked as a counselor for rape 
victims and battered women. Currently, she works with Project Angel Food, 
bringing meals to housebound outpatients. 
</P>
<P>
Divorced and with a son, now 17, McBain has also taken screenwriting courses at 
UCLA Extension. She's now trying to put together financing on her screenplay, 
"The Spilling Moon," celebrating the first woman to trek along the Colorado 
River through the Grand Canyon. Gerald Peary

OUTTAKES: ROLL OF THE DICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Patrick Goldstein

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MTV may have "banned" Andrew Dice Clay for life -- for sprinkling his live MTV 
Video Music Awards performance last September with a string of obscenities -- 
but the video channel is willing to run paid advertising for "Adventures of 
Ford Fairlane," the Dice-starring vehicle due out July 13 from 20th Century 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Contradictory? 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't doing anything with 'Fairlane' that features Andrew Dice Clay in our 
programming," says an MTV spokeswoman, insisting that the ban is still in 
effect. "And we won't be running any contests or promotions involving the 
film." She adds that MTV has been airing a video of Billy Idol's "Fairlane" 
sound-track hit "Cradle of Love," but "we made it clear to Fox that in order 
for us to play the clip it could not have footage of Clay in it." 
</P>
<P>
Why is MTV willing to run "Fairlane" trailers that prominently feature Clay? 
</P>
<P>
"We had internal discussions over 'Fairlane' advertising," says the MTV 
spokeswoman. "But we value our relationship with Fox and decided to keep our 
decisions about advertising separate from decisions about programming." 
</P>
<P>
Fox marketing president Bob Harper calls the two-edged policy "stubborn and 
hypocritical." 
</P>
<P>
"If Dice is banned," asks Harper, "then why make an exception if we're willing 
to buy airtime to promote him? We will advertise the movie, but we give less 
credence to the importance of MTV advertising these days. We just don't think 
they deliver the audience or set the trends like they used to." Patrick 
Goldstein

*** 1/2 JAMES NEWTON "IF LOVE" JAZZLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long regarded as the young master of jazz flute, James Newton went through a 
period where an overly formal compositional sense reined in his playing and 
left the music on the dry side. Not on "In Love," where Newton gets back to 
quartet basics and cuts loose with the exemplary rhythm section of bassist 
Anthony Cox, drummer Billy Hart and pianist Mike Cain. 
</P>
<P>
Newton meshes sterling technique with free-flowing imagination on a 
wide-ranging program which includes the frenzied tribute, "Mr. Dolphy," and 
"Oblong," a variant on Monk's "Well You Needn't." It would have been nice if 
there had been a front line foil to complement Newton's airy tone with some 
mid-range muscle but "If Love" is still a solid return to form. DON SNOWDEN

Recorded live in the Bay Area a year ago, this quintet session harks back to 
the halcyon days of the 1940s Central Avenue scene, when jazz could be heard in 
countless clubs almost 'round the clock. Trumpeter Farmer and altoist Morgan 
were bandstand-mates then and they both still embrace the be-bop style: Farmer 
is a little more true and precise in his improvisations, whereas Morgan likes 
to let his lines squiggle chaotically on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
While the tunes are solid (e.g., Miles Davis' "Donna Lee," Gene de Paul-Don 
Raye's "Star Eyes," Farmer's "Farmer's Market," Sonny Clark's "Blue Minor" and 
"Cool Struttin' "), the group doesn't achieve a 'band' feel and the versions 
never jell into a groove. Farmer's ballad style on "Embraceable You" is ever 
eloquent and Levy gets his moments as the Bud Powell-based pianist he's long 
been. ZAN STEWART

Like his new cohorts Public Enemy, Ice Cube is fueled by persecution. The 
rapper's first solo album since leaving N.W.A opens with the sounds of his 
execution, and he goes on to cast himself as "The (racial epithet) Ya Love to 
Hate." 
</P>
<P>
Charged by the chase, Cube raps with tireless urgency in a thick, one-note, 
scowling tone. He covers the same grim ghetto territory he did with N.W.A, 
putting you in the front seat for a drive-by, taking you on a visit to a crazy 
crack house. If this harsh world isn't enough to explain his rage, he exposes a 
string of anti-black slurs as a storm-warning against conciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Cube's a no-nonsense guy, with no time for Arsenio or fancy-dancing rappers or 
smooth R&amp;B deejays. Nor for women -- and that's where he loses a lot of 
credibility. At least he doesn't sugarcoat his contempt for those whom he 
reduces to "bitches" and "hos," and he does let rapper Yo Yo voice the woman's 
view. But when a woman tells Ice that she's pregnant with his child, his 
response -- to contemplate a kick in the tummy -- is cold and vile, even if she 
is the neighborhood hussy out to hook him. 
</P>
<P>
It would be nice if his misogyny were an intended illustration of how 
oppression begets oppression, but that might be giving Ice Cube the benefit of 
the doubt. Does he really believe that he doesn't encourage the attitudes he 
depicts? The argument that he's simply reflecting the reality of a particular 
culture is disingenuous -- Andrew Dice Clay could say the same thing. Ice 
Cube's cruelty might be more explainable, but that won't make the victims feel 
any better. RICHARD CROMELIN

Straight outta N.W.A, Ice Cube continues in his first solo album to express the 
ugliness and rage that he exhibited last year in such raps as "Gangsta, 
Gangsta." But the young rapper also injects slight traces of new qualities: 
responsibility and conscience. 
</P>
<P>
In "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted," Ice Cube takes us on a much more ambitious tour 
of the projects than he and N.W.A led us on in "Straight Outta Compton." There 
is such an overpowering sense of frustration at the crime, drugs, poverty and 
injustice that he sometimes seems shouting all directions at once -- not sure 
whether the real enemy is within or without. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the brutal images and insensitive language, there is much that's 
redeeming to consider. When he leads a robbery spree in a white suburb, Ice 
Cube's not advocating such action. He's commenting on what he sees as different 
police attitudes toward black-on-white and black-on-black crime: 
</P>
<P>
"I think back when I was robbin' my own kind 
</P>
<P>
 The police didn't pay me no mind." 
</P>
<P>
The most ground-breaking track, however, is "It's a Man's World," where he is 
joined by a female rapper, Yo Yo, who challenges some of Ice Cube's views about 
women. 
</P>
<P>
There is much on the album that is disturbing, yet there is also the 
encouraging feel of an artist struggling to understand himself and his 
community. In the end, there is even a glimmer of hope -- distant and faint, 
but alive. ROBERT HILBURN

RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 WORLD PARTY "GOODBYE JUMBO" ENSIGN/CHRYSALIS: ALBUMS ARE

Karl Wallinger is no Lenny-come-lately, hippie wanna-be. Chairman of World 
Party as well as its sole member, Wallinger has it all over the Kravitzes of 
the world when it comes to being a flower child by nature. 
</P>
<P>
If originality is not one of the pantheist protest singer's major virtues, his 
Lennonisms sound somehow endemic, not affected. And if he blatantly posits 
himself somewhere between the Age of Aquarius and the New Age, there's a 
healthy cynicism to his naivete. Or is it vice versa? 
</P>
<P>
It's not just the Beatles that inspire the beat here. The slide guitar of "When 
the Rainbow Comes" suggests Derek &amp; the Dominoes; the ecumenical "God on My 
Side" borrows its title from Dylan but its vocal style from Jeff Lynne. 
Elsewhere it's Prince, slinky Memphis soul, echoes of Badfinger and Donovan. 
</P>
<P>
It's no petty theft, either. "Jumbo" comes together marvelously. You might wish 
Wallinger would let his guard down and admit you into his inner sanctum more 
often. But his nature-loving, celebratory side -- in "Thank You World," the 
grass is his blanket "and the sun is my alarm" -- is compelling enough to make 
you want to organize a Post-Modern love-in. CHRIS WILLMAN

CHAYA HITS THE BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
IT STARTED IN LOS FELIZ AND THEN SPREAD TO WEST HOLLYWOOD. NEXT, IT APPEARED ON 
THE SUNSET STRIP. NOW IT'S FINALLY MADE IT TO THE OCEAN'S EDGE AND CHAYA VENICE 
IS EVERYTHING YOU HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM THE CHAYAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a great spangled beast taking glacially slow steps, Chaya moves to the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
Or at least that's how it seems. Ten years ago La Petite Chaya, the pioneering 
Franco-Japanese restaurant, opened in Los Feliz to great acclaim. A couple of 
years later, a second footprint of the Chaya Beast appeared in West Hollywood 
up the street from the Beverly Center -- Chaya Brasserie, where Japanese 
parasols hung whimsically from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Less formal and with a more eclectic menu, Chaya Brasserie targeted the 
emerging L.A. taste with uncanny accuracy. Then a couple of years later, as if 
the Chaya Beast were moving its hind foot westward, the original place on 
Hillhurst closed down and the Chaya Diner appeared on the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Now the latest step has appeared: Chaya Venice. It's definitely in the 
tradition, a little like a cross between La Petite Chaya (relatively sober 
decor) and Chaya Brasserie (if anything, an even more eclectic menu). 
</P>
<P>
Great stuff. The crowd swigs its mineral water and roars. 
</P>
<P>
It's certainly the handsomest Chaya yet, managing to be both impressive and 
comforting. The door and the bar are the impressive part, dominated by a huge, 
arresting metal panel, partly corroded blue-green and leaning at an imperious 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the warehouse-sized room is warmer. From the ceiling hangs an odd 
frame of blond wood that suggests a vault curving cozily over the diners, but 
the real ceiling is flat, painted with flowering branches and perching birds. 
From it hang lamps that split the difference between Art Deco and Oriental, 
alternating with little snake's-head spotlights that recall the cute robot in 
the movie "Short Circuit." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether it's a very pleasant place, with about a medium sonic level; you can 
hear yourself think most of the time. Maybe that's because, fashionable and 
crowded though Chaya Venice is, people don't seem to be there merely because 
it's the latest place to be. The room has a buzz of food-lust. People openly 
crane their necks to stare at the plates being brought to the next table. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the plates are worth looking at in themselves, always lyrical and 
colorful in the Chaya manner. Take the seaweed salad. Seaweed is there -- 
chewy, gray-green, paper-thin sheets with a licorice-like flavor contrasting 
with the pickled ginger vinaigrette -- but buried under a mountain of at least 
six salad greens, including peppery radish sprouts. It's a chaste, vegetarian 
picture of wild abandon. 
</P>
<P>
There are also the usual Chaya-type marvels of food technology. How in theworld 
do they make the tuna spring roll? Inside the flimsiest imaginable layer of 
filo-like pastry is an oblong chunk of tuna, surrounded by a forcemeat that 
tastes like a mixture of ground shrimp and calamari. Here's the trick: somehow 
the forcemeat is cooked, while the tuna is raw. It's like a sort of fishy baked 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
There's a mild mania for stuffing things on the appetizer menu. Jalapeno 
peppers are stuffed with shrimp, like tiny, sneaky-hot chiles rellenos. 
Scallops are hollowed out, filled with ground shrimp and then cooked in a sort 
of armor plating of sliced almonds; a bit fussy, that one. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizers begin to prepare you for the cross-cultural tendencies of the 
entrees. In the middle of a delicious curried crab soup, slightly sweet and 
mapley, stands a thick slice of crab-stuffed cabbage roll topped with a tiny, 
strictly ornamental crab the size of your thumb. What would you call it: 
Indian, French, Hungarian? 
</P>
<P>
The best of the entrees is at least partly Frenchified, the Moroccan lamb 
chops. These are particularly meaty rib chops in a thin tomato and sweet pepper 
sauce dashed with mint -- a bit too dainty for real Moroccan food. On the side 
comes a ratatouille featuring rather a lot of tomato sauce, and unless these 
taste buds fail me, some sweet fennel bulb. Instead of rice, though, there's a 
bit of couscous. 
</P>
<P>
There's a huge rib-eye steak on the menu too, served with grilled vegetables 
and quaint little balls of mashed potato encased in almond slices. Basically, 
though, this is more of a fish than a meat menu. Halibut in soothing spinach 
and chive sauce. Swordfish with sweet peppers. 
</P>
<P>
And lots of Oriental stuff, pure and cosmopolitanized, particularly on the 
specials menu. Pure is, for instance, lobster with to-bang jan sauce, a thin 
peppery tomato sauce made in an exceptionally clean and classical manner. 
Cosmopolitanized might be seabass in Chinese scallop and onion confit; the fish 
is topped with a sweet, aromatic hash of scallops and wilted onions and 
surrounded by a thin chive-sprinkled cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The specials are also where to look for unusual, meaty flavors. Salmon might be 
available in a Chinese brown sauce flavored with capers and thin, chewy slices 
of giant clam. Duck with walnut oil and confit comes in a meaty sauce with 
slices of fried potato, and on the side, resting on top of some thin, baby 
asparagus, a square of mashed potato mixed with fried duck confit. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest cross-cultural extravaganza on the menu is tuna nicoise. It's made 
with smoked tuna, raw inside and barely charred on the outside, dressed with 
whole-seed mustard and tarragon vinaigrette. But instead of being laid on a bed 
of European vegetables, it rests next to lettuces, peppers, radish sprouts and 
a mysterious pink paste that turns out to be an exotic variation on the Greek 
dip taramosalata, made with mashed potato and flying fish eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything is so inspired. Rather thick veal scallops marinated in pesto 
are tasty grilled, but hardly a breakthrough. Chaya Venice's version of penne 
arrabbiata, tarted up with Montrachet cheese, is actually sort of a flop; the 
French cheese is nice in itself but has nothing to do with the dish, and the 
tomato sauce is, shockingly, not peppery in the slightest. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing I've positively disliked here, though, was a special appetizer 
of mussels in "spicy tomato sauce." The fresh but un-spicy tomato sauce could 
not save these lukewarm mussels. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are desserts. They're perfectly good, really, but not quite the 
center of attention here. The best of them is the somewhat dangerous Chaya 
square: layers 
</P>
<P>
of cake alternating with layers of chocolate, cream and hazelnut. The chocolate 
mousse cake is imposingly dense, like the soft center of a candy with a bit of 
mocha flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The apple tart is unassuming, a single layer of thin-sliced apples with a bit 
of apricot glaze. One cake is a sort of Black Forest with a particularly clean 
flavor, and there's an extremely rich praline cake with a sprinkling of crunchy 
praline on top. But the almost flourless chocolate cake is extremely dry, more 
like a fallen souffle than a cake. The pecan pie is unusual only in having two 
crusts. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I hail the great Chaya Beast, and pray the next step doesn't mean we'll 
have to swim to Catalina.

NOTEBOOK: AFTER MANY MOONS, JACOUPY IS READY TO OPEN LUNARIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As restaurants sometimes remind us, with signs on the wall or notes on their 
menus, good food takes time to prepare. Restaurants themselves take even more 
time, though -- as Bernard Jacoupy will gladly tell you. 
</P>
<P>
He is finally about to open a restaurant he has been working on for at least 
four years -- a place he calls Lunaria, on Santa Monica Boulevard near Beverly 
Glen Boulevard in West Los Angeles. According to Jacoupy -- who was co-founder 
of the acclaimed Bernard's in the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel downtown, and who, 
for the past four years, has been general manager of Le Meridien Hotel in 
Newport Beach -- it took fully 2 1./2 years just to get the necessary permits 
for the place, because of local parking requirements and various neighborhood 
concerns. Now he expects to open sometime between Wednesday and June 4. "We're 
not quite there," he says, "but we're almost there." 
</P>
<P>
Chef at the new establishment will be Dominique Chavanon, former chef de 
cuisine at Le Meridien's Antoine Restaurant. In a way, though, the real star of 
the place -- and certainly one of the principal inspirations -- figures to be 
Jacoupy's late grandfather, Andre Montpellier, who was an accomplished amateur 
painter and a friend of such noted French Catalan artists as Aristide Maillol. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a unique collection of about 130 paintings of his," says Jacoupy, "all 
done between 1890 and 1940, almost all of them of the back country behind 
Perpignan. These will be featured at the restaurant, along with works by 
several other artists who are rather more contemporary. The menu, too, will be 
very much impressed by the area of Perpignan, and the French Mediterranean in 
general." 
</P>
<P>
Even the name of the restaurant, he adds, is a tribute to his grandfather. 
"Lunaria annua, or 'money plant' was his favorite plant," Jacoupy explains. 
"Everybody thinks it has something to do with the moon, but it's really a 
botanical name -- which is, fortunately, easy to remember and to pronounce. In 
one way, of course, Lunaria does have to do with the moon -- since you have to 
be a lunatic to open a restaurant in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
JAY STAYS: Last year, Jay Fiondello, proprietor of the veteran Santa Monica 
restaurant Chez Jay, announced that he was being forced to close his 
establishment after all these years and move to new premises because his 
landlord, the RAND Corp., needed the space for expansion. Chez Jay, however, is 
still in business on the site. What gives? 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to move down Main Street, onto a piece of property that I had 
bought myself 20 years ago," says Fiondello, "but I got shot down by the 
locals. There's an ordinance that prohibits any new restaurants on Main Street 
right now. I fought it, and finally got permission to put my own restaurant on 
my own property -- and then I got shot down on the liquor license. So that 
deal's off. Luckily, Rand has extended my lease at least till the end of the 
year, so it'll be business as usual in the old place until then." 
</P>
<P>
FUTURE SCHLOCK: A chilling view of the culinary future: According to a press 
release from the Long Beach Area Convention and Visitors Council, Floreale, at 
the community's Ramada Renaissance Hotel, is about to debut a new dinner menu 
"to keep a step ahead of changing culinary trends." Among the dishes to be 
included -- for all you culinary trend-spotters out there -- are sole topped 
with toasted almonds and fresh bananas, filet mignon with a Benedictine 
rosemary mousseline, and Brie rolled in almonds and served with garlic toast 
and pecan blackberry chutney. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S COOKING: The original Uncle Tai's Mandarin Gourmet in Studio City has 
spawned an offspring of the same name in Encino. . . . Louis (Bif) Caruso, 
proprietor of Caruso and Me in San Pedro, has taken over the Melrose Avenue 
site near La Cienega that formerly housed (in succession) an All-American 
Burger, Bono's, Silvio's and (briefly) Ashley's -- and plans to open a second 
place, called simply Caruso's, there. The San Pedro restaurant will remain open 
as usual. . . . Muldoon's Irish Pub in Newport Beach celebrates its 15th 
anniversary this month. . . . And Steven Sponder, proprietor of the Palace Cafe 
in Santa Barbara, has just celebrated his establishment's fifth anniversary by 
flying his entire staff to New Orleans for a three-day dining and sightseeing 
binge.

A DELIGHTFUL ADVENTURE FOR WINE PURISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One glance at the wine list at Chaya Venice and I knew it had been carefully 
thought out and would be a joy -- and an adventure -- for wine lovers and 
novices alike. 
</P>
<P>
The large card lists 100 bottles, ranging in style from the simple and elegant 
to the outrageous and powerful, with a flood of exciting offerings in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
The thing I liked best about it, though, is that it is not your standard 
"Chardonnay and Cabernet" listing with a couple of expensive Bordeaux tossed in 
for effect. It is, in fact, the wine purists' delight: stuff you wished you had 
a chance to try once in your life with dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Here you can. 
</P>
<P>
Wondered what a good Marsanne tastes like? Here you can try the 1988 from Qupe 
for $22. Heard about Woodward Canyon Winery of Washington state? The restaurant 
offers the opportunity to try a bottle of their 1988 Chardonnay for $27. 
Interested in tasting a red Rhone wine? There are a dozen as well as a few 
California Rhone-type wines (such as Bonny Doon's Cigare Volant at $22). 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, instead of a listing of wines of similar types, you get to choose 
from Riesling, Muscadet, Sancerre, Chablis, Arneis, Soave, Beaujolais, Chianti, 
Sangiovese, Brunello, Barolo and even a cult Cabernet Sauvignon from France's 
Midi, the acclaimed Mas de Daumas Gassac, at $34. 
</P>
<P>
Some wines seem too pricey, but, then, I tend to think of emperors and new 
clothes when I see wines such as 1985 Baron de L from Ladoucette at $62, or 
1987 Chateau Grillet at $100. I can't imagine anyone spending his or her own 
money on these wines. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, something like Ludovico Antinori's 1986 Ornellaia, a deep 
red wine from Tuscany, is actually a bargain at $48 since the regular retail 
price is about $40. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the wines are from expert wine merchants Martine Saunier and Kermit 
Lynch, whose wines from traditional districts such as Burgundy and the Loire 
are anything but humdrum choices. The 1986 Chateau Trignon Cote du Rhone, 
imported by Lynch, is an excellent wine; at $15 it can't be topped for value. 
</P>
<P>
Other values include the 1986 Hess Cabernet ($23), 1987 Bonny Doon Vin Gris de 
Cigare ($14), 1988 Handley Sauvignon Blanc ($16) and 1988 Beaujolais-Villages 
from George Duboeuf ($16). 
</P>
<P>
Splurgers will like the 1961 Chateau Lynch-Bages (a fair $210), 1970 Chateau 
Mouton-Rothschild from a magnum ($285), the extremely rare 1979 Guigal La 
Mouline ($295) or the superb 1985 Sassicaia ($90). 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Louie, who assembled the fine wine list at Chaya Brasserie, is also 
responsible for this one. A note at the bottom indicates that if a diner would 
like a wine from the Brasserie list (where the wine storage is better), it may 
be ordered with 24-hour notice. This is a nice touch.

<P>
There used to be an added delight in going to the Music Center. It was the 
impromptu, alfresco performances in the plaza -- before and after the shows -- 
by mimes, violinists, jazz trios, brass choirs, etc. 
</P>
<P>
They were of varying quality, of course, but they were always enlivening. 
Sometimes they were more interesting than the performances in the auditoriums. 
</P>
<P>
They have been missing for the past year or so. Why? And who is responsible for 
banishing them? Is it the result of some purists' devotion to the idea of a 
"higher art"? If so, the purists are sadly mistaken. They are making a visit to 
the Music Center as drab and obligatory as visits to any other Temple of the 
Higher Arts. 
</P>
<P>
While they are seeking to improve our lives, why don't these purists devote 
their energies to getting rid of the beggars who now surround and sometimes 
infest the Music Center block, and who have injected into the area a sense of 
danger rather than one of exaltation?

A Music Center spokesman said the policy on free-lance performers has not 
changed. A person must get permission to perform in the plaza at any time, he 
said. The policy is to ask unauthorized performers to leave, but the spokesman 
noted that some have managed to get around the prohibition.

THE MUSICAL INSIGHT OF PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In re People magazine's "de facto ban" on articles about rap music, as reported 
in the May 13 Pop Eye column: 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the lack of interest in rap articles is due in part to the fact that 
90% of rap records have identical machine-generated robot rhythms, identical 
percussive sounds, identical female shrieks, identical topics and identical 
beats-per-minute. 
</P>
<P>
And when it comes to the only genuine (non-synthesized) sound -- the rapper 
himself -- we get the same inflections, the same cadence, the same number of 
words and syllables per line. 
</P>
<P>
In short, this is a very, very tired musical style, so if it's so boring to 
listen to, who wants to read about it?

RESTAURANT ADVISERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colman Andrews' "Just What Is a Restaurant Consultant?" (May 13) addressed only 
the fluff and glamorous aspects of what one consultant (Debbie Slutsky) chooses 
to provide her clients. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, the professional restaurant consultant has a duty to provide a firm 
opinion as to whether the client can execute a long-term restaurant business. 
</P>
<P>
This includes labor-relations issues, human-resource environment or company 
culture issues, sanitation, quality food and service, waste management, 
marketing, total financial and inventory control, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Too many egos are catered to by consultants as featured in this article, and 
they continue to do an injustice to their clients and the professionalism of 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Slutsky states, "People should open restaurants because they love food, have a 
certain sense of style and taste, and have recognized a niche in the 
marketplace they can fill." What about good business sense?

ANIMAL KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is virtually impossible these days to see a European film without animal 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
Saura stabs horses, Bertolucci shoots ducks, crushes cats and stabs pigs, 
Chabrol beheads geese and others cut the throats of sheep and goats. In "Cinema 
Paradiso," a heifer is knifed to death. 
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society says it has no jurisdiction over European and Latin American 
productions, but it should attempt to restrict the viewing of this unfortunate 
suffering by warning animal lovers to stay away. Instead, we give the directors 
Academy Awards.

WHAT'S NEW? NO-TIE TIES, QUIET WAKING 
</P>

<P>
David Cecil offered an irresistible guarantee from his booth at the world's 
largest invention convention. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll never have to tie your tie again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate, Cecil tugged at the knot in his silk tie as if to loosen it. 
Instead of one end of the tie slipping out of the knot, the tie zipped open. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you start wearing one, you'll never go back to tying a tie. It's the 
perfect tie-less tie," said Cecil, who represents Zippertie Enterprises, a 
Pittsburgh company marketing the tie for the inventor, an anonymous 
Midwesterner. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil pulled again on his tie, this time on the short end, and the zipper 
hidden in the knot closed up. 
</P>
<P>
"A perfect double-Windsor knot!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil and hundreds of other promoters and inventors set up shop at the 
Monroeville Expo Mart, near Pittsburgh, for the Invention-New Product 
Exposition. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other items displayed were a portable fire escape that can be 
anchored inside a window, a trap designed to lure fleas off carpet and a device 
to repel mosquitoes with sound waves. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day exhibition also featured the unveiling of a water-powered engine 
designed by Yoshiro Nakamatsu, known as the "Edison of Japan" since he invented 
the floppy disc for computers and the digital wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamatsu said the nonpolluting engine, called Enerex, runs on tap water alone 
and can generate three times the power of a standard gasoline engine. 
</P>
<P>
"It will generate electricity for any purpose," he said. "Petroleum will 
exhaust in 100 years." He said he will modify the engine and build a special 
vehicle to be powered by it. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamatsu also showed some of his other inventions, including "brain food," 
which he said contains "good elements" to encourage clear thinking. The snack 
food, which tastes something like seaweed, is sold in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamatsu, 62, said that listening to Beethoven and swimming have helped him 
maintain the creativity that has led to more than 2,000 patents in the United 
States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"My best place to create inventions is under the water," he said. "So I swim 
every day."

AFTER 29 YEARS, ETHIOPIAN REBELS SEEM ON VERGE OF WINNING CIVIL WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REID G. MILLER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
AFABET, Ethiopia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just south of this neat town built of rock and adobe are towers of sandstone 
boulders hundreds of feet high, where the people take cover during daylight in 
case of bombing raids. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot stay down there during the day," said Mariam Teglest, 32, a 
soldier's widow with three children. "It is much too dangerous when the planes 
fly." 
</P>
<P>
She was speaking of Soviet-built MIG fighter-bombers of the Ethiopian air 
force, which had strafed the town of about 20,000 people twice in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
Afabet is one of a dozen or so major towns in Eritrea, Ethiopia's northernmost 
province, where rebels have fought for independence since 1961. Rebel forces 
captured the town in February, early in their biggest offensive of the war. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict began 29 years ago as a small uprising by scattered guerrilla 
bands and has grown into a toe-to-toe slugging match by armies of thousands of 
soldiers armed with heavy artillery, tanks and other modern weapons. 
</P>
<P>
It is a war the Eritreans appear on the verge of winning, despite the Ethiopian 
military's total dominance of the sky and its vast superiority in manpower. The 
government has a military force of about 320,000 men, largest in black Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The Eritreans do not divulge the size of their army. The International 
Institute for Strategic Studies in London says 30,000, but some recent visitors 
to the region believe the true strength is double that or more. 
</P>
<P>
In three decades, the war has touched almost every part of this barren, 
mountainous province the size of England. 
</P>
<P>
Afabet is tucked into a desert valley that evokes the American Southwest. Here 
and elsewhere, people hide by day and work by night in caves or camouflaged 
stone buildings and under the spreading branches of the ubiquitous African 
thorn tree. 
</P>
<P>
"We've created the world's largest underground economy," said Haile Menkerios, 
a Harvard-educated economist, grinning at his play on words. He is on the 
Central Committee of the rebel Eritrea People's Liberation Front. 
</P>
<P>
"We've learned not to expose ourselves," he said, with a sweep of the arm that 
covered hills dotted with cave mouths and stone huts almost undiscernible from 
a few yards. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty miles north of Afabet is Orota, the main rebel base camp. It sprawls 
through a deep, narrow valley cross-hatched by canyons and surrounded by rugged 
peaks so high that the sun reaches in for only a few hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Enemy planes fly into this maze at great peril. 
</P>
<P>
Orota is a supply and military training base, site of a detention center for 
thousands of prisoners of war, a civilian and an army hospital, schools for 
children of soldiers, manufacturing plants and repair shops for trucks, tanks 
and other military vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The hospitals stretch for 3 miles down the main valley, to reduce the threat 
from bombing. Wards and operating theaters are hidden in tents under thorn 
trees, in caves and in nearly invisible buildings hewn from the same sandstone 
as the surrounding mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Frank Lloyd Wright would be proud of us," said Menkerios, grinning 
again at his reference to the architect who believed buildings should harmonize 
with their natural surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
A pharmaceutical factory, hidden in caves, makes everything from saline 
solutions to malaria pills and sanitary pads for women. 
</P>
<P>
One in four rebel soldiers is a woman, many of them commanders in an army with 
no ranks or sex discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Everything in Orota is powered by electrical generators, most of which are 
cranked up only after sundown, when the vast camp stirs to life. 
</P>
<P>
Primitive, Soviet-made field telephones captured from the Ethiopians connect 
the scattered complex. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly everything is captured, scavenged, donated or handmade by a people used 
to getting by on next to nothing. This province on the Red Sea is one of the 
poorest in one of the world's poorest nations. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is thrown away. Artillery shell casings filled with sand and welded 
together form the supporting pillars of a new school. Disposable hypodermic 
syringes become light switches. Old tractor and truck tires are turned into 
wash troughs. 
</P>
<P>
The Eritreans claim that they do not have the support of foreign governments 
and that all their military hardware, from tanks to Kalashnikov assault rifles, 
has been captured from the Ethiopian army. 
</P>
<P>
Officials and some diplomats in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, say the 
Eritreans have received arms and money from several Arab countries around the 
Red Sea that oppose the Soviet-supplied government of President Mengistu Haile 
Mariam. Eritrea's population is split about 50-50 between Muslims and 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
A few reporters allowed behind rebel lines in recent months saw nothing but old 
and often battered Soviet-made military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in Orota except the crowded hospitals suggests the huge battles being 
waged around Asmara, the Eritrean capital, a 16-hour drive south over rutted 
trails even experienced drivers can lose in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
On a roughly north-south line running nearly 100 miles between Asmara and the 
sea, the rebels are fighting more than a third of Ethiopia's armed forces, 
mostly conscripted and poorly trained young men. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of their February offensive, the rebels surrounded and cut off 
Asmara, including an estimated 1 million civilians and the government's 
120,000-man 2nd Revolutionary Army. 
</P>
<P>
Three times since early April, the 2nd Army pushed eastward in an attempt to 
recapture its nearest outlet to safety, the Red Sea port of Massawa. Each time, 
an Eritrean force no more than half the size stopped it cold. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters who visited Massawa in late April could hear the thunder of artillery 
and tank barrages day and night at the front 40 miles away. The fierce 
exchanges often made windows rattle. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels claim that they killed, wounded or captured 30,000 Ethiopian 
soldiers when they took Massawa in a three-day battle in early February and 
have inflicted similar casualties along the Ghinda front. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists who have seen the remains of Massawa, and have been guided near the 
front by the rebels and talked with deserters from Mengistu's army, believe the 
numbers are not greatly exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the number of dead and wounded on either side, the Ethiopian 2nd 
Army's inability to break out of Asmara illustrates the rebels' military 
prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Mengistu's other forces are occupied far to the south in the 
neighboring provinces of Tigre, Wollo and Gonder with an uprising by the 
smaller Tigre People's Liberation Front. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigreans, known to coordinate military moves with the Eritreans, have spent 
15 years fighting to overthrow Mengistu and establish a new national 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Eritrean fighters and their leaders predict that the long war will end in a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"Come back soon," said Asmellash Abraha, who was detached from other duties to 
play host to three visiting journalists. "I'll show you Asmara. I am anxious to 
see it myself. It's been a long, long time since I was last there."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Mengistu Haile Mariam, who built a Marxist regime on the ashes of a 
feudal empire he helped bring down in 1974, is a man with many problems and, 
some predict, a limited future. 
</P>
<P>
His army has suffered battlefield setbacks in recent months, particularly in 
the northernmost province of Eritrea, where rebels appear on the verge of 
winning a 29-year-old war for independence. 
</P>
<P>
Another insurgent group swept out of its stronghold in Tigre Province, just 
south of Eritrea, 10 months ago and has pressed its fight to overthrow 
Mengistu's government to within 50 miles of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, preoccupied with its own economic and political problems, has 
threatened to close the tap that has poured billions of dollars worth of 
military hardware into Ethiopia since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Mengistu spurned the United States and its Western allies when he achieved 
power 13 years ago, and they are in no hurry to improve relations. 
</P>
<P>
Major elements of Mengistu's own army attempted a coup last year. He said in a 
recent speech that he had survived nine assassination attempts. 
</P>
<P>
With all those problems, and burdened by a collapsing economy that has never 
been robust, Mengistu signaled a change of course two months ago. From now on, 
Ethiopia will favor free-market economics and welcome foreign investment, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Giant posters of Marx and Lenin came down in Addis Ababa, but those showing 
Mengistu in various poses as a revered leader remain. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a deathbed conversion," a Western diplomat in Addis Ababa said, 
on condition of anonymity. "If you believe that Mengistu has had a true change 
of heart, you probably also believe in the Easter bunny." 
</P>
<P>
Mengistu joined other army officers in 1974, when he was a major, in 
overthrowing Emperor Haile Selassie. Three years later, he reigned supreme. 
</P>
<P>
He created the Marxist-Leninist Workers Party of Ethiopia in 1984. In 1987, 
Mengistu established the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, formally 
dropping his military rank of lieutenant colonel to become a civilian 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is ruled by a small group agreeable to Mengistu's every plan, 
according to the memoirs of Dawit Wolde Giorgis, a former member of the party 
Central Committee who defected to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Dawit, major human rights groups and other critics accuse Mengistu of ordering 
or participating in the executions of dozens of rivals and of imprisoning 
thousands. Mengistu has denied the claims.

Volunteers on Friday began rescuing penguins from an oil slick along the 
southeastern coast of Australia that has already killed more than 100 of the 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six of the oil-covered penguins, close to death, were being cared for at 
a special rescue center, said Kris Reinertson, head ranger of the Otway Range 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation was under way to find the ship responsible for the 
six-mile-long oil slick, which has largely broken up in the heavy seas since it 
was first sighted Monday, the Port of Melbourne Authority said.

SHRINKING LAKE CHAD TARGETED FOR RESCUE 
</P>

NDJAMENA, Chad 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seen from an airplane, the only major body of water in the heart of Africa 
could be mistaken for a mirage, a mirror shimmering in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Chad, whose name in the Kanuri language means "great body of water," 
millions of years ago covered 132,000 square miles, or one-quarter of the 
African nation that now bears its name. 
</P>
<P>
But although a subject of much speculation and curiosity on the part of 
European explorers, it failed to appear in detail on maps of the continent 
until the late 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Today, fears are growing that the changing world climate and rampant 
desertification will combine to dry up the lake, leaving behind only a memory 
of its outline in the Sahel region south of the great Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
Several million fishermen and farmers in Chad and other countries depend for 
their livelihood on the lake that has shrunk to about 3,200 square miles. Last 
year Chadians alone pulled 100,000 tons of perch and catfish from the lake for 
smoking and shipping to the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Natron, a mineral extracted from the lake for fertilizer, is sold in gunny 
sacks to merchants in N'Djamena's bustling market for shipment south to Chad's 
best agricultural land. 
</P>
<P>
During the seventh summit of the 26-year-old Lake Chad Basin Commission in 
Yaounde, Cameroon, earlier this year, the presidents of Chad, Cameroon and 
Nigeria urged increased international aid to save the lake and the area that 
depends on it. 
</P>
<P>
Experts at the meeting suggested, however, that the governments of the 
countries bordering the lake have themselves neglected its resources because of 
simmering disagreements over boundaries and a civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Lemoalle, a French government hydrobiologist, spent 1963 to 1977 
studying Lake Chad and returned recently to check reports that the lake was 
fading away. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 1967, the lake has been shrinking progressively. The most remarkable 
decline was at the end of the 1968-72 drought when high spots on the floor 
began sticking out, effectively dividing the lake in two," he said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Chad is fed from the south by the Chari River, which rises in the Central 
African Republic and is then joined by the Logone. 
</P>
<P>
The Chari is gorged with water during the rainy season, usually July to 
October, but then recedes to a sluggish, meandering course that seems to take 
forever to reach the marshy, reed-filled lake. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole basin is a relatively unstable system," Lemoalle said. "This is the 
third time the lake has been this small since the beginning of the century." 
</P>
<P>
The African Development Bank is funding a 5-year, $20-million program to pump 
new life into an earlier Lake Chad project. A first group of experts in 
irrigation and vegetable farming arrived earlier this year to advise on more 
efficient ways of growing millet, sorghum and okra, staples of the region.

NEW GENERATION OF FAMILIES JUGGLE LOVE AND CAREERS UNDER THE BIG TOP

Laurie Reker, with the greatest of ease, fell for Jid Gutty on the flying 
trapeze. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia and Luis Palacio domesticated one another; now, the two lovebirds train 
tigers together. 
</P>
<P>
Circus performers traditionally have kept their acts in the family, handing 
down taming, teetering and tight-wire techniques for many generations. Now, 
"outsiders" -- performers who weren't born into circus dynasties -- are 
juggling love and careers under the Big Top, too. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, such acts include The 
Palacios; The Flying Guttys (He's "circus," she's "outsider"); Tommy and Tammy 
Parish, natives of Neodesha, Kan., who love to clown around together; and 
American-Canadian animal act Lee and Judith Stevens, who consider themselves 
parents of 16: two kids and 14 baboons. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, when a child was born into a circus family, it was taken for granted 
they would continue the act," Judith Stevens said. "Now, you're here because 
you are very good -- not just because you were born here." 
</P>
<P>
"My father worked 43 years at something he couldn't stand," her husband added. 
"We're here because we want to be." 
</P>
<P>
The Stevenses met in Canada in February, 1985, while working at a different 
circus. They married four months later; two years after that, they took the 
baboons on their "honeymoon" -- a working trip to Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just normal people doing unusual jobs," Judith said. "In a lot of ways, 
it can be real hard; we never go home from work." 
</P>
<P>
The Stevenses often travel with their sons, Alexander, 3 1/2, and Sebastian, 2. 
In all, 20 children -- newborn to 14 years old -- tour with this 
community-on-wheels, which employs 150 performers and 200 other workers. 
School-age children study twice a day with Natalie Osbourne, a dancer and 
certified teacher. Younger kids can stay at the traveling day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a special day for a child to go to the zoo or the circus; my kids have 
that every day," Judith said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander sometimes appears in the baboon act. "He loves to do it," his mother 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Stevenses are no stage parents. Judith fantasizes that her sons will 
grow up to be doctors or lawyers: "Isn't that always a mother's dream?" 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Palacio's mother never dreamed that her daughter would work in a cage 
with three tigers, two lions, three leopards, two bears, two hyenas and a wolf. 
Neither, for that matter, did she. 
</P>
<P>
"My father's never seen the circus," said Palacio, who is from Staines, 
England. "When my mother saw me work, she went through two packets of 
cigarettes. I heard her scream." 
</P>
<P>
It all started nine years ago, when the former ballet dancer, then known as 
Marcia Spence, met animal trainer Luis Palacio, a native of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
First, they became a couple; then, they became co-workers. Marcia started 
tending baby animals, learning the ropes from Luis, who had worked for circuses 
since he was 11 years old. In 1988, she stepped into the cage with her husband 
and the big beasts. 
</P>
<P>
"I was terrified," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But she went into it with her eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
On July 18, 1986, during another circus in England, Marcia Palacio had watched 
in horror from outside the cage as a lion bit and slashed Luis. The badly 
mauled trainer finally returned to work in May, 1988, with a jagged scar across 
his jugular. 
</P>
<P>
"Marcia went through the whole thing," Luis said. "She was there when it 
happened and there through the surgery. She nursed me and learned to change the 
tracheotomy and do injections." 
</P>
<P>
After he recovered, Ringling had an opening for a two-person act. Despite the 
job hazard she had witnessed, Marcia wanted to try it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Luis performs with several animals at the front of the cage while Marcia 
controls the remaining animals at the rear. At the finale, Marcia rides a tiger 
around the ring. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to separate the relationship inside the cage and outside," 
said Luis. "Sometimes, when she makes a mistake, I scream at her; that's how I 
was taught. But I'm growing." 
</P>
<P>
The two relax by sightseeing. But even a brave lion-trainer has fears. Asked if 
they saw the Empire State Building while working in New York City, Luis 
shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have to go up," he said. "I don't like going up." 
</P>
<P>
Going up is no problem for Jid and Laurie Gutty. Flying 32 feet above the floor 
is their equivalent of a day at the office. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie had just graduated from high school in Pompano Beach, Fla., nine years 
ago when she saw Jid, a native of Bogota, Colombia, practicing his trapeze act 
at an Orlando campground. At first they were just friends; it was the trapeze 
that made her heart flutter. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell in love with it," she said. "Something told me it was a way for me to 
do something special." 
</P>
<P>
The first time she flew, "I cried. I was very scared of the height. But I knew 
in my heart I could do it somehow," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After years of physical conditioning, Laurie became the only American woman to 
master a triple aerial somersault. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Jid is her husband, as well as her catcher. His face lights up when he 
talks about the circus -- and about his wife's accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"I love what I'm doing," he said. "When an audience responds, when people like 
me, I feel proud. And I'm proud of what she's doing too." 
</P>
<P>
How do they balance the demands of living and working together? 
</P>
<P>
"You have to communicate a lot," he said. "You need to talk to each other all 
the time on the trapeze." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard," said Laurie. "You have to separate your personal life from 
your professional life. And you still have to trust each other: Even though 
you're arguing, you still know he's there to catch you." 
</P>
<P>
The danger is even present for Clown Alley veterans. Tommy Parish ticks off 
accident stories involving stilts and a runaway elephant cart. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing serious -- a few broken bones," said Parish, whose clown cowlick and 
bulbous, red nose belie a modest, shy personality. 
</P>
<P>
But the pratfall is no pitfall for a two-clown couple. The Parishes became 
hard-core circus fans while growing up together in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years ago, Tammy Parish was attending "regular-people college" when her 
husband-to-be went to clown college in Florida and won a job with Ringling. She 
followed his career path a year later. Since then, they estimate that they have 
played to more than 55 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Their clowning carries over into their personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
On Valentine's Day, Tammy sang her undying love for Tommy, accompanied by an 
original accordion arrangement. Then, she hit him with a pie that was hidden in 
a big, red heart. "I can't carry a tune in a bucket, but Tom was touched 
anyway," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The Parishes say they have it better than other circus couples. When tempers 
flare, noted Tammy, "We have access to foam hammers."

RESORT STUDIES THE FLIP SIDE OF ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: ONE OF FOUR VISITORS TO COLORADO MOUNTAINS IS AFFLICTED BY ALTITUDE 
SICKNESS. TAKING A FEW DAYS TO REACH HIGHER GROUND IS EFFECTIVE PREVENTION, 
DOCTORS SAY.

Altitude sickness afflicts one of four visitors to Colorado's mountains. Its 
effects range from nausea and headaches to death, according to a study at this 
Rocky Mountain resort. 
</P>
<P>
One victim was Howard Shapiro, a 40-year-old New York City lawyer. He flew from 
Newark, N.J., on a Monday morning in February, arrived in Denver about noon and 
drove to this ski resort at above 9,000 feet altitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I became very dizzy, lightheaded. At the onset I was short of breath, but that 
seemed to abate pretty quickly. The headache went from mild to severe . . . and 
then the constant vomiting," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point in time, dying seemed the lesser of two evils," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, at the resort's Snake River Health Center, he was asked to 
participate in an experimental program. He was placed in a red Gamow bag, which 
resembles a backpacker's tube tent. Air pressure in the bag is increased. 
</P>
<P>
"We take him down to higher pressure and lower altitude. It's a simulated drop 
from Keystone's 9,300 feet to about 4,300 feet," said University of Colorado 
graduate student Jim Kasic, who is involved in the study by the Colorado 
Altitude Research Institute based at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
In two hours, Shapiro could eat and drink again. 
</P>
<P>
Bengtake Jaurin, 35, a microbiologist from Umea, Sweden, complained of the same 
symptoms after arriving at Frisco, altitude 9,036 feet. He went to his room and 
was found dead the next morning, Jan. 19. An autopsy showed he died of 
respiratory failure due to high-altitude pulmonary edema, an abnormal 
accumulation of fluid in the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem involves dozens of millions of people -- 13 million visitors to 
Colorado alone each year," said Dr. Charles Houston, founder of the institute. 
</P>
<P>
Altitude sickness has been found to afflict 23% of those surveyed so far, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean they're incapacitated," said Houston, of Burlington, Vt. "But 
with simple measures, we think we can stop at least a dozen preventable deaths 
a year from altitude sickness in Colorado. Make that 12 to 20 deaths that are 
preventable," Houston said. 
</P>
<P>
The institute's study, staffed by graduate students and supervised by 
doctor-board members of the nonprofit Snake River Health Clinic, began last 
June. About 1,700 adults and teen-agers have been interviewed at Keystone ski 
resort so far. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has looked at the 8,000-to-10,000-foot level and Mr. and Mrs. Joe 
Public, how well or how poorly they tolerate altitude, particularly if they 
have heart or lung disease," Houston said. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated the clinic's research could save each of the state's major ski 
resorts $3 million to $5 million a year in lost income and litigation. He said 
losses to the state's ski industry because of high-altitude sickness approach 
$55 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Kruzic, spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country USA, said the figures would 
be hard to verify. During a recent meeting, she asked chief executive officers 
from the state's ski areas about the estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"They were extremely surprised by that figure and would certainly want 
additional information to qualify those numbers because it's not something that 
has been of major concern in terms of lost revenues to the areas," Kruzic said. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, 76, began research on altitude while a mountain climber in the 
Himalayas in the 1930s and 1940s and with the Navy during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Houston said altitude sickness is a mixture of problems that often occur 
together: 
</P>
<P>
* Acute mountain sickness, which includes headache, nausea, vomiting, shortness 
of breath, fatigue and sleep disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
* High-altitude pulmonary edema, water accumulation in the lungs that can be 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
* High-altitude cerebral edema, in which water accumulates on the brain. It 
also can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms can be treated with medication, but the disease can be prevented, 
Houston said. 
</P>
<P>
"Prevention is to take a couple of days to get here, spend a couple days in 
Denver (at mile-high altitude) and then come on up here" to 9,300 feet, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Houston explained what happens to the body within an hour of arriving at a high 
altitude: 
</P>
<P>
First, breaths come deeper and faster. Second, the heart beats faster and puts 
out more blood per stroke. Third, bone marrow begins making more red blood 
cells to carry oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, body cells undergo enzyme changes, and the kidneys excrete more 
urine to get rid of excess bicarbonate. "There is something going on in just 
about every organ" as the body tries to adjust, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clinic medical director Dick Nicholas said acclimatization generally takes a 
night at an intermediate altitude. 
</P>
<P>
"We get people taking the all-night bus from Kansas City. They get on the bus 
Thursday afternoon and get off here Friday. That's not enough time for most," 
Nicholas said.

CENTURIES-OLD BOLIVIAN TAPESTRIES AT HEART OF MODERN PROPERTY DISPUTE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: BOLIVIAN TOWN SAYS WEAVINGS ARE PART OF ITS SPIRITUAL HERITAGE AND WERE 
SOLD WITHOUT ITS PERMISSION. IMPORTER SAYS HE BOUGHT THEM FAIRLY.

<P>
The centuries-old tapestries depicting gods, animals and people in natural dyes 
of blue, brown, red and indigo have become the stuff of legal argument. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is not their beauty, which is undeniable, but whether they are private 
property or the spiritual heritage of an Indian town. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors abroad pay handsomely for such weavings made by Indians of the Andes 
Mountains from the wool of alpacas, llamas and vicunas. 
</P>
<P>
A prolonged legal battle in North American courts pits international dealers in 
antiquities against the Aymara Indians of Coroma, 180 miles south of La Paz by 
dirt road, and has involved the Bolivian, U.S. and Canadian governments. 
</P>
<P>
It is a contest between the concept of private property and the communal 
ownership in which Indian cultures find religious significance, rooted in the 
lucrative traffic in antiquities and artifacts from Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Elders in Coroma, where about 10,000 Aymaras live in thick-walled adobe huts on 
Bolivia's wind-swept high plains, seek the return of weavings they describe as 
sacred. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, U.S. customs agents in San Francisco seized 56 textiles of the 
pre-Columbian and colonial eras from dealer Steven Berger. Police in Halifax, 
Nova Scotia, confiscated about 6,000 Bolivian artifacts, including an 
unspecified number of Coroma weavings, from Roger York, a former partner of 
Berger. 
</P>
<P>
All the goods are being held pending court rulings on whether they were 
exported from Bolivia illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Town elders say some people in Coroma sold the cloths, which are kept by 
families for generations, to Bolivian middlemen without community 
authorization, and the middlemen sold them to the foreign dealers. The 
villagers involved have been ostracized, and in some cases jailed. 
</P>
<P>
The weavings are used in religious rites, and community leaders say their loss 
has disrupted spiritual life. Some blame the absence of the weavings for 
troubles in the town and surrounding countryside. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Claudio Torres, said: "The textiles are the collective property of 
the community and we never authorized that they be taken. They are the spirit 
of the community. Because they were lost, people have died or lost their 
eyesight. There is drought and many animals have died." 
</P>
<P>
Torres, who has nine children, makes his living raising llamas and sheep and 
growing potatoes and grain. He was interviewed in La Paz, where he met with 
Maria Bedoya, director of the Bolivian Culture Institute, who is helping with 
the town's case. 
</P>
<P>
Bedoya said she is confident the cloths will be returned. "These weavings are 
being held captive because somebody took advantage of the good faith of 
Bolivians," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by telephone from San Francisco, Berger denied he had violated any 
laws in buying and shipping the weavings. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the pieces were stolen and all pieces were purchased in good faith," 
he said. "The Indians want to sell their textiles. I purchased textiles that 
were for sale." 
</P>
<P>
Cristina Bubba, a Bolivian psychologist who supports the town's efforts, said 
"the history of the community is depicted in the weavings," and they are used 
as oracles to communicate with ancestors. "The ancestors orient or direct the 
community in resolving political, social and individual problems." 
</P>
<P>
If the directions are followed, "the community is blessed, the cattle multiply 
and there is a good harvest," said Bubba, who has spent four years studying 
Aymara culture and religion in Coroma. "If the rites are not carried out, 
negative forces take hold." 
</P>
<P>
About 1.5 million Aymara Indians live in Bolivia and Peru. Their culture, older 
than the Incas, always has put a value on tribal weavings at least equal to 
that of gold. 
</P>
<P>
Berger's laywer, Ted Cassman of San Francisco, acknowledged by telephone that 
the case involved "competing interests." 
</P>
<P>
"If an individual has a textile in his family and he decides to sell it, and 
some people in the community believe it is not his to sell, the question is, 
who is to say to whom it belongs?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Cassman said it is common in Bolivia for individuals to own, and even collect, 
old weavings such as those from Coroma, and to consider them private property. 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Constitutional Rights, based in New York City, is among the 
agencies working with the Indians. Its legal director, Michael Ratner, said the 
effort is "part of a larger movement to try to get back the patrimony of Indian 
tribes in the Western Hemisphere."

A woman's decision to donate seven frozen embryos she won in a custody fight, 
rather than use them to become pregnant, does not end the battle, her 
ex-husband said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I am totally against it," Junior Lewis Davis, who produced the sperm for the 
embryos, said of his ex-wife's decision to donate them to another childless 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
"There is just no way I am going to donate them," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that's my right. If there was a child from them, then I would be a 
parent to it. And I don't want a child out there to be mine if I can't be a 
parent to it." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 31, and his ex-wife, Mary Sue Davis Stowe, 29, have been locked in a 
legal battle over the embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization in 1988 
while they were still married. 
</P>
<P>
In the only contested issue in their divorce, Blount County Circuit Judge W. 
Dale Young ruled in September that temporary custody of the embryos should go 
to Stowe, who at the time said she wanted to try to bring a child to term. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, taking the unprecedented step of ruling that "life begins at 
conception," accorded the embryos the same rights as children. He said it would 
be in the embryos' best interests to be with Stowe.

Pearly (The Catwoman) Chong's love affair with cats began a decade ago when she 
took in a family of strays. 
</P>
<P>
Today Chong's bungalow on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur vibrates to the purring 
of no fewer than 48 cats, ranging from pure-bred Persian, Siamese and Burmese 
to common strays. 
</P>
<P>
Chong dotes on them all, pedigree or not. 
</P>
<P>
"There should have been 52 of them but four died of kidney failure recently," 
said Chong, her eyes watering as she recalled the burial of her pets in a 
sprawling garden that now holds the remains of 10 of her furry companions. 
</P>
<P>
"They are my children and it's a full-time job," said the petite 40-year-old 
housewife, who also keeps 13 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
The wife of a commercial pilot, Chong said her collection of cats grew as more 
strays, some of them pregnant, found their way into her home and heart over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
As her interest in cats grew, she decided to breed and sell Persians. 
</P>
<P>
"But soon I found it too painful to sell them. I cried each time I sold one. 
Besides, I feel it is unfair to the cat to give birth so often," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to part with the kittens within three months of their birth, otherwise I 
would grow too attached to them. I interviewed each client and later visited 
them to check if the cats were all right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't sleep if I found they were not." 
</P>
<P>
All six cats she entered in a major Malaysian competition last September won 
prizes, including Pein Pein (Flat Nose), a 4-year-old Persian who took the 
"Best Malaysian Bred Cat" and two other titles. 
</P>
<P>
Another of Chong's cats, Tassy Star, took the "Best Siamese" title and was 
named Grand Champion for consistently winning that category in Malaysian shows 
since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Chong also owns Paprika Panter, a light-brown Persian bearing a remarkable 
resemblance to the cartoon character Garfield. It has retired from competition

Chong said she was offered $740 for Pein Pein. "But I won't sell her or any 
other of my cats. They are all valuable, even the strays I picked up." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the cats live in the Chongs' air-conditioned, marble-floored bungalow 
decorated with an assortment of items bearing cat motifs -- ashtrays, posters, 
dolls, clay figurines and paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"If burglars ever break in, they may take away any items but not my cats," 
Chong said as she sat surrounded by a multicolored platoon of animals purring 
around her for affection. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the cats are kept in a "cattery," a huge shed with rooms for 
different breeds. 
</P>
<P>
It is guarded by 12 dogs, some of them German Shepherds, prowling outside the 
chicken-wire fencing. 
</P>
<P>
Chong's 13th dog, a tiny, five-pound Chihuahua that looks as delicate as one of 
the cats, eats and sleeps with the felines. 
</P>
<P>
"She can't stay with the bigger dogs or she will be eaten up," Chong said. "But 
she is as cunning and lovely as any of the cats."

GREAT-GRANDSON OF LAST SHOGUN ACCEPTS LIFE AS SPECIAL BUT ORDINARY BUSINESSMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From his office window, Tsunenari Tokugawa gazes down at the wide moat and 
stone walls of the ancient fortress in the heart of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Tokugawa might have had a view from inside the fortress had history taken a 
different turn more than a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
He is the great-grandson of the last shogun, or military leader. Thus he 
descends from the Tokugawa clan that ruled Japan for more than 2 1/2 centuries, 
during the feudal days when the country was closed to foreigners, the days of 
warlords and samurai. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the fortress is the "palace" of the emperor whose supremacy was restored 
in 1868 after the toppling of the last shogun. 
</P>
<P>
But during the dynastic reign of 15 shoguns, the fortress was the mighty Edo 
(Tokyo) castle. "The government itself was run by a family of just 200 to 300 
members, and their loyal retainers," the shogun heir says. 
</P>
<P>
Had the Japanese not decided to make a mad dash for modernity after the 1853 
threat from the Black Ships of Adm. Matthew Perry, Tokugawa might have been the 
18th shogun. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he is today a simple middle manager of a shipping company in a Tokyo 
skyscraper. "I want to blend into Japan as a normal 'salaryman,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Tokugawa acts as titular patriarch of a family that carries one of the 
most distinguished pedigrees in Japan. The twigs and branches of the family 
tree hold a reunion once a year, and a few still own shogun heirlooms. 
</P>
<P>
Once a year, Tokugawa leads the family in a Shinto ceremony at the burial 
shrine of the first shogun, Ieyasu Tokugawa, who is famed for unifying Japan in 
the early 1600s and for being the source for the novel and TV series, Shogun. 
</P>
<P>
"When I tell any Japanese that my name is Tokugawa, they realize that I am from 
the shogun family," he states. "They are curious and disbelieving that the 
family has even survived." 
</P>
<P>
The family survived in part because the last shogun, Yoshinobu Tokugawa, had 
the wisdom to step down amid the turmoil caused by samurai revolt and the 
banging of "unclean beasts" (foreigners) on Japan's door. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the West at bay, the Japanese decided to adopt many of its ways. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fallen Yoshinobu was at first made an official enemy and his 
family hounded, he was later granted an aristocratic title and survived well 
into the 20th Century. He became a noted painter and photographer. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokugawa shogunate is best known for freeze-drying Japanese society, 
locking the nation's door and putting the emperor in lacquer. 
</P>
<P>
A suppressive rule also helped create Kabuki theater. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been thought that there was a clean break between modern Japan and the 
dark period of the shoguns, when the country was closed," the Tokugawa scion 
says. "But very recently, many books have suggested there was really a 
continuity -- with no break. "Certain cultural practices have persisted, such 
as loyalty, hierarchy, shame and face. Perhaps these have strong roots in the 
Tokugawa time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Such Japanese qualities are both blamed and praised by outsiders for creating a 
tight, advanced economy. "The backbone of the Japanese way of life was 
cultivated during this period," says Tokugawa. "Have we changed? Maybe not."

EVERYDAY LIFE UNDER BIG TOP IS NO CIRCUS 
</P>

<P>
Behind the glitz that is the circus, life for married couples and others who 
work under the Big Top is no circus. It is a world of constant work and 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
This community-on-wheels employs 150 performers and 200 handlers, riggers, 
seamstresses -- even a traveling priest, the Rev. Jack Toner. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe is on the road for two years, with perhaps a month off. Mail is 
forwarded, eventually, to the arenas where they perform. Animal trainers Lee 
and Judith Stevens had a $300 phone bill in March. 
</P>
<P>
The comforts of home go with them. Co-workers often are neighbors, as well: 
sleeping, cooking, doing laundry on a circus train that carries them from city 
to city. To help preserve family ties, relatives plan their vacations around 
visits to the circus. 
</P>
<P>
When they are not performing, practicing, making costumes, building props and 
caring for animals, some circus folks use their scant time to fish, sightsee, 
play golf or watch movies on their VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them travel with pets, although Marcia and Luis Palacio, who perform 
with ferocious animals at each show, left their cat and dog -- "spoiled, fat, 
lazy" and admittedly undisciplined -- at her mother's home in England. 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as the Stevenses, travel overland -- discreetly pulling into 
campgrounds with their baboons in an unmarked trailer. 
</P>
<P>
"We look like Joe Tourist going down the highway," said Stevens. "It's home; 
the dirt changes under the wheels -- that's all."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS PROPOSITIONS 118, 119; 
</P>
<P>
VOTERS COULD RADICALLY ALTER POLITICAL REMAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine baseball with five bases instead of four. Football with a field only 50 
yards long. Basketball with an extra hoop at center court. 
</P>
<P>
Changes no less fundamental could be in store for the rules that help determine 
who represents California voters in the Legislature and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Two initiatives on the June 5 ballot -- Propositions 118 and 119 -- would 
transform the way district lines are drawn for elections to the state Assembly 
and Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. If approved by voters, either 
measure could lead to a new balance of power in the Legislature and the 
California delegation in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Both initiatives take aim at redistricting, a process now the private province 
of state lawmakers. Under current law, their power to redraw district lines 
every 10 years is checked only by a brief set of general guidelines in the 
state Constitution and the potential veto of the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with high-powered computers and sophisticated analyses of voting 
patterns, a party that controls the Legislature and the governor's office, as 
the Democrats did in 1981, can draw lines that solidify its power far into the 
next decade. The process often produces odd-looking, serpentine districts as 
the line-drawers scoop in desired neighborhoods to corral clusters of 
like-minded voters. 
</P>
<P>
But Propositions 118 and 119 would change all that, and the thought has 
Democrats in a tizzy. They charge that both initiatives are thinly veiled 
Republican power grabs. What's more, Democratic leaders claim, the measures 
would unseat minority and women legislators, who only recently have begun to 
make gains after decades of being shut out of office. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an insidious plan designed to move . . . power, and it is disguised as 
good government," Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown of San Francisco 
said of the campaign for the two initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans and some nonpartisan groups tell a different story. They say 
Democrats have rigged the electoral process to keep incumbents in office; as 
proof, they note that only nine incumbents have been defeated in California's 
580 legislative and congressional elections since 1982. A fairer system, they 
maintain, would probably result not only in more Republican officeholders, but 
more women and minorities as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Our legislators are holding us hostage," said Ellen Elliott, a leader of the 
League of Women Voters, which supports Proposition 119. "We have legislators 
who are less responsive to voters and less focused on resolving major issues, 
because they know they have a very good chance of being reelected, regardless 
of how ineffective they may be." 
</P>
<P>
Both initiatives would place detailed new restrictions on the way district 
lines are drawn. For instance, they would prohibit districts from jumping 
certain county boundaries and limit the number of times that cities and 
counties could be divided. Both measures also include provisions designed to 
make districts more compact and competitive. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the two proposals diverge. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 118 leaves redistricting in the hands of legislative negotiators, 
but requires that any plan receive two-thirds of the votes in each house, the 
governor's signature and the approval of state voters. The measure also sets a 
deadline for the plans to be in place -- July 15 in the year after the census 
-- and requires that the proposals and maps be made public before they are 
approved. If the deadline for approval is missed, the state Supreme Court would 
handle redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 119 is more sweeping. It would create an independent 12-member 
commission to choose new districts from proposals submitted by registered 
voters. Ultimately, the commission, whose members would be appointed by a panel 
of retired appellate court judges, could amend the plans it received and thus 
draw the lines itself. The Legislature would have no say in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
If both measures pass, the one that garners the most votes would take effect. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 118 was written by top Republican activists and has strong support 
from GOP incumbents. Proposition 119 is more of a grass-roots product, 
sponsored by Republican San Mateo County Supervisor Tom Huening, the League of 
Women Voters and a handful of Democrats who do not hold state office. 
</P>
<P>
Most Democratic politicians oppose both measures. California Common Cause, the 
National Organization for Women and the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund also oppose them. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 118 supporters argue that their measure would ensure fairer plans 
by giving the party not in power -- in this case, the Republicans -- a chance 
to participate in redistricting. Allowing the voters to pass judgment on the 
plan would further check creative line-drawing. And the ballot measure includes 
restrictions on speech fees and gifts that lawmakers can accept from groups 
with lobbyists in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"This measure guarantees that the views of the minority party will be taken 
into account, which should result in some fairness," said Assembly Republican 
leader Ross Johnson of La Habra. "The name of the game in the past has been for 
the majority party to artificially maintain and extend its majority by the 
drawing of the lines." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, however, charge that Proposition 118 would lead to the creation of 
district lines that protect incumbents of both major parties. By requiring a 
two-thirds vote in the Legislature, the measure ensures that at least that many 
seats would be safe from challenge, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"If you require a simple majority vote, then a majority will vote for the plan 
that gives them safe seats," said Brenda Robinson, an analyst for Common Cause. 
"If you require a super-majority, then a super-majority will vote yes if they 
have safe seats. It guarantees incumbent protection." 
</P>
<P>
Other critics contend that the measure's deadline and the automatic referendum 
it calls for would make it more likely that the redistricting job would be 
given to the Supreme Court. The court is dominated by appointees of Republican 
Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats so far have focused more of their venom on Proposition 119, which 
would remove elected lawmakers from the process. Assembly Speaker Brown has led 
an attack on the initiative's backers, and Democratic lawmakers have pressured 
nonpartisan groups to oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
A consistent theme of Brown's public statements has been that the measure would 
cost women and minorities their legislative seats. He contends the proposed 
guidelines regulating how districts would be drawn would cause such disruption 
that three Los Angeles seats now held by black women and two Bay Area seats 
also held by women could change hands. 
</P>
<P>
But at least four of the five seats Brown has identified -- those held by 
Maxine Waters and Teresa Hughes of Los Angeles, Jackie Speier of South San 
Francisco and Delaine Eastin of Union City -- appear to be compact enough to 
meet the standards of the initiative. The four districts also follow city 
limits closely -- another requirement of the initiative, although Speier and 
Eastin have districts that cross county lines. 
</P>
<P>
The other district Brown mentions, which is held by Gwen Moore of Los Angeles, 
follows city boundaries but probably does not meet the compactness test. But, 
with only minor changes, it could meet both standards. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for the Democrats is that many of those districts already are in 
jeopardy, because the state's population has shifted away from older urban 
areas and into the suburbs. The situation facing Speaker Brown and 
Assemblywoman Speier illustrates the potential consequences of this trend. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's central San Francisco district has lost population relative to the rest 
of the state. Since every district must contain roughly the same number of 
people after redistricting, the boundaries for Brown's district probably will 
be forced to move south or west to pick up the population it needs. But that 
change could threaten Speier, whose district would be pushed down the San 
Francisco peninsula, lose Democratic voters and thus confront her with a 
tougher fight for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Although Brown insists that both measures would hurt minorities, the backers of 
Proposition 119 point out that their initiative requires the redistricting 
plans to meet the standards of the federal Voting Rights Act before they are 
considered by the commission. The measure also requires that minority 
communities be neither diluted nor concentrated in a way that diminishes their 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
With the Democrats in control of redistricting, minority representation has 
improved little in 15 years, even as the state's ethnic populations have 
increased dramatically. In 1975, there were seven blacks, six Latinos and two 
Asians in the Legislature. Today, there are nine blacks, six Latinos and no 
Asians. 
</P>
<P>
"The intent of Proposition 119 is to help minorities and women; the way you do 
that is you provide opportunities for challengers," said San Mateo County's 
Supervisor Huening, the initiative's sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Huening and others say that partisanship is the real motivation behind Brown's 
opposition. Proposition 119 might threaten the Democrats' hold on the Assembly, 
where they control 47 of 80 seats, and in the Senate, where they have 25 of 40 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one of the more controversial provisions contained in both initiatives 
is a requirement that as many districts as possible be "competitive" -- defined 
as containing Democrats and Republicans in proportions that are within 2% of 
the parties' statewide share of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Since Democrats currently have the edge -- 50% to 39% -- this requirement might 
appear harmless. But Republicans historically have been able to win almost any 
district in which Democrats account for fewer than 50% of the registered 
voters. This is because Democrats tend to be poorer, and they move more often 
than Republicans, and so each district actually has fewer Democratic voters 
than the registration rolls suggest. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to penalize the Democrats for representing poor people, this is 
the way to do it," Bruce Cain, a University of California professor and 
Democratic consultant, said of the criteria in Proposition 119. 
</P>
<P>
So far, public opinion polls show that neither Republican nor Democratic voters 
know much about the redistricting initiatives. In a Los Angeles Times Poll 
published in early May, 85% of voters surveyed did not know enough about 
Proposition 118 to have an opinion, and 88% had no position on Proposition 119.

All the way here, I have been thinking about what I would say to you. Today's 
column comes to you -- live! -- from the woods. This modern miracle is made 
possible by a portable laptop computer. The laptop is so light I can take it 
off my lap and place it in my knapsack along with my apple and bag of nuts. 
</P>
<P>
They say you should write about what you know. I am sick of what I know -- 
contemporary urban life. I want to be a nature writer. I want to write about 
the beautiful things you never read about in newspapers, right here at the 
source, away from the cutting glances of coffee-gulping editors. 
</P>
<P>
(Although right now there is a huge turkey vulture circling above me. Do you 
think he can sense my dead prose?) 
</P>
<P>
On the way here, I saw some kind of butterfly. I scared away a family of quail. 
Those would be the highlights of my story so far. 
</P>
<P>
I have come to the woods where I used to hike daily in my halcyon hippier days. 
It's hard to believe those were 20 years and 20 pounds ago, back when the focus 
of my life was staying mellow and getting in touch with nature. 
</P>
<P>
I once brought my mother to this place. Her trip here was certainly harder than 
mine -- from Russia by boat and then plane to California, with a 50-year 
stopover in Chicago. I thought it would be good to get her on the trail, but 
those 50 years in Chicago had taken their toll. 
</P>
<P>
Itook her to where there was no sound except the chatter of birds. She looked 
around at the tall pines and eucalyptus, the graceful hillsides of purple 
lupine, and said: "Ya' know, you could bring someone here, kill them, bury the 
body and no one would ever know." 
</P>
<P>
I must admit a touch of that orientation has stayed with me. When I sat down on 
this hillside. . . . Excuse me, but two young gray birds with white tails are 
edging toward me. Not sure what they are. Why can't they pose exactly like the 
ones in my "Field Guide to Western Birds"? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, a life lived in cities has rendered me a tiny bit paranoid. When I sit 
down in the woods now, I frequently look behind me. I'm not sure what I think 
is going to happen. It's not as if a bear with a gun will come up to me and 
say, "OK, lady, hand over the Tandy laptop." 
</P>
<P>
There's an airplane. These darn noises are so distracting! 
</P>
<P>
Think it's time for a break. Think I'll eat the apple, OK? 
</P>
<P>
It's clouding up now. Getting kind of chilly. Getting kind of hard to write in 
complete sentences, too. 
</P>
<P>
I thought that if I came to this peaceful place, I could write of such serenity 
that you, in your crowded office or dingy room or noisy cafe, could get a 
contact mellow off reading this. You know: I'm here and you're not, but at 
least one of us is doing this for all mankind. 
</P>
<P>
I also thought that away from the distractions, I could concentrate, get in 
touch with the fundamental truths and communicate them. It's a 
you-are-where-you-write kinda thing. Just a woman, an apple, a bag of Weight 
Watchers peanuts, a Tandy laptop and the cosmos. . . . What was that? A blue 
jay. Noisy son of a gun. I'll just wait until it stops squawking. Waiting. . . 
. Oh well. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, free from the distractions, the clock, the Post-its, the phone, the 
endless whirl of the hard disk drive, I could. . . . When is that darn bird 
going to shut up? For Pete's sake! 
</P>
<P>
Think I'll take a little break here and eat the peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
Oh my God! There's a man down there on the trail. You know, he could kill me 
and leave the body and a ranger will find this computer in a garbage bin with 
these, my last words. 
</P>
<P>
So if I never get back alive, take my advice: Get out to the serenity of. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Whew! He walked on by. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as I was saying, I had hoped that by coming to this beautiful place. . . . 
What was that? 
</P>
<P>
Squirrel! No problem; just a squirrel. Too bad I'm out of nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Guess the old wind in my boot heels is sayin': Time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 I love to go a wanderin' 
</P>
<P>
 Across the mountain track . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And as I go 
</P>
<P>
 I love to schlep 
</P>
<P>
 My computer on my back.

REELING FROM INVASION BY HOLLYWOOD CREWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Patt Morrison's article "Mad About the Movies" (May 18), a major point is 
missed. It is not the occasional film crew that disturbs residents, but the 
tendency to pick a specific location and then use it ad nauseam. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case in our neighborhood, where we have had a constant invasion of 
nighttime shoots that are noisy and disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
With the cost of property and the tax base we pay, I certainly think residents 
are entitled to some rest. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, words mean nothing to the movie crews, and the city is totally 
insensitive to the issuance of permits. Only by asking for outrageous amounts 
of money can neighbors prevail and make certain locations "undesirable." I 
assure you that in many cases it is not greed but desire to be left alone.

REELING FROM INVASION BY HOLLYWOOD CREWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cliff Roseman, a location manager for some film company, is dead wrong. I, and 
many others, will not say "damn" when the film crews are gone. 
</P>
<P>
Good riddance is more like it. 
</P>
<P>
My neighborhood, with its old houses, was one of many favorites of the film 
companies. I haven't seen much of them lately, perhaps because of letters to 
Charles Weisenberg, director of the city's motion picture and television 
affairs office, and tactics such as asking for the crew's film permits. These 
permits have a definite ending time, and if they aren't cleaned up and out of 
there by that time, my neighbors and I let Weisenberg know. 
</P>
<P>
As for Weisenberg's assertion that the industry generates $5 billion a year for 
California, I ask for whom? Does $5 billion go into the coffers of the state or 
cities of California? I bet most of it ends up in the pockets of the producers 
and stars, those people who don't allow filming in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
If more companies were like Avnet/Kerner, which helped the community and 
improved the area instead of trashing it, maybe I'd sing a different tune. But 
they are not. Most just go for the bucks, everyone else be damned. It is time 
the production companies shape up or ship out. ANDREW CARRILLO, Los Angeles

ROGER SIMON: LIFE CHANGES IN THE FACE OF DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If I were Lee Atwater, I'd want to read bad things about me once again. 
</P>
<P>
I'd want to read how I was "the most evil man in America" (U.S. Rep. Patricia 
Schroeder), "a nervous little devil's helper . . . a bug-eyed gnome with a 
perpetual smirk and an uncanny ability to patronize blacks" (Spy magazine), 
"sinister . . . viciously demagogic . . . nefarious" (Michael Kinsley), and how 
"Atwater would kidney punch a Girl Scout" (GQ). 
</P>
<P>
You have not seen stuff like this written about Atwater lately and you are not 
likely to see it written in the near future. That's because Lee Atwater has a 
brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
And the press does not speak ill of the dying. It is one of the last great 
taboos. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing shows this more clearly than the flip-flop The New Republic was forced 
to perform. 
</P>
<P>
Early reports -- and these were conscious smoke screens -- were that Atwater 
had "fainted" during a speech on March 5. In reality, he had had a violent 
seizure and lost control of the left side of his body. 
</P>
<P>
He was diagnosed as having a non-malignant brain tumor, but the word was put 
out that everything was going to be all right. So when Atwater gave a phone 
interview to Lee Bandy of Knight-Ridder, some people were confused. Because 
there now emerged an Atwater nobody had seen before. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine me getting back in a fighting mood," he said. "I don't see how 
I'm ever going to be mean. It's going to be hard for me to be as tough on 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Atwater said he would now view life differently. "I have a better sense of 
humanity," he said, "a better sense of fellowship with people than I've ever 
had before." 
</P>
<P>
Mentioning a longtime political foe, Atwater said: "If I saw him right now, I'd 
hug him around the neck. I'd give him the warmest hug I could give him." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, everybody thought this was pure hogwash. Pure Atwater. This was 
straight out of the heavily underlined copy of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" that 
Atwater always traveled with: "Without deception, you cannot carry out 
strategy, without strategy you cannot control the opponent." 
</P>
<P>
Which is how The New Republic viewed it. "Leave it to Lee Atwater -- now on the 
mend, we're glad to say -- to spin-control his own brain tumor," the magazine 
wrote. "He's been telling reporters that his bout with illness has turned him 
into a kinder, more mellow Republican National Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"To paraphrase a comment of Evelyn Waugh's, doctors appear to have found the 
only part of Mr. Atwater that isn't malignant. Let's hope they don't have to 
remove it." 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad line. Except that soon afterward, the true seriousness of Atwater's 
illness became known. His tumor was deadly and he was pursuing a very daring 
method of treatment: Radioactive material was being injected directly into the 
tumor in an attempt to kill it. 
</P>
<P>
And stories began quoting doctors saying the survivability rates of this kind 
of tumor were not good. In other words, Lee Atwater might be dying. 
</P>
<P>
So The New Republic suddenly did not look wry and witty anymore. It looked mean 
and cruel. And so a few weeks later it said: 
</P>
<P>
"We apologize for making light of Lee Atwater's illness. . . . Our objections 
to the campaign he managed for George Bush still stand, but we sincerely wish 
him well in his struggle for health." 
</P>
<P>
Then the magazine went on to say that others in his party were even worse than 
Atwater and concluded with: "Get well, Lee. Your party needs your comparative 
decency and intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
Atwater must have gotten a smile out of that "comparative." One wall of his 
rather grand office at Republican National Headquarters is devoted to political 
cartoons that depict him as a racist, a liar and a scoundrel. 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't bother me," he said when I asked him about them once. "I'm a 
professional lightning rod. I ain't never gonna run for office. But when I call 
the cartoonists to ask for the cartoons, a lot of them don't know how to 
react." 
</P>
<P>
The whole point of the wall was to show that Atwater knew how to take it. It 
was to tell people: "I can take any punch you can throw." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Lee Atwater has been thrown a curve. He is a man used to 
controlling lives, events, even the destiny of a nation. And now he cannot 
depend on controlling even his own body. 
</P>
<P>
It must be a terrible, frightening thing. And I believe Atwater when he says 
his life has changed. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think you can go through what he is going through and emerge the same 
person. Who would want to? Facing the end of life teaches you something about 
the life you have led. 
</P>
<P>
It teaches you something about hate and love and the relative value of things. 
Since he was 20, Atwater wanted to work in presidential politics. He is 39 now 
and I wonder what he is thinking about today. Surely, he still thinks about 
politics and about winning seats for Republicans. That is his job. 
</P>
<P>
But I bet he thinks about other things too: about one more day with his 
children, one more moment with his wife, one more conversation with friends, 
one more opportunity to tell people what they mean to him. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Atwater is fighting his illness in the most active and aggressive way he 
can. Nobody who knows him would expect anything less. 
</P>
<P>
And I sincerely hope we start reading once again about what a bug-eyed gnome he 
really is. 
</P>
<P>
It'd be a good sign.

ERMA BOMBECK: BART SIMPSON? KIDS NEED A BRAT LIKE HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is no surprise that Bart Simpson has become a role model for every kid in 
America. And why not? The TV cartoon character is insensitive, rotten and 
manipulative. If he lived next door, you would forbid your child to play with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
This is upsetting for many educators and parents, as it "sends out the wrong 
message to children." 
</P>
<P>
For as long as I can remember, there have been characters in this world who 
play off goodness. Just when you thought Shirley Temple's face would break out 
from so much perfection, along came Jane Withers, who could make her cry. For 
some reason, this minimized the fiction. 
</P>
<P>
You could always count on the Beav and Wally to do the right thing, but the 
character my kids really related to was Eddie Haskell, who sneaked into movies 
without paying, never cut the grass and in general spelled trouble. You just 
knew when he said, "Gee, Mrs. Cleaver, didn't I see your twin on the cover of 
Seventeen magazine?" that he was full of it, but so what? 
</P>
<P>
Kids need to know that somewhere in this world is a contemporary who can pull 
off all the things they fantasize about, someone who can stick it to their 
parents and still be permitted to live. 
</P>
<P>
Children are made up of certain component parts: goodness, conscience, daring, 
judgment, cuteness, larceny and rebellion. There's a little of Dennis the 
Menace in them, a tad of Oscar the Grouch, a snippet of the Brady Bunch. 
</P>
<P>
They are endowed with the same ambivalence as their parents. Adults love their 
children more than life one minute, and the next threaten to chain them to 
their beds through puberty. 
</P>
<P>
The message always seems clear, though. Mike Seaver on "Growing Pains" and 
Dennis on "Head of the Class" get their comeuppance for their behavior. Hey, 
didn't Bart get shipped off to France as a slave to a couple of sleazy 
winemakers? 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't have been surprised if my kids had chosen Lizzie Borden as a role 
model. We're dealing with relationships where the protagonist is always bigger, 
taller, older and has permanent possession of the car keys. The children are 
the ones who always have to listen, learn and do as they're told. I wouldn't 
deprive them of Bart for anything in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Be honest. When Roseanne wins a round with her teen-agers, don't we all stand a 
little taller?

Temple City, celebrating its 30th anniversary of incorporation, was founded by 
Walter P. Temple in 1922. In 1936, the Town of Temple was officially designated 
a city by the U.S. Postal Service. A successful incorporation election in May, 
1960, made its city status official.

HARD LESSONS IN SCHOOL-BASED MANAGEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A SEMINAR AT USC HELPS TO LAY GROUNDWORK FOR PARENTS, TEACHERS AND 
PRINCIPALS WHO WILL BE MAKING THE RULES FOR THEIR SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The principal, the teachers' union representative and the mother of a 
Westchester High School student huddled on the steps of a USC class building 
last weekend to plan their next move. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a big one. The three women, along with groups like them from about 
70 other schools, are in the vanguard of a revolution that could rejuvenate or, 
once and for all, sink Los Angeles' public schools. 
</P>
<P>
It's called school-based management, and the three women -- who make up 
Westchester High's proposal-writing team -- spent most of last weekend learning 
how to go about it. 
</P>
<P>
School-based management gives individual schools governing power over how the 
school will be run, including everything from the length of the school day to 
some budget matters -- an awesome opportunity or a potential disaster, 
depending on how an adventure into the unknown is viewed. 
</P>
<P>
It is the current trend in urban school districts, a trend fueled by 
dissatisfaction over public schools' performance and a belief that a turnaround 
requires upending the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
"It finally gives parents and teachers and principals the freedom to be 
creative and find effective ways to serve their students," said Mark Slavkin, a 
Westside school board member. "The current system is set up to guard against 
the very kind of creativity we're trying to promote." 
</P>
<P>
For school-based management to succeed, the district -- along with the state -- 
must respond to the push from individual schools to rethink a Byzantine set of 
rules that, Slavkin said, impedes the schools' true mission: to educate the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the group last weekend, Los Angeles School Supt. Leonard Britton 
pledged cooperation, saying that if school-based management does not work, it 
will be a travesty for the district. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its settlement of the teachers' strike last year, the district 
agreed to require "shared decision-making councils" at all schools. The 
councils, which are advisory, include parents, teachers, the principal and, in 
secondary schools, student representatives. 
</P>
<P>
School-based management is the second step, actually a series of steps, toward 
self-rule. Seventy schools will take the plunge next year -- if they can 
complete the Herculean task of getting coordinated. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of them are in the Westside region. They are: Hamilton High School, 
Hamilton Music Academy, Loyola Village School Magnet, Marquez Elementary, 
Pacific Palisades Elementary, Palisades High, Paul Revere Junior High, Webster 
Junior High, Westchester High, Westside Alternative, Westwood Elementary, 
Windsor Hills Elementary and Wright Junior High . 
</P>
<P>
Under deadline pressure, the pioneers gathered in classes over the weekend to 
learn about everything from how to define their school's mission to when to 
hold meetings of the school's new governing council. Proposals have to be 
finished and approved by the faculty and staff before a parents meeting is held 
to obtain their approval. Absentee ballots for parents who don't attend the 
meeting must be in the mail by June 22, the last day of school. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals are due at the district in early July, an extension of an earlier 
deadline. Schools whose proposals are approved by the district will be notified 
by Aug. 23 for fall implementation. The board recently voted a second deadline 
in October for those of the 70 that require more time. 
</P>
<P>
Among the ideas under discussion at various schools: extending the kindergarten 
day; teaming junior high students with the same teachers for three years, so 
they can get more individual attention, and various proposals for staff 
development. 
</P>
<P>
On the steps outside of the USC class building, Westchester Principal Eileen 
Banta, teacher Adrienne Zeigler and parent Helen Rupp were reporting to each 
other what they had learned that morning and which seminars they should attend 
next. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh from a seminar lead by a representative from the National Education 
Assn., Rupp was persuaded that they should not be too ambitious in their first 
proposal, because of the deadline and lack of time for research. 
</P>
<P>
Banta urged action. "I say we go for it," she said. "You can research it to 
death. . . . It's better to be in the door and be creative. 
</P>
<P>
The trick, she told the others, was to write a proposal with a broad enough 
brush to prevent getting backed into a corner. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps an even more difficult task than writing the proposals is 
understanding the district's current regulations. At a Friday night session 
with a district budget official, teachers, principals and parents acted as 
though they were junior high students at an assembly. Each piece of information 
evoked chatter from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
At a Saturday seminar on governance, the buzzword was flatness -- in this case 
meaning a minimum distance between the decision-makers and those affected by 
their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Barby Halstead-Worrell, from the National Education Assn., cautioned another 
group to set manageable goals that are concrete and winnable. "If you go into 
this process thinking you're going to turn the world around in one year . . . 
you're setting yourself up for a fall," she warned. 
</P>
<P>
The Westchester High School proposal writers ignored protocol for the third 
session when they all attended the same proposal-writing workshop. 
</P>
<P>
And this week they got down to it. Banta reported Wednesday that the three were 
hoping to complete their task during a marathon session after school. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a weary Banta said that in nearly seven hours they had completed 
three pages, and were determined to "burn the midnight oil" and finish the 
task, an additional seven pages, before today. 
</P>
<P>
Banta said they have identified their goals of improving student achievement 
and increasing staff effectiveness. They're looking at seeking a waiver from 
the district so they can use student activity funds, such as proceeds from a 
fund-raising event, for curriculum needs. 
</P>
<P>
Other plans on the table include interdisciplinary teaching of English, history 
and art, college-type scheduling for seniors and putting more students on the 
governing council "so they can feel a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
On Banta's time line, the parents will get ballots on June 11, after the 
faculty has voted June 4 if it "ho, ho, ho" has been written by then, she said. 
"I'm very optimistic," she added.

Where but on the Westside can you find Zsa Zsa Gabor's lawyer, a gay swimming 
pool contractor and a born-again Jew for Jesus on the ballot? 
</P>
<P>
The three candidates are among a crop of challengers who have chosen to take on 
firmly entrenched legislators and congressmen despite overwhelming odds against 
their insurgent candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
Under-financed, under-organized and largely unknown, the challengers do not 
pose a threat to the Westside's political power structure. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, their campaigns have been so low-key that, with little more than a 
week before voters go to the polls, there's almost no sign of an impending 
election: No billboards, no bumper stickers, no posters on utility poles. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of action is a testament to just how safe incumbent lawmakers are on 
this solidly Democratic turf. The veteran office-holders are all but assured of 
renomination June 5, and since the area is so reliably Democratic, the odds 
heavily favor their reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
Challengers may cry foul, but it is a fact of political life that after all the 
votes are counted, it's most likely to be the status quo all over again. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Cain, associate director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC 
Berkeley, says the Westside is simply "hard-core liberal, Jewish and 
non-competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it is precisely that state of affairs that prompted Century City 
attorney William Graysen to run against state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Graysen, who represented Gabor in the celebrated Beverly Hills cop-slapping 
case, said he decided to enter the Democratic race after the Berlin Wall 
crumbled last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Events in Germany caused me to examine the state of government here in West 
Los Angeles," Graysen said. "I found incumbents getting elected again and 
again. Incumbents running unopposed." 
</P>
<P>
Graysen said he decided to run because "the people don't even have a choice, so 
I'm the choice." 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old attorney does not underestimate the task before him in trying 
to oust the 72-year-old Rosenthal. "I know he is a very tough candidate, that 
he is very entrenched." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal is the only senator in the state with a primary challenger, but he 
does not sound worried. "I think that the man is looking for a little 
publicity," he said. "I'm not really that concerned." 
</P>
<P>
In his quest for a third term, Rosenthal will face Republican Michael Schrager 
and Peace and Freedom candidate Margery Hinds in November. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal's 22nd Senate District includes Pacific Palisades, Santa Monica, 
Brentwood, Bel-Air, Westwood, West Los Angeles, Century City, Beverly Hills, 
Mar Vista, the Palms area and part of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby in the 45th Assembly District, the primary fight to select a Republican 
challenger to Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) has taken on a personal 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which includes Hollywood, West Hollywood, Hancock Park, Universal 
City, North Hollywood and part of Burbank, is nearly 59% Democratic in voter 
registration. Margolin is running for a sixth term after winning a landslide 
reelection victory two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood swimming pool contractor Robert K. Davis is running against 
Hollywood businesswoman Elizabeth Michael in the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 45, who ran unsuccessfully for the West Hollywood City Council last 
month, conceded it is "doubtful that a Republican will win in November." But 
Davis, who said he is gay, entered the race to oppose "certain right-wing 
elements in the Republican Party." He accuses his rival of making 
"fire-and-brimstone fundamentalist speeches" and opposing abortion and gay 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Michael, 33, identifies herself as a "born-again Christian" and "a Jew who 
believes among other things that Jesus is the Messiah." She strongly opposes 
abortion because of her religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael's position on gay rights is difficult to discern. "I do not have a 
clearly defined set of religious convictions on the subject of homosexual 
orientation," she said. Nor does she take a position on the current controversy 
in the Republican Party over whether gay clubs should be chartered. 
</P>
<P>
Margolin will face the GOP nominee and Peace and Freedom candidate Owen Staley 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
Farther west, Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) has drawn another 
Democratic primary challenge from Los Angeles businessman Alex Cota. 
</P>
<P>
Cota sends out crudely produced campaign mailers and sharply questions Hayden 
at some campaign forums. He is making his third run at the four-term lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Cota opposes the "Big Green" environmental initiative that Hayden is 
sponsoring. He said the measure, which would create the office of a state 
environmental advocate, phase out cancer-causing pesticides and protect the 
coastline, is an abuse of the initiative process. And he charges that Hayden is 
attempting to promote himself as state environmental czar. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden, 50, has said running for such a highly visible statewide office would 
be appealing if the initiative wins approval this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Two Republicans are competing for the right to challenge Hayden in the 44th 
Assembly District, which includes Malibu, Pacific Palisades, Santa Monica, 
Venice, Mar Vista, West Los Angeles and Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Stout, 45, a Pacific Palisades camera store owner, has run against 
Hayden twice before. She is opposed by Fred Beteta, 60, a retired aerospace 
associate engineer and longtime member of the Santa Monica College board of 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates support abortion rights and favor more aid to education. 
</P>
<P>
They differ on what to do about the homeless. Stout has called for creation of 
a commission to study the problem and consider shifting responsibility for the 
homeless from local governments to the state. But Beteta says another 
commission is not needed and suggests that rent subsidies may be necessary 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans disagree about who can best tackle Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
Beteta charges that Stout has tried and failed to win elective office and that 
a new face is needed. "There is a choice, for a change," he tells Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Stout questions Beteta's commitment to the GOP, noting that he 
became a Republican after a falling-out with local Democrats. "What I call 
myself is the real Republican," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Republican contest will face Hayden in November, as will 
Libertarian Rebecca Donner and Peace and Freedom candidate Timothy Burdick. 
</P>
<P>
Like Hayden, Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) faces a primary challenger. 
Sal Genovese, 44, administrator of a private treatment program for alcoholics 
and drug abusers, is making his second run against Roos. 
</P>
<P>
Genovese readily acknowledges that "it's not easy to unseat a person like Mike 
Roos," but says the public doesn't like incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
Roos' 46th Assembly District includes the mid-Wilshire area, downtown Los 
Angeles, Silver Lake and Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
Two Republicans, Los Angeles stockbroker Geoffrey Church and disabled Korean 
War veteran Howard O. Watts are running in the GOP primary. Both are 
anti-abortion and oppose Roos' efforts to restrict the sale of assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
In his quest for an eighth term, Roos will face the winner of the GOP primary 
and the victor in the Peace and Freedom Party primary, which pits Dan Robrish 
against Robert Taves. Libertarian Michael Everling also will be on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In congressional races, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) has no Democratic 
opponent. But two Republicans, West Los Angeles attorney David Barrett Cohen 
and Playa del Rey computer salesman Hans Yeager, are running in the GOP 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
Issues have not divided the two Republican candidates, although campaign 
spending and political endorsements distinguish them. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, 30, said he plans to spend about $30,000 on his primary campaign. He has 
won the endorsements of state and local Republican groups and is planning a 
pre-primary mailer to GOP voters. 
</P>
<P>
He complains about incumbent advantages, including congressional mailing 
privileges. Cohen wants a limit on campaign spending, a ban on contributions 
from political action committees, and a six-term limit for House members. 
</P>
<P>
Yeager, 27, said he has spent about $3,000 for signs and a limited mailing to 
active Republicans. He says he brings a different style to the race. "I'm just 
not going to be another lawyer," Yeager said. 
</P>
<P>
He said higher taxes and reductions in defense spending may be necessary to cut 
the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Levine's 27th Congressional District includes Santa Monica, part of West Los 
Angeles, Mar Vista, Venice, Marina del Rey, Playa del Rey, part of Inglewood, 
El Segundo, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach, Lawndale, part of 
Torrance and Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
When he seeks a fifth term this fall, Levine, 46, will face the winner of the 
Republican race and Peace and Freedom candidate Edward Ferrer. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), one of the leaders of the Westside's 
Berman-Waxman Democratic political organization, faces a nominal primary 
challenge from a follower of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche. 
</P>
<P>
Scott M. Gaulke of Studio City, who said he has been associated with LaRouche 
for 11 years, differs with the liberal Berman on numerous issues, including 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Two Republicans, Van Nuys businessman Roy Dahlson and Sun Valley hardware 
manager Gary E. Forsch are seeking the right to oppose Berman. Both are 
anti-abortion. 
</P>
<P>
On the November ballot, Berman will face, in addition to the winner of the GOP 
primary, Libertarian Bernard Zimring. Berman's 26th Congressional District 
includes the hills above Hollywood, Bel-Air, and Beverly Hills, plus the 
northeastern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Several Democratic incumbents have no primary challengers: 
</P>
<P>
* Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) can concentrate his energy on the 
fall campaign when he is expected to face a well-financed challenge from 
Republican businessman Jim Salomon. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson is seeking his eighth term in Congress. Although his district is 53% 
Democratic in registration, he received 63.5% of the vote against Salomon two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 23rd Congressional District includes Malibu, Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, 
Westwood, Bel-Air, Century City, Beverly Hills, Rancho Park, and the Palms area 
plus the northwestern part of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
* Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) will again face Republican John N. 
Cowles in the fall. Peace and Freedom voters must select between candidates 
Vikki Murdock and Maggie Phair. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, 50, was elected to an eighth term in 1988 with 72% of the vote. His 
24th Congressional District includes the Fairfax District, the Hollywood area, 
the edge of downtown Los Angeles, Griffith Park and North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
* Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) will run against Republican George Z. 
Adams, whom he easily defeated two years ago. Libertarian Bob Weber and Peace 
and Freedom candidate William R. Williams will also be on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon, 55, is seeking his seventh term. His 28th Congressional District 
includes Culver City, Westchester, Lennox, Baldwin Hills, and South Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
* Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), who is seeking a third term, 
will face Republican Gary Passi, Libertarian Andrew S. Rotter and Peace and 
Freedom candidate John Paul Lindblad in November. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman's 43rd Assembly District includes Bel-Air, Brentwood, Westwood, 
Beverly Hills and parts of the northwestern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
* Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) is seeking a seventh term. She will 
again face Republican Eric Givens, whom she easily defeated two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Peace and Freedom candidate Alice Mae Miles and Libertarian Carin Rogers will 
also be on the ballot in the staunchly Democratic 49th Assembly District, which 
includes Marina del Rey, Playa del Rey, Westchester, Culver City, Ladera 
Heights, Baldwin Hills, and the Crenshaw area. 
</P>
<P>
* Sen. Diane E. Watson (D-Los Angeles) has no Democratic or Republican 
challenger in her bid for a fourth term. Watson faces only Peace and Freedom 
candidate Ivan Kasimoff. 
</P>
<P>
Her 28th Senate District includes Marina del Rey, Playa del Rey, Westchester, 
part of Culver City, Inglewood, Hawthorne, Lawndale and part of South-Central 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
One other state Senate contest touches the Westside. Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa 
Barbara) will face Republican Carey Rogers of Santa Barbara and Libertarian Jay 
C. Wood in November. Hart's 18th Senate District runs from the Topanga Canyon 
area in Malibu north to Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.

NEW GOLD RUSH; 
</P>
<P>
PANNING ENTHUSIASTS SEE BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR HOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND D. NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to gold panning, you have your recreational speed panners and you 
have your unvarnished, dirt-chewing prospectors. 
</P>
<P>
Speed panners practice in the comfort of their backyards. Prospectors scrabble 
through the wilderness, scuffing knuckles and fingernails in gravelly stream 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
"Us old miners who have been in the field a long time tend to pooh-pooh the 
speed panners," says George Massie, president of the Gold Prospectors Assn. of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Roberts, a retired mechanical engineer and confirmed suburbanite from 
Claremont, is different. Not only is he the current world champion in speed 
panning, he can also get down and dig through muddy gravel with the best of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"They say a cowboy ain't a cowboy till you've seen him ride," says Massie. 
"Well, I saw Roberts pan once, and he's one heck of a gold panner." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts won the 28th World Championship Gold Panning contest last month in 
Dahlonega, Ga., extracting eight gold nuggets from a panful of sand in 11.54 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Competitive panning is an oddball skill, with only a distant resemblance to 
stream-side panning, most competitors acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
You're handed a pan brimming with fine sand, in which gold nuggets have been 
secreted, explains Roberts, who has done his share of both back-yard panning 
and prospecting. The idea is to plunge the pan into a barrel of water and, 
using a distinctive swirling motion, quickly lose the sand while retaining the 
nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're lucky, you won't lose a nugget (into the barrel)," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, 64, a brusque man with an ivory-colored mustache that, after 17 years' 
growth, corkscrews across his cheeks, demonstrates the technique in his own 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"The gold should stay in the bottom, because it's seven times heavier than 
sand," he says, pushing eight small gold nuggets into sand heaped in a pan. 
</P>
<P>
He smoothes the surface, pauses like a runner waiting for the starter's gun, 
and thrusts the pan into the barrel. Much of the sand forms a cloud in the 
water. The rest, under pressure from Roberts' side-to-side motion, quickly 
slides out of the pan, revealing the gold nuggets nestled at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy, he says. "You've got as much chance as anybody of becoming a 
champion. It's 80% luck." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts is one of a growing number of amateur panners and prospectors who, 
equipped with pans, sluice boxes and shovels, head for the nation's streams and 
forests on weekends to search for gold and silver. "It's the fastest-growing 
hobby in America today," says Massie, whose Northern California-based 
organization has almost doubled its membership in three years to 76,000. 
</P>
<P>
California, site of the gold rush of 1849, is Mecca for weekend prospectors. 
Though there is no reliable count of those who participate, the state 
Department of Fish and Game expects to issue about 1,000 suction-dredging 
permits this year to people struck with gold fever, at $27.50 apiece. About 900 
permits were issued last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The dredgers are only about 10% of the people (prospecting)," says Massie. 
</P>
<P>
The East Fork of the San Gabriel River, in the Angeles National Forest, has 
always been one of the most popular gathering spots for gold panners. U.S. 
Forest Service officers say that on a busy weekend, there may be as many as 300 
panners between Follows Camp and Cattle Canyon Bridge, single-mindedly 
shoveling gravel and sticking their faces close to their pans to search for 
telltale glints. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, there are no restrictions," says Charles McDonald, 
environmental coordinator for the Angeles National Forest. "Unless they're 
bothering an archeological site or they're digging holes in an embankment that 
could fall in on somebody, we don't bother them." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who is a member of the Gold Panning Hall of Fame in Dahlonega, Ga., 
says he got the gold bug 23 years ago. A 29-year employee of Aerojet, he took 
his family on a company camping trip to Arizona, where the gold panning 
championship was being held. 
</P>
<P>
"I got into the contest myself and I didn't win," he says. "But I saw I had a 
chance to be a world champion. I told myself I'd do it in 10 years. It took me 
eight." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' son, Don, the current world record holder in the sport (he did it in 
7.55 seconds last year in Arizona), says his father, who was born in Iowa, was 
drawn implacably into the active outdoor life in his adopted state. 
</P>
<P>
"Being from back East -- at least, in our terms -- Dad came out here and, I 
guess, decided to try all of the California type of things," says Don Roberts, 
a Diamond Bar computer programmer. "He wanted to do everything that he imagined 
that people did in California." 
</P>
<P>
That included surfing, hiking, camping out and prospecting. 
</P>
<P>
Not satisfied to sift sand, Jack Roberts got out into Mother Lode country, 
dipped into streams and rivers in Idaho and Montana, haunted the East Fork. He 
found some nuggets, accumulated little jars of gold dust. 
</P>
<P>
"There's gold in every stream in California," Jack Roberts says. "Ninety 
percent of it is still up there. There's always the hope you'll hit something 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
Mostly he had fun. "It's probably the best family sport there is," he says. 
"Get a pan for five bucks and go out to any stream." 
</P>
<P>
Fun? It's a lot more like hard work, demurs Don Roberts. "Once you've tried it 
for a while, you find out why people don't become professional prospectors," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Picture yourself kneeling or squatting for hours on end, with your feet higher 
than your hands, with your hands stuck in freezing water. That'll give you an 
idea of what it's really like." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the whole Roberts family has tried it. Jack Roberts' wife, 
Beverly, has won a few trophies of her own, and his daughter-in-law, Stacey, 
Don's wife, placed third in this year's championships. Only daughter Cathy, a 
Hacienda Heights dental technician, has rejected the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Roberts drove up into San Gabriel Canyon the other day to his old East 
Fork stomping grounds, which he hadn't visited in more than 10 years. He 
carried a shovel and a gold pan -- a plastic device like a big pie pan with 
little ridges cut into it -- down to the river bank and picked out a spot. 
</P>
<P>
"The rocks form a natural riffle here," he said, digging into the stream bed 
near a row of rocks that formed stepping stones across the stream. In other 
words, the gravelly stuff rolling along the bottom of the stream tended to sort 
itself out there. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts filled a pan with dirt and stones, separated out the big stuff and 
sloshed the rest around in the pan. "The chances of finding a nugget here 
bigger than a quarter of an inch aren't very good," he said. "If you do, it'll 
shine out at you like a flashlight." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, there was an accumulation of fine black sand on one side of the pan. 
Roberts pulled out a pocket magnifying glass. "Holy Moses, there's a bunch of 
it in here," he said, squinting through the glass. "I may come up here again 
this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
There they were. Tiny specks -- "colors," Roberts called them -- glinting in 
the black. Impressive when magnified 10 times, but nothing to get excited 
about. "It'll take about 20,000 of those specks to make an ounce," Roberts 
said. "That's why I just do recreational prospecting."

UES MOVE CALLED AN EXCELLENT IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In my opinion, the move of University Elementary School to Ocean Park is an 
excellent idea. 
</P>
<P>
Our family has researched UES for our children to attend. The possibility of 
attending UES at its present location is slim to none, and the proposed move 
would bring UES to our neighborhood as a public school. This quality school 
could benefit many families like ours without the worry of financial burden. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed site is a superior location for the students, as well as the 
surrounding community. The present public school (John Muir) is located on a 
very busy intersection, and UES needs to be relocated from its current 
privileged isolated location into a neighborhood setting.

ELECTIONS MUNICIPAL COURT; 
</P>
<P>
RENT CONTROL IS NOW AN ISSUE EVEN IN WHAT IS USUALLY A LOW-KEY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Santa Monica politics, there's no escaping rent control. It has emerged as a 
central issue even in next week's contest for Municipal Court judge, usually 
the most low-key of all elections. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will be expected to decide landlord-tenant disputes that may appear 
before the court, and all four candidates in the June 5 primary say they would 
be objective in such matters. But the outcome of the race to succeed retiring 
Judge Joseph P. Chandler may be determined by the candidates' association with 
various factions of the rent control debate. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights, the tenants group whose candidates control 
both the City Council and the city Rent Control Board, has endorsed City 
Councilman David B. Finkel, a labor attorney, for judge. 
</P>
<P>
Action, a local landlords group, has not formally endorsed West Los Angeles 
Court Commissioner Norman Perry Tarle, but many members of the group are 
supporting him. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate, Sonya Bekoff Molho, is a tenants' attorney who co-founded 
the Tenants Organizing Project, a legal aid program for tenants, under the 
aegis of Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth candidate, Santa Monica Community College Board Trustee James M. 
Bambrick, a civil litigator, says he has no connection with either the 
landlords' or the tenants' group, which may also be an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
All four candidates have been rated "well qualified" by the Los Angeles County 
Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Though the office is a nonpartisan one, the June 5 election is still considered 
a primary, because unless one of the four candidates wins a majority of the 
votes, there will be a runoff in November between the two top vote-getters. 
</P>
<P>
None of the candidates have attacked each other publicly or in their 
literature. In separate interviews, they were reluctant to say anything, 
negative or positive, about their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
But all the candidates acknowledged that, regardless of whether it is 
appropriate or relevant, rent control may decide the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
All four candidates say that while walking precincts they have been asked their 
opinions on rent control and other city issues that have nothing to do with the 
judiciary or are inappropriate to discuss because the matter may appear before 
them in court. 
</P>
<P>
But it is unclear which side, if any, of the rent control debate will provide 
the advantage. Both sides are in the midst of proposing changes to the law that 
would allow rents to increase. Landlords are promoting a ballot initiative that 
would allow rents to increase to market levels on voluntary vacancies. Some 
tenant advocates are advocating a ballot initiative that would allow rents to 
increase to specific higher levels upon voluntary vacancies, but would not 
allow the full decontrol of vacated units that landlords say is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants make up 80% of the city's population and generally control local 
elections. But because landlords have taken more than 1,000 rental units off 
the housing market in the last four years under provisions of the state Ellis 
Act, there is a growing belief that tenants are starting to fear the loss of 
their apartments and may be ready to shift their allegiance. The 1986 Ellis Act 
allows landlords to evict tenants and go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers suggest that residents may be growing weary of the rent control 
battle and are ready to support someone who is not associated with either side. 
</P>
<P>
But Bambrick, the nonaligned candidate, is not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"When you walk both sides of the street, you're likely to get hit by a bus," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A Municipal Court judge, who serves a six-year term at an annual salary of 
$86,157, deals with civil matters involving less than $25,000, and misdemeanor 
criminal matters with maximum penalties of a year or less in jail. Most 
criminal matters deal with traffic, landlord-tenant disputes or misdemeanor 
drunk driving. Municipal judges also preside at Small Claims Court. 
</P>
<P>
Following are brief backgrounds on each of the candidates, in the same order as 
on the ballot: 
</P>
<P>
* James M. Bambrick, 50, has lived in Santa Monica since the age of 2 and 
graduated from St. Monica's High School. He is married and the father of four 
children ages 14 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
He is endorsed by Chandler, 73, who is giving up his seat on the bench after 20 
years, as well as several other judges, including Beverly Hills Municipal Court 
Judge Judith O. Stein. He also has the endorsements of Los Angeles County 
Supervisors Deane Dana and Mike Antonovich, state Sen. Robert G. Beverly 
(R-Manhattan Beach), Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) and U.S. Rep. Mervyn 
M. Dymally (D-Compton), among others. 
</P>
<P>
Bambrick is in his third term as a trustee of Santa Monica City College. He 
served as a member of the Board of Education of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified 
School District from 1979 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
He is managing partner of the firm Richardson &amp; Bambrick and says he has 
tried more than 50 civil jury trials. 
</P>
<P>
* David B. Finkel, 58, has lived in Santa Monica since 1963. He is married and 
is the father of four children ages 24 to 32. 
</P>
<P>
Finkel is considered the front-runner in the race by the other candidates 
because of his high name recognition as a city councilman. Finkel says that has 
also worked to his disadvantage, because voters often want to discuss city 
issues when he is precinct-walking rather than his qualifications for judge. 
</P>
<P>
He is endorsed by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), Santa Monica Mayor 
Dennis Zane, Santa Monica City Atty. Robert Myers, the Santa Monica Democratic 
Club and several former and current members of the city Rent Control Board, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
Finkel was appointed to the rent control board in 1981, and elected to a full 
four-year term in 1983. In 1986, he was elected to the City Council, and serves 
as mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
He has been an attorney for 30 years, mostly as a labor and civil litigator in 
private practice. He is the only one of the four candidates to have his ballot 
statement printed in Spanish as well as English. 
</P>
<P>
* Sonya Bekoff Molho, 43, has lived in Mar Vista, next to Santa Monica, with 
her husband since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Molho, who is endorsed by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and rent 
board members Susan Packer Davis and Wayne Bauer, makes a point in her campaign 
that she would be the first woman judge on the Santa Monica Municipal Court. 
She said a woman judge would help ensure fairness of penalties in abuse, child 
support and custody cases. 
</P>
<P>
Molho, a tenant defense attorney for 12 years, says she has tried more than 500 
cases and is best-known for her victory last year in Minelian vs. Manzella. The 
case established the right of tenants to withhold rent to recover previous 
overcharges. 
</P>
<P>
* Norman Perry Tarle, 39, has lived in Santa Monica since 1974. He is married 
and has three children ages 4 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
He is endorsed by Santa Monica City Councilman Herb Katz, U.S. Rep. Henry A. 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles), Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman and 54 
Superior and Municipal Court judges and commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Tarle, a past president of the Bay Cities Jewish Community Center, was 
appointed a court commissioner in West Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1985, a 
job that entails duties similar to those of a Municipal Court judge. He was a 
Los Angeles deputy city attorney from 1979 to 1985.

PEOPLE: LONGTIME GUARD SETTLES IN AS BOSS OF THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a lot of the older Los Angeles County lifeguards, Don Rohrer says he 
started his job in the 1950s thinking it would be an enjoyable way to work his 
way through college so he could become a schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
But after graduating from Cal State Los Angeles and substituting at high 
schools in the South Bay and San Fernando Valley, he felt the tug of sand and 
sea and returned to lifeguarding. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed the ocean," said Rohrer, who was born in Venice and grew up in Playa 
del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
And he's remained at the shore ever since. He was recently appointed chief 
lifeguard for the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors. 
</P>
<P>
He got his first job as a beach lifeguard in 1953 while a student at El Segundo 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a dream come true," said Rohrer, 53. 
</P>
<P>
The college-age lifeguard applicants he meets today are not likely to be as 
concerned with paying for school because many are already competitive swimmers 
or water polo players on scholarships, but they share much of the same love for 
the ocean and swimming as lifeguards of three decades ago, Rohrer said. 
</P>
<P>
The similarities end there, he said with a chuckle, and compared the situation 
to that of professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids today are faster and probably smarter too," said Rohrer, whose oldest 
son, Jeff, was a linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys. "The competition is 
unbelievable. Not only are they great swimmers, but they're also (academically) 
the finest kids in school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you, if you can get the grades and work out in the pool for four or 
five hours a day, you have to be a pretty special human being," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrer, who lives in Manhattan Beach, assumed his new post April 1 and said 
he's slowly getting used to the added responsibilities, which include 
supervision of 108 permanent lifeguards, 580 summer lifeguards and more than 32 
miles of coastline. 
</P>
<P>
One thing he doesn't like about the new position is the amount of time he's 
forced to spend indoors at his Venice Beach headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I get out there (on the beach), but not as much as I'd like to," he said. 
"Fortunately, I live four blocks from the beach, and on my days off . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Chester A. Widom was once renowned as a gifted 22-year-old architect. In fact, 
in 1962 he was the youngest licensed architect in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, the founding partner of Santa Monica-based Widom Wein Cohen will be 
officially recognized as a gifted 50-year-old architect when he and 61 other 
architects, including three others from the Los Angeles area, are invested in 
the American Institute of Architects' College of Fellows, the group's highest 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
Venice High School teachers Laura M. Monroe and Beverly Findlay should have 
some interesting stories to tell about what they did on their summer vacations. 
</P>
<P>
They are among 105 foreign-language teachers chosen as 1990 Rockefeller Fellows 
and given $5,000 to spend on intensive study this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe will fly to Mexico City and Guadalajara to study the murals of Clemente 
Orozco, Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siquerios and how they reflect the 
social, political and religious life of the Mexican people. 
</P>
<P>
Findlay will spend her summer in Yokohama, Japan, to study with Japanese 
teachers and produce audiovisual lessons focusing on Japanese teen-age life and 
the annual summer obon festivals, a celebration honoring ancestral spirits. 
</P>
<P>
Two Culver City bus drivers accomplished the highly improbable by scoring 
exactly the same number of points, 2,392 out of 2,400, to tie for the top score 
in the Culver City Municipal Bus Lines 1989 Driver of the Year competition. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Clay, 52, and Earnest James, 60, were named co-winners for scores based 
on their promptness, safety record and attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"To score 2,392 out of 2,400 is phenomenal," said Deputy Transportation 
Director Steve Cunningham, explaining that one verified customer complaint 
would take 10 points off a score and being late for work one day would cost 15 
points. "And to tie is almost unbelievable. I mean, we tried to set it up so it 
would be very difficult to tie." 
</P>
<P>
For their performances, the highest point totals in the four years the contest 
has been held, the Bus Drivers of the Year will receive plaques, a commendation 
from the City Council and three days off with pay, said Transportation Director 
David Ashcraft. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount University sophomore Gary S. Brown will be in Independence, 
Mo., on June 3 to accept his award as a 1990 Truman Scholar. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a political science and economics major, is one of 92 college students 
to receive four-year, $28,000 scholarships from the Harry S. Truman Scholarship 
Foundation. The awards are based on potential for leadership in government and 
public service. 
</P>
<P>
The Westchester resident, son of Robert K. and Jennie Brown, said that after 
graduating from law school he plans work "as a legislative aide in Congress or 
a politician on the local level."

HOT PROPERTY: 'KING'S' QUEEN SELLING GETAWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISCILLA PRESLEY has put her Montecito home on the market at $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
She bought the wooded, 2-acre property, with a Country French house on it, in 
1981, eight years after she divorced rock 'n' roll king Elvis and four years 
after he died. 
</P>
<P>
Although she has owned the property for several years, Presley rarely went 
there, said Linda Fareed, who has the listing through Alexander Velto Real 
Estate, a Fred Sands company. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been so busy on 'Dallas' and doing other things," Fareed explained. 
</P>
<P>
Presley launched "Moments," her own line of perfume, in late March. She is 
co-executive producer of ABC-TV's "Elvis" series, which premiered in February 
and was just canceled. She starred as Jenna Wade during the 1987-88 season of 
CBS-TV's "Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
She has also been busy with her son, born in 1987, and her granddaughter, born 
last June to Elvis's daughter, 22-year-old Lisa Marie. 
</P>
<P>
Presley is known to be looking for a vacation home in the San Bernardino 
Mountains, where the children can experience snow and winter. Her main 
residence is in the Beverly Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
Her Montecito home was built in 1964 in what is known as the "Golden 
Quadrangle," the most exclusive part of the community. 
</P>
<P>
The main house has three bedrooms and three baths in about 2,600 square feet. 
It also has a barn that was converted into a guest cottage with a large stone 
fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
DAVID GEFFEN'S $47.5-million cash deal for late movie mogul JACK L. WARNER'S 
Beverly Hills estate has closed escrow, making it the highest price known to 
have been paid for a private home in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen also acquired all the furnishings in the purchase price, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's had a dozen or so staffers ticketing the porcelains, antique 
furniture and Impressionist paintings for an auction when Geffen, who sold his 
record company earlier this year for $545 million in MCA stock, decided to buy 
everything, the sources explained. That included a portrait by Salvador Dali of 
Warner's wife, Ann. 
</P>
<P>
The home, designed in the '30s by architect Roland Coate, has a room with wood 
paneling that was hand-carved by a son of Chippendale and a floor taken from a 
palace in France on which Napoleon proposed to Josephine, sources added. 
</P>
<P>
The main house has five bedrooms, a card room and a 50-foot-long bar in 15,000 
to 17,000 square feet, and there is a separate house with seven to 10 bedrooms 
for the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not a big mansion by today's standards," a local broker remarked. 
"The bathrooms and closets are minuscule, and the upstairs of the main house is 
completely inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Geffen got a good buy, the broker said, largely because of the 9-acre 
grounds, which have a pool, large lawn where there was a four- or five-hole 
golf course; a 300-foot long, 200-foot-wide entry lined with trees; a 
waterfall, fern gardens and an esplanade of statues, fountains and greenery. 
"It looks like Versailles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A $3.5-million Beverly Hills house also owned by Geffen and described as 
"David's tear-down" was on a brokers' caravan last week of seven houses valued 
at a total of $54.7 million. Jana Jones of Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young arranged 
the tour. 
</P>
<P>
PRINCESS MARIA CHRISTINE, half-sister of King Baudouin of Belgium, and her 
husband, Jean Paul Gourguesm, have opened a restaurant in Dana Point known as 
Napoleon, featuring French cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small, chic restaurant -- one-story with a gazebo," said Pat Hug, who 
handled the lease with Linda Taglianetti of George Elkins Co. -- Newport. The 
restaurant, which seats 65, was completely redecorated in what Taglianetti 
described as "a Napoleon theme, with everything in blue and gold." 
</P>
<P>
The princess moved to Orange County about a year ago and married Gourguesm 
earlier this year. The newlyweds have been leasing a home in San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Gourguesm was formerly in the restaurant business in Toronto, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
JOSEPH SIROLA, who co-starred on the recently canceled CBS series "Wolf" and 
has made a career of doing voice-overs in commercials for national advertisers, 
has sold 648 acres in the Yucca Valley to an investment syndicate from Des 
Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The New York City-based actor, who has a posh co-op in Manhattan and a bachelor 
pad in Brentwood, bought the acreage in 1980 for less than half a million 
dollars. He sold it for $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
A Bel-Air home built in 1966 by car dealer FLETCHER JONES and later owned by 
Sylmar pacemaker manufacturer Alfred E. Mann is on the market for $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 11,000-square-foot residence, with a pool and tennis court, was built on 
the 4-acre site of a home that burned to the ground during the 1961 Bel-Air 
fire. That home was owned, at the time, by the late JUSTIN DART, an adviser to 
President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The house built by Jones, on one of the highest peaks in Bel-Air, has been the 
home for nearly 10 years of German industrialist Carl E. Press, who owns radio 
stations and vineyards in West Germany and prawn and alligator farms in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"His son graduated a year ago from (nearby) Harvard School, and now Mr. Press 
is only spending four to six weeks out of the year here, so he's selling," 
explained Cecelia Waeschle, who shares the listing with Joyce Rey at 
Rodeo/Prudential Realty.

AT HOME: WHERE HOMES, MONEY TEND TO BE OLD; 
</P>

LOS FELIZ: NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED IN THE LIFESTYLE OF THIS PART OF LOS ANGELES, 
WHERE THE SUCCESSFUL HAVE LIVED FOR GENERATIONS.

<P>
Overhead, the trees on North Vermont Avenue in the Los Feliz area of Los 
Angeles form crowns that spread 70 feet or more, a graceful dapple of oval 
leaves, glossy green on top and bronze underneath. 
</P>
<P>
The bark of these 60-year-old Moreton Bay fig trees is light-gray and smooth, 
except where the stout trunks branch out into boughs. Then it is as creased as 
an elephant's knee. And the roots -- ah, the roots. The elephant melts, flows 
in every direction in foot-high ridges along the ground for 20 feet in some 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
This is Los Feliz, after all. It's a neighborhood that shows its roots. 
</P>
<P>
"This area, of any in L.A., probably has the highest rate of homes that have 
been in one family since the '20s," says real estate agent Dorothy Carter of 
Jon Douglas Co. And, she says, "There are a tremendous amount of people who 
sell in Los Feliz who buy in Los Feliz." 
</P>
<P>
Situated on the southern slopes of Griffith Park, near freeways and 15 minutes 
by car from downtown, Los Feliz represents to Los Angeles what Gramercy Park 
does to New York or Nob Hill to San Francisco. Los Feliz mansions suggest old 
money, good cloth coat, not fur money, their elegance so understated it's a 
murmur. 
</P>
<P>
In the nearby shopping areas, the Los Feliz Theater on Vermont shows art films 
next to the well-known Chatterton's Bookshop; down the block, patrons of 
Sarno's sing operatic arias between courses. Homeowners above Los Feliz 
Boulevard are likely to include the Music Center when pointing out features of 
their vast views. 
</P>
<P>
And apartment-dwellers below the boulevard take pleasure in the greenery of the 
largest metropolitan park in the nation. Whereas the Hollywood Hills show the 
quaint and glamorous Hollywood sign, the Los Feliz Hills bear the serene, 
classic lines of the white triple-domed Observatory and Planetarium. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Los Feliz is less homogenous than those neighborhoods: The nearby shops 
cater to customers speaking a variety of languages. And though the median price 
of Los Feliz homes is approaching $500,000 now, it remains un-yuppified, a 
family place. 
</P>
<P>
Says resident Nina Mohi -- she and her son both went to the local high school, 
John Marshall High, "It's a great place to raise children because if they're 
rich, the kids don't know they're rich, and if they're poor, that's not so bad, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
A century ago, the land belonged to Col. Griffith Jenkins Griffith, and two 
centuries ago, to Cpl. Vicente Feliz, and before that, to the Cahuenga Indians, 
who used part of Ferndell in Griffith Park for their council grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Feliz, as founder of the Pueblo de Los Angeles and its first commissioner, was 
granted 6,677 acres in 1794. Like the homeowners who succeeded them, the 
Felizes tried to keep the land in the family. They held on to their El Rancho 
de Los Feliz (in Spanish, the plural of a family name is the same as the 
singular) until 1863. 
</P>
<P>
Several owners later, Griffith bought the land in 1884 and deeded 3,015 acres 
of it to the city, which added another 1,000 acres to establish Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, elegant but unostentatious mansions, often in Spanish or English 
style, were built on the gentle slope above Franklin Avenue. Luminaries such as 
Cecil B. DeMille, W. C. Fields and Deanna Durbin arrived. There were more 
physicians than you could shake a crutch at -- it became known as Pill Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Master architects found a market in Los Feliz for their innovative work. Frank 
Lloyd Wright did three houses; his son, Lloyd Wright, many more. Richard 
Neutra, R. M. Schindler, Gregory Ain and John Lautner designed dozens. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Lehrer, a Los Feliz architect and USC professor, calls the homes in Los 
Feliz "the absolute architectural gems of the city." A good architect "reads 
the hills," he says, and except for one tract built in the 1960s on the former 
Los Feliz Estates, the houses "tend to be fitted into the landscape." The 
result is "a European or Italianate look," Lehrer says. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the deodars planted on Los Feliz Boulevard in 1916 are still there, 
waving their feathery fir boughs in the breeze. And many of the old families 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bullock and her husband, a physician, bought their home for $12,000 in 
1939. She says the neighborhood, in appearance, "was much the same as it is 
now." 
</P>
<P>
The old homes draw the newcomers. According to Gary R. Holme, president of the 
Los Angeles Board of Realtors, Los Feliz was the hot spot for home sales in 
March, leading every other area in the city: Twenty-six houses sold for an 
average price of $479,600, he says. In April the average was down slightly to 
$468,993. 
</P>
<P>
Los Feliz resident Philip Homsey, an attorney who stepped down last week as 
president of the Los Feliz Improvement Assn., grew up in Sacramento. On a 
family trip in the early '60s, he saw Los Feliz Boulevard for the first time 
and remembers thinking, "One day I'm gonna live in one of these homes." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from law school in 1976, he and his wife "toured all around 
the city," he says, looking for an apartment. And then he had the kind of deja 
vu experience that keeps real estate brokers from going broke. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw Los Feliz," he recalls, "I thought, 'This is the place!' . . . I 
just want to keep moving up the hill a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
They rented at Franklin and Normandie avenues, then on Los Feliz Boulevard, and 
in 1981, bought a two-bedroom house above the boulevard for $187,500. And "I 
was probably the only person in Los Angeles who lost money in real estate," he 
says with a laugh. He put a few thousand dollars into the property but couldn't 
unload it. In 1985, he bought a Spanish-style three-bedroom repossession nearby 
for $430,000, and in 1986 the other property sold for only $190,000. But the 
Homseys recouped. Their present house is now "probably worth a million-three to 
a million-five," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Homsey is the third owner of this house, and "most of my neighbors are the 
second owners," he says. He adds, "It's as far up the hill as I want to go." 
</P>
<P>
The elegant old homes still act as magnets. Real estate agent Jodi Hodges of 
Jon Douglas Co. says her customers specify: "I don't want a new home." What she 
calls the "large, character homes" cost far more in Bel-Air and in Hancock Park 
don't have the view, she says. In Los Feliz, realtors, homeowners and house 
hunters use the word character as often as a dramaturge. 
</P>
<P>
As real estate agent Lee Doumitt of Castagna Realty explains, "if you woke up 
in Los Feliz and you'd been sleeping 20 years, you'd know you're in Los Feliz." 
</P>
<P>
"And in the last few years," Hodges says, "there's a new attitude: A lot of 
people like to fix homes up." 
</P>
<P>
In search of a fixer-upper "with character" and viewing a house on Los Feliz 
Boulevard that's on the market for $750,000, interior designer Philip Osterloh, 
who lives in Sherman Oaks, mentions an additional attraction: 
</P>
<P>
"There is a mixture of people here; in Sherman Oaks, everybody is similar. . . 
. And it still seems safe here. You don't see a lot of bars on the windows." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "crime is down a little bit" in Los Feliz, according to Paul Afdahl, 
senior lead officer at the Police Department's Northeast Division. Robberies 
and thefts of cars or from them are all down, although 70% of the crime in Los 
Feliz is still vehicle-related, he says. 
</P>
<P>
There is occasional gang activity in Griffith Park or around Marshall High 
"during school hours or immediately after," Afdahl says. 
</P>
<P>
Two screenwriters in search of a character -- a character home, in this case -- 
moved from New York to a house above Franklin Avenue six months ago. Keith and 
Peggy Walker -- she also acts -- paid "in the sixes," he says, meaning above 
$600,000. They bought it sight unseen, except for a video, and are jubilant 
about the house and the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Walkers are walkers. Says Peggy: "We walk everywhere -- to the cleaners, to 
the marketplace. . . ." Their immediate neighborhood, she says, "is the first 
place I've ever moved to that people acted like neighbors, like they used to in 
Alabama" when she was a child. "This is more like down South," she says. "More 
like home. It's gentler." 
</P>
<P>
"Here in Los Feliz, there's a kind of camaraderie," Keith says. "We know and 
say hello to almost everyone on the street. . . . And it's not just a WASP 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
The cosmopolitan nature of Los Feliz is as old as its history. Barbara Bullock 
came from Bakersfield and met her physician husband at Stanford. Architect 
Lehrer, who is Jewish, went to local schools and lives just south of Los Feliz 
Boulevard, within a mile of all his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall High alumna Nina Mohi, whose parents were both born in Italy, was one 
of the people instrumental in preventing the school's Gothic architecture from 
being sacrificed in the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
Josephine Nicola, of Lebanese heritage, arrived as a doctor's bride 40 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Serop Israelian, proprietor of Universal Shop, a fabric store on Vermont Avenue 
just below Franklin, has been in the same location almost 19 years. Soft-spoken 
and genial, he says, "I am Armenian from Romania. . . . I speak Romanian, 
Armenian, Turkish." His smile broadens as he adds, "a little English." He also 
speaks "a little Spanish, regarding the business." 
</P>
<P>
Asians have always lived in the neighborhood; the Latino population has grown 
larger over the years, and more Armenians are from the Soviet Union now. 
</P>
<P>
Opinions on the schools serving Los Feliz appear mixed. Marshall High won the 
1986-87 U.S. Academic Decathlon. Students at Thomas Starr King Junior High last 
year scored below the state averages; at the elementary schools, Los Feliz 
school scored below, and Franklin school scored above. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problems facing Los Feliz residents these days is the traffic on 
Los Feliz Boulevard, Homsey says. Griffith Park presents advantages -- "you can 
walk to the Greek Theatre at night" -- and disadvantages: "the traffic it 
brings, the crime it brings, the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
As president of the improvement association, he supports plans to upgrade the 
nearby shopping areas on Vermont and Hillhurst avenues below Franklin, seeing 
the need for "a fine stationery store, a hardware store, . . . more delis and 
some planters" and bemoaning the fact that "the awnings on some of those shops 
look like they've been there since the '30s." 
</P>
<P>
Not all Los Feliz residents favor the projected improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"I like a lot of it the way it is," Peggy Walker says. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh gee, yeah," Keith adds. "Homey, old-fashioned, comfortable." 
</P>

SAM HALL KAPLAN: A SLEEK LOOK DOESN'T MEAN IT WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The German design exhibit at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood now 
through June 23 raises issues that go beyond that engaging display to the 
continuing debate of how we shape the world around us. 
</P>
<P>
The objects displayed -- a coffee maker, door handles, electrical connections 
and lighting systems, as well as a train compartment, airplane models and a 
Mercedes-Benz car -- remind us of the distinguishing German design 
characteristic of a commitment to making things functional. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there is style, such as the simple lines and detailing of the 
Rowenta coffee maker, the FSB door handle grips or the Mercedes hood. But the 
style evolved from the object's function. It is not decoration prompted by some 
current fad, fashion or consumer profile survey. 
</P>
<P>
We are talking here of design in its broadest definition, beyond just a 
particular plan or a rational form to satisfy a function, but an expression of 
that function. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, design is concerned with how things work and look, with the look, 
or more precisely the styling, a secondary consideration. 
</P>
<P>
This reaffirmation of the historical concept of design comes at a critical and 
controversial time for the profession, which includes architects and furniture 
makers as well as interior, industrial, graphic and environmental designers, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly over the last decade, design considerations have yielded more and 
more to market considerations and the pressure to be trendy, with how things 
look too often taking precedent over how things work. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been pricey tea kettles that make bold stylistic statements but 
are awkward to handle; graphics that catch your eye but which you can't 
decipher, and restaurants where, because the wall and ceiling materials were 
selected for their visual not acoustical qualities, you can't hear the person 
sitting across from you. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the buildings that imaginatively juxtapose shapes, but as a 
result create contorted interior spaces and roofs that leak; furniture that is 
an engaging riot of colors and materials but nearly unusable, and subdivisions 
that behind their lushly landscaped and ornamented gateways are an 
insensitively planned clutter of ticky-tacky houses. 
</P>
<P>
While design demands constant experimentation, be it intuitive, cognitive or 
whatever, the ultimate use and user of the resulting object must remain 
paramount. Otherwise, the object becomes a personal expression, and should be 
considered art, and be valued and judged as such. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there is nothing wrong with placing the label of art on a stylized 
tea kettle or a deconstructive cluster of spaces forming a house, or an office 
tower tattooed with historical architectural allegories. 
</P>
<P>
Such a label may lend the objects value, however transitory, while promoting 
the architect, attracting tourists, reassuring the client and feeding the 
scholars, editors and critics forever in search of new design waves to ride. 
</P>
<P>
But this does not necessarily make the designs great or good. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how many times a building might appear on the cover of a magazine or 
how many awards it may win, if it is poorly designed it will continue to 
frustrate its users. 
</P>
<P>
That the building might have involved some innovative use of materials or 
construction methods offers little solace when the roof leaks every time it 
rains, you can't reach the windows to open them or you hear every sound a guest 
makes down a hall. 
</P>
<P>
The same can be said for a designer tea kettle that, despite its honors and 
sales, continues to drip hot water down the outside of the spout onto the table 
or someone's hand every time you try to pour its contents into a cup. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, an example of the distortion of the purpose of a design to create a 
look is the PDC's own Murray Feldman Gallery, where some elements of the German 
Design exhibit are on display. The bulk of the exhibit happily is in the wide 
lower hallway of the center's so-called Green Building. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story gallery, designed by Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates, sits like a 
bloated mausoleum on the western edge of a bland, 2-acre plaza formed by the 
glistening cobalt-blue, glass-clad center and its emerald-green glass addition. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not the unprepossessing style of the gallery, but the spaces 
within it. There is no sense of entry, the stairs are awkward, the lighting 
poor, the ground floor nearly useless and the upper floor poorly shaped and 
scaled to display any variety of art and design objects other than perhaps a 
single towering sculptural work. 
</P>
<P>
The contrast between the functional German designs and the inefficient gallery 
is striking. For a gallery that is used primarily for design exhibits in 
conjunction with a design center that is the focus of a prominent design 
community one would have expected more. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in this city, where design is not a priority, you take what you can get 
and hope that eventually things will improve. I like to think they will. 
</P>
<P>
After all, we are the sum of our designs. 
</P>
<P>
Be it a wine glass, a coffee maker, a car, a living room, a restaurant, a 
building, a streetscape, a park or a city, the designs we construct, covet or 
choose to experience tend to reflect our values and those of our society. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, design is the mark of civilization, and as such demands our attention.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: BUYERS OF NEW HOME ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THE BUILDER'S 
INEXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We are considering buying a new home. It was built by a new builder 
who told us this is only the third home he has constructed. We noticed several 
defects the builder promises to correct if we buy. But I am concerned there may 
be more serious defects that will appear after the purchase. The builder says 
he will give us a 10-year warranty, but I am concerned as to what recourse we 
have if the builder goes broke? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You raise an excellent question, to which there is no satisfactory 
answer. Even many experienced builders now form separate corporations for each 
subdivision, and then they fold that corporation when the project is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that if construction defects develop there is no builder to sue 
unless you can "pierce the corporate veil" and sue the individual contractor if 
you can find him. 
</P>
<P>
The best home builders provide 10-year warranty policies from independent 
third-party warranty companies such as the well-known HOW (Home Owner's 
Warranty) Corp. 
</P>
<P>
If the builder can't correct any home defects, then HOW steps in to make the 
necessary repairs. This is your best protection, but not all builders qualify 
for such policies. Ask your real estate attorney to explain further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Include a Financing Clause in Your Offer 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I want to buy a home as soon as we save up a down payment. We 
read your column every week and have learned much about real estate and buying 
a home. I hope we don't make the mistakes other people write about to you. My 
question is how can we be sure we can get the mortgage we will need to finance 
our home purchase? 
</P>
<P>
A: When buying a home, be sure to include a financing contingency clause in 
your purchase offer. If for some reason you are not able to obtain the mortgage 
you need, then you can get your earnest money deposit refunded. 
</P>
<P>
For example, such a finance contingency clause might read: "This purchase offer 
is contingent on buyers and property qualifying for a new 30-year first 
mortgage of at least $100,000 with a fixed interest rate not to exceed 10.5%, 
loan fee not more than 2 points and a monthly payment not more than $914.74." 
</P>
<P>
Before you go shopping for a home, you may want to prequalify for a mortgage at 
a local bank or S &amp; L, subject to appraisal of the home you select. Most 
lenders welcome prospective borrowers to prequalify because they know these 
buyers are likely to come back to that lender to obtain their home loan. 
</P>
<P>
By prequalifying you will then know the maximum mortgage you can obtain and how 
much down payment and seller financing you will need. However, just because you 
prequalify with one lender, don't stop shopping among other lenders to be sure 
you got the best loan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offer May Not Stand Unless All Owners Sign 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are selling our home. The realty agent brought us an offer by another 
agent. It is a pretty good offer, but it is signed only by the wife. The agent 
says the husband is on a long overseas trip and won't be back until next month. 
The wife seems very nice and says her husband will like our home. But this 
seems risky. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you accept that offer, I think you have a very shaky sale without the 
absent husband's signature on the purchase contract. Watch out. This may be a 
ploy to renegotiate the sale when the husband returns. Please consult your 
attorney for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Agent Disclose Second, Better Offer? 
</P>
<P>
Q: We listed our home for sale with a real estate agent who works in a large 
brokerage office of about 50 salespeople. After holding an open house last 
Sunday, on Monday evening, she presented us with a pretty good purchase offer 
from a buyer she met on Sunday. Since this was the first offer we received in 
the two months our home was listed, we were pleased. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning she phoned to tell us another agent in her office has a 
"back up" offer. Our agent delivered the second offer to us on Tuesday evening. 
It was much better than the first offer, which we already had accepted. But the 
date on the second offer was Monday. When we questioned the agent, she claimed 
she didn't know about the offer on Monday evening when she presented her offer, 
which is about $5,500 lower. I can't understand why our agent didn't know about 
the second offer on Monday, can you? Should we do anything about it? 
</P>
<P>
A: A real estate agent has a duty to present all offers to the property seller. 
Based on the facts you reported, it appears your listing agent either should 
have known about the second and better offer or she made herself unavailable 
until her lower offer could be presented to you. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest you arrange a conference with the brokerage's manager and the 
salespeople to resolve this problem. Perhaps the company should pay you the 
$5,500 lost profit. If you are not satisfied with the outcome, you may want to 
report the matter to the state real estate commissioner for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should a Discount Broker Be Retained? 
</P>
<P>
Q: About six months ago, my neighbor listed her home for sale with one of those 
discount real estate brokers. If they sold her home, she would only have to pay 
a $3,900 commission and they would help her with all the details and paper 
work. 
</P>
<P>
But she was very disappointed. She knew she would have to hold the weekend open 
houses, but the discount broker gave her virtually no help other than a few 
newspaper ads. Within two months she canceled the listing and signed up with a 
regular agent who sold her home within a month. 
</P>
<P>
I am getting ready to sell my home and wonder what you think about the discount 
real estate brokers? 
</P>
<P>
A: Before signing a listing with one of the so-called discount brokers, please 
investigate very carefully. Just as you should with a full-service broker, ask 
for references of previous sellers and phone them to inquire: "Were you in any 
way unhappy with your agent and would you list another home for sale with the 
same agent?" 
</P>
<P>
In my area, I watch the "For Sale" signs of the discount brokers very 
carefully. They are often up for many months. Frequently they are replaced by a 
for sale sign of a full-service broker who usually sells the home. Rarely do I 
see a "Sold" sign added to the discount broker's sign. 
</P>
<P>
While my informal survey is not scientific, I doubt that I would list my 
property with a discount broker unless I see more evidence of sales success. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Age No Handicap for Becoming Agent 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am 19 and will soon complete my freshman year in college. I hate college. 
My dad is a very successful realtor, and I have sold homes for his company 
since I got my sales license when I became 18. I earned over $18,000 in net 
sales commissions last summer before I went to college. I want to quit college 
and go full time into real estate sales, but my dad refuses to let me work for 
his company. He says I am too young. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. I've never met a person who is too young or too old to sell real estate. 
But I agree with your dad that you should get your college degree before 
entering real estate sales on a full-time basis. If you quit college you 
probably won't want to go back to complete your education. 
</P>
<P>
If you are not already majoring in real estate, perhaps you can transfer to a 
college which offers such a major. 
</P>
<P>
That might be the motivation you need to stay in college to take advantage of 
the opportunity your father wants to give you. Of course, you can sell real 
estate in the summers to get the practical knowledge to go along with what you 
learn in college. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Idea for Selecting the Right Salesperson 
</P>
<P>
Q: I retired from real estate sales about 10 years ago, and have spent full 
time on realty investing since then. The reason I am writing is to alert you to 
a technique I learned the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
Like you, I list my properties for sale with a realtor. When I was choosing the 
wrong agents, I stumbled on an idea that corrected my error. Before listing a 
property with an agent, I ask them for a list of their last 20 properties in 
which they were the listing or selling agent and the names and phones of their 
client. 
</P>
<P>
After phoning these people to ask questions about the agent and the quality of 
their services, I quickly learn if I should do business with that agent. Have 
you ever tried this technique? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, but that's a great idea. Many thanks for sharing it. As you know, I 
recommend home sellers ask each prospective listing agent for at least three 
references of previous sellers to phone and inquire "Were you in any way 
unhappy with your agent and would you list your home for sale with this agent 
again?" 
</P>
<P>
But I like your idea better. However, now you just got me in trouble with the 
novice agents who don't have 20 transactions yet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoiding Tax on Sale of Duplex Not Easy 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are considering selling our two-family duplex where we live in one 
apartment and rent the other to tenants. Since we have owned this building for 
many years we have a handsome profit. 
</P>
<P>
But we are receiving conflicting advice on how to avoid tax on the sale. Can we 
use that "roll-over residence rule" if we buy a single-family house? 
</P>
<P>
A: Avoiding the tax on the sale of the duplex won't be easy. For income tax 
purposes you are really selling two properties. One is the sale of your 
principal residence. The other is the sale of the rental unit. 
</P>
<P>
To defer the tax on the profit from the sale of your personal residence unit, 
within 24 months before or after the sale you must buy a replacement principal 
residence costing at least as much as the adjusted (net) sales price of only 
your personal apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if you are 55 or older, have owned and lived in your residence three 
of the five years before the sale and never used this tax break before, you can 
use the $125,000 home sale tax exemption on the profit from the sale of your 
personal residence unit (but not the profit from the rental unit). 
</P>
<P>
Or you can move out of your personal residence apartment and rent it to 
tenants, thereby making it eligible for a "like kind" tax-deferred exchange of 
property held for investment or use in a trade or business. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid tax on the profit from the sale of the rental unit you will need to 
make a tax-deferred exchange, as authorized by Internal Revenue Code 1031. 
</P>
<P>
Your situation is ideal for an IRC 1031(a)(3) Starker delayed exchange, so you 
can sell the rental apartment, have the sale proceeds held by a third-party 
facilitator, designate another "like kind" property to acquire within 45 days, 
and complete the acquisition within 180 days. For further details, please 
consult your tax adviser.

SCHOOL AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am appalled at the inaccuracies of many of the statements Sam Hall Kaplan has 
used to lambaste the Los Angeles School District for attempting to acquire the 
Ambassador Hotel site for use as a high school ("Board Ignores Signals in 
No-Trump Deal" May 20). 
</P>
<P>
Our building staff has done its homework and knows its business. Many of 
Kaplan's suggestions already have been implemented or studied. We'd be more 
inclined to hear Kaplan's ideas if they were presented in a balanced and fair 
way. 
</P>
<P>
The school board was interested in the site for school use long before Trump 
arrived on the scene. The district's building staff has spent more than two 
years studying and evaluating 57 separate sites in the Mid-Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
The sites were all either more costly than the Ambassador site, or, for those 
that didn't cost more, would require significant destruction of affordable 
housing and the relocation of many residents. In the past, Kaplan has taken us 
to task for taking housing in other projects. No matter what we do, there seems 
to be no way for us to satisfy him. 
</P>
<P>
A lengthy environmental report for this project was completed in 1989. This 
project has been fully approved by the state Department of Education, and has 
met, and exceeded, all the rules and requirements of the State Allocation Board 
that funds school construction. 
</P>
<P>
The $73 million being requested is a reasonable amount of money based on the 
amount of land needed for a high school and the typical cost of land in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan summarizes our joint use proposal accurately, but describing it as a 
"scheme yet to be made public" is both untrue and absurd. Our joint-use plans 
have been presented to the press and public on a number of occasions in the 
past two months, one such instance being reported in The Times on April 22. 
</P>
<P>
I can assure Kaplan that the school board is not interested in joint 
development of the site because we want to be "a player" in local development. 
We have proposed joint development because we agree with him that innovative 
approaches to land use are needed in this crowded urban area. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan also suggests that the joint development proposal is "unmarketable" and 
"unfeasible." We wonder if he has been talking mainly with the Trump 
organization, which is uninterested in joint development. Other developers have 
approached the district with an interest in this and other joint development 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan is welcome to express his personal opinion over any of the board's past 
or present school planning or design efforts, but I do take exception when he 
sets himself up as an educational expert. Kaplan's comments about test scores, 
dropout rates and school crime are irrelevant and far from the mark. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan concludes by calling on the board to come up with more imaginative ideas 
to provide classroom seats. I believe the board's joint use proposal for the 
site is just such an innovation. 
</P>
<P>
Some might conclude from Kaplan's article that he favors developers over the 
need of schoolchildren. But the issue here is not the board versus Donald Trump 
or any other real estate developer. It is about building schools for children 
now, not some time in the future. The board is convinced that the Ambassador is 
the best site for a school in the area, and that is why we have been so firm in 
seeking the site.

SELLERS NEED TO GET REAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a realtor for 16 years, I've experienced two other "off" real estate 
markets. Each of those were off for different reasons, but there was one 
consistent trait: the sellers' resistance in accepting a changing market. 
</P>
<P>
Our multiple listing service shows that it's taking an average of 115 days to 
sell a home, with seven out of 10 listings expiring. Yet, no matter how much we 
try to educate the sellers, most think they are immune to the current trends, 
and that some "miracle" buyer is going to pay whatever price the seller has 
placed on the property, regardless of what the home is really worth. 
</P>
<P>
Today's buyers are not as committed to a property as in the past, and when they 
make an offer, that's usually it. When the seller counters, the buyer walks 
away! 
</P>
<P>
I'm consistently reading where sellers are quick to criticize agents for the 
kind of job they are doing, are willing to change agents every 30 days, ask 
agents to spend time and money on open houses, advertising, lunches, expensive 
brochures, etc., and then in addition ask the agent to reduce the commission, 
even if the seller has overpriced the property to start with! 
</P>
<P>
Agents want to sell homes for the highest price possible, but agents are not 
miracle workers. It's time the sellers face reality. According to our multiple 
listing service, homes are selling within 5% of their asking price, so 
properties that are priced right, sell.

Kaplan's column ("Preservation Lesson: UCLA Flunks Test," May 13) discusses how 
ironic it is that UCLA, whose library houses the Richard Neutra Archives, is 
planning to destroy the UES buildings designed by Richard Neutra.

GARDEN SEMINARS FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three children's gardening workshops will be held Saturday at the Ralph M. 
Parsons Discovery Center of the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the workshops, called "Seeds for Summer Gardens" will begin at 
1:30 p.m. Due to limited space, 125 children will be admitted to each workshop 
on a first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
Each workshop will last half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Each child will be provided with enough of "Jack's Magic Bean," a Dutch 
climbing pole bean from the Rosemary Clooney Herb Garden in Long Beach, to make 
a tent-shaped bean-vine teepee. "Giant Greystripe Sunflower," "Jack o'Lantern 
Pumpkin" or "Crackerjack Marigold" seed will be offered for embellishment. 
</P>
<P>
Each child will propagate seeds for warm weather growing to transplant later 
into his own garden. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the Discovery Center is included with the admission price to the 
museum, and costs $3 for an adult, $1.50 for seniors over 62 years and students 
over 12; 75 cents for children ages 5 to l2, and free for children 5 years old 
and under.

ENHANCE GARDEN WITH LOW-VOLTAGE LIGHTING; 
</P>
<P>
ILLUMINATION: KITS WITH LIGHTS THAT PLUG INTO REGULAR OUTDOOR OUTLETS ARE EASY 
TO INSTALL. ENERGY COST IS LOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you ever thought that decorative outdoor lights around your home would be a 
nice addition, then you should consider the benefits of a low voltage system 
you can install yourself in an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Low-voltage lighting kits are sold at most large home centers and building 
supply stores (Builder's Emporium, Home Club, Home Depot, National Lumber, 
etc.). The most common kits are by Malibu, Toro and Luna Lights. 
</P>
<P>
The kits include floodlights to highlight trees and shrubs or tier lights to 
illuminate walkways, or a combination of both. Also included is enough wire to 
complete the average installation and a timer or light sensor to control the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The systems plug into a 110 volt outlet on an outside wall of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Although low-voltage lights are not as bright as standard lights and not 
desirable where security lighting is required, for decorative purposes they 
offer tremendous energy and installation cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
Because each fixture uses a bulb of 13 watts on average, energy usage is very 
low. As Pop Larson, Builder's Emporium's answer man, says, "An entire 
six-fixture low-voltage light set costs about one-half cent per hour to operate 
in most communities. Over the life of the system the savings over standard 
voltage lighting can be enormous." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the hardware (the lights, wiring, power pack and timer/sensor) is 
a fraction of the price you would pay for standard hardware. Complete kits 
start as low as $65. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the installation is much cheaper than standard voltage lighting 
installation. Since standard lights carry high voltage, weather-tight fixtures, 
conduits and junction boxes have to be installed by a licensed electrician, all 
of which is expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Low voltage lights do not carry enough current to be dangerous, and can be 
easily installed by a novice without concern about electric shock or fire. 
</P>
<P>
Here is how its done: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- You will need a 110-volt grounded outlet to plug the power pack into. If 
you do not have one on the outside of your house convenient for the power pack, 
you may wish to plug the power pack into an inside outlet and run the cable 
through the wall or through a window to the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Or, you may prefer to have an electrician install a new outside receptacle in 
an ideal spot for the power pack. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Look around the area you wish to illuminate and determine how many 
fixtures you need, and whether tier lights (for walkways) or floodlights (for 
trees and shrubs) would suit you best. Most kits are sold with 4, 6 or 10 
fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
Also, estimate the length of power cable necessary so you can buy extra if 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Hang the power box off the ground and attach the cable to it. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Assemble the fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Lay out the cable and place the fixtures on the ground where they will be 
permanently located. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Attach the fixtures to the cable (be sure the sharp terminals pierce the 
center of the cable wire). Push the fixtures' stakes into the ground to 
permanently anchor them. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Bury the cable between the fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- Plug in the power pack and set the timer. 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Check that all the lights are working. If not, check the cable connections 
and make sure the bulbs are held securely in the sockets. 
</P>
<P>
10 -- Come nightfall, aim and adjust the lights for optimum illumination. 
</P>
<P>
That's it! You will be amazed at how great the lights look and how easy it was 
to do yourself. An entire six-light low voltage set can be installed by a 
novice in one afternoon or less.

IF TOILET TANK 'SWEATS' LINK TO HOT WATER LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: All summer long our toilet tank sweats and drips water, especially 
when it's humid. We've tried several products, but they only work for short 
periods. One plumber suggested that we hook up the tank to the hot-water line, 
but others had never heard of this. Who's right? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The plumber knows his business. When warm, moist room air hits your 
water-cooled tank and bowl, condensation forms. Tell your plumber to install a 
mixing valve that will flush your toilet with room-temperature water (not 
straight hot water). The valve can be adjusted to maintain the correct water 
temperature without wasting hot water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urethene Foam Not Recommended for Attic 
</P>
<P>
Q: My insulation installer recommended urethane foam in my attic. He claims 
that 1 inch of urethane will equate an R-30 value. He claims that's a lot 
better than fiberglass because 6 inches of fiberglass can't get anywhere near 
that R-value. But I have heard that plastic foams should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
A: You'd better change installers. Never even consider using foam in the attic. 
The material was developed for use in walls or on flat roofs (mainly commercial 
ones). By the way, don't confuse all "foams" with urea-formaldehyde, which the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission has deemed harmful to your health. Most 
foams, however, are flammable and certain precautions must be taken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interior Room Vapors Cause Blisters on Siding 
</P>
<P>
Q: We installed redwood siding 26 years ago, and painted it with the best 
exterior oil paint. Every spring since, paint blisters and red stains appear. 
We've sanded the siding and applied latex paint over the best undercoat 
available. But we still have the same blistering, peeling and red stain 
problem. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
A: I believe interior room moisture (vapor) is passing through your walls and 
popping the paint. You need to treat the interior walls so warm, moist air 
won't pass through to the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Apply an interior paint designed to minimize the flow of moisture, or place a 
polyethylene vapor barrier between the studs and the drywall. Once you've 
corrected the moisture problem, scrape off the blistered paint and sand the 
wood bare. Prime the blistered area with an oil-base primer, then repaint the 
entire area. Note: Primers containing zinc are sensitive to water and should 
not be used on redwood. 
</P>
<P>
Latex or other water-base primers should not be used on woods containing 
water-soluble extractives (natural moisture that can be drawn out), such as 
redwood or cedar. The water in the primer base will cause bleeding stains. 
Latex top coats may be applied over an oil primer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seek Engineer's Advice Before Moving Column 
</P>
<P>
Q: A support column in my basement is right in the way of my new pool table. Is 
there any way to remove that column without causing a sag in the floor above? 
</P>
<P>
A: As your drawing shows a girder joint over the column in question, I believe 
that removing the column would cause total collapse. Your problem can be 
corrected, but to make absolutely certain you should seek the services of a 
professional engineer.

ORDINARY-LOOKING SANDER BOASTS MANY USES; 
</P>
<P>
WOODWORKING: RANDOM ORBIT SANDERS HAVE BEEN USED BY AUTO BODY SHOPS, OPERATED 
ON AIR PRESSURE. NOW A MODEL IS AVAILABLE THAT RUNS ON ELECTRICITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. HAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the years, a lot of friends have asked me what's the most useful type of 
sander for do-it-yourself woodworking. And my answer has always been something 
of a hedge. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can match the speed and power of a good belt sander," I usually say. 
But then I'd turn around and warn that a belt sander can also work too fast, 
and in the hands of a rookie, it can create some pretty deep gouges and 
depressions in a matter of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
So for all-around versatility and user-friendliness, I'd recommend a good 
orbital sander . . . specifically one of the smaller types called "palm 
sanders" made by Makita, Ryobi, Porter-Cable, Black &amp; Decker and others. 
But then I'd have to point out that orbitals are painfully slow if you have a 
lot of heavy sanding to do. 
</P>
<P>
And finally -- because they are too difficult to control and because they 
create horrendous swirl marks -- I would dismiss disk sanders as totally out of 
the question. 
</P>
<P>
Just recently however, a new sander made by Porter-Cable has appeared on the 
market, and it may be the most useful type available (shown in the sketch). 
</P>
<P>
"But that looks like an ordinary disk sander!" you say. Well it may look like 
one, but it isn't. It's a new type called a random orbit sander. Actually, 
random orbit sanders aren't new. 
</P>
<P>
They've long been used in auto body shops and in factories. But they've always 
been pneumatically powered by air pressure, and that has kept them out of the 
home market. 
</P>
<P>
That changed when Porter-Cable introduced an electric version a few months 
back. If my guess is right, other makers will probably follow suit. The random 
orbit design is just too good to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
How It Works. Conventional orbital sanders all work on the same principle. An 
eccentric drives the sanding pad in a circular orbit, much the same path your 
hand would take when wiping a window with a circular scrubbing motion. To 
reduce the likelihood that the sander will create visible circular scratch 
marks, these sanders keep the diameter of the orbit small, about 
one-thirty-second inch or so. Trouble is, the smaller the orbit, the slower the 
sanding. 
</P>
<P>
The random orbit sander takes a different approach. Its eccentric drives the 
circular pad in a large orbit with a diameter of about half an inch. This 
increases sanding speed greatly. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, an orbit this large would create visible swirl marks, but the sanding 
pad doesn't just orbit. It's mounted in a ball bearing so it's free to spin on 
its axis, totally at random, which is exactly what it does once you press it to 
your work and the friction of sanding comes to bear. The combination of orbital 
and spinning action breaks up any swirl marks before they can form. 
</P>
<P>
What does all this mean in practice? You can sand at close to belt sander 
speeds with coarse 8O-grit paper, then switch to 100 and then 150 grit paper to 
get a super-fine finish. And the sander doesn't really care about grain 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
This makes it perfect for those tricky situations when you are sanding two 
pieces of wood joined at right angles as shown in the sketch. If you attacked 
this joint with a belt sander, you'd always be sanding one piece across the 
grain, creating unsightly cross-grain scratches in the process. With an 
orbital, grain direction is immaterial. 
</P>
<P>
Porter-Cable's random orbit sander takes self-adhesive 5-inch disks, a system I 
have grown to like. Disks press on and peel off in a second, and if you keep 
the sticky side free of dust, you can remount it several times. Swapping disks 
is so easy you don't give it a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few tricks to using this sander. First, you press its pad flat on 
your work, you don't tip it slightly on edge as you would a disk sander. 
</P>
<P>
Second, be sure the pad is down flat on your work surface before you turn on 
the sander. If you start it in the air and then lower it to your work, it will 
behave something like a disk sander until sanding friction sets the pad into 
random motion. 
</P>
<P>
Third (related to the second), don't expect to feather your work by using the 
sander with a light touch. If you fail to keep downward pressure on the pad, it 
will break out of its random orbits and start acting like a disk sander. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth, you'll probably have to use both hands to keep this tool under control. 
</P>
<P>
And fifth, be careful if you try to use the random orbit sander on moldings, 
sharp corners, edges and the like. It may sand faster than you expect. 
</P>
<P>
This new sander lists for around $205, but I 've seen it in catalogues for well 
under that. Trend-lines, (800) 343-3248, sells it for $140.

NATIONAL PARKS OFFER NATURE STUDY WITH A TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through the eyes of a trout or from the inside of a volcano, visitors to 
America's national parks can get a new perspective on the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Usually thought of in terms of gorgeous scenery, the parks have a little 
something extra these days: outdoor summer-school courses on campuses that 
embrace vast expanses of mountain and desert. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you can study: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The curious habits of the grizzly bear. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Life in a mountain stream through the eyes of a trout. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The brilliant sky of a summer night. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Volcanoes, as seen from inside the crater of Mt. St. Helens. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to more than a dozen of the nation's popular parklands can enroll in 
these and many other college-level courses lasting from a day to a week or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
The courses are offered by more than a dozen outdoor institutes and other 
educational organizations closely associated with national parks and forests. 
They are not U.S. Park Service programs, but several of the institutes are 
operated by national park support groups and are within park boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Because they often provide low-cost lodging, institute programs can be one of 
the least expensive ways to visit a national park, whether you go as an 
individual, with friends or as a family group. 
</P>
<P>
Special educational institutes operate at such popular national parks as 
Yellowstone and Grand Teton in Wyoming; Olympic, North Cascades and Mt. Rainier 
in Washington; Crater Lake in Oregon; Yosemite in California; Canyonlands and 
Arches in Utah; Rocky Mountain in Colorado; Big Bend in Texas; Everglades in 
Florida, and Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Yellowstone Institute, one of the largest of the educational organizations, 
offers more than 80 courses annually from its headquarters at Buffalo Ranch in 
the lightly visited Lamar Valley area of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more adventurous of the institute's classes is a five-day 
horsepacking expedition following the probable route taken in August, 1877, by 
the Nez Perce Indians, led by Chief Joseph as they tried to flee the Army. The 
area "was wild and rugged then," notes the institute's catalogue, "and remains 
so today." 
</P>
<P>
The ride covers about 20 miles a day. One aspect of the trip is learning how to 
travel in the wilderness without damaging the fragile country. The course, 
offered July 30 to Aug. 3 and Aug. 9-13, costs $405 per person, which includes 
food and horse. 
</P>
<P>
A topical course is "Fire Ecology,"three days of exploring the response of the 
park's vegetation to the massive forest fire two summers ago. The instructor 
will lead field trips to areas of both old and recent burns. 
</P>
<P>
You should be in good physical condition, because at least one five- to 
six-mile hike is planned. The cost for this course, offered July 30 to Aug. 1, 
is $105 per person, which covers only class activities. 
</P>
<P>
A most popular course each year, available at several parks, is "Alpine 
Wildflowers." At Yellowstone the class is scheduled for two days, July 9-10. 
Participants make day trips to the high country of the Beartooth Plateau to 
study wildflowers found only in an arctic environment. The instructional cost 
is $75 per person. 
</P>
<P>
The Yellowstone Institute is one of several that can provide low-cost 
accommodations for participants. Its Lamar Valley ranch has 13 rustic cabins, 
each with two or three single beds and not much else. None of the cabins has 
electricity, plumbing or heating, but bathrooms, showers and a communal kitchen 
(you cook your own meals) are available in a nearby classroom building. 
</P>
<P>
You must take a sleeping bag, and you may be expected to share a cabin with a 
stranger. However, the fee for a cabin bed is only $7 per person a night. The 
institute calls the experience "indoor camping." 
</P>
<P>
The ranch is in the least-traveled part of Yellowstone where the principal 
vegetation is sagebrush and grass. It is an area frequented by herds of elk and 
bison, black bears and an occasional grizzly. 
</P>
<P>
All of the institutes listed below are nonprofit organizations that have a 
close affiliation with one or more national parks or forests. Many, like the 
Yellowstone Institute, are within a park. They are sponsored by one or more 
organizations that may include colleges and museums. 
</P>
<P>
Most offer programs for adults as well as elementary- and high-school-age 
children, although not necessarily at the same time. Several offer summer 
courses designed for vacationing families. 
</P>
<P>
A few play host to Elderhostel groups, in which the minimum age is 60. The big 
season for classes is the summer, but programs are offered all year at 
warm-weather parks such as Big Bend. 
</P>
<P>
College credit is available for several of the institutes' courses, although 
there is usually an additional enrollment fee. The programs have proved 
especially popular with schoolteachers, who compose a large percentage of 
summer participants. 
</P>
<P>
Class sizes are limited, often to no more than a dozen, and many fill up months 
ahead. Travelers who would like to visit one of the parks and join an institute 
course should send for a course catalogue as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Among the nonprofit organizations providing educational programs in America's 
park and forest lands: 
</P>

EGYPT MAY PUT WALL AROUND PYRAMIDS, SPHINX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because too many people want to see the 5,000-year-old Pyramids and the Sphinx, 
Egyptian officials are considering building a wall around the ancient 
monuments. 
</P>
<P>
Not to keep the tourists out, but rather to help save the structures for future 
generations to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, a rising water table in the Nile Valley, pollution and 
the spread of settlements have threatened the monuments. 
</P>
<P>
A wall -- as unobtrusive as possible and preferably built with local materials 
-- would be built around them to control visitors and limit encroachment from 
nearby Nazlet el-Semman, a village whose main industry is catering to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
A network of asphalt roads crisscrossing the plateau on which the monuments 
stand would be removed and replaced with tracks of stabilized sand. Motor 
traffic would be virtually banned. 
</P>
<P>
All modern buildings within the wall would be razed, including a museum housing 
an ancient boat interred beside the Pyramid of Cheops and unearthed several 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the Egyptian government, the wall is expected to take 1 1/2 
years to complete. Whether it will stand for 5,000 is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
More than a pinch: According to the latest edition of "Ford's Freighter Travel 
Guide," which apparently keeps track of this sort of thing, if all the salt in 
all the world's oceans were crystallized, there would be enough to cover the 
Earth with a layer 45 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics: The U.S. travel and tourism industry generates more revenue from 
foreign dollars than that generated from exports of automobiles, agricultural 
goods or chemical products. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the United States this year will spend an estimated $48 billion, 
according to Rockwell A. Schnabel, the Commerce Department's undersecretary for 
travel and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
The travel-tourism industry generates revenues of about $1 billion a day, he 
said, adding that about 41 million foreigners will visit the United States this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, travel and tourism revenue reached a surplus for the first time, 
meaning that foreigners spent more in this country than U.S. residents spent 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
There's no catch: If you happen to be in Vermont on Saturday, June 9, and want 
to drop a line into the water, feel free to do so. That's the state's "free 
fishing day," when no license is required. 
</P>
<P>
Staying out of Africa: Tourism overtook coffee and tea exports as Kenya's top 
foreign exchange earner two years ago, but a decline in the number of visitors 
to the East African country has officials there worried. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of the (tourist) industry to the economy cannot be 
overemphasized," vice president and finance minister George Saitoti told 
delegates to a national tourism seminar in Nairobi earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the United States advised citizens against traveling to Kenya 
after two Americans were killed in an attack on a tourist bus. It has not 
rescinded the advice, despite high-level appeals. Nor is it likely to, 
diplomats said, until Kenya offers proof of a reduction in crimes against 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, meanwhile, has lost European tourists after a 
series of health scares involving cerebral malaria, AIDS and even cholera. 
</P>
<P>
Rail lines: That silver-and-blue flash you see streaking across the French 
countryside could well become a familiar sight before too long. 
</P>
<P>
French railways expects to have its high-speed Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) 
operating on at least three routes: from Paris to Bordeaux, Paris to Brussels 
and, most intriguing of all, Paris to London via the train tunnel being built 
under the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
The TGV recently set a world speed record for a train by clocking 320 m.p.h. 
during a test run. 
</P>
<P>
The French have also sold the TGV to the Spanish National Railroads, which 
plans to use it on runs between Madrid and Seville. 
</P>
<P>
Havana dreams: Cuba is hoping to offset an economic crisis by encouraging 
foreign investors to develop resort hotels that will lure the tourist dollar 
(or mark or yen or pound or whatever). 
</P>
<P>
The newly inaugurated Sol Palmeras Hotel in Varadero, 60 miles from Havana, is 
the first of eight beach resort hotels to be built with private foreign 
investment and government money in the cities of Varadero, Santiago de Cuba and 
Havana. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish, Finnish and Soviet investors are working with Cubanacan, the Cuban 
government tourism developer, to build the hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thousand more hotel rooms are expected to be ready by the end of the year. 
Most of them will be in four-star hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Quick fact: Hungary, which has a population of about 10 million, attracted 14.5 
million tourists in 1989, including a 27% increase from 1988 in the number of 
visitors from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Olympian effort: In an effort to persuade the 90-member International Olympic 
Committee to award Athens the Summer Olympics in 1996, Greek officials have 
drawn up detailed plans to rebuild much of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major projects are a new international airport costing $220 million, 
two underground railway lines costing $1 billion and the completion of two main 
roads costing $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics note that such plans have been around for years. 
</P>
<P>
The IOC meets in Tokyo in September to choose the 1996 host city. Other 
candidates are Atlanta, Toronto, Belgrade, Melbourne and Manchester, England. 
</P>
<P>
Quick facts: The American Society of Travel Agents would like you to know that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A total of 38.5 million foreign visitors came to the United States in 1989, 
or an average of 73 per second. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The year before, foreign visitors spent $56,000 per minute in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The federal government receives more in tax revenues from foreign visitors 
in four days than it spends on the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration in 
one year.

TRIP OF THE WEEK: SOAK UP YOUR CARES AT SPRINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE GRIMM and TOM GRIMM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AVILA BEACH, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When their Granada Hills home was lost to the California 118 freeway in 1969, 
Paula and Bob Snowdy moved to San Luis Obispo County. There they bought Hidden 
Valley Hot Springs, a deteriorating spa and campground on 16 acres. 
</P>
<P>
"Our family loved to camp, so Mom and Dad decided to run a campground," recalls 
Jim Snowdy, the eldest of two sons. "As for the hot mineral water bubbling up 
on the property, we just considered it something that was pretty smelly." 
</P>
<P>
But after more than two decades in business, the family credits the sulfurous 
water that flows from the earth at 50 gallons a minute as their fountain of 
success. It fills the private-tiled tubs and outdoor pool where a steady stream 
of visitors come to soak away their cares. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 50 staff members, including eight masseuses and masseurs, are 
employed to take care of the spa and camping clientele at the renamed Avila Hot 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
It has become a favorite vacation stop for families who like the informal 
atmosphere. Children especially enjoy the 50-by-100-foot freshwater swimming 
pool, recreation hall and snack bar. 
</P>
<P>
"Our small grocery store with racks of 10-cent candy is really popular with the 
kids," says Jim Snowdy, who now runs the hot springs with his brother, George, 
and sister, Sally Watters. 
</P>
<P>
The Snowdys are the third family to operate the spa in the past 80 years, at 
the beginning of which the mineral well was brought under control and buildings 
first erected for visitors. The big swimming pool that is still in use was 
built in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
Liquor, gambling and girls gave the hot springs a notorious reputation during 
Prohibition in the 1920s. William Randolph Hearst and his Hollywood friends 
were said to stop there en route to the castle Hearst was building on a hilltop 
at San Simeon. 
</P>
<P>
A large unadorned mirror in the spa's entry building reportedly was a gift from 
the newspaper magnate. "We think it's a 17th-Century piece from Italy," Snowdy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"A turkey run used to occupy that area," he said, pointing to the playroom with 
a pool table and video games. It fills the space between the main building and 
the bath house, which still has the original 1930s step-down ceramic tile tubs. 
"This place has sort of evolved over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Among the improvements is the campground with 50 spaces for RVs and a grassy 
area that will accommodate 25 tents. RVers pay $21 a night (for full hookups 
including cable TV) and tenters $15. 
</P>
<P>
An hour's use of one of the six private indoor mineral baths is $8.50. When the 
$40 fee for a one-hour massage or facial is paid, that person also gets 30 
minutes in the private bath or all-day use of the outdoor swimming and hot 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, use of those two pools is $6.50 daily; children $4.50. They are open 
and attended by lifeguards from 8 a.m. to midnight in the summer. Swimming 
lessons are offered. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about Avila Hot Springs Spa and RV Resort, call toll-free 
(800) 332-2359. The local number is (805) 595-2359. 
</P>
<P>
The Snowdy family enterprise is only one of two successful hot springs in the 
area. Just down the road, on the opposite side of Avila Beach Drive, is 
Sycamore Mineral Springs, which caters to a different crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three redwood hot tubs in lattice enclosures are scattered on hillsides 
among live oaks and other trees that add to a feeling of privacy in the 
outdoors. On a recent spring day at the spa, a young couple from UC Santa 
Barbara were taking a break from classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a considerable number of students, especially from Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, which is less than 15 minutes away by freeway," said Chet Hogoboom, a 
manager at Sycamore. "And employees at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant 
just over the hill also like to relax here after work." 
</P>
<P>
The hot tubs are available 24 hours, but Hogoboom recommends making 
reservations if you want one between 7 p.m. and midnight, "especially on 
weekends and nights with a full moon." 
</P>
<P>
Garden lamps illuminate the concrete steps and pathways that wind through the 
wooded hills to the hot tubs. Guests at Sycamore Mineral Springs are given a 
map to the tubs, which are identified by names such as "Enchantment," 
"Shangri-La" and "Paradise." Hot tubbers pay $9.50 per person an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Also named are the 27 motel-style rooms in two hillside buildings that offer 
comfortable accommodations as well as a private whirlpool tub on the porch of 
every room. The rooms are sited by order of their names in the alphabet, from 
Adventurous to Zany. Nightly rates are $89/$108 a room. 
</P>
<P>
People began staying overnight at the springs at the turn of the century, when 
San Luis Hot Sulphur Springs was opened as a spa resort. Guests arrived by 
horse-drawn buggies, stagecoach and a narrow-gauge railway. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothea and Paul Byllings bought the spa soon after the Depression of the 
'30s, renamed it Sycamore Mineral Springs and built a horseshoe-shaped bath 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Today that renovated adobe and red-tile-roofed building serves as the reception 
office. It also has rooms for four therapists who offer body massages and 
facials. Fees are $30 to $65, including 30 minutes in a hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Byllings sold the mineral springs in the 1970s to Carol and Russell 
Kiessig, who have continued to improve the 116-acre property. The bath-house 
courtyard has been enhanced with a pond and gazebo, where weddings frequently 
take place. And a gardener has restored the formal gardens. 
</P>
<P>
A lifeguarded, freshwater swimming pool is open daily until 6 p.m. Hot tubbers 
and room guests swim free, but others pay $4.50 (children $3.50) for day use of 
the pool. 
</P>
<P>
To make reservations at Sycamore Mineral Springs, call toll-free (800) 234-5831 
or (805) 595-7302. 
</P>
<P>
Both spas sell snacks and beverages, but you'll find better dining a few miles 
away on the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch is good at Mulligan's Bar and Grill on the San Luis Bay Golf Course. 
Fresh seafood for dinner is outstanding at the Olde Port Inn at the end of Port 
San Luis Pier. A favorite for all-day dining and Sunday brunch is the Old 
Custom House. 
</P>
<P>
For other restaurants and lodgings in the area, contact the San Luis Obispo 
County Visitors and Conference Bureau at toll-free (800) 634-1414. 
</P>
<P>
To drive from Los Angeles to the hot springs, go north on U.S. 101 and take the 
Avila Beach exit just after the freeway turns inland beyond Pismo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Avila Beach is 420 miles.

YORKTOWN, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The memorial is humble but not inappropriate: just a small brick pavilion at 
the edge of a quiet meadow. 
</P>
<P>
Split rail fences discourage visitors from entering the large field, thereby 
maintaining its serenity. The only movement is that of a squirrel scampering 
along a wooden fence, the only sound a crow cawing in the distant woods. 
</P>
<P>
No ornate monuments clutter the meadow and no maps outlining military tactics 
are in the modern pavilion. No grand paintings or sculptures immortalize heroic 
deeds. No stirring words are etched in brass or marble. 
</P>
<P>
The circular building, like the tranquil field it overlooks, is empty -- except 
for a red button on the far wall above the words "Surrender Story." 
</P>
<P>
Push the button and what happened in the field, on an autumn day nearly 209 
years ago, comes back to life in a stirring taped narration that concludes: "On 
this open field, it might be said, the United States of America was born." 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 19, 1781, a battered British army marched out of the nearby village of 
Yorktown to the isolated field and surrendered to combined French and American 
forces under Gen. George Washington, after the last major battle of the 
Revolutionary War. 
</P>
<P>
Surrender Field is preserved as part of Yorktown Battlefield, a 4,500-acre unit 
of Colonial National Historical Park in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Yorktown is eclipsed in popularity by nearby Colonial Williamsburg, but history 
buffs who visit it will not be disappointed. The battlefield, which overlooks 
the wide York River, has more artillery pieces and reconstructed earthen 
fortifications than many Revolutionary War sites. 
</P>
<P>
And although more American soldiers died in winter encampments at Valley Forge 
and Morristown, N.J., earlier in the war, what happened at Yorktown was more 
dramatic and certainly more decisive. 
</P>
<P>
A visitor easily can spend a full day exploring the area -- taking two 
battlefield driving tours, a walking tour through the small town and seeing two 
worthwhile museums. 
</P>
<P>
No admission is charged to visit the parklike battlefield. In winter, 
especially on weekdays, visitors may feel as if they have the place to 
themselves. Unfortunately, a couple of historic buildings are closed at this 
time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who goes will better appreciate France's role in helping the United 
States gain its independence. After joining the war against England in 1778, 
France provided troops and financial support. Without the French the Americans 
would have been defeated at Yorktown and the Revolutionary War might have been 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Washington could not have done anything at Yorktown without the assistance of 
the French," said National Park Service spokesman Douglas Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
In 1781 Gen. Charles Lord Cornwallis had fortified Yorktown as a British naval 
base. (The York River has the deepest natural channel of any Chesapeake Bay 
tributary.) But a French fleet under Adm. De Grasse blockaded the mouth of 
Chesapeake Bay, cutting off Cornwallis and any relieving force for him from New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 5 of that year 24 French ships fought 19 British ships off Virginia 
Beach in the Battle of the Virginia Capes. The damaged British ships returned 
to New York City. No Americans were involved in that engagement, which assured 
a British defeat at Yorktown. 
</P>
<P>
Cornwallis deliberately sank more than a dozen supply ships off the Yorktown 
beach as a barricade against a possible French invasion. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time George Washington ferried American and French forces west 
across the Hudson north out of sight of the British in New York City, and 
marched them 450 miles south to attack Cornwallis by land. 
</P>
<P>
After arriving in Virginia, Washington used Williamsburg as his base before 
starting the attack. The French fleet put 3,000 troops ashore at nearby 
Jamestown to join Washington's army. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of Washington's 17,600 men were French soldiers under Gen. Jean de 
Rochambeau. Cornwallis had 8,300 men -- about one third of Britain's forces in 
the United States. They included some American troops who fought for England. 
"In many respects, the Revolution was a civil war as well as a war between the 
United States and Britain," said Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 28, 1781, French and American forces marched 13 miles to Yorktown and 
began digging a mile-long siege trench 800 yards from the British defense line. 
</P>
<P>
The battle began Oct. 9 when French and American howitzers, mortars and field 
guns began bombarding the occupied town. Washington fired the first American 
siege gun. 
</P>
<P>
"Yorktown was unique because it was the only major siege of the Revolution," 
said Thompson, adding that more than 15,000 artillery rounds -- both solid 
cannon balls and exploding bombs -- were fired during the eight-day siege, 
mostly from French guns. Half the town's buildings were destroyed. Considering 
the intensity of the battle, casualties were not high. British dead totaled 156 
and the Americans and French lost 72 men. Many more were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
By Oct. 11 most British guns had been knocked out of action and the Redcoats 
pulled back from their outer defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, after fierce hand-to-hand combat with bayonets, American and 
French troops captured two small British fortifications, Redoubts 9 and 10, 
allowing completion of a second siege line only 300 yards from the enemy. Both 
reconstructed redoubts can be visited, although part of one has eroded into the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
Menacing pointed pikes called fraises protrude from the walls of the tiny 
forts. The sharp "timbers" look exactly like gray wood, but are modern 
reproductions made of reinforced concrete. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 16 the British attempted a counter-attack but were repulsed. Late that 
night they tried to evacuate Yorktown by crossing the York River in small 
boats, but a violent windstorm forced them to abandon that idea. 
</P>
<P>
Cornwallis was outmanned and outgunned. He was short of supplies and the town 
he occupied was being subjected to a continuous bombardment at close range. On 
Oct. 17, with no hope of escape or reinforcement, he proposed terms of 
surrender. The next day, officers from both sides met at the Moore house to 
negotiate terms. Visitors can go inside that restored house in summer. 
</P>
<P>
The formal surrender ceremony took place two days later. Cornwallis' army, 
which included German mercenary forces, marched out of Yorktown between two 
lines of Allied soldiers that stretched more than a mile. Cornwallis did not 
attend, claiming to be ill. His second in command, Gen. Charles O'Hara, tried 
to surrender his sword to Rochambeaurather than to the Americans. But the 
French general directed O'Hara to Washington. The sword was accepted by Gen. 
Benjamin Lincoln, Washington's second in command. 
</P>
<P>
When the British laid down their arms, some flung down their weapons, damaging 
them so they could not be used by their enemies. Mounted vertically at the base 
of the Surrender Field pavilion are 11 British artillery pieces surrendered at 
Yorktown. The defeated soldiers were marched to prison camps in Maryland and 
western Virginia. Many later became Americans. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1782, the British Parliament passed a resolution to end the war 
against the United States. But the war did not formally end until the Treaty of 
Paris was signed in September, 1783, almost two years after the victory at 
Yorktown. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after news of the battle reached the federal capital in 
Philadelphia, a jubilant U.S. Congress authorized construction of a victory 
monument, but construction did not begin for 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
The 98-foot-tall Yorktown Victory Monument -- erected to commemorate both the 
victory and the alliance with France -- was completed in 1885. It overlooks the 
York River between the town and the National Park Service Visitors Center. 
</P>
<P>
The center, open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., is a good first stop. A 16-minute 
film explains the battle, as does an illuminated map display. In the center's 
museum you can walk inside a full-size reproduction of one-fourth of a British 
frigate (watch your head). 
</P>
<P>
Other artifacts include Washington's field tent and a British cannon dented by 
enemy fire at Yorktown. The roof of the visitors center, which is behind 
British lines at the south edge of town, has a battlefield observation deck.

PURITY OF VITTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the May 6 Travel Section, Dr. Karl Neumann wrote that Vittel uses 
"sophisticated techniques to remove potentially harmful chemicals and 
microorganisms from water, techniques that local bottlers may not." 
</P>
<P>
This is not true. 
</P>
<P>
Vittel's purity is protected not by chemical or other treatment. In fact, 
French law prohibits the physical or chemical treatment of bottled waters, 
other than to remove iron or add natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Vittel's purity is maintained first by protecting its spring, Grande 
Source. Second, exceptionally strict sanitary precautions are taken to ensure 
that the spring, holding tanks, bottling lines and bottles are 
contaminant-free. 
</P>
<P>
Vittel employs a staff of 40 in three laboratories who perform a never-ending 
series of tests to ensure that the purity of Vittel is never compromised. Thus 
the purity and quality of Vittel is protected not by treating the water by 
chemical or other means. It comes from protecting the original pure water.

I have been meaning to write and thank Jerry Hulse for a squib in his Travel 
Tips column last year on CampAlaska Tours, P.O. Box 872247, Wasilla, Alaska 
99687, phone (907) 376-9438. 
</P>
<P>
I went with them for two weeks and had about the best time I have ever had on a 
vacation. We must have covered 2,000 miles and saw just about everything. It 
was a most reasonably priced trip, and the people in our group, from all over 
the world, were bright, fun and good sports. I highly recommend this company 
for a great way to really experience Alaska.

JUSTICE PREVAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Adler's May 13 Consumer Report about refunds on unused portions of advance 
payments for travel expenses was interesting but left for the last sentence 
probably the most effective way of recovering one's funds. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I were on the third day of a prepaid vacation to Hawaii when I took 
a bad fall in Hana and suffered a bad break of my left foot. 
</P>
<P>
After examining the X-ray, the doctor at the Maui hospital recommended that I 
return to the mainland for surgery. My wife canceled the rest of the prepaid 
hotel accommodations and returned the prepaid rental car and we returned to 
California for the treatment for my foot. 
</P>
<P>
The travel company, through which our local agency had arranged our vacation, 
refused to consider either a refund or to issue undated vouchers for the unused 
part of our trip, although I addressed the president of the company by letter 
directly. Feeling that I was not being treated fairly, I sued in small-claims 
court and collected my requested refund plus court costs.

FINDING THE FAIR INTERVAL BETWEEN SENTENCING, DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: REHNQUIST LENDS HIS PRESTIGE TO A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD PERMIT STATES TO 
EMPLOY NOVICES TO DEFEND INDIGENTS ON TRIAL FOR THEIR LIVES.

<TEXT>
<P>
This month, the state of Louisiana executed Dalton Prejean, a young, mentally 
retarded black defendant whose all-white jury never learned about many 
mitigating factors in his case, simply because his lawyers never placed them in 
evidence. Last year, Alabama executed a mentally retarded black defendant whose 
lawyer failed to produce any evidence of mental retardation. One of the jurors 
who sentenced him to death said she would never have done so had she known of 
the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Reduced to its essentials, the debate over limiting federal review of such 
death-penalty cases is one over the competency of the Southern lawyers 
appointed to defend indigents like Prejean. If they want to carry out 
executions expeditiously, how much should states be required to spend on 
competent defense lawyers? 
</P>
<P>
Listening to the federal judges debating this issue, it's hard to believe that 
they are reviewing the same cases. For Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the 
problem seems to be that lawyers are doing too good a job. They deliberately 
hold off filing petitions until death warrants are issued and then, "in fits of 
frantic action followed by periods of inaction," succeed in delaying executions 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
He appointed retired Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. and four other federal judges 
(all Southeners) to look into the matter. The special committee recommended 
barring successive federal petitions unless the defendant can demonstrate that 
he should not have been convicted in the first place. It also recommended 
giving states the option of adopting a plan that requires the appointment of 
"competent" lawyers for state post-conviction hearings; it did not define the 
standard of competence. 
</P>
<P>
For the eight federal judges (including the chief judges of a majority of the 
federal circuits) who led a successful revolt to amend the Powell committee 
recommendations in the U.S. Judicial Conference, the incompetency of lawyers 
appointed by states to handle death-penalty cases is so appalling that it's a 
national disgrace. Federal courts, on average, set aside the death penalty in 
more than half the capital cases they review, frequently because the trial 
lawyer was incompetent. The conference recommended that successive federal 
petitions be allowed if the defendant can show either innocence or the 
inappropriateness of a death sentence. And it would mandate that all states 
meet specific minimum standards of competence approved by the American Bar 
Assn. at all stages of death-penalty litigation, including trial, appeal and 
post-conviction hearings. 
</P>
<P>
These opposing views are embodied in bills pending in the U.S. Senate. The 
Powell committee recommendations are contained in a bill sponsored by Sen. 
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.); Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) is carrying the 
conference's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides offer examples to support their views. One of the Powell committee 
judges cites the case of serial killer Theodore Bundy, executed by Florida in 
1989. He questions why it took 10 years to decide that Bundy's trial was free 
of constitutional error. Rehnquist, now a active lobbyist for the Thurmond 
bill, cites statistics showing an average lapse of eight years between 
imposition of a death sentence and execution. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of stricter competency standards point to the Mississippi case in 
which a capital defendant was represented by a third-year law student, the 
Georgia death case in which the lawyer representing the accused was handling 
his first trial, or the Alabama case in which a woman was sentenced to death 
after a trial during which her lawyer was jailed for being drunk in court. Many 
southern states limit compensation of lawyers in capital trials to less than 
$2,500. It is no coincidence that the states carrying out the most executions 
are the most parsimonious. They are also the states that see the highest 
proportion of convictions set aside by the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
During Senate hearings on the two pieces of legislation, Biden posed a 
hypothetical: What if a lawyer for a Death Row inmate first learned, just 
before a scheduled execution, that the prosecution had presented perjured 
evidence during the sentencing hearing that resulted in the death sentence? 
</P>
<P>
Under the Powell proposal, the federal courts couldn't even consider the issue, 
since it was not raised in the first trip through the federal courts. The 
Judicial Conference's recommendation would permit review of the appropriateness 
of the death-penalty sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The Powell committee was quite candid in explaining its rejection of stricter 
standards of lawyer competence: It might jeopardize support for its legislation 
among states necessary to secure passage. "Imposing these burdens will probably 
nullify any hope of enactment," the committee said. Standards of competence 
should reflect "community standards and judicial development." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents suggest that a national consensus on minimal standards of competence 
is needed. States should not be allowed to railroad executions if they are 
unwilling to pay for competent lawyers for the accused. Accepting "community 
standards" is, they argue, a euphemism for accepting the outrages perpetrated 
by such states as Alabama and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of Chief Justice William Rehnquist as such a strong advocate of 
speedier executions without the safeguards so many circuit judges demand poses 
grave risks. A chief justice who injects himself into the midst of such a 
divisive issue can only compromise his role as impartial spokesman for the 
judicial branch. And when the legislation that eventually emerges comes before 
the Supreme Court, lots of eyebrows will be raised if Rehnquist does not 
disqualify himself. 
</P>
<P>
But Rehnquist has raised eyebrows before. Indeed, his strident support of 
expedited executions is hardly surprising. He has railed against delays in 
executions throughout his judicial tenure. In one opinion, Rehnquist even 
resurrected the ghost of his personal hero, Judge Isaac C. Parker, to support 
his position. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Parker presided over the federal court in Fort Smith, Ark., from 1875 to 
1896. He sentenced 144 men to hang from the gallows on the front lawn of his 
courthouse. Ninety-two were executed before Congress enacted a law permitting 
appeals from Judge Parker's court directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, which was 
hardly a haven for criminals seeking to escape punishment. Yet the justices 
reversed 71% of Judge Parker's death judgments. 
</P>
<P>
Parker blamed "a criminal wave sweeping over the country" on the laxity of the 
courts. In calling for speedier executions, Rehnquist quoted the words Judge 
Parker spoke on his death bed: 
</P>
<P>
"I never hanged a man. It is the law. The good ladies who carry flowers and 
jellies to criminals mean well. There is no doubt of that, but what mistaken 
goodness! Back of the sentimentality are the motives of sincere pity and 
charity, sadly misdirected. They see the convict alone, perhaps chained in a 
cell; they forget the crime he perpetrated, and the family he made husbandless 
and fatherless by his assassin work." 
</P>
<P>
Eight years is a long time to ensure ourselves of the fairness of a death 
sentence. But the real issue is the price we're willing to pay to reduce that 
period. A majority of the Judicial Conference suggests we demand that every 
state meet a minimum, national standard of competence for the appointed lawyers 
who represent indigents accused or convicted of capital crimes. The chief 
justice of the United States, in an unprecedented rejection of the 
policy-making body he leads, insists that's too high a price to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Rehnquist's predecessor, Warren E. Burger, led a crusade to improve 
the competency of lawyers trying federal cases, decrying the specter of "Piper 
Cub lawyers" trying "Boeing 707 cases." Rehnquist now lends his prestige to a 
proposal that would permit the states to employ drunks and novices to defend 
indigents on trial for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Judge Parker's courtroom in Arkansas has been restored as a historical 
monument by the National Park Service. Even the gallows has been reconstructed 
on the front lawn. As one looks up the 13 steps leading to the nooses and 
trapdoors, one can only wonder how many of the men who died there might have 
been spared if a higher court had taken the time to review the fairness of 
their trials. Once the trapdoor is sprung, no errors can ever be corrected 
again. But the legacy of Judge Parker lives on, not just in the South, but at 
the pinnacle of the federal judiciary.

IS COMPETITION AT BALLOT BOX WORTH LOSS OF CHOICE AND EXPERIENCE IN OFFICE?; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: LIMITING THE TERMS OF OFFICEHOLDERS AND PUBLIC FINANCING OFFER 
CHALLENGERS A BETTER CHANCE AT DISLODGING ENTRENCHED INCUMBENTS.

<P>
It is safe to predict that not many voters will bother to cast ballots June 5. 
The consequences are worrisome, because it means winners stay in office too 
long, blocking the rise of new leadership and, perhaps, society's forward 
movement. In Congress, for example, 99% of House incumbents were reelected in 
1988; in the Senate, 85% held onto their seats. At the state and local levels, 
the reign of incumbents is similar. 
</P>
<P>
One explanation is that the lower you go on the political ladder -- the less 
visible the office -- the less voters know about challengers. At best, choice 
is little more than recognizing a familiar name. 
</P>
<P>
There are two solutions to non-competitive elections now widely discussed in 
public-policy circles: public financing of campaigns and limiting the terms of 
officeholders. It is not always clear, however, that these are solutions to the 
same problem. 
</P>
<P>
Public-financing advocates contend that unless challengers gain access to more 
funds, they have virtually no chance at the polls. With the additional money, 
the candidates can improve their name recognition among voters, thereby 
enhancing their competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, incumbents tend to be wary of public financing, especially 
when it comes to their own campaigns. They are less reluctant to tap taxpayer 
funds for campaigns in which others politicians are running. Congress, for 
example, made public financing the law in presidential campaigns. As for 
itself, it still prefers private campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
When some form of public financing is instituted, incumbents want to keep 
spending limits low to prevent their opponents from spending enough to gain 
name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
The other solution to incumbency stalemate is limiting the terms of 
officeholders. There is a federal proposal for senators and representatives. 
Come November, Californians can choose to limit the terms of Assembly members 
and senators. And Angelenos can sign a petition to be able to restrict the 
tenure of council members and certain elected officials. (The Los Angeles 
version is especially anti-incumbent, because it would retroactively impose a 
two-term limit.) Most of the proposals would impose a 12-year limit. 
</P>
<P>
The President, of course, is restricted to two terms. Governors in 29 states 
also can't spend the rest of their lives running their states. But thus far, 
few cities and no state have set term limits for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
It is quite possible that if the term-limit clock began ticking for the 
"permanent Congress," as it is known in Washington these days, the consequences 
would ripple throughout the electoral system. The idea that public-service 
careers should start in the school committee or city council, advance to the 
state legislature, to Congress and then on to the presidency loses it appeal 
when you consider the average tenure of the respective officeholders. 
Typically, a Los Angeles council member has been in office 13 years, a 
supervisor 18. In Sacramento, an Assembly member, on average, has been in 
office for 15 years, a state senator for 12. The average tenure of the 
California delegation to the House of Representatives is 11 years. At that 
rate, it would take 69 years just to run for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Reapportionment, old age, changing ambitions, the need to make more money and 
new opportunities, however, help to maintain the turnover in most of these 
governmental bodies. Sixty percent of the California delegation to Washington 
has been elected since 1980; likewise, 54% of the state senators and 65% of the 
Assembly members. 
</P>
<P>
The average tenure of local officeholders is greater. Two of the five 
supervisors were elected in 1980; the remaining three were already supervisors. 
Six City Council members were elected in the 1980s; five have been on the 
council for 20 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
Talent, hard work and experience are needed to become a good politician. It 
usually takes years to develop the skills to rise to positions of leadership in 
legislatures. For example, the name of Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) is invariably 
preceded by "well-respected," in large part because his judgment on military 
matters is the result of long study and service on the Armed Services 
Committee. He was first elected to the Senate in 1972. Advocates of term limits 
would eliminate the Nunns. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if terms were restricted, the time it takes to advance might 
shrink proportionately. Seniority could be achieved in six or eight years, not 
10 or 20. Since political issues tend to recycle themselves several times 
during a 10-year period, maybe the country would be better served by new 
leaders the second or third time around. 
</P>
<P>
A more serious drawback to term limits is that they are anti-democratic because 
they eliminate choice. We rely on voters to hold elected officeholders 
accountable. If a politician's constituents wish to reelect him or her year 
after year, they should be able to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, in the end, is that we really don't have a choice because we don't 
know enough about the candidates. Sometimes, we pick candidates because we know 
something about them, are able to discern their positions by virtue of their 
party affiliation or because the issues have been widely discussed during the 
campaign. Most of the time, however, the choice is between a vaguely familiar 
name and one that is totally unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Public financing, where available, has proved to be effective in increasing 
political competitiveness. Limiting the terms of officeholders on the top rungs 
of the political ladder assures open seats, but when were these offices ever 
non-competitive? The two-term limit for President and one- or two-term limit 
for governors more likely reduces bossism and corruption than promote 
competitiveness. What medicine you take depends on what disease you want to 
cure.

SAN DIEGO AMERICA'S CUP RUNNETH OVER WITH DEBT; 
</P>
<P>
SPORT: THREE YEARS AGO, A YACHTING REGATTA SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT IDEA. TODAY, 
THE CITY AND COUNTY CANNOT AFFORD THE PRICE OF GLORY ON THE SEAS.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yachting's prized racing trophy, the America's Cup, at last came home to San 
Diego this month, won not in honorable combat on the waves, as is tradition, 
but in a stuffy New York courtroom. After a particularly dismal cup event in 
1988, and 18 months of tacking through a legal storm, the trophy returns 
tarnished in spirit and metal, and still facing an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
Noticeably absent from its homecoming was the enthusiasm that greeted the 
America's Cup when sailing champ Dennis Conner carried it through the city's 
streets on his hero's return from Fremantle, Australia, in 1987. Also absent is 
the city's unquestioning desire for the America's Cup regatta. Things have 
changed in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Conner and Malin Burnham, the San Diego businessman and 
world-class yachtsman who spearheaded the Sail America syndicate's Australian 
challenge, made San Diego beg for the privilege of holding the next America's 
Cup regatta, then planned for 1991. This was despite the fact that the sailing 
syndicate's challenge was sponsored by the San Diego Yacht Club. By tradition, 
the yacht club whose burgee flutters at the top of the winning boat's mast 
hosts the subsequent race. 
</P>
<P>
This year, as president of the America's Cup Organizing Committee, it has been 
Burnham's turn to be rebuffed by the same agencies and officials he forced to 
beg three years ago. Still $4 million in debt from the 1988 fiasco pitting 
Conner's catamaran against New Zealand challenger Michael Fay's hopelessly 
outmatched racing sloop, the organizing committee now needs $20 million to 
retire the debt and to finance the next cup race -- scheduled 12 months from 
now. Burnham hopes to get at least $10 million from public sources, the 
remainder from private ones, including corporate donations and television 
broadcast fees. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the regatta organizers are promising to reward the region with a 
$1.2-billion economic windfall from America's Cup XXVIII, including nearly $50 
million in local and state tax revenue. That kind of talk was enticing three 
years ago. It isn't today. 
</P>
<P>
Both the county and city of San Diego are in no position to provide funding. 
The county is struggling to find ways just to pay for long-needed new jails and 
to reinforce the escape-plagued jails it already has. The city of San Diego may 
have to lay off staff, freeze hiring for its already too-small police force and 
cut back its much underfunded library system to deal with a $60-million budget 
shortfall. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency is forcing city 
officials to upgrade its sewage-treatment facilities, which could cost San 
Diego as much as $2.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, legislation written by Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee 
(R-Carlsbad), proposing the state provide the America Cup's committee with a 
$10-million "loan" was shelved after city and county officials opposed the 
bill's requirement that the money be matched by regional public funds raised 
through a temporary increase in the local hotel occupancy taxes. San Diego's 
proposed fiscal '91 budget already calls for diverting money from arts and 
tourism programs financed by those revenues for more urgent needs. 
</P>
<P>
Even the normally cash-rich San Diego Unified Port District is beginning to 
count its pennies. The agency is fighting several lawsuits, which the port 
director says may put much of its surplus money in jeopardy. Port commissioners 
have already granted the organizing committee more than $100,000 to begin 
planning for the regatta; they will hear another appeal from Burnham on 
Tuesday. Cup organizers may have to stand in line behind the five bayside 
cities, including San Diego and the nearly bankrupt Imperial Beach, which also 
would like to receive some of the district's legendary cash surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Committee officials may even find San Diego corporate dollars wanting. Such 
contributions tend to come from corporate headquarters. Since the early 1980s, 
when Sail America received strong support from corporations headquartered in 
San Diego, the number of such offices here have dwindled. As a result, local 
arts and community groups that rely on corporate largess are finding huge voids 
in their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee isn't the only group facing money problems. The eight 
U.S. sailing syndicates hoping to vie for the privilege of defending the 
America's Cup in 1992 will be competing for donations to design and build their 
yachts and train their crews. 
</P>
<P>
Several well-financed potential foreign challengers already have boats built 
and in the water. So far, the only American hull to wet its keel is a scale 
model undergoing tank tests in Escondido. The American syndicates hope to make 
up for lost time by pooling design data, but even that technological advantage 
may not be enough to overcome the brimming coffers of some foreign challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Even the design of the new 75-foot, America's Cup-class racing sloop presents a 
problem. San Diego had more than enough docking space for its predecessor, but 
there are few available commercial berths in the harbor deep enough to 
accommodate the new boats. Dredging the berthing areas, anchoring barges in or 
building platforms out to deeper water may be too costly and environmentally 
unsound. San Diego Bay is plagued by several toxic "hot spots," many of them in 
areas already envisioned for regatta docking facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a world-class sporting event no doubt has its benefits for San Diego. 
Yet even the promise of $1.2 billion in revenues doesn't alleviate the doubts 
about the wisdom of publicly financing a yachting regatta. 
</P>
<P>
Yachting remains a rich man's sport. There are few chances to join a pick-up 
yacht race in Barrio Logan, Clairemont or anywhere else in the city except, 
perhaps, wealthy Point Loma, where the San Diego Yacht Club and other clubs are 
located. It is telling that most of the regatta organizers seeking public money 
for the race are political and fiscal conservatives who would most likely 
oppose public funding of much more needed programs. Furthermore, most of the 
regatta-generated revenue would be enjoyed by the tourism-related industries 
along the coast, while the region's poorer, inland communities would go 
wanting. 
</P>
<P>
The America's Cup has become less a tribute to good sportsmanship than to 
personal greed and power. That's how Dennis Conner himself summed it up to 
reporters two years ago. "The America's Cup is about money," he said. "Money, 
money, money, money. Then power and glory, power and glory, power and glory 
after that. That's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
The question is what price is that glory, and who should pay it?

IF CITIES CHANGE LAND-USE POLICIES, CALIFORNIANS MIGHT TAKE TO RAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Development Report, a newsletter based in Ventura that covers growth and 
development issues around the state.

VENTURA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 5, Californians will be presented with perhaps the most dramatic 
opportunity ever to break their decades-long love affair with the automobile. 
Two ballot measures, Propositions 108 and 116, hold out the possibility of 
allocating nearly $3 billion to rail-transit projects. And Proposition 111, the 
comprehensive gasoline-tax package, contains provisions likely to encourage 
even more investment in rail transit. 
</P>
<P>
If all three measures pass, the election results will be interpreted by 
politicians and transportation officials as a sweeping mandate to build 
rail-transit lines around the state, especially in auto-oriented Southern 
California. Proposition 108 would authorize a $1-billion bond issue for 
rail-transit projects; Proposition 116 would authorize another $2 billion in 
rail bonds, most of it earmarked for specific projects. Proposition 111 also 
contains some rail funding, and its so-called "congestion management" 
provisions would require local governments to undertake traffic-reduction 
efforts in order to qualify for a portion of the increased gas-tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
But even if all three are approved, the measures won't do much to relieve 
traffic congestion and improve the quality of life in California -- unless the 
vote is also interpreted as a broad mandate to change local land-use policies 
so that they support transit ridership. 
</P>
<P>
Simply approving bond issues and constructing rail lines won't guarantee people 
will ride rail transit. For rail to succeed, communities must be oriented 
around transit stations, with rail travel located within easy walking distance 
of many jobs, stores and, especially, homes. Pedestrian-oriented communities, 
with easy access between homes and rail-transit stations, are the "software" 
required to make the "hardware" of rail lines succeed. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are obvious: Most people will ride the rails when trains are a 
convenient alternative to driving. With the exception of some long-distance 
commuters, virtually no one who has to get into a car to reach a rail station 
is going to get out of that car and wait for a train. Most people will simply 
continue driving to their destination -- and with good reason. Under such 
circumstances, driving is easier, more convenient and probably faster than 
taking public transit. 
</P>
<P>
Some recent rail systems haven't come close to ridership projections. It was 
projected that Miami's new rail system would carry 240,000 riders in 1988; it 
drew only 35,000. Most of Miami's rail stations are accessible only by car. The 
software is missing. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, California's software programmers do not appear very interested 
in making the hardware work any better here. Land-use policy is a jealously 
guarded prerogative of local government, and most of California's 500-plus 
local governments are still pursuing land-use policies that reduce the 
potential for transit ridership. Influenced by slow-growth sentiment and 
frustration with traffic congestion, local politicians and planners continue to 
create spread-out communities that seek to solve growth problems by minimizing 
the number of new residents -- thereby maximizing dependence on the automobile. 
The idea of linking new subdivisions to potential transit lines usually does 
not arise. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the experience of BART in the San Francisco Bay Area suggests that 
even when suburban communities do agree to create clusters of high-density 
development around transit stations, they often leave out the one ingredient 
that is most necessary to make a transit system work: housing. A recent study 
for the Senate Office of Research found that East Bay cities, driven by fiscal 
concerns, have encouraged heavy commercial development around BART stations 
while discouraging housing construction. In several cities, high-density 
housing projects near transit stops have been killed by neighborhood 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Such an approach may help maintain communities that are financially sound, but 
it does nothing to alleviate traffic congestion. According to the same Senate 
study, only about 10% of people who work near transit stations ride BART. By 
contrast, 30%-40% of people who live near the stations use the rail system. In 
terms of creating a successful transit system -- and therefore reducing traffic 
congestion -- there is simply no substitute for clustering housing around 
transit stops. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of high-density housing constitutes a potent political force all over 
California. Hardly a day goes by without some neighborhood group somewhere 
making headlines by opposing an apartment building or condo complex, on the 
ground that it threatens to undermine their current low-density way of life. In 
the suburbs, all socioeconomic issues get narrowed, sooner or later, to a 
debate over housing units per acre. 
</P>
<P>
But even with opposition to high-density housing, there is still a chance for 
change in local land-use policies to improve rail transit ridership -- making 
rail transit work, especially in Southern California, doesn't necessarily mean 
more high-density housing. In many instances it may simply mean rearranging 
current land uses to encourage transit ridership. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the high cost of land, developers and home-buyers are already being 
forced to look at high-density alternatives. According to the Construction 
Industry Research Board, almost 40% of all housing units built in Southern 
California last year were apartments and condominiums. Most of these projects 
were probably built at a density of somewhere around 20 units per acre -- not 
enough to generate optimum transit ridership, but far more than the five to 
seven units per acre typically found in suburban subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that these apartments and condominiums, like everything else in 
Southern California, are flung across the landscape on the assumption that 
everyone who lives in them will drive everywhere. In urban areas as well as 
distant suburbs, apartment complexes are built as walled-off fortresses 
accessible only by car, even when they are built (as they often are) adjacent 
to shopping centers or employment districts -- because local land-use 
regulations usually require enormous parking lots, massive roads, buildings set 
back from the street and all the other trappings of suburban life, even for 
high-density apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a rail-transit stop were constructed a block away from this kind of 
project, only the hardiest pedestrian would brave vast parking lots and 
six-lane arterial highways to get there. Some localities are beginning to 
recognize the potential in combining rail transit with a more 
pedestrian-oriented community life. For example, the city of Irvine plans to 
convert its auto-oriented office corridor along Von Karman Avenue into a 
pedestrian-oriented "Main Street." The city recently approved two new office 
buildings by McDonnell Douglas Realty Co. in the Von Karman area, on the 
condition that the company build a half-mile monorail from John Wayne Airport 
to its buildings. The project is likely to form the basis for a countywide 
monorail system. 
</P>
<P>
But the Irvine example also reveals the shortcomings of even a farsighted local 
plan. In exchange for building the monorail, McDonnell Douglas got permission 
to build larger office buildings than permitted under the code. And the area 
contains little housing, meaning that the McDonnell Douglas project will 
probably be a duplicate of the East Bay situation: an office district clustered 
around a transit stop where virtually everyone drives to work. 
</P>
<P>
Two influential members of the state Senate -- Housing Chairman Leroy Greene 
(D-Carmichael) and Transportation Chairman Quentin L. Kopp(I-San Francisco) -- 
are sponsoring a pilot program to encourage high-density housing around transit 
stops. If the bill passes, communities that permit such housing would receive 
top priority for a whole slew of state grant programs. The bill is a worthy 
start toward using the state's own policies to reinforce rail-transit 
ridership. 
</P>
<P>
Potentially far more powerful are the "congestion management" provisions 
contained in Proposition 111. About $6 billion in funds would become available 
for local streets and roads -- but the money will be available only to local 
governments that undertake traffic-reduction efforts meeting with state 
approval. If it passes, Proposition 111's congestion-management provisions must 
be used not only to build roads, but to encourage a shift away from 
auto-oriented development. 
</P>
<P>
California desperately needs a major commitment to rail transit, and for that 
reason alone the passage of Propositions 108, 111 and 116 is imperative. But 
billions of dollars will be wasted unless local land-use policies are changed 
to make transit ridership easy and convenient. The mandate should not be just 
to build rail lines, but also to build a different kind of California -- a 
place where people who want to use rail transit don't have to get in their cars 
to do so.

FLAG BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I just opened The Times to Page 2 and saw the flag-burning photograph from 
Portland, Ore., where President Bush paid a visit for a political fund raiser 
(May 22). I was angry and ashamed to see a young lady holding the flag of our 
United States while watching it burn. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder our country is filled with crime and corruption when we allow this to 
happen. We are losing the fight for the respect of our wonderful United States 
by allowing flag burning. 
</P>
<P>
How can anyone in his right mind, be it a U.S. citizen, alien or a visitor, 
look inthe mirror after commiting this despicable act? 
</P>
<P>
Those who deliberately burn, mutilate or walk on our "red, white and blue" 
should be punished by law. I commend our government to take action now and stop 
this unlawful act.

REDUCING HANDICAPS FOR THE DISABLED; 
</P>
<P>
BOLD NEW LEGISLATION WOULD EXTEND PROTECTIONS TO BROADEN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 43 million Americans have trouble walking, talking, hearing and seeing. 
Most disabled men and women are unemployed and depend on public assistance to 
survive. Many are willing -- and able -- to work. Too often, they face physical 
or social barriers that prevent employment. The Disabled Americans Act would 
make those discriminatory barriers illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would extend the protections of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans 
job discrimination based on race, national origin or gender, to Americans who 
have physical and mental disabilities "affecting a major life function." Men 
and women who carry the AIDS virus would gain timely and compassionate 
protections against discrimination as well. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the workplace protections, the legislation, approved by the 
House of Representatives, would prohibit discrimination in hotels, stores, 
restaurants and other public accommodations. It would mandate as well equal 
access to public transportation and telephone services. 
</P>
<P>
After reconciliation with a bill passed earlier by the Senate, the legislation 
is expected to reach the White House before Congress breaks for the Fourth of 
July. The President's signature would guarantee a larger measure of 
independence for disabled Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Bush supports the broadened protections in the face of some business 
opposition. Sure, compliance would cost, but not the small fortune opponents 
claim. Typical expenses include the price of putting in a ramp, widening a door 
or hiring a sign-language interpreter. Those things can add up, but surely no 
business would go bankrupt making an office or store physically accessible to 
people with disabilities. Small businesses would be exempt from the new law, as 
would firms that would suffer "undue hardship" from the expense. Firms with 25 
or more employees would have two years to make changes; firms with 15 or more 
employees would have four years. Allowing firms to phase in the improvements 
would spread the expense in a reasonable fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Social access is as important as physical access. How many bosses have refused 
to hire a qualified worker who happens to be handicapped for fear of making 
other employees or clients uncomfortable? The new law would make such biases 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Discrimination based on race, gender, national origin or disability is contrary 
to the founding principles of this nation. The Disabled Americans Act would 
extend basic federal protections to broaden equal opportunity. All Americans 
would benefit.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although it is encouraging to see that the candidates for governor are 
concerned about education, I am not optimistic that the ultimate winner will 
retain that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
After all, George Deukmejian won the seat claiming that he would be a governor 
with education as his top priority. Nothing could be further from the truth! He 
has broken promises to the educational community concerning the implementation 
of Proposition 98. His budget proposals for the upcoming year will be 
devastating to our schools. 
</P>
<P>
So, I only wonder if the candidates will maintain their commitment towards 
education after election day.

Is the Cold War over? Not if Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues are having 
second thoughts about withdrawing Soviet troops from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Is the world becoming safer? Not if the United States accepts constraints on 
advanced weapons while dangerous Soviet intercontinental ballistic weapons 
remain unrestricted. 
</P>
<P>
Has democracy triumphed? Not yet. Not in the Soviet Union or China or almost 
anywhere in Asia outside of Japan. Not in the Middle East or Africa. While 
democracy spreads in Latin America, fundamentalism spreads in Muslim nations. 
</P>
<P>
Reason has not yet replaced force in Kashmir or Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq or 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush cannot write enough notes to comfort all the families of all the 
victims of violence -- in Nepal, Malaysia, Afghanistan, Jordan, Beirut and 
Nazareth. Secretary of State James A. Baker III cannot cut enough deals to 
eliminate all the proliferating weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
It is not true that the case for democracy has vanquished all opposing 
philosophies, only that it has vanquished European Marxism. We have not arrived 
at the Heavenly City of 18th-Century philosophers or the Crystal Palace of 
19th-Century prophets. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that no one knows what will happen next. The great movements of the 
20th Century have come as a surprise. Communism, fascism, Nazism, Islamic 
fundamentalism -- each was an unexpected development. Each seemed unlikely even 
as it fastened a fanatical grip on an unwary society. Lenin and his Bolsheviks 
were as implausible a band of conspirators as ever moved into a volatile 
political situation. They were as implausible as Hitler and the freakish 
freebooters who met with him in Bavaria and Berlin, as implausible as the 
Ayatollah Khomeini and his frenzied followers, as implausible as the Chinese 
Red Guard or Pol Pot's baby-faced killers in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Ours is a century of violent revolutions, each more unexpected than the last. 
It is a century of utopian dreams and megalomaniacal revolutionaries who, as 
rulers, move their subjects about like so many pawns on a gigantic chessboard 
-- into cities, out of cities; from re-education onto farms, from farms into 
re-education. 
</P>
<P>
Always the world is surprised. We are surprised by war and surprised by peace; 
surprised by economic growth (as in the Asian miracle) and surprised by 
economic failure (as under socialism). We were surprised by Stalin's ruthless 
conquests and by Gorbachev's abandonment of those conquests. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that we have not discerned the "laws" of historical development, 
probably because there are none. Individual leaders have a greater impact on 
history than we prefer to think because individuals are so unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what has happened since World War II has come as a surprise. And much 
that lies ahead will also surprise us. We did not foresee the resurgence of 
German and Japanese economic power, nor do we know the consequences for them or 
us of Japan's highly leveraged security market and wide-ranging acquisitions. 
No one anticipated the rapid liquidation of the Soviet Union's European empire. 
Nor did we foresee the Soviet government's sudden halt of its withdrawal from 
Eastern Europe. We do not know how long Gorbachev will retain power or what his 
policies will be while he remains. 
</P>
<P>
We are more involved with one another than ever, but that does not mean that we 
like each other better. Some Japanese dream of saying "no" to America. Some 
French will not say "yes" to NATO or to a special role for the United States in 
Europe. The size and shape of the European community are less certain than 
Brussels pretends. Difficulties in breaking East Germany out of the Warsaw Pact 
expand that unknown. Uncertainty hangs as heavy as London fog over the future, 
obscuring it. 
</P>
<P>
It is a good time now, in advance of the American-Soviet summit, for the U.S. 
government to step back and think again about a sweeping arms deal that does 
not affect the presence of Soviet troops and tanks in Europe or the continued 
production of ICBMs with a well-understood first-strike capability. 
</P>
<P>
It is time for the Bush Administration to reiterate Ronald Reagan's message at 
Reykjavik: A deal? Yes, but not at the price of enhanced American vulnerability 
in a still very uncertain world.

THE MAJORITY RULES, BUT NOT FOR LONG; 
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA'S VOTING POPULATION IS 80% WHITE; THE URBAN SCHOOLS' IS 20%. A 'NEW 
POLITICS' IS DAWNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD REEVES, Richard Reeves is a Washington-based columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be an election next week in a state called California, a pleasant 
and orderly nation of white people living well in Mediterranean climates along 
the Pacific Ocean between Oregon and Mexico. The big contest is between Atty. 
Gen. John Van de Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein for the 
Democratic nomination for governor. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will face Republican Sen. Pete Wilson in November for the chance to 
govern a place called California, an unruly and rather wary conglomeration of 
people of many colors, many incomes, many cultures. 
</P>
<P>
There are two Californias sharing the same space these days, in different 
decades, different time zones. There is a 20-year gap, at least, between 
California on election days and California on any other day of the year. Next 
Tuesday, more than 80% of the voters will be white. Next Wednesday, almost half 
of California will be black and many shades of brown and tan. 
</P>
<P>
The current coexistence of old and new Californias is one of the most 
extraordinary episodes of change in American history -- and most American 
history is about change. The voting population of California in the 1980s was, 
and will be on June 5, between 80% and 85% white -- and 7% black, 7% Latino and 
2% or 3% Asian. But the overall population is now estimated at only 58% white 
-- or Anglo, as most say here. "Euro-American" is used by some scholars in 
anticipation of the day, not far away, when Anglos are again a minority here, 
as they were until the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The overall population, as opposed to the voting citizenry, includes both 
children and non-citizens, including immigrants, some legal, some not. But if 
you used demographic statistics including only actual U.S. citizens above the 
voting age of 18, the white total would still reach only a little more than 
60%. 
</P>
<P>
"There are new and potentially dangerous pressures in the demographic gaps 
now," said Mervyn Field, director of the California Poll, which produced some 
of the figures used here. "The non-voters are becoming more and more different 
from voters in color, class and life-style." 
</P>
<P>
The time and place to see that is any Sunday at the intersection of Alvarado 
and 7th streets near downtown Los Angeles. If you are white and middle-aged, as 
I am, you can sit in Langer's delicatessen with a collection of urban types as 
American as bagels and lox -- a cross-section of the people who vote in Los 
Angeles and most other American cities, Jewish and Christian, most white but a 
couple of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Step outside and you magically transcend great distance and time. You are in 
Guatemala City. The streets are crowded with families, all Latino, speaking 
Spanish in the accents of Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua and 
Honduras. Men wait in long lines to buy ices or to make telephone calls. 
Children chase each other through a maze of food stalls along the edge of 
Westlake Park. There is nothing visible to indicate that this is the United 
States until three Los Angeles Fire Department trucks come screaming down 
Alvarado as if they were spaceships from another planet. How many people on the 
streets are legally in this country? Maybe half, but the ones who have American 
citizenship don't often vote -- and neither do the Asians, mostly legal, in 
other parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
If Langer's customers reflect today's voting, Alvarado, Koreatown and Asian 
neighborhoods up and down the coast reflect tomorrow's California. More than 
80% of the children in the lower grades of Los Angeles schools are "people of 
color." Only 33% of the students are white at Berkeley, the best of the fine 
schools that make up the University of California system. Ten years ago, the 
proportion of whites at Berkeley was 58%, but their numbers have eroded with 
affirmative action and the scholastic achievements of Asians and 
Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The schools, from kindergarten to college, are where the races and cultures of 
modern California come together -- and divide. White resentment over admission 
to the state university is balanced by minority-group resentment about the 
flight of white students from public schools, usually followed by the 
reluctance of voters and politicians to pay or levy taxes to maintain the kind 
of high-quality California schools represented by the Norman Rockwell past. 
</P>
<P>
So next Tuesday, white voters will choose Van de Kamp or Feinstein to oppose 
Wilson. But the victory photos will look like old tintypes the moment they are 
developed. This is already the politics of the past in the California.

DIRECTORS JOIN MOVE TO PROTECT FILM RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joe Scott 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Filmland politics: Move over, corporate Hollywood, Jack Valenti and the Motion 
Picture Assn. of America. Actors, writers and directors have long supported a 
variety of political candidates and causes. But now they are aggressively 
moving into industry-related political issues. 
</P>
<P>
That it's a new ballgame recently became evident when two well-known directors 
-- Steven Spielberg and Barry Levinson -- easily raised $100,000 from 
colleagues for the reelection campaign of -- are you ready? -- Rep. Robert J. 
Mrazek (D-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
That Mrazek could raise such a large sum in one day in Hollywood sent shock 
waves across Capitol Hill. It is a signal to politicians eager for 
entertainment dough that the creative side of filmland is entering the 
legislative arena in a major way to protect artists' rights. 
</P>
<P>
Mrazek was tapped by Spielberg and Levinson because the New York congressman 
sponsored a bill that created the National Film Preservation Board, which has 
already designated 25 films as national treasures. He has also supported 
legislation that safeguards the artistic integrity of films. 
</P>
<P>
What worries Spielberg and Levinson is the lack of legal protection for film 
artists on such technical matters as scoring, dialogue, wardrobe and set 
design. 
</P>
<P>
Turning up the heat on movie moguls, Spielberg was quoted as decrying the idea 
of corporate meddling because "someone thinks it's a good idea to turn the four 
hours of 'Gone With the Wind' into a rock opera." 
</P>
<P>
 Whispers: Should Councilman Robert Farrell, Tom Bradley's choice for the 
Democratic Assembly seat now held by Maxine Waters, win the primary nomination 
June 5, who is the mayor's choice to succeed him in City Hall? Insiders hint 
that Bradley will be in the corner of Los Angeles Board of Education member 
Rita Walters . . . Here's proof that explaining a complicated issue like 
reapportionment to voters requires a gimmick: GOP redistricting gurus are 
playing a "Star Wars" image game with the Democrats. Seeking to offset a 
potential edge that Democrats may have by recruiting Jack Lemmon to appear in a 
TV ad opposing Propositions 118 and 119, proponents have countered with another 
big Hollywood name: Charlton Heston. The ad will begin airing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
No one was more puzzled than GOP gubernatorial candidate Sen. Pete Wilson by 
President Bush's failure to announce his decision on offshore oil drilling last 
week during a stop in Venice, a stone's throw from Santa Monica Bay. Wilson, a 
staunch foe of any drilling, hitched a ride back to Washington on Air Force 1, 
but had no clearer idea on touchdown, or afterward, about where the ambivalent 
President stands . . . Waking up the echoes: the caption on one paid GOP 
slate-card mailer to high-propensity voters before primary day reads: "Vote 
Republican: Keep the Reagan Revolution Alive."

CHINA'S QUEST FOR CHINA; 
</P>
<P>
THE SEARCH FOR MODERN CHINA BY JONATHAN D. SPENCE (W.W. NORTON: $29.95; 876 
PP.,ILLUSTRATED; 0-393-02708-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Frank Ching, Ching, former China correspondent of The Wall Street Journal, 
is the author of Ancestors: 900 Years in the Life of a Chinese Family (William 
Morrow). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1759, Li Syiyao, the viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi, submitted to the 
Qianlong emperor a draft of "Regulations for the Control of Foreigners." In the 
memorial, the viceroy expressed amazement and horror at the fact that some 
foreigners had been able to learn to speak and write Chinese, while one of them 
could understand not just Mandarin but also the Cantonese dialect. 
</P>
<P>
"How could these foreigners have learned Chinese if they had not been taught 
secretly by traitors?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The viceroy continued: "It is my most humble opinion that when uncultured 
barbarians, who live far beyond the borders of China, come to our country to 
trade, they should establish no contact with the population, except for 
business purposes." 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Empire in those days went to great lengths to keep even its 
language a secret from foreigners. When an English merchant, James Flint, 
presented a petition levying charges against the superintendent of customs, the 
emperor, after verifying the allegations, dismissed the official, sentenced 
Flint to three years of exile in Macao for having violated protocol, and had 
the Sichuanese who helped him prepare the Chinese-language petition publicly 
beheaded. 
</P>
<P>
This obsession with secrecy, this passion to prevent foreigners from finding 
out what China is really like, accounts to some extent for the myths and 
mystique surrounding China. Even Deng Xiaoping has said that one has to go back 
to the Ming Dynasty, to the time when the 15th-Century explorer Zheng He went 
on expeditions to the western oceans, to discover a time when China did not 
practice a closed-door policy. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan D. Spence in "The Search for Modern China" endeavors to facilitate an 
understanding of China. He says, quite rightly, that "in trying to understand 
China today we need to know about China in the past." That is why Spence begins 
his narrative in the late 16th Century, when China was ruled by its last native 
dynasty on the eve of the Manchu conquest. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the Yale historian explains that his book is not about modern 
China. Rather, it is about a centuries-long effort to create such a country, 
one which "is both integrated and receptive, fairly sure of its own identity, 
yet able to join others on equal terms in the quest for new markets, new 
technologies, new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
By this definition, Spence says, China is not today and never has been a modern 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, China in the Qing Dynasty was far from being "fairly sure of its own 
identity, yet able to join others on equal terms." As Spence points out, China 
did not even have a national flag in its 4,000 years of existence, until one 
was created in the 19th Century, when the country consciously began to acquire 
what it thought were the attributes of a modern nation. 
</P>
<P>
As is to be expected, Spence finds numerous parallels in Chinese history. Thus 
he likens Gen. Claire Chennault's World War II "Flying Tigers" to the foreign 
mercenary Ever-Victorious Army formed to fight the Taiping rebels; he sees 
similarities between Great Leap Forward rhetoric and the vision of Hong 
Xiuquan, the Taiping Heavenly King, and he compares the Shanghai Communique of 
1972 with the Treaty of Nerchinsk of 1689. 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean, of course, that China is unchanging. During the Qing 
Dynasty, for example, China spurned British requests to develop trade. Spence 
quotes the Qianlong emperor's message to George III of England: 
</P>
<P>
"We have never valued ingenious articles, nor do we have the slightest need of 
your country's manufactures. Therefore, O king, as regards your request to send 
someone to remain at the capital, while it is not in harmony with the 
regulations of the Celestial Empire, we also feel very much that it is of no 
advantage to your country." 
</P>
<P>
This disdain for trade has now been replaced by eagerness to earn foreign 
exchange. Recently, we saw China go to great lengths in its attempt to retain 
most-favored-nation trading status with the United States. In the weeks before 
Washington was to decide whether to renew China's trading privileges, Beijing 
went so far as to lift martial law in Tibet and to release hundreds of 
political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Spence has an eye for the telling detail, the little twists of fate that propel 
history forward. Thus he says that when two Soviet nuclear experts were 
withdrawn from China during the Sino-Soviet dispute, they tore to shreds all 
the documents they could not take with them. But the Chinese painstakingly 
reconstructed the shredded documents and "found in them crucial information on 
atomic implosion." 
</P>
<P>
This is by no means a book that can be read in one sitting. Some of Spence's 
earlier books were page-turners: "The Death of Woman Wang" was as gripping as 
any thriller; "Emperor of China: Self-Portrait of K'ang-hsi" was poignant and 
stirred one's deepest emotions. 
</P>
<P>
But "The Search for Modern China" is the most ambitious work by the author thus 
far. It is encyclopedic in scope. It is crammed with facts, dates and names. 
Its 876 pages include 49 well placed maps and 49 well chosen tables, as well as 
dozens of illustrations in color and black-and-white. Its contents are to be 
sipped and savored, not swallowed in big gulps. 
</P>
<P>
Spence, the master historian, is on less sure ground when dealing with more 
recent events. Thus he has Chiang Ching-kuo becoming president of Taiwan in 
1975, three years too early. He also displays an uncertain grasp of his facts 
regarding the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
But these petty details are almost not worth mentioning when one considers the 
scale of the task that he set himself. "The Search for Modern China" is a 
landmark in China scholarship. Spence's talent as a raconteur and his immensely 
readable style enable him to succeed in making history interesting to the 
nonspecialist. 
</P>
<P>
On the present succession crisis in China, Spence points out the eerie parallel 
between Deng Xiaoping's behavior today and that of Mao Zedong in his last 
years, with each man anointing, then purging, one hand-picked successor after 
another. Even greater perspective is provided by his relating the present 
situation to that of the early Qing Dynasty, when the Emperor Kangxi was 
brought, as Spence put it, "to the edge of despair" by the succession question, 
not being able to decide which of his many sons to name as his heir. 
</P>
<P>
The author provides a rare perspective on China's centuries-old struggle to 
come to terms with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls that the reformers of 1898 had sought to resolve this tension by 
developing the concept of ti, or "essence," and yong, or "practical use." This 
formulation, Spence says, "affirmed that there was indeed a fundamental 
structure of Chinese moral and philosophical values that gave continuity and 
meaning to the civilization. Holding onto that belief, China could then afford 
to adopt quickly and dramatically all sorts of Western practices, and to hire 
Western advisers." 
</P>
<P>
Spence sees Deng and the other Chinese leaders today falling victim "to the 
nineteenth-century fallacy that China could join the modern world entirely on 
its own terms, sacrificing nothing of its prevailing ideological purity." 
</P>
<P>
He feels this effort is doomed to failure. "The task was even more hopeless in 
the late 1980s than it had been in the 1880s," Spence concludes. "What was left 
of Chinese communist doctrine after the rejection of many of Mao's ideas and 
the emergence of the enterprise system was a thinner gruel even than the 
overformalized Confucianism that had guided the reformers of the late Qing. The 
party elders flailing out at Zhao Ziyang and his noisy supporters were reacting 
in an oddly similar way to the empress dowager Cixi as she struck back at 
Emperor Guangxu for attempting his Hundred Days' Reforms." 
</P>
<P>
As Spence and other students of history are well aware, circumstances in later 
years forced the empress dowager to implement even more radical reform measures 
than the ones that her nephew the emperor tried to put in place. But those came 
too late to save the dynasty.

NO, BUT I READ THE SCREENPLAY; 
</P>
<P>
WALTER WINCHELL A NOVEL BY MICHAEL HERR (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $18.95; 156 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Ceplair, Ceplair is the editor of The Public Years of Sarah and 
Angelina Grimke (Columbia University Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A novel that begins with a preface is like a play subtitled "a comedy" -- a 
signal of the author's doubts. This particular preface is no false alarm. The 
reader is told: "You could call it a screenplay that's typed like a novel, that 
reads like a novel but plays like a movie. Maybe it's a completely new form, or 
a wrinkle on an old form, or a mongrel. Maybe it's just a novel with a camera 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it is just sheer laziness. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Herr, author of one of the finest collections of essays on the Vietnam 
War ("Dispatches") and co-author of one of the worst movies on war ("Full Metal 
Jacket"), has written what is, in effect, a glorified treatment for a movie 
about Walter Winchell. It is not quite a screenplay; it is not a biography; it 
is not a journalistic examination or expose; it is not a novel. It is, however, 
profoundly uninteresting. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that are only too obvious, Herr's "screenplay" did not please the 
producer. For reasons still evident, but less justifiable, Herr has tried to 
palm off his failed "screenplay" as a new type of novel, and his publisher has 
aided and abetted him, with phrases like "equal parts novel, screenplay, 
biography, and cinematic dream." 
</P>
<P>
A screenplay is a useful, but limited, form of writing. It is the sine qua non 
of a good movie, and it is an essential item of research for authors analyzing 
movies and preparing biographies of screen writers. Though many are well 
crafted, few are works of art, and even fewer repay reading them for the sake 
of reading them. That goes double for hybrids. 
</P>
<P>
Literary depth and camera depth are two different entities. The language of the 
screen and the language of the page are two different tongues. Perhaps a very 
gifted writer-director can bridge the gap, letting us see in the script what 
will appear in the viewfinder. 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence in "Walter Winchell" that Herr has a cinematic eye. There 
is massive evidence that he fancies he does. But the juxtaposition of camera 
directions with narrative prose only emphasizes the jury-rigged nature of the 
whole project. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if filmed, the story of Walter Winchell, as Herr has conceived it, 
would have worked. Perhaps a talented director could have made something 
interesting out of the material. But he or she would have had to be a wizard 
with technique, because Herr's "scenes" are very static, and he has provided 
very little content. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably, Winchell the man, or Winchell the celebrity, offered the possibility 
of a lens through which some otherwise hidden truth about human nature or U.S. 
history could have been viewed and appreciated. After all, he was perhaps the 
most-read and listened-to reporter in the United States during the '30s and 
'40s. He associated with some of the most loathsome personalities of the time 
(gangster Owney Madden; J. Edgar Hoover; William Randolph Hearst; Sen. Joseph 
McCarthy). He was a confidant of President Franklin D. Roosevelt; he publicly 
confronted Martin Dies, the chairman of the House Committee on Un-American 
Activities, and he feuded with a large number of famous people, including 
President Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
Herr seems to see Winchell as an icon, symbolizing the vulgarity of U.S. 
culture and the strange elements that constitute American patriotism; as a 
self-created celebrity with a built-in destructiveness, both creator and victim 
of a celebrity-adoring/hating attitude among the citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
These insights are visible, but they are not depicted in a compelling literary 
or cinematic manner. Herr is interested only in surfaces. And he makes a virtue 
of what I consider this manuscript's flaws: the "flat and telegrammatic prose," 
the "externalizing" dialogue, and the presentation of the various characters 
"as types . . . in true biopic style." 
</P>
<P>
Since his characters "were not particularly famous for their introspection," he 
has decided to make their dialogue the action for the plot. One is forced to 
conclude that either Herr needs more practice with that device or that it is a 
red herring concocted by a writer who did not know how to get inside his 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the conclusion, "Walter Winchell" is a shallow deceit, a major 
disappointment from the writer whose journalistic skills and literary 
imagination took the reader, via "Dispatches," deep into the interior of the 
Vietnam combat experience.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: ETHNIC L.A. BY ZENA PEARLSTONE (HILLCREST PRESS, P.O. BOX

Los Angeles is the second-largest Mexican, Armenian, Korean, Filipino, 
Salvadoran and Guatemalan city in the world, and more than 50 foreign-language 
newspapers are published in L.A. County, says Zena Pearlstone in "Ethnic L.A." 
Her book describes the enormous human diversity of the city, to which the 
author applies the metaphor mosaic rather than melting pot, because the 
communities tend to retain their individual characters. With its statistics and 
local histories of the various ethnic groups, this book can be used as a 
reference, or it can function as a guidebook: It concludes with lists of ethnic 
foods, religious centers and a calendar of celebrations that could keep any 
tourist occupied every day of the year. Sonja Bolle

DESIRE IN L.A. BY MARTHA CLARE RONK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pull away from the map of the mind sprawls 
</P>
<P>
over the whole of city streets, L.A. extends 
</P>
<P>
our own errands and where we have to get to, you 
</P>
<P>
are far away, left at corners where one awning tears 
</P>
<P>
in the once-a-year wind, where the wind blows 
</P>
<P>
the trees as we stand over the open grave, 
</P>
<P>
the one we love; planes taking off from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Waves turn to go out to sea, 
</P>
<P>
a whole city expanding like the universe, 
</P>
<P>
each drive up canyons, each centrifugal wind reaching 
</P>
<P>
beyond what used to be the limits of a city 
</P>
<P>
and none of us can stop 
</P>
<P>
pushing beyond our time, our money, the need 
</P>
<P>
for some outskirts of a city already wholly outskirts, 
</P>
<P>
reaching for, like erotic desire, the nether parts. 
</P>
<P>
Mannered fingers and necks elongate beyond themselves, 
</P>
<P>
skin hurts drying in the wind, 
</P>
<P>
and waiting to find transparent expansion 
</P>
<P>
into the upper reaches of not even belief, 
</P>
<P>
but craving our own unbelief 
</P>
<P>
and that image of another's skirt 
</P>
<P>
lifted by the warm, slightly soiled air of an open grate.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE AMERICAN CIRCUS AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY BY JOHN CULHANE 
(HENRY HOLT: $39.95; 504 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Hall Kaplan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before television, amusement parks, country fairs, public zoos and 
entertainment zones, there was the circus. In the United States, ever since 
1785 when in Philadelphia a Thomas Pool presented "Feats of Horsemanship . . . 
and a Clown to Amuse the Spectators," the circus has enthralled ladies and 
gentlemen and children of all ages with increasingly spectacular acts and 
abiding dedication, under makeshift tents, in sports arenas and in open fields. 
</P>
<P>
Author and sometime performing clown John Culhane notes in his three-ring 
effort of a book that the history of the circus has been rich and rocky, marked 
by storybook characters and magical moments, personal tragedies and public 
disasters. It has been, in effect, a theatrical high-wire act, teetering 
between failure and acclaim, and Culhane in his obvious enthusiasm tries to 
tell it all. 
</P>
<P>
Culhane's narrative begins with pioneer Pool's performances and moves through 
the turbulent era of P. T. Barnum, his competition with Bailey, their merger, 
the rise of the Ringling brothers, their merger with Barnum and Bailey in 1919 
to create the halcyon days of the super circus, to the present diverse efforts. 
The institutional history is interspersed with the legends of Buffalo Bill and 
Annie Oakley, animal trainer Clyde Beatty, the acrobatic Great Wallendas, clown 
Emmett Kelly, Gunther Gebel Williams and his cage of mixed cats, and dozens of 
other lesser characters who have performed under the Big Top. 
</P>
<P>
The total is an evocative, somewhat overflowing, starry-eyed history of a 
grand, if wavering, tradition. Culhane's effort reads not unlike the feat of 
immortal clown and contortionist Lou Jacobs, who orchestrated the packing of a 
midget car with a gaggle of clowns. And while the illustrations could have been 
of better quality and the design more imaginative (as would befit the book's 
subject and price), "The American Circus" as a history of an endearing 
theatrical tradition deserves the center ring.Sam Hall Kaplan

TENURED RADICALS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I share Donald Lazere's dismay at the reductive, fraudulent arguments that 
conservative cultural critics have been aiming at American higher education. 
Lazere's efforts to set the record straight by doing the research that the 
Kimballs and Sykeses only pretend to do are valuable for checking the 
misperception of what goes on in colleges and universities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, I was dismayed to read in his litany of what "leftists" and 
Kimball find distasteful: " . . . Paul de Man (whose posthumous exposure as a 
Nazi collaborator confirmed leftists' belief that deconstruction was a 
conservative movement)." Lazere's comment is no less scurrilous than the gossip 
for which he rightly chastises Kimball. It substitutes the reviewer's bogeyman 
for the author's and begs an equally irresponsible analogy between left culture 
criticism and Stalinism. 
</P>
<P>
I do not want to explain away De Man's wartime journalism . . . (some 
anti-Semitic comments in newspaper reviews, as Lazere does not tell us -- did 
he rely on Newsweek's sensationalism, or does he suppress the information 
hoping that we will think the worst?) but its mention here is a red herring. 
His "leftist" objection is to a certain moment in deconstruction's 
Americanization that threatened to reduce it to a method of close reading, 
conservative in being apolitical. De Man's wartime writing, obviously 
political, did not produce deconstruction or vice-versa, as Lazere deceptively 
suggests. . . .

SIMONE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reference to Richard Eder's review of "Simone de Beauvoir: A Biography" by 
Dierdre Bair (Book Review, April 15), Mr. Eder writes of Sartre's final years: 
"Old and ill, he gave a series of interviews to Benny Levy, a young Maoist 
adept whom many of the old Sartrians saw as an evil genius, in which he notably 
reversed the existentialist notion of the autonomous man." What was Beauvoir's 
reaction to such goings on? 
</P>
<P>
Again, Eder according to Bair: "Beauvoir wept tears of rage when she read the 
manuscript. For her, the ideas she and Sartre had worked on were her life. For 
him, they were a corset that made him look stiff and old." 
</P>
<P>
I have to question, or at least wonder about, Ms. Bair's scholarship when I 
compare the above with the first volume of John Gerassi's biography of Sartre, 
"Jean-Paul Sartre: Hated Conscience of His Century." Gerassi, the authorized 
biographer of Sartre and friend to both Sartre and Beauvoir, writes, " 'Tell 
me, Sartre,' I asked him in 1979 during one of his rare moments of lucidity, 
'is it true that you have renounced the dialectic and found God?' He exploded 
in his famous guttural laughter. 'I tell them what they want to hear . . . but 
don't you print that until they have all published their new analyses. Think 
carefully, Gerassi. Right now, as France turns far right, all these 
opportunists will go with it. For the foreseeable future, they are the future.' 
" And Sartre concludes, "All I want out of the future, whatever of it there is, 
is to be read." 
</P>
<P>
Seeing that Sartre and Beauvoir were as close as any two people have ever been, 
I find it hard to believe that she was not let in on his little scheme. As for 
the rest of the book's scholarship, who knows? I just know that I won't be 
reading a book that doesn't even bother to look behind what are seemingly the 
most complete changes of opinion taken by any philosopher at any time in 
history.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: DISRAELI BY JOHN VINCENT (OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $5.95) 
</P>

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON

<TEXT>
<P>
In this stuffy biography, John Vincent traces the motivations behind Benjamin 
Disraeli's political actions to passages in his novels, which few people in 
England, and even fewer in America, still read. Oxford's "Past Masters" series 
is supposed to provide "concise, lucid, authoritative introductions to the 
thoughts of leading intellectual figures of the past whose ideas still 
influence the way we think today." But Vincent fails to explain the issues and 
crises that his subjects faced: Anyone who could follow this stolid account of 
Disraeli's career wouldn't need an introduction to the colorful statesman's 
career.

(ECCO PRESS: $8.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although many of the stories in this anthology are set in the Pacific 
Northwest, Tobias Wolff's talent transcends regional boundaries. In crisp, 
hard-edged prose, he delineates bleak miniature worlds that encompass the 
disillusionment of contemporary life. 
</P>
<P>
The reader watches with impotent alarm as a botched practical joke releases the 
hatred and fear needed to commit murder in "Hunters in the Snow." In the title 
story, the smug hypocrisy of a faculty search committee forces a shy professor 
to speak the truth in her lecture. Citing the example of the Iroquois, she 
admonishes her dumbfounded students to "Be kind. Do justice. Walk humbly." On a 
lighter note, in "The Liar," a young man discovers that falsehood can become so 
gloriously entertaining that it appears more vivid than the truth. An 
exceptional collection of short fiction.

</P>

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A vivid, warmly nostalgic novel that evokes a child's vision of the 4th of July 
weekend, 1935. While visiting a farm in Upstate New York, Mary Ann Hubbard (who 
prefers to style herself Princess Miranda) and her shy friend, Lolly Zimmern, 
play games of make-believe as they watch the grownups play games of their own: 
some silly, some deadly serious. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann's father, a stuffy bureaucrat, arrives with a briefcase full of papers 
and refuses to leave his work for even a few hours of leisure. Her mother, a 
fading, flirtatious Southern belle, turns her charms on Lolly's calculating, 
hearty father -- to the horror of his neurotic, clinging wife. It falls to 
Anna, the wise Earth Mother figure who owns the farm and the progressive school 
the girls attend, to show the nominal adults the the meaning of independence 
and maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Alison Lurie's gentle sense of irony ensures that the resulting contretemps end 
happily and teach the adults the folly of believing too strongly in their own 
make-believe worlds.

PSYCHIC SHOPPERS AT EXPO FIND AISLES FULL OF VISIONARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

Thea-Dianne McCall had paid $5 to have her aura analyzed Saturday, and she 
wanted her money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
She handed a photograph of herself to a clairvoyant interpreter at Energy 
Vision, one of hundreds of promotional booths at the Whole Life Expo, a new age 
fair at the San Diego Convention Center through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"You're forgiving yourself for being born into a female body. You have a lot of 
enthusiasm," the dark-haired interpreter said, pointing to a golden glow around 
McCall's head. "There's an image of a witch here. It looks like your mother put 
it there. It's affecting your self-image." 
</P>
<P>
McCall nodded and wandered over to another interpreter, a tiny blond woman who 
was complimenting a customer on her "nicely-shaped" blue aura. McCall wanted a 
second opinion. She didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, it's the same thing she said," said the blond, who looked suddenly tense. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. Between the aromatherapy and the ecstasy breathing, the bee 
pollen and the Relaxman glasses, there were dozens of tension remedies on 
display in the cavernous exhibit hall. And for every peddler of diet 
supplements and subliminal cassette tapes, there were 10 people eager to 
believe that self-fulfillment waited at the next booth. 
</P>
<P>
Touted as the world's largest showcase of "leading edge issues, products and 
personalities," San Diego's first Whole Life Expo was more than a psychic 
shopping trip. As well as lectures and panel discussions featuring such big 
names in consciousness-raising as Timothy Leary and Terry Cole-Whittaker, the 
Expo also attempted to address "key issues": substance abuse, environmental 
degradation and financial investment. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, this show has concentrated on 'new age' subjects such as 
metaphysics, crystals, UFO's, channeling and psychics -- but times have 
changed," said Joy Jacot, the Expo's producer. "We've expanded our focus." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, among the 300 exhibitors, there were several booths that sold re-usable 
canvass shopping bags, water purifiers and other eco-conscious products. But 
mostly, the vendors seemed to be selling self-improvement -- and all the health 
and optimism that comes with it. 
</P>
<P>
There were nutrient drinks with names like Natural Drive, GreenMagma and 
Megafood. There were brain synchronizers -- glasses, fitted with flashing 
lights and earphones, that enhance creativity, vendors said, by emitting tones 
that help the brain's right and left hemispheres work together. There was a man 
who said that magnets have been known to cure cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"With the appropriate magnet, you can kill 85% of all types of pain. The more 
severe the pain, the quicker the results," said Dr. Jesse F. Partridge, a 
magno-therapy expert whose booth was flanked with graphic color photographs of 
a man with a large growth on his nose. After a magnet was held over his nose 
for three hours a day, Partridge said, the bump went away. Partridge said he 
had the pictures to prove it -- or most of them, at least. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst one, I had to quit showing. It made the ladies sick," he said. 
</P>

Ken Anderson, the co-owner of Mental Building Blocks, described his subliminal 
cassette tapes for children as "the most lasting love gift you'll ever buy." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said his grandchildren listen to the tapes every night while they 
sleep. On each hour-long cassette, there are 10,000 positive affirmations -- 
including, "I love myself. I am beautiful. I am loved. I am love." -- all set 
to a rhythmic music that imitates a mother's heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
"If they sleep eight hours, that's 80,000 loving repetitions that goes into 
their little minds," Anderson said. "It doesn't make zombies out of them. The 
little buggers come out swinging."

Helen Pappas, a director of Mr. Bee Pollen in Newport Beach, beckoned to 
passers-by with two gold antennae that bobbed on her head. Bee pollen has been 
known to reduce blood pressure, correct allergies and solve sexual problems, 
according to a pamphlet Pappas offered. 
</P>
<P>
"You can live on bee pollen alone," she said, pushing a tiny spoon into a bowl 
of yellow granules. "It's not only energy, but a source of well-being. We call 
it the life changer." 
</P>
<P>
Rob Potter, an associate of the Laguna Beach-based pyramid vendor Pyradyne 
Inc., urged people to put pyramids on their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"Pyramids make your brain waves go into Alpha," he said. "All our pollutions in 
the air are eating up our life force, or prana. The pyramid delivers prana to 
the brain. On a clean healthy planet, you wouldn't need to wear a pyramid on 
your head. But . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Potter paused, and then confided: "A lot of this technology is extraterrestrial 
in nature." 
</P>

At the booth labeled Psychic Perceptions by Joyce, Joyce Zakrajsek furiously 
drew circles on a note pad as she spoke quietly to a customer. In a few 
minutes, Joyce stopped scribbling, hugged the customer goodby and bit into a 
breath mint. 
</P>
<P>
"The energy point is in her hand," said her manager, Nicholas Joseph, 
explaining to the next person in line why she had to wait for the next $25 
channeling session. "This drains her. She needs to go charge herself." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Tessa, a delicate woman in black tights, offered to unfold life's 
promises via computer astrology. 
</P>
<P>
"I need your birth-time," Tessa told a woman who was waiting to pay $25 to have 
her life progression analyzed, a year at a time, using secondary progressed 
planets. 
</P>
<P>
"I only know Hawaii time," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's no problem," said Tessa. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Expo's hard-sell, not everyone was sold. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, fresh from a psychic consultation, pooh-poohed the advice she'd been 
given. "I have to learn to trust men? Give me a break," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another man eyed a steady stream of people who took turns standing under 
something called an Ion Shower, a nozzle that had no visible output at all. 
</P>
<P>
"You should open up a booth right now, selling oceanfront property on the 
moon," the man muttered. "I'll tell you, you'd make a killing."

THE QUESTION THAT SOWS DISTRUST; 
</P>
<P>
RACISM: TRANSPLANTED TEXAN DISCOVERS THAT ALL TOO OFTER SKIN COLOR IS SOLE 
BASIS BY WHICH PEOPLE ARE JUDGED IN SAN DIEGO, AND IT RAISES SOME FUNDAMENTAL 
QUESTIONS ABOUT CITIZENSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I often forget my dark complexion. 
</P>
<P>
This admission is important because it explains my utter surprise and disbelief 
at being approached by a U.S. Border Patrol agent on a recent, early-morning 
Amtrak ride from San Diego to Los Angeles, and asked this question: "Where are 
you from, sir?" 
</P>
<P>
Quite simply, I was taken aback. So much so that my tongue temporarily wouldn't 
work. Those milliseconds when I was attempting to fashion a response to the 
question seemed like an eternity, and I thought: "Oh no, he notices your 
hesitation. Now he's convinced you're not a U.S. citizen." 
</P>
<P>
I managed to get the words out: "I'm from San Diego." The accentless English 
was apparently enough to satisfy the agent. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty seconds later, I could barely contain my anger. If I'd been slightly 
more awake and had my wits about me, I would have answered: "Where are you 
from?" Or better yet: "Soy de San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
In either language, I was lying. I'm not from San Diego, or Los Angeles -- to 
which I've recently moved. I'm from San Antonio, Tex., and in my 25 years 
there, I never encountered as much blatant racial distrust as I have in 
slightly less than 12 months of living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
First, there was the taunt of an angry driver who thought I was taking too much 
time crossing a street in Mission Hills: "Go back to Tijuana!" 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the owner of my girlfriend's apartment building, who curtly 
asked why I was waiting outside the complex. His dubious reaction to my 
response told me his suspicion was unallayed. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the police officer who ticketed me for making an illegal pass. I 
admit guilt to the hasty driving, but there was something odd here. The officer 
followed me for several blocks from the infraction, but didn't stop me until 
after he had pulled alongside my car at a stop light. 
</P>
<P>
Believe me, I'm not hyper-sensitive to this sort of thing, but these episodes 
have gotten under my dark -- and usually thick -- skin. In fact, the odd 
circumstances surrounding the ticket didn't even occur to me until after I had 
described the incident to a non-Latino friend, and she suggested the officer's 
possible motivation. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was the incident on the train. The agent was polite and very 
professional. No complaints there. And though he was just doing his job, I 
hardly fit the profile of someone trying to sneak into the country. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, I have long harbored a fantasy about a case of mistaken 
citizenship. It's a humorous idea for a short story, or better yet, a stage 
work: A U.S. citizen of Mexican descent is stopped as he attempts to reenter 
the United States. He has lost his wallet and, despite his perfect English, 
can't prove he's an American. He resorts to doing a John Wayne imitation. 
</P>
<P>
There is a current stage play on the subject: "De Donde?" (shorthand for "Where 
are you from?") -- a production by the Friends and Artists Ensemble in Los 
Angeles. In his Times review of the show, writer Ray Loynd said "For Angelenos, 
the play hits close to home and humanizes whatever imagery, cliches and 
certitudes we have tucked away in the back of our heads about that border 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Two phrases stick out there. The first: "For Angelenos, the play hits close to 
home . . . " Actually, it hits close to home for all Southern Californians -- 
including Mexican nationals who are here illegally. While this may not be their 
legal home, it is part of their historical and spiritual home. If not for one 
bad real estate deal -- the 1848 treaty that ended the U.S.-Mexican war -- the 
only "border problem" would be how to keep rich Anglos from invading that 
valuable stretch of Mexico from San Diego to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The second phrase: " . . . that border problem." You know which problem -- 
hordes of brown-skinned illegals who take those choice jobs in the fields, or 
in sweat shops, or in private residences. Yeah, that border problem. 
</P>
<P>
The train episode has certainly sensitized me further to the plight of those 
residents -- legal and otherwise -- who more regularly, and more aggressively, 
have their citizenship questioned. 
</P>
<P>
I've been trying to put the train incident in perspective ever since it 
happened. It seems fundamentally discriminatory to question someone's 
citizenship solely on the basis of one's skin color. And that's all the agent 
had to go by. As opposed to the episode outside my girlfriend's apartment when 
I was casually dressed and groomed on a weekend, on the train I was neatly 
attired, as I was going directly from the train station to my job in downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
So I have learned this: In certain parts of San Diego, one should always be 
clean-shaven and well-dressed . . . and preferably white. And having your 
nationality questioned is the price you pay for being dark-skinned in certain 
parts of the United States.

GOTCH'S EXPERIENCE GIVES HIM THE EDGE OVER MARSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two intelligent, articulate candidates are competing in the June 5 special 
election to fill the vacancy in the 78th Assembly District -- and the 
similarities between Mike Gotch and Jeff Marston don't end there. Though Gotch 
is a liberal Democrat and Marston a moderate Republican, voters will have a 
difficult time telling the candidates apart. 
</P>
<P>
Both support abortion rights and capital punishment and strongly oppose 
offshore oil drilling. Both deem an increase in the county's dismal share of 
state revenue their top priority. Both are against development of the proposed 
De Anza resort on the shores of Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between Gotch and Marston, in an election whose victor will be 
casting votes in the Assembly perhaps a month after the election, is that Gotch 
has a proven record of legislative achievement in eight years as a San Diego 
city councilman. Marston's only government experience is as an aide to former 
U.S. Sen. S.I. Hayakawa and San Diego Councilwoman Gloria McColl. 
</P>
<P>
Voters should elect Gotch to the Assembly from the 78th District, which 
stretches from Ocean Beach and Pacific Beach on the coast, inland to Miramar 
Naval Air Station, south to downtown San Diego and east to East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Gotch brings to the race an environmental record that Marston cannot match. 
Gotch championed the successful campaign for the 1985 ballot initiative that 
restricted development in the city's urban reserve. He has served on the state 
Coastal Commission. He opposed the SANDER trash-to-energy facility. He is a 
longtime ally of the city's environmentalists. The redevelopment of Mission 
Beach Park was not the blunder that Gotch's opponents would make it out to be. 
</P>
<P>
Marston, in contrast, has no record of his own and worked most recently for 
McColl, a generally pro-development councilwoman with an unenviable 
environmental record. Though his work as a staffer is by all accounts 
commendable, and his enthusiasm undeniable, he does not show Gotch's grasp of 
the specifics on some issues. 
</P>
<P>
Gotch would take eight years of experience on the council to Sacramento, where 
he would join the Democratic majority that controls both houses. (Under the 
rules for the June 5 contest, voters will mark two ballots -- one for the 
special election, and a second in the primary for the November election.) 
</P>
<P>
We are troubled, however, by the campaign mailer Gotch sent to 40,000 homes the 
weekend before the April 10 primary, misidentifying the party affiliation of 
chief Democratic rival Howard Wayne. Gotch's aides called the mistake a 
typographical one. We wonder. 
</P>
<P>
On balance, however, Mike Gotch deserves to be elected in the 78th Assembly 
District.

LACK OF COMMUNICATION OVER MEDICATION FUELS PROBLEMS FOR ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dorothy Buth, 80, was taking six medications when she entered Burbank's St. 
Joseph Medical Center last month. When she went home a few days later, her 
family physician replaced two medications with new prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, no one mentioned the changes to Buth's daughter, Bonnie, who 
monitors her mother's prescriptions. And no one told the Adult Day Health Care 
Center of St. Joseph, which cares for Buth five days a week and administers 
most of her medications. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the phone going back and forth to the doctors," Bonnie Buth said. "I 
had a little of all her medications left. I didn't know what to give her. I was 
going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
"She's a heart patient and the situation could have been very dangerous," said 
Susan Myers, the program nurse for the Adult Day Health Care Center. "If she 
had been on her own, the potential for taking all the drugs, or too many of 
them, would have been there." 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies suggest that Buth's case is symptomatic of a disturbing problem 
among older adults taking prescription or over-the-counter medications. 
</P>
<P>
Federal, state and private studies say that an alarming number of Americans 60 
and older take medications that cause harm by themselves or through adverse 
reactions with other prescriptions. The problem is exacerbated by physiological 
changes, including a decline in kidney and liver performance, that make elderly 
people more sensitive to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Myers said the problem develops from inadequate communication between doctors 
and patients about prescriptions and their possible side effects. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Buth averted trouble by aggressively pursuing doctors to learn what 
dosages to give her mother, Myers said. But many other senior citizens have 
been less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 report by the United States Inspector General, for example, called 
mismedication of seniors "a critical health care issue." 
</P>
<P>
The report said that in 1987 at least 200,000 elderly Americans were 
hospitalized due to adverse drug reactions or experienced drug reactions while 
hospitalized. It also found that each year prescription drugs cause 32,000 
older adults to fall and fracture their hips. In addition, it reported that 
61,000 senior citizens who take medications develop tremors, rigid muscles or 
other side effects resembling Parkinson's disease. The problem is also 
extensive -- and costly -- in California. A state Assembly study found that in 
1986, patients 60 or older accounted for "62% of reported adverse drug 
reactions associated with legally administered drug therapies." The cost of 
hospitalizing these 31,326 senior citizens was $289 million. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is significant in the San Fernando Valley, said Dr. Roland Jacobs 
of the Valley Hospital Medical Center in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, the medical director of the hospital's special care unit for geriatric 
psychiatry, recalls a woman who was brought to the emergency room babbling and 
delirious. She had no sense of herself or the time of day. She was extremely 
agitated and restless and had no control of her bowels or bladder. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs learned that when the elderly woman had become agitated during early 
symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, a family doctor had prescribed tranquilizers 
and anti-psychotic drugs while she continued to take medications for high blood 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks the woman became increasingly agitated and psychotic. Instead of 
re-evaluating her medications, the doctor increased them. This cycle continued 
for several months until the woman came to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically stopped her medications and observed her," Jacobs said. "Within 
three days she made significant improvement by just detoxifying and washing out 
all these medicines. In about seven days she had come back to her normal 
status. 
</P>
<P>
"We re-evaluated her. All she needed were light tranquilizers along with her 
medication for high blood pressure. We also made recommendations for improving 
her home life and lowering her stress so that she did not require as many 
medications." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs also recalls treating an 88-year-old widow who had difficulty walking 
and had fallen, requiring stitches on her ear, the day she was brought to the 
hospital. She was talking incessantly and was delirious. 
</P>
<P>
A doctor had prescribed Haldol, an anti-psychotic, to treat a slight case of 
nervousness. For five days, the medication seemed to work well. But on the 
sixth day her agitation returned and she became confused. The next day she 
experienced difficulty walking, became delirious and went to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs took her off Haldol. Four days later she could walk. Although still 
suffering from severe memory loss, she became less confused and needed only a 
mild sedative. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clearly a case of Haldol toxicity," Jacobs said. "Her family doctor 
needed to know that it accumulates in the elderly and what may not be toxic 
initially can become so after six or seven days." 
</P>
<P>
The inspector general's report said a predominant reason that elderly people 
are more likely than other groups to be mismedicated is that they suffer more 
chronic illnesses and use more medications. 
</P>
<P>
Although Americans 65 and over "constitute only 12% of the population, they use 
over 30% of the prescription drugs and 40% of the non-prescription drugs," 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The report added that because elderly Americans take a greater variety of 
drugs, the risk is higher that the medications will interact adversely. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the elderly also suffer because many physicians are poorly 
trained in geriatrics. It cited a 1988 study that said less than 2% of students 
in medical school were required to take courses in geriatric medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mangano, a deputy inspector general in Washington, said physicians get 
some information on drugs from scientific publications but get more of their 
information from drug company representatives who are trying to sell a product. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1988, drug companies spent $2.5 billion on promoting their products to 
physicians," he said. "They say that they get scientific literature all the 
time. But I think if they are honest, they will tell you that they are heavily 
influenced by promotional people from the drug companies." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Chernof, a Northridge internist who is president-elect of the Los 
Angeles County Medical Assn., said the assertion that physicians receive 
insufficient training in geriatric medicine is "not backed by any data that I'm 
aware of." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the inspector general would be well advised to have a doctor help him 
with these evaluations in the future," he said." 
</P>
<P>
"It does not reach the heart of the matter to say that only 2% of medical 
students take courses in geriatric medicine because that is not necessarily 
where they get the information on pharmacology for elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
"They get it in courses in pharmacology and in internal medicine and in bedside 
teaching on the hospital wards. Much of traditional pharmacology courses . . . 
in medical school have to do with issues of fine tuning dosage according to age 
and coexistence of other medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors are required . . . to have a substantial number of hours of formal 
education each year. Much of that is provided in lectures in hospitals and 
those lectures often have to do with exactly these issues. They are not given 
by drug companies but by skilled physicians experienced in these matters." 
</P>
<P>
The recent studies of over-medication sparked interest among politicians. State 
Sen. David Roberti, a Democrat representing Burbank and part of North 
Hollywood, introduced one of several bills on the subject now before the state 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a vast problem and getting worse," Roberti said. "The problem is that 
there has to be some way of keeping a list of what medications a senior citizen 
is taking because of the adverse reactions that can occur." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti's bill (SB 2815) would require the state to develop a brochure to teach 
patients what to ask about medications. Doctors and pharmacists would be 
obligated to give older patients a copy of the brochure. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would also compel doctors and pharmacists to take complete information 
about patient's medications and to advise them about possible "effects or 
contraindications." 
</P>
<P>
Chernof said doctors are taught in medical schools and urged by professional 
canon to counsel patients about adverse reactions and drug interactions. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Williams, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy and clinical 
gerontology at USC, said the American Pharmaceutical Assn. includes counseling 
patients as one of its standards of practice. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams said pharmacists in high-volume stores often are too busy to 
counsel patients, and that Roberti's bill would make a good law because "it 
raises the issue of drug medication counseling and will encourage people to ask 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
Medical groups might have a different opinion once they have time to study the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alex Pruchnicki, geriatrics fellow at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration 
Medical Center, said good physicians already take histories of their patients' 
prescriptions and discuss possible side effects. He said physicians might 
oppose legislative intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Chernof questioned the data that fueled the proposal. "Who decided what an 
adverse drug reaction was?" he asked. "What were the criteria? In an elderly 
person with multiple system illness such as diabetes and heart disease, for 
example, it's difficult to call an incident an adverse drug reaction because 
sometimes it's difficult to distinguish a manifestation of the illness from the 
purported adverse reaction." 
</P>
<P>
Chernof said other causes frequently contribute to adverse reactions, including 
failure to follow directions, misunderstandings of directions, the patient's 
forgetfulness, difficulty opening bottles, difficulty reading labels and 
self-advised changes in dosages of medication. 
</P>
<P>
Chernof said physicians and pharmacists need to educate patients, but he 
wondered if a booklet was the best way. 
</P>
<P>
"Will elderly patients read it? Will they pay any more attention to it than to 
what the doctor said? . . . If a pharmacist raises an issue about possible drug 
interaction, the net effect may be to scare the patient away from taking the 
drug at all."

ELECTIONS 22ND SENATE DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
ROSENTHAL FEELS CONFIDENT OF REELECTION AGAINST GRAYSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The last time state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal sweated out an election, he and his 
wife, Pat, walked 92 precincts, door-to-door. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal hasn't lost any sleep over a campaign challenge in the intervening 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
He won that race in 1974, taking over the 45th District Assembly seat vacated 
by his old friend Henry Waxman, who went on to Congress and eventual co-billing 
in the powerful Berman-Waxman political machine. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years later, in 1982, Rosenthal crossed the hall to the state Senate, and 
the liberal Democrat has controlled the 22nd District -- which includes the 
Westside and the East Valley south of Ventura Boulevard -- ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal is being challenged in the primary this year by a candidate who has 
three generations of ties to the district and fresh public name recognition. 
William Graysen gained media attention recently as the lawyer who represented 
Zsa Zsa Gabor in her cop-slapping trial in Beverly Hills. The winner of the 
primary will face Republican Michael Schrager, a businessman, and Peace and 
Freedom candidate Margery Hinds, a medical assistant, in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 72-year-old Rosenthal isn't worried that Graysen poses a threat. And 
his primary campaign -- or lack of it -- reflects that. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal's hegemony in the district has been so complete that, four years ago, 
reporters had to call him to see if he could help them track down his elusive 
Republican opponent in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
To no one's surprise, Rosenthal trounced his Republican foe, Daniel Ward Sias, 
68% to 29%, and marched back to the Senate to continue his career political 
pursuits involving education, senior citizens' issues and environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
In his current term, Rosenthal has served as chairman of the Senate Energy and 
Public Utilities Committee and chairman of the Joint Committee on Energy 
Regulation and the Environment. He has sponsored dozens of bills, on such 
varied issues as elder abuse, coastal preservation and safe playground 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The airline industry has come under his scrutiny for its fares, the telephone 
companies for their variable pay-phone rates. A pet project for Rosenthal has 
been his attempt to prohibit fishing for white croaker, which he says are 
unsafe to eat because they are tainted by polluted water. And not long ago, he 
attacked Medfly spraying as "idiotic." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal's message plays well in his district, which includes such liberal 
strongholds as Beverly Hills, Encino, Santa Monica, Studio City, Westwood and a 
large chunk of Venice and registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers, and Rosenthal's position as a Democratic Party insider, have let 
him smile through elections and pass on his campaign contributions to other 
candidates who need a boost. 
</P>
<P>
Because recent campaign reforms have banned politicians from transferring 
contributions to other candidates, Rosenthal is donating the surplus to 
initiative campaign groups. This year, he has given money to groups opposing a 
pair of reapportionment plans and the Proposition 112 committee, backing 
changes in legislative ethics rules instead of spending it fighting Graysen. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't spent any money," Rosenthal said. "I go to all of the homeowners 
group meetings and chambers of commerce, and I've done a couple of newspaper 
interviews." 
</P>
<P>
Graysen's campaign, meanwhile, is also a low-budget affair: total expenses, 
$498, the cost of the filing fee. His message, delivered to small groups in his 
neighborhood, is fervent, if quixotic. 
</P>
<P>
"In November, when the Berlin Wall came down, it led me to question, what is 
the state of democracy in the 22nd District? I'm not in any way comparing West 
L.A. to East Berlin," said Graysen. "But I looked at an incumbent who is rarely 
challenged, a very low voter turnout, and tremendously difficult issues like 
crime and drugs and pollution and traffic congestion that the Legislature 
doesn't seem to be doing anything about. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that there were 22 ballot measures, and it looks like people are 
legislating for themselves. Legislators are taking bribes, soliciting bribes, 
and seem to be using all their time raising money to get reelected." 
</P>
<P>
Graysen's preference is an electoral system that would operate like Costa 
Rica's, where candidates run once, for six-year terms, and cannot run for 
reelection while in office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see citizen legislators go up to Sacramento for a six-year term. 
They would not be beholden to anybody because they would not be running for 
reelection," Graysen said. Such a system, he passionately believes, would bring 
to the process new ideas, be they risky or expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Graysen acknowledged that he has no quarrel with most of Rosenthal's stands on 
district and statewide issues. They both oppose capital punishment, both 
support a woman's unrestricted right to abortion in the first trimester, and 
both like the so-called "Big Green" initiative for its sweeping environmental 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're both liberal Democrats from the Westside," Graysen said. 
</P>
<P>
The big difference, he stressed, is that Rosenthal is a career politician. 
Graysen said if he were elected -- and he admits it is a long shot -- he would 
serve his six years and then return to his Century City law practice. 
</P>
<P>
Of his opponent's one-term idea, Rosenthal said it would create a system 
without any institutional memory. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think things are bad now, under that system, the staff and bureaucracy 
and special interests would run everything, because the people in office 
wouldn't know what was going on," Rosenthal said.

DETECTIVE'S HIRING TO INVESTIGATE GALLEGLY NEW POLITICAL TREND; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SANG KORMAN'S INQUIRY INTO AN INCIDENT POTENTIALLY DAMAGING TO HIS 
OPPONENT ILLUSTRATES A TACTIC BECOMING STANDARD PROCEDURE AMONG ELECTION 
RIVALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past few months, a private detective has been digging into the personal 
affairs of Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), an increasingly common practice 
in the world of political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Although such political tactics usually remain behind the scenes, the 
investigation of Gallegly provides a rare glimpse into how campaigns attempt to 
dredge up embarrassing incidents to hurl at their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The detective, hired by a pollster working for Gallegly's opponent, said he was 
asked several months ago to check out some "embarrassing details" of a boating 
accident in September in Channel Islands Harbor and to look into other rumors. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the investigation has failed to turn up evidence substantial enough to 
be raised as an issue by Republican challenger Sang Korman before the June 5 
primary in the 21st District, which spreads from the conservative suburbs of 
northern and western Los Angeles County to southern and eastern Ventura County, 
said Korman's campaign manager, A. Robert Lavoie. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said he is concerned that the opposition might have twisted the truth 
about an innocent boating accident, but he added that he sees nothing wrong 
with Korman's campaign snooping into his private life. Indeed, Gallegly's 
campaign has done background checks on Korman and on other opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is legitimate, and you did something wrong, that's fine," Gallegly said. 
"You should be able to stand up and face the music. But if someone tries to 
twist something, or have someone out and out lie, that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Known in political circles as "opposition research," the practice usually 
consists of scrutinizing voting records, campaign financial documents and other 
official statements. But more and more, campaigns poke into the private lives 
of opponents looking for scandal, sometimes with professional help. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a seasonal thing," said Nicholas Beltrante, who runs an investigation 
firm in Washington. "As we get closer to the election, we get as many as a 
dozen cases going on at one time." 
</P>
<P>
The trend not only reflects a shift in attitudes about what is fair game in the 
political arena, it is also a measure of the political difficulty of unseating 
an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are a challenger, you hope for every opportunity that comes along," 
Lavoie said. "Face it, the only people who have been removed from office were 
removed because of malfeasance or a scandal of some sort." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, 98% of incumbents won reelection to the U.S. House of Representatives 
in 1988. It takes a great deal for an outsider to overcome the incumbent's 
advantage of name identification and ability to raise political contributions 
and send out taxpayer-financed mass mailings to constituents. 
</P>
<P>
In his two terms in Congress, Gallegly has used these advantages to seize hold 
of his safely Republican district. He easily trounced Korman in the GOP primary 
two years ago, as well as a Democrat in the general election. Political 
analysts expect a repeat performance, barring any unforeseen campaign 
bombshell. 
</P>
<P>
Lavoie said the Korman campaign has not had to search for material billed as 
explosive. "During the course of a week, we receive a number of calls giving us 
supposed inside information," he said. "Most of them are a little strange, and 
we dismiss them." 
</P>
<P>
But a rumor about the boating accident kept resurfacing, Lavoie said. "The 
nature of the boating accident had to do with the congressman having left the 
scene . . . and left people in a precarious position," he said. Other related 
rumors, he said, "had to do with what kind of condition the congressman was 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Lavoie asked Robert Danford, an investigator in Los Angeles, to look 
into the incident and conduct other opposition research. Danford refused the 
job and told Gallegly's campaign about the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Danford refused to comment on the matter. But Ben Key, a consultant for 
Gallegly's campaign, said he talked extensively with Danford about what 
Korman's campaign wanted him to do. "Danford said he was turned off by the way 
that Korman's people wanted him to get information," Key said. 
</P>
<P>
Key said Korman's campaign wanted Danford to check out other rumors about 
Gallegly and to conduct 24-hour surveillance of Gallegly in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Lavoie acknowledged that he asked Danford to investigate the boating accident. 
</P>
<P>
When Danford turned him down, Lavoie said, campaign staff asked Gary Lawrence, 
an Orange County pollster, to inquire about the incident. "We asked Gary to 
look into it, check out any reports that were available, conduct any 
interviews," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence turned the matter over to Harry F. Block, a Newport Beach private 
detective, Block said. Through his investigation, Block tracked down the main 
witnesses to the Sept. 4 boating accident at Channel Islands Harbor in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Block said he found one witness who was willing to accuse Gallegly of being 
drunk and leaving the scene of the accident, if he was paid $3,000. The 
detective repeatedly contacted The Times in an attempt to persuade the 
newspaper to publish a story about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The witness' allegations, Gallegly said, are "totally untrue." The congressman 
said the claims are particularly infuriating because he was acting as a good 
Samaritan when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly was returning from Catalina in his 33-foot boat on Labor Day when the 
occupants of a disabled 18-foot speedboat asked him for a tow back to Channel 
Islands Harbor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman said he had managed to maneuver the smaller boat into the 
harbor and to a launch ramp without incident. But at the last minute, the wind 
blew his larger boat into the smaller one, puncturing it with a sizable hole. 
The wind continued to push his boat onto the rocks, knocking out one of its two 
engines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once free of the rocks, Gallegly said, he had to leave to avoid further damage. 
He said he motored across the harbor to his boat slip and then reported the 
accident immediately. He said he left the speedboat safely in shallow water at 
the launch ramp. Gallegly's insurance paid $4,900 to cover damage to the 
speedboat. 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor Patrol and other witnesses, in reports and interviews, backed up the 
congressman's version of events. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, I saw no probable cause to suspect that he was under the influence," 
said Harbor Patrol Sgt. Don Molony, who handled Gallegly's accident. 
"Basically, it was windy, and it was explained to me that they needed to dock 
the boat. And he, on his own volition, was reporting the incident to the Coast 
Guard. So I assumed it wasn't a hit-and-run." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said he believes it is appropriate for political opponents to scour 
the public record for ammunition to use against each other. But he draws the 
line, he said, "at having someone hiding in the bushes -- that kind of 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
Korman said he believes background checks are a legitimate campaign tool. "That 
kind of research is reasonable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he never intended to hire a private investigator, he 
acknowledged that he asked his campaign staff to check out the rumors about the 
boating accident involving Gallegly. He said he told his staff, "maybe we can 
hire someone to find out what kind of person he is, what kind of friends he 
has, what kind of political background he has." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Gallegly campaign did a background check on Korman when the 
Korean-American first challenged the incumbent in the 1988 Republican primary, 
Key said. "We wanted to check out who is Sang Korman," he said. "What we found 
was of no consequence." 
</P>
<P>
Other than routine checks of public records, the Gallegly campaign has not 
mounted another investigation of Korman, said John Frith, Gallegly's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The probe into Korman's affairs was not the first by a Gallegly campaign. In 
1986, his campaign hired a researcher to check out Tony Hope, son of 
entertainer Bob Hope, Key said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout that campaign, Hope was considered the front-runner in the race for 
the vacant seat left by former Republican Rep. Bobbi Fiedler. But Gallegly won 
an upset victory after labeling Hope a "carpetbagger" who was not living within 
the boundaries of the congressional district and after pointing out that Hope 
had not voted in several elections. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of attempting to dredge up embarrassing details about a 
candidate's private life is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
A political operative who once worked for Gallegly was caught plying his trade 
in Texas earlier this year. Former Gallegly aide Gary Maloney became the center 
of a controversy over his research into a Texas GOP gubernatorial candidate in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
According to the candidate's complaint, Maloney asked the ex-wife of one of the 
candidate's employees "several inappropriate questions," including whether the 
candidate drinks or uses foul language and how he treats his employees and 
conducts his personal and business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the complaint hit the newspapers, Maloney was promoted to 
director of strategy of the National Republican Congressional Committee. His 
committee helps finance House campaigns across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Koops, a spokesman for the Republican committee, said there is no 
committee policy forbidding research into private affairs or banning the 
employment of private investigators. But he said the committee believes that 
"suitable issues" can be found in the public record. 
</P>
<P>
His Democratic counterpart takes a firmer position. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a difference between hiring someone to do research and hiring a 
private detective to snoop around in people's lives," said Howard Schloss, 
spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "It is an 
extreme that doesn't have a place in the election process." 
</P>
<P>
Schloss said he wouldn't be surprised if some Democratic candidates have hired 
investigators, but he is not aware of any examples. "We don't condone it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater and co-chairman Ed Rollins like to 
talk about their $1-million research center in the basement of Republican 
headquarters. But Republican staff members say they don't hire investigators to 
probe into private affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not an investigative agency," said Leslie Goodman, a spokeswoman for 
the Republican National Committee. "We deal with items that are in the public 
record and in the public domain." 
</P>
<P>
Private detectives nationwide suggest that campaign officials underestimate how 
frequently they hire investigators. The leader of one private investigator 
association takes a philosophical view about investigating private lives of 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has a right to know about the honesty and integrity and, to a 
certain extent, the personal habits of the public servants," said Ralph Thomas, 
president of the National Assn. of Investigative Specialists in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
His 1,000 members are frequently summoned by campaigns to do the digging for 
them, he said. "It is very common these days. But it is not a big percentage of 
our work."

A GUIDE TO ISSUES IN DISTRICT 26 RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overview 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) is strongly favored to retain his seat 
in the 26th Congressional District, where he has served for eight years as a 
very high-profile liberal politician and a partner of Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles) in the powerful Berman-Waxman political organization. Running against 
Berman in the Democratic primary is Scott Gaulke, a follower of Lyndon 
LaRouche. Two conservatives, Roy Dahlson and Gary Forsch, are competing for 
votes in the Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contenders 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman, 49, serves on the House Judiciary, Foreign Affairs and 
Budget committees. Berman was born and raised in Los Angeles, and received his 
bachelor of arts and law degrees from UCLA. A lawyer, he served in the Assembly 
from 1973 to 1982, when he ran for Congress after losing a bid to become 
Assembly speaker. Berman has stressed issues such as immigration reform, trade 
policy, foreign aid, human rights, arms control and anti-terrorism. He and his 
wife, Janis, have two daughters, Brinley, 17, and Lindsey, 11. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Gaulke, 33, a Studio City property manager, was raised in Wisconsin and 
attended Milwaukee Area Technical College, majoring in architecture and 
mechanical engineering. He ran for the Assembly seat held by Burt Margolin 
(D-Los Angeles) in 1984 and managed the 1988 congressional campaign of Don 
Marquis when he ran against Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton). He has 
been an associate of Lyndon LaRouche for 11 years. He is single. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Dahlson, 59, of Van Nuys owns a wholesale flower business and a flower farm 
in San Diego County. He has lived in the San Fernando Valley for most of his 
life. He has been endorsed by California Young Republicans and Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. Dahlson and his wife, Gerrie, have raised 
nine children, all of whom work in the family flower business. 
</P>
<P>
Gary E. Forsch, 39, of Sun Valley is manager of a retail hardware store. 
Forsch's family has lived in the Sun Valley area for more than 60 years. He 
attended UCLA, where he majored in chemistry. Forsch has directed several 
conservative political action committees and has been endorsed by the 
California Republican Assembly. He and his wife, Phylis, an administrative 
assistant, have one son, Michael, 10. 
</P>
<P>
Libertarian Bernard Zimring is unopposed in his primary. His name will appear 
on the general election ballot in November. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questionnaire 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates in contested primary races and 
were returned this month. Answers have been edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe that there will be a "peace dividend" as a result of reduced 
tension with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact nations? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, would you generally be most inclined to use the dividend to: a) spend 
more on domestic needs, b) reduce the deficit, c) cut taxes? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): Yes. Domestic needs and reduce deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): Yes. Reduce the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): Yes. Reduce the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present system of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of dealers and users will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): No. We need a substantial increase in drug treatment programs and 
drug education, and a more pervasive presence of police foot patrols and 
citizen involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): Yes; however, greater emphasis must be created in discouraging use 
and purchase of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): No. The criminal prosecution aspect of our anti-drug efforts is not 
effective because dealers are not given sentences that deter them. Border needs 
to be more effectively patrolled to prevent smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you consider the possibility of decriminalizing drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): No. I'd consider almost anything, but I'm not persuaded that this 
is a sensible approach. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): No. Why add to the poison already on the streets? 
</P>
<P>
Q. Under the Gramm-Rudman law, the federal government is supposed to cut the 
budget deficit to zero by 1993. Is that a realistic goal? 
</P>
<P>
Briefly explain your answer. 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): No. The important goal is to continue to reduce the deficit. The 
massive tax increases that would be needed to comply with the Gramm-Rudman 1993 
requirement could trigger a very serious recession. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. The nation is in an economic depression. Gramm-Rudman is not 
going to solve that, and cutting the budget to the bone will only make things 
worse. We need to return to American System economics, and fast. We need aid 
from the Asians and Europeans, and the Paris-Berlin-Vienna triangle of 
industrial production. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): No because our Congress is controlled by legislators who belong to 
the "Big Spenders" club. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): No. It is unrealistic because the liberal majority in Congress will 
not cut wasteful spending and balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Rising property values in the Santa Monica Mountains have made it more 
difficult for state and federal parks agencies to buy land for public use. Land 
prices have escalated in part because local officials have allowed developers 
to build more houses than provided for under zoning laws. To keep property 
prices more affordable to parks agencies, should governments in Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties refuse such so-called "upzoning"? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): Yes. Continued haphazard development in the Santa Monica Mountains 
could lose us essential open space resources forever. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. The over-inflated real estate balloon is going to pop sooner or 
later. Governments in L. A. and Ventura should organize to get out of the 
depression we are in and worry about such secondary concerns when they have 
done so. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): Yes and no. Each case has to be weighed in light of the facts; 
location and other variables are pertinent. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): People need a place to live. People come first. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support President Bush's call for a capital gains tax cut to 
stimulate economic growth? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): We need to give more incentives to business to create jobs. High 
taxes create unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): No. That's my personal viewpoint, but I would abide by the will of 
the people and by current law. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): I support the human right to life. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support President Bush's policy of seeking to maintain good relations 
with China's current regime despite its violent suppression of the 
pro-democracy movement last year? 
</P>
<P>
If no, what specific measures should the United States take against China? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): No. No munitions list or militarily useful items should be exported 
to the PRC. If most-favored nation status extended, should be of limited 
duration and withdrawn absent amnesty to political prisoners, loosening of 
emigration and an agreement with China to lessen its support of the Khmer 
Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. Economic embargo, discounting humanitarian aid. Diplomatic 
isolation, in concert with our allies. Aid to pro-democracy forces inside 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): We must have equal policies against repressive regimes. We must 
have the same policy toward Soviet Russia that we have for China. Economic 
embargoes and no high-level summit talks until the repression ends. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support removing China's most-favored nation trading status because 
of the regime's repressive policies? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole's proposal to shift foreign 
aid from traditional allies, including Israel, to newly emergent democracies in 
Eastern Europe and drug-fighting nations in Latin America? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): No. We can and should aid emerging democracies without undermining 
our traditional allies like Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor opening up additional parts of the California coastline to oil 
exploration under any circumstances other than a national emergency? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): I would support it if the local people, the folks who live in the 
area, agree. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Congress has passed legislation that would expand tax credits for low-income 
parents with children in day care and create school-based day-care programs for 
"latchkey" children of middle-income families. President Bush has threatened to 
veto the legislation, which will cost $27 billion, unless its cost is 
dramatically reduced. Do you support the President? 
</P>
<P>
If no, briefly explain your answer. 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): No. Current severe shortage in child-care facilities and services 
is a problem that threatens the quality of life for the children of countless 
working families. Child-care bill passed by Congress addresses this crisis in a 
comprehensive way. What the President wants would not. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. Refer to explanation for question about Gramm-Rudman law. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): Yes. I support the right of women to stay home and take care of 
their children. This bill restricts that right. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you support a national gasoline tax increase if the proceeds were 
dedicated to improving transportation? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): Only if combined with elimination of the "bubble" that benefits the 
richest taxpayers at the expense of the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): No. This would hurt those who can least afford it. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): Why can't we properly spend the gas tax revenue that we have now? 
We are not under-taxed; we are incompetently governed. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you support a national gasoline tax increase to reduce the deficit? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): See previous answer. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): No. For the same reason. We must learn to spend less. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): No. So long as Congress spends more than they take in, increased 
taxes are useless. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support limiting the amount of money a candidate for national office 
can spend on the campaign? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): We must be very careful not to impose limits that are so low that 
challengers can never defeat incumbents. I'd prefer mandating free or low-cost 
TV advertising, televised campaign forums and a limited low-cost mail 
allowance. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): I refuse to support limitations on freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you support at least a partial taxpayer-financed campaign funding as 
part of a reform package that limited spending? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): No. Under no condition. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): No. Why force people to support through their tax dollars people 
they oppose? 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support limiting the number of terms that U.S. senators and 
representatives can serve? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, what should the limit be? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): Yes and no. If a fair and impartial reapportionment plan were 
instituted, there would be no need to limit terms. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): No. The voters can limit terms of elected officials by voting them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor more control over the availability of handguns to the general 
public? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, what specific controls? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): Yes. A waiting period, safety instructions and licensing to keep 
handguns out of the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): No. Since law enforcement has been unable to control the 
availability of firearms to criminals, the public must be able to defend 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the current program to build a "Star Wars" anti-missile 
system? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, do you think the program is adequately funded? 
</P>
<P>
Berman (D): No. Program is rife with questions regarding technical feasibility, 
survivability and cost-effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke (D): Yes. Program must be funded at several hundred billion dollars. We 
need a crash SDI program modeled on the Manhattan Project. The spin-offs to the 
civilian economy more than pay for the investment. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson (R): Yes. It's not adequately funded. Big spenders in Congress are not 
concerned over research in the area of national defense. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (R): Yes. Unsure if it's adequately funded.

REAGAN HAS SCAR TISSUE 
</P>

<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan has developed scar tissue, or adhesions, in his 
intestine, which his physicians believe resulted from his 1985 colon cancer 
surgery, a spokesman for Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said Friday that tests at St. John's Hospital in 
Santa Monica, including a CAT scan and blood tests, had "revealed no evidence 
of cancer or any other disease" and that "neither surgery nor hospitalization 
is contemplated at this time." 
</P>
<P>
"Such adhesions are not uncommon and are not dangerous and the president's 
physicians consider him to be in otherwise excellent health," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the 79-year-old former President has been advised to "limit his 
traveling for the next several weeks," Weinberg said, adding that the Reagan's 
planned trip to Europe next month "will be postponed." 
</P>
<P>
Adhesions -- bands of scar tissue that binds two surfaces that are normally 
separated -- frequently develop after surgery as part of the normal healing 
process. But they are only a problem when they are severe enough to cause 
kinking or obstruction of the intestine. 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of severe adhesions may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or 
constipation. In such cases, surgery is usually required to cut the scar tissue 
and free the loops. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone I see with adhesions usually has some symptoms and is hospitalized," 
said Dr. Steven Stain, a general surgeon at USC Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
Stain, who is not treating Reagan, said he "may have a partial intermittent 
obstruction of his intestine that causes him minimum symptoms." 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg said Reagan's physicians were "monitoring and evaluating his condition 
consistent with standard medical procedures," including a check-up conducted 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
He would not say whether Reagan was receiving any specific therapy for the 
adhesions. He also said he had no information about whether the adhesions were 
diagnosed in response to specific symptoms.

SOCKERS LOST KARIC, FOUND THEMSELVES; 
</P>
<P>
MISL: GIVING UP A PROLIFIC SCORER IN EXCHANGE FOR 20-YEAR-OLD PAUL WRIGHT MIGHT 
HAVE SEEMED A RISK, BUT IT CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE THAT LED THE DEFENDING 
CHAMPIONS BACK TO THE FINALS.

<P>
From the looks on their faces, it wasn't hard to tell something was up. 
</P>
<P>
It was Feb. 24, and minutes earlier, the St. Louis Storm had clobbered the 
Sockers, 6-1, in the San Diego Sports Arena. The previous night, also in front 
of their own fans, the Sockers had been beaten up by the Baltimore Blast, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
The three Rons -- Coach Ron Newman, President Ron Cady and owner Ron Fowler -- 
huddled together behind a closed door in the locker room as people peared 
through the window. A smile wasn't to be found. Their faces were taut. After a 
short time, the meeting broke up. In the Arena Club later, Fowler would say 
simply: "We've decided we're not going to stand pat." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers dressed quietly that night and walked to their cars with a 14-20 
record flashing in their heads as if it were police-car lights. This was no way 
to defend a championship. 
</P>
<P>
To nobody's surprise, a trade was made 10 days later. Forward Zoran Karic, the 
Sockers' most productive goal-scorer the previous season, was sent to the 
Cleveland Crunch for Paul Wright, a forward selected by the Crunch in the 
free-agent draft after he played his rookie season with the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, it looked promising but risky. Most certainly, it would eliminate 
a bit of tension, largely the result of friction between Newman and Karic. But 
could the Sockers really compensate for the loss of Karic's magnificent 
shooting skills with a player who was still learning the finer points of the 
game? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think there was any question," Newman says. "We don't make trades 
unless we see logic in it." 
</P>
<P>
Newman would be the first to admit, though, that being logical doesn't always 
breed success in the MISL, particularly when you're dealing with the ever 
unpredictable Sockers. But if Newman has a hunch, he usually goes with it. He 
trusts his judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a hell of a lot more experienced than the guy on the street," Newman says, 
laughing. "There's a lot of guess work involved no matter what you do. If you 
continue to make the right guesses, you must be doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
And this was something Wright. It is possible the Sockers would be on vacation 
now if the trade had never been made. 
</P>
<P>
Since Wright's return, the Sockers won nine of their last 15 regular-season 
games and then eliminated St. Louis, 3-1, in the Western Division semifinals 
and Dallas, 4-2, in the division finals. Tuesday, the Sockers will begin the 
best-of-seven championship series at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Against Dallas, Wright had three two-point games: two goals in a 4-2 victory in 
Game 1, two assists in a 4-2 victory in Game 4 and two goals in a 3-1 victory 
in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
But his offensive capabilities might not be Wright's biggest contribution. When 
Karic was a Socker, he could never be counted on to run back and play defense. 
Wright gets back in a blur and allows the Sockers to open up their game. Wright 
is one player you won't find gasping to catch his breath. 
</P>
<P>
What does he think he did for the team? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I added," Wright says. "Just hard work. That's what Zoran 
was lacking, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike with Karic, Newman doesn't have to worry about an argument when he tells 
Wright to do something. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows when he says something to me, I don't talk back," Wright says. "What 
the coach says is the final word. He'll get exactly what he asks for." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 20, is also a good morale booster. His youthful enthusiasm can't help 
but rub off on his teammates, and he enjoys having a good time. 
</P>
<P>
Wright is attached to his Walkman head phones the way Maggie Simpson is 
attached to her pacifier. On airplanes, he can often be found strolling the 
aisles, looking for a pretty woman to flirt with. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a fun kid to have around," Newman says. "The youth is so exciting. It 
blows your mind to think what he could be in a few years." 
</P>
<P>
His accomplishments on the field don't match Karic's statistically. In his 15 
games with Cleveland, Karic had 12 goals and 14 assists. Wright had nine and 
four in the last 15 regular season games. 
</P>
<P>
But Cleveland went just 6-9 with Karic. In this sport, there are many variables 
other than goals and assists. 
</P>
<P>
"You put a team together like a jigsaw puzzle," midfielder Brian Quinn said. 
"(Wright) fits in well. Zoran is a quality player, but I think Paul Wright has 
shown that he's better for this team." 
</P>
<P>
If the Sockers were given a boost with Wright's arrival, so was Wright. Being 
back in San Diego meant going to the playoffs. Cleveland wound up finishing 
last in the Eastern Division. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came back to San Diego, I got new life," Wright says. "I saw I had a 
chance to win another championship." 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not he'll be sticking around remains to be seen. Wright is currently 
making just $25,000. Scott Simpson, Wright's agent, said he will be looking for 
between $40,000 and $45,000 next season. 
</P>
<P>
Wright wants it to be known that he's no longer a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to hear from the owners 'You're not proven,' " he says. 
"Obviously I'm going to do better than what I've done this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely going to be a money issue. I'm sure Ron Fowler knows what I 
want, and I'm sure (Crunch majority owner George) Hoffman knows what I want. 
It's just a matter of who's going to give it to me." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Wright to the highest bidder? Quite possibly. San Diego may be where he 
grew up, where he was a star at Grossmont High School and for the San Diego 
Nomads, but you know what? He kind of liked it in Cleveland. Yeah, the weather 
was brutal. But other than that, he had a good time. So if it comes right down 
to it, he'll got back to Cleveland for the right chunk of change. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever he ends up, he is sure to have an impact. Ask Quinn, and he'll say the 
only thing that could get in the path of Wright's success is Wright himself. 
It's up to him to develop his talent and polish the areas in which he is still 
rough, such as shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a lot of qualities that could put him in the upper echelon of players 
in this league," Quinn says. "If he wants to be a star, he'll be a star."

AZTECS WIN IN 10TH, STAY ALIVE

STANFORD 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Boucher was running just as fast as his one good leg and one bad leg 
would carry him, running for his team and toward Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It was near the end of San Diego State's long Saturday, 13 hours after their 6 
a.m. wake-up call and 19 innings into this day at the West I Regional at 
Stanford's Sunken Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher had been standing on second in the 10th with none out and the score 
tied, and now there was a wild pitch, and now he was belly-flopping across 
home, safe. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs were safe. In 10 innings, they had defeated Southern Illinois, 4-3, 
long after they lost to No. 1 Stanford, 6-2, in Saturday's 9 a.m. game. 
</P>
<P>
Their victory over Southern Illinois means the Aztecs will meet Stanford again 
today at noon for the championship of the double-elimination tournament. The 
Aztecs must win that game to force another at 4, then win again for the title. 
All Stanford needs to do is win once. 
</P>
<P>
But enough about the potential for a long day today. First, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs played Stanford in front of 3,347 fans clad mostly in Cardinal red. 
By the time they faced Southern Illinois, there were just 767 people left. 
</P>
<P>
From first pitch to last, the Aztecs took a lead over Stanford, missed a few 
chances to increase it and lost. Most returned to their hotel too tired to eat 
and too depressed to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was time to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so tired I had a headache," outfielder Jeff Barry said. "Every time I 
threw, it hurt my head. I've never been this tired before." 
</P>
<P>
Still, they battled and scrapped in the second game and watched as their 
clean-up hitter was robbed of a home run. They took a lead and lost it in the 
ninth. They saw second baseman Scott Dennison go down with an injury in the 
10th, minutes before Boucher sprained an ankle when he got tangled up with 
Southern Illinois' first baseman. The Aztecs called time out, taped him up and 
sent him back. Then there was a wild pitch . . . 
</P>
<P>
The day started with Stanford. The Aztecs got a run in the first when Dennison 
doubled off the base of the left-field fence, and Eric Christopherson singled. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the second, a source of frustration the rest of the day. Brian 
Grebeck and Anthony Johnson led off with singles, putting runners at first and 
second with none out. Up stepped first baseman Darin McGhee, all set to bunt 
the runners over. 
</P>
<P>
He popped up, right to pitcher Stan Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
"The big part of the game for us," SDSU Coach Jim Dietz said. "If we get that 
down and follow it with a base hit, we have a three-run lead." 
</P>
<P>
But they didn't. Instead, they left Grebeck and Johnson on base. Their only 
other run came in the sixth, when Johnson homered. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU left eight on base, including seven in the first six innings. All that did 
was allow Spencer, Stanford's ace, to get stronger. He ran his record to 14-1. 
</P>
<P>
And he got all the offense he needed in the fourth. Stanford strung together 
four consecutive hits against SDSU starter Erik Plantenberg (10-5) and came out 
of it with four runs, making it 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "We'll be there in the championship game. We faced one of 
Stanford's best pitchers and got 10 hits." 
</P>
<P>
Four hours later, the Aztecs' bats were silent. Southern Illinois' George 
Joseph held them hitless through four innings. SDSU finished with six hits and 
barely escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Illinois took a 1-0 lead in the fourth on a Tim Davis home run. The 
Aztecs tied it in the sixth, when Dennison singled, moved to second on a wild 
pitch and then scored on Christopherson's single. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Barry, with Christopherson on first. He hit a ball hard into the 
swirling winds, deep toward left. Southern Illinois' Ed Janke drifted back and 
leaped. His glove snaked over the seven-foot high fence and snared the ball. 
</P>
<P>
You want more drama? Bottom of the eighth, score still 1-1, Bill Dunckel on 
first. Barry steps in and puts Joseph's first pitch over the left-field fence, 
this time beyond the reach of Janke. Revenge. 
</P>
<P>
But Southern Illinois tied it in the ninth after loading the bases with one 
out. After Kurt Archer relieved Rusty Filter, Southern Illinois scored one run 
on a double play and another on Brad Hollenkamp's single to left. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th, Boucher singled up the middle and took second when shortstop Dave 
Wrona made a wild throw to first. Dunckel was walked intentionally. Up stepped 
Steve Dietz, who replaced Dennison in the top of the 10th. Strike one. Wild 
pitch. Aztecs win. 
</P>
<P>
"In all the years I've been coaching at SDSU (19), that win was one of the 
better ones," Dietz said. "It shows me the backbone of this team. I've had 
teams that would have been ready to get on the bus (after the Stanford loss). 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these guys haven't eaten a correct meal yet (today). It was one hell 
of a battle." 
</P>
<P>
He sighed. The day was finished. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hug each one of those guys if I could," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
SDSU will probably start left hander Kevin Nielsen (4-3, 4.53 earned-run 
average); Stanford is undecided.

HAWKINS THROWS TWO-HITTER TO LEAD SANTANA; RBV, BISHOP'S ALSO WIN 
</P>

<P>
Santana pitcher Shelly Hawkins said the playoffs were no place to walk on the 
the wild side or throw anything fancy. Just pitch conservatively. 
</P>
<P>
Her instincts not only held Madison (27-3) to two hits but earned Santana 
(29-2) the San Diego Section 2-A softball championship Saturday at Mesa Del Sol 
Complex. 
</P>
<P>
The Sultans, who hadn't reached the finals since they won the 3-A title in 
1984, defeated Madison, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pitching a conservative game," Hawkins said. "I didn't want to take any 
chances on risky pitching. I let my defense take over." 
</P>
<P>
Santana had a 3-1 record against Madison this season, and in 23 innings against 
the Warhawks, Hawkins (16-1) allowed just one run. She didn't pitch in a 3-0 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the third time we've seen her, so there was nothing we didn't expect," 
Madison Coach Steve Miner said. "We figured the team that got the first run 
would win, and that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the fifth, Hawkins' line drive up the first-base line scored 
Christy Stippy, who had doubled. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an outside fastball," Hawkins said. "I can't believe it went where I 
wanted it to go, right up the base line." 
</P>
<P>
The game featured the county's top two pitchers in Hawkins and Jenifer Booker 
(16-3), but Miner said Thursday's semifinal might have bothered Booker 
Saturday. She pitched the entire 14 innings in a 1-0 victory over USDHS. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we won't know how she would have done if she didn't pitch those 14 
innings, but I was concerned that it might affect her today," Miner said. 
</P>
<P>
John Bobof, Santana's first-year coach, was not only blessed with Hawkins but 
inherited a team full of upperclassmen. The lineup had eight returning varsity 
players; the lone freshman, Teresa Stippy, was at third. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew at the start of the year it was a good team and that we were capable of 
winning it all if we could put it all together," Bobof said. 
</P>
<P>
3-A Championship 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista 5, Orange Glen 0 -- Rachel Boyer, who usually throws a 
rising pitch, was instead successful dropping it down, yielding no hits until 
the sixth and leading the Longhorns (25-5) to their first section title. 
</P>
<P>
"We changed the pitching," RBV Coach Ken Elderts said. "We wanted to stay down. 
Her drop was working right in the umpire's strike zone." 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, Christina Feliccia, running for Boyer, stole second and 
reached third on Carrie Chino's infield single. With Laura Quiroz up, Chino was 
caught in and then escaped a rundown between second and third, allowing 
Feliccia to score RBV's first run. 
</P>
<P>
Quiroz then tripled, scoring Chino. Quiroz scored on a sacrifice fly by Valarie 
Valencia. Annjanette Vitulli bunted safely, went to third on an error and 
scored on a bunt by Alicia Maronne, giving RBV a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, Chino doubled and scored RBV's final run on an error. 
</P>
<P>
Chino, who went three for three, was the only Longhorn with more than one hit. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen finished 17-8. 
</P>
<P>
1-A Championship 
</P>
<P>
Bishop's 7, La Jolla Country Day 4 -- Bishop's (21-3), which collected its 
fourth consecutive 1-A section title, rallied from a three-run deficit by 
scoring four runs in the top of second and another three in the third. 
</P>
<P>
"It was important for us to come right back," Bishop's Coach Ren Marquette 
said. "They're veterans and knew what they had to do." 
</P>
<P>
Nicole Boynton, a junior, went three for four for Bishop's. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Country Day finished 13-9.

DAY GOES PERFECTLY FOR DRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The only things John and Anne Dring had an appetite for during this 
stomach-churning track and field meet were their fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, daughter Allison Dring, Mt. Carmel's great hope to win four 
events at the San Diego Section championships, slowly simmered in her own 
pressure cooker while high in the stands, Mom and Dad tried to turn down the 
heat on their own emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worse on us then it is on her," Anne Dring said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dring, a sophomore wisp of a girl who runs like a heavyweight, took the 
pressure and ran with it, winning the 200 and 400 meters and competing on the 
winning 400 and 1,600-meter relays Saturday at Poway High. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't believe it," said Dring, who set a section record of 54.29 -- 
second best in state this season -- in the 400 and contributed to a meet record 
in the 1,600. "This is all going to take a while to sink in." 
</P>
<P>
A good deal more time than it took Dring to record her first victory here. 
Aided by a shaky baton pass by Morse on the third leg of the 400 relay, Mt. 
Carmel and Dring -- running anchor -- fought off a 12-year section final 
winning streak by the Tigers and won in 47.92, .14 ahead of Lincoln. Morse 
(48.09) finished in third. 
</P>
<P>
The victory reminded Dring of how she had felt when she dropped the baton 
during the Palomar League championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt so bad about dropping the baton," she said. "That was a hard 
thing to deal with. It's great to get a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
Less than an hour later, she had a second chance for a victory, this time in 
the 400. Dring never trailed and accelerated coming around the final curve to 
leave the field far behind. Already weak from her all-out style of running, 
Dring's legs almost buckled beneath her when she heard her time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been looking at the meet record book and it gives me shivers," she said. 
"I had no idea I'd run that fast today." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the ghost looming in the distance had the first clue. Dring said she 
makes a habit of pretending there is an imaginary figure ahead of her in the 
400. Her job is to catch it. 
</P>
<P>
"I focus on putting something in front of me, and I chase it," she said. "I 
scare myself if I run side-by-side with someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Dring has reservations about the state meet she will run in Friday and Saturday 
in Cerritos -- "It scares me to death," she said -- but Mt. Carmel Coach Dennis 
McClanahan said Dring isn't the same runner she was last year. 
</P>
<P>
"She has a much better understanding of the sport now," he said. "Plus, I think 
she's a lot more committed than when she was a freshman. She didn't realized 
where the sport could take her." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dring: "Last year I came into the season, and there was this big track. I 
had no idea what was out there. Now, I'm more concentrated on my purpose." 
</P>
<P>
John Dring said Allison knows more about the competition and how to race 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
"She identifies with the people she's competing against," he said. "She didn't 
know what to expect before. Now she does." 
</P>
<P>
In the 200, Dring drove hard and finished in 24.38 to edge Monica Henderson of 
Morse (24.63). 
</P>
<P>
Not relying on Dring to make the difference, her teammates in the 1,600 gave 
Dring a big lead for her anchor leg. Mt. Carmel defeated San Pasqual by almost 
five seconds.

<P>
GROSSMONT, SAN DIEGO ADVANCE TO TITLE GAME 
</P>

<P>
Top-ranked Grossmont didn't come close to living up to its long-ball reputation 
in Saturday's San Diego Section 2-A baseball semifinals. It managed but five 
singles off two San Pasqual pitchers and came nowhere near hitting the ball out 
of the spacious park at Grossmont College. 
</P>
<P>
But the Foothillers took what was given -- eight walks and a hit batter -- and 
played solid defense behind three pitchers to advance to the section finals 
with a come-from-behind, 5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont's opponent in the final at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday at the University of 
San Diego will be San Diego, which defeated unheralded Clairemont, 9-5. San 
Diego beat Grossmont, 6-5, earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont has set a single-season record for runs scored (308) by averaging 10 
a game and has hit 36 home runs, but it lost two of its leading hitters -- 
Lenny Van Every (broken foot) and Jim Earley (academic ineligibility) -- and 
its bats have gone silent. 
</P>
<P>
In its past two victories, over Escondido and San Pasqual, Grossmont (28-2) has 
scored 10 runs on 11 hits. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been smashing the ball lately," said Greg Layson, Grossmont's 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont had trouble solving San Pasqual starter Bobby Cummings, leaving five 
runners on base in the first three innings and trailing, 2-0. Only one of the 
five runners hit their way on -- Cummings walked the other four. 
</P>
<P>
But in the fourth, Grossmont capitalized on Cummings' control problems and some 
shaky fielding by the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
After a leadoff walk to Bob Roberson, Grossmont's Winter Phoenix hit what 
appeared to be a double-play grounder up the middle. But the ball eluded 
Cummings and went off the glove of shortstop Chris Hancock. Then Cummings hit 
Steve Moyer to load the bases and walked Marc Landers to force in a run. After 
Tim Young relieved, Scott Brennan hit a run-scoring single, and Todd Cady and 
John Tatum hit fly balls that scored two more runs. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, I don't think they were as good as they thought they were," said 
Cummings, who walked seven in three-plus innings. "We gave them the game with 
walks. I'd have rather lost by them hitting me." 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded San Pasqual (15-11-1) managed just one hit after the fourth 
inning off Grossmont's Mike Spears and Tatum. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Josh Stepner, who pitched five innings to pick up the victory 
Saturday, is the probable starter against Grossmont. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be out to get us," said Stepner, who allowed two runs and 
four hits in the five innings. "But it's going to take a good game to beat us." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Kian Sly got the Cavers rolling in the first by hitting a homer 
over the 385-foot mark in right center. He was given the chance when Clairemont 
shortstop Dave Salonius missed second on what would have been an unassisted 
double-play. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteenth-seeded Clairemont (17-14) stayed close until the fifth, when No. 
2-seeded San Diego (20-7) broke open a 4-2 game with five runs on five hits.

Upset? 
</P>
<P>
The word certainly applied to Saturday's fight-marred semifinals of the San 
Diego Section 3-A baseball playoffs at USD's Cunningham Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-seeded Monte Vista, the fourth-place finisher in the Grossmont 3-A 
League, "upset" fourth-seeded Patrick Henry, 9-7, and 15th-seeded Mira Mesa, 
the third-place team in the City Eastern League, "upset" No. 6 Mt. Carmel, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
But truly upset was Patrick Henry's Luke Lowrey, whose postgame punch of a 
Monte Vista player ignited a brawl that lasted about three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after Patrick Henry went down in the bottom of the seventh, the two 
teams lined up in front of home plate for the traditional postgame handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
Lowrey instead greeted Curt Howard with a right to the jaw. The two wrestled to 
the ground as other fights broke out all around. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista's Chris Sabala was struck in the left eye -- he said by a punch he 
didn't see coming -- and the eye swelled shut within minutes. There didn't 
appear to be any other serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry Coach Bob Imlay lambasted his team afterward in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Imlay said, "They're a very emotional team, more so than any other I've 
had in 22 years. So they're mercurial. They get real high and real low, like 
manic depressives." 
</P>
<P>
Lowrey, a junior first baseman, said he had been taunted by Monte Vista players 
throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Monte Vista advanced to its first ever baseball final. 
</P>
<P>
Or did it? 
</P>
<P>
Section rules on fighting -- adopted before the 1990 spring seasons -- state 
that teams involved in a brawl during a playoff contest are to be eliminated. 
There is no appeal process. But the rules do not specifically cover postgame 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
The umpires said their responsibilities regarding ejections ended when the game 
did. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry's season is over at 17-12, as is Mt. Carmel's at 22-8. If Monte 
Vista (20-11) is eliminated, Mira Mesa (21-7) would be champion. 
</P>
<P>
Section Commissioner Kendall Webb must decide the matter before Thursday's 
scheduled final at 3:30 p.m. at USD. 
</P>
<P>
In Mira Mesa's victory, left-hander Brendan Hause carried a no-hitter into the 
sixth inning before Andy Panganiban broke it up with an infield single. Hause 
finished with a two-hitter and was aided by three double plays. The third ended 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa had just four hits -- two coming in scoreless innings -- but the 
Marauders took advantage of two costly Mt. Carmel errors for three runs in the 
first and two in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista and Patrick Henry pounded out 19 hits. Howard, who hit .180 during 
the regular season, was the only Monarch with multiple hits, getting three 
singles and three runs batted in. Lowrey and John Dutra had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista's Vern Mullis and Patrick Henry's Robert Mendez had bases-empty 
home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry led at 3-0 and 7-4, but each time Monte Vista responded 
immediately with rallies to either tie or go ahead.

THE ALLEN MYSTIQUE RUBS OFF ON CAL STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A harp was being played in an elegant salon with a high ceiling on the Queen 
Mary. "Gosh, this is exciting, this is the way to live," said George Allen, who 
wore a dark pinstripe suit and a tie his daughter had purchased in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a legendary sports figure who some people still cannot believe is the 
new football coach at Cal State Long Beach, was the guest of honor at a 
reception Wednesday evening. It preceded a dinner that officially welcomed him 
to the city and raised more than $100,000 for his football program. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran four miles today to relax for this," said Allen, 72. 
</P>
<P>
He held a glass of orange juice and mingled with men who had played for him in 
the pros, fans of the Long Beach team, entertainment celebrities and other 
well-wishers who were glad to be in the same room. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest sports dinner in the history of Long Beach -- 1,200 
people," said lawyer Don Dyer, a longtime money raiser for 49er athletics. 
"There's a certain mystique to George's name. It's going to be fascinating 
around here for as long as he stays." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Barber, a professor in the Graduate Center for Public Policy, watched as 
cocktail sippers gravitated toward the man known as much for his eccentricity 
as for his 116-47-5 record as a National Football League coach from 1966 to 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
"George Allen is a legitimate American character, alongside Mark Twain and 
others," Barber said. "It's his values that make him so unique. He stops on 
campus when he sees a tree that's dying and says, 'Golly, what can we do about 
that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Curtis L. McCray, Cal State Long Beach president, said the school has never 
received as much national publicity as it has since Allen's hiring in December. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tremendous," McCray said. "I talk to chancellors and presidents 
across the country, and our discussions always open up with them asking, 'How's 
George Allen doing?' " 
</P>
<P>
Milton Berle, 82, walked into the room, lit a long black cigar and said, "If 
George Burns were here, we'd have Burns and Allen, for Christ's sake." 
</P>
<P>
He was quickly joined by McCray and Allen. 
</P>
<P>
McCray was happy to be with Berle, whose show he had watched on a 
black-and-white Philco TV in southern Indiana as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great coach, you're a great comedian," McCray said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the greatest football coach in the world," Berle said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the old players who had come was Billy Kilmer. He was known as "Ol' 
Whiskey Face" when he played quarterback for Allen in Washington, but it was a 
beer he accepted from a white-jacketed waiter. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks alive, excited again," Kilmer said after posing for a picture with 
Allen, who had been out of football for five years before his arrival in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
With envy, Allen looked over at Dave Butz and Roger Brown, two of his former 
stars. He joked that he hoped they had some eligibility left. 
</P>
<P>
"I only had four defensive linemen" for spring practice, said Allen, who 
canceled the 49ers' annual intrasquad game for that reason. "Now I'll have 
six." 
</P>
<P>
With Allen has come an inevitable re-emphasis on football at the university, 
which has had three consecutive losing seasons and almost dropped the sport in 
1986 because of financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether all the sudden attention could provoke jealousy among faculty in 
other departments, McCray said: "It could, but I think that's OK. It's healthy. 
It means people are taking notice. I doubt we'd get 1,200 people for a 
conference on Chaucer, but the excitement (Allen) has brought can be generated 
in other departments." 
</P>
<P>
As a band played, the party-goers left the ship and went to the Spruce Goose 
dome, which was set up with tables for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Black-and-gold balloons formed three high arches but were easily overshadowed 
by the great white wooden plane of Howard Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Allen spotted McCray's wife, Mary, and said, "That was a great piece of 
swordfish," remembering a night when he and his wife, Etty, were dinner guests 
of the McCrays. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, who was greeted by Mayor Ernie Kell, sat on the dais with Berle, Walter 
Matthau, Dabney Coleman, Cathy Lee Crosby and former players Kilmer, Brown, 
Butz, Dick Bass, Roman Gabriel, Deacon Jones, Tom Mack and Jeff Severson. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvester Stallone was the only celebrity expected who did not show up. 
</P>
<P>
"I get the feeling," said Msgr. Ernest Gaulderon as he gave the invocation, 
"that (Allen) is the apple of your eye." 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the back, Donald P. Lauda, dean of the School of Applied Arts and 
Sciences, said: "I've been here seven years, and I've never seen anything like 
this. (Allen) seems like a real genuine person. I met with nine department 
chairmen recently, and they said they appreciate his concern for academics." 
</P>
<P>
Dyer, vice president of the 49ers Athletic Foundation, said half of the people 
who paid $100 to get into the dinner have been 49er boosters on and off over 
the years and the others, attracted specifically by Allen, are new. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a whole lot of interest from Orange County," said Dyer, who is 
skeptical about whether the apparent new interest in the team will assure 
larger crowds at Veterans Stadium. The 49ers have consistently been at the 
bottom among Division 1-A teams in home attendance. 
</P>
<P>
McCray was asked why a state university, one mostly for students who commute, 
needs to try to build a prominent football program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not to draw more students," he said. "We had 13,000 applications for 
4,000 places in our freshman class. Taxpayers are saying they don't want to pay 
any more taxes. I have to find other ways to raise money." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the dinner audience included developers, financiers and 
industrialists. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we've called attention to one of our programs means it will be 
easier for me to raise dollars for other programs," he said. "Football is 
bringing attention to the university as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
Up on a huge TV screen, Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda, who had been videotaped, 
was praising Allen and vowing that he would be at Veterans Stadium in the fall. 
"Maybe we'll have to build luxury boxes if these people start to come to the 
games," said Merle Makings, promotion director for the athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
Master of ceremonies Roy Firestone read a telegram Ronald Reagan had sent. 
</P>
<P>
After all the celebrities had spoken, Allen finally took the podium for brief 
remarks. The crowd responded with a standing ovation as balloons drifted down. 
</P>
<P>
"I invite all of you to join the team," Allen said. "You can help in hundreds 
of ways. The bottom line is not just a better team, but a greater university. 
This is a great opportunity. We can't lose, the future is really now. There's 
no way we can go but up." 
</P>
<P>
When the cheers died, fans flocked around Berle and Allen. 
</P>
<P>
A man handed over a football and said: "Coach, can you put, To Alex right here? 
Thanks, Coach." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Allen came up to his father, said, "Hi, Dad, great show" and kissed him. 
</P>
<P>
The party was finally over, but confetti still stuck to Allen's carefully 
parted hair as he stepped down from the dais. 
</P>
<P>
"That should buy 50 helmets . . . and some visual aid equipment . . . and some 
new shoes," he said. "I hope."

ARTS FIESTA UNDER WAY IN HERMOSA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The semiannual Chamber of Commerce Fiesta de las Artes is under way in Hermosa

the city pier. Food, entertainment and work by more than 400 artists and 
artisans is on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 people are expected for the three-day arts festival, which opened 
Saturday and combines art and crafts with entertainment, including comedy, 
magic, electronically controlled puppets, jazz, reggae and soft rock. 
</P>
<P>
Free parking is provided at the Mira Costa High School parking lot, Artesia 
Boulevard and Peck Avenue in Manhattan Beach. A round-trip shuttle to and from 
the fiesta is $1, and children under 12 ride free.

hand-painted clothing, pottery, watercolors and paintings. 
</P>
<P>
B. J. Conte, who coordinates the fiesta for the Hermosa Beach Chamber of 
Commerce, said the long-established celebration has been growing as family 
entertainment with the addition of clowns, a petting zoo and pony rides.

CAREER WOMEN INSPIRE GIRLS TO STAY IN SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
They have given up Coke and chips for water and apples. They devour 400-page 
novels and visit the library regularly. And they are learning to stand tall. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen girls at Santa Monica High School have been picking up health 
and beauty tips, along with the success stories of professional women in a 
volunteer project that began in February. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to get the girls interested, animated and inspired to read and to 
stay in school, said project director Susan Bell. She said students can be "at 
risk" for dropping out for any number of reasons: "you're bored, you need 
money, your family life is not too good." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to make them see their goals are reachable. It's one step at a 
time." In weekly lunchtime sessions, the project provides encouragement, 
instruction and "accessible role models, women who made it" to help the girls 
take the first steps. 
</P>
<P>
The girls, mostly Latinas, hope to buck statistics, family history and 
stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
A national study issued this year by U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro F. 
Cavazos found that the average reading level of pupils tested was below 
"adept." The Department of Education defines adept as "the ability to read and 
comprehend a wide variety of text material." Only 46% of Anglo 17-year-olds, 
and fewer than a quarter of Latino 17-year-olds, scored high enough to be 
classified as adept readers. 
</P>
<P>
One in eight Latino high school students in California dropped out in the 
1987-88 school year. Nationwide in 1988, 55% of Latinos from age 18 to 24 had 
graduated from high school, compared to 82% of Anglos in that age range and 81% 
overall, according to the American Council on Education. Only 47% of Latino 
high school graduates went on to college, compared to almost 59% for Anglo 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Latino students with the best of intentions and the highest aspirations face 
serious obstacles, including financial problems and the shortage of positive 
role models to turn to for inspiration, the girls said. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Sernas, 14, said she knows of many students whose schoolwork is hampered 
or who have to drop out because they have to work to help support their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
Others look to the statistics and see little reason to stay in school. Marcela 
Avila, a ninth-grader, said she sometimes wonders whether it's worth it, 
"waking up at 6:30 in the morning and having homework," when "after high 
school, I might end up married and pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
The girls' parents -- secretaries, maids, factory workers -- urge their 
children to do better than they have but are not able to offer themselves as 
role models. Sernas said her father, who only got to the sixth grade in Mexico, 
is "always telling (me) to be somebody," while her housekeeper-mother 
instructs, " 'I don't want you to clean for a living. I want you to be proud of 
your achievements.' " 
</P>
<P>
The girls said stereotypes also stand in their way. "Teachers put you down: 
'You're Mexican, you're in gangs, you're a cholo,' " Avila said. Too often told 
that "you're going to end up pregnant, with a low-paying job," it becomes a 
self-fulfilling prophecy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica High School has had programs geared to its 25% Latino student 
body, including a Latin American history course this semester with sections on 
study skills and careers. An upperclassmen-mentor program was offered last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica project, financed with a $39,300 grant under the federal 
Women's Educational Equity Act, offers a similar message of support and 
empowerment but with low-key delivery. Bell is paid with money from the grant. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to start with young girls and get them interested in careers," said 
Alicia Coro, who helps administer grant-funded programs as the director of 
school improvement programs in the U.S. Department of Education's office of 
elementary and secondary education. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1974 Women's Educational Equity Act, about 30 pilot projects are 
funded each year to develop educational opportunities for women and girls and 
to counter sex-role stereotypes in curriculum. Some of the projects, selected 
as models, are described in manuals and videos that are passed on to teachers, 
community organizations and women's groups across the nation, Coro said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a definite need for improving the participation of girls . . . and 
minority people . . . in math and science," and promoting reading, Coro said. 
"Good readers go on to bigger and better things."

SEPARATED AT BIRTH: Imitation is definitely the most sincere form of flattery, 
especially if you're trying to make a name in rock radio (where everybody's 
always sincere). So it hardly came as a surprise Monday to hear KLOS-FM morning 
sensations Mark &amp; Brian blast a pair of Seattle deejays who've promoted 
their KPLZ-FM morning show with a billboard-ad campaign picturing the duo as 
8-year-old kids. 
</P>
<P>
That's right -- almost the exact same ad campaign Mark &amp; Brian have been 
using to hype their show. Instead of getting mad, Mark &amp; Brian got even. 
After recruiting a lawyer from their audience of morning commuters, M&amp;B 
impishly phoned the Seattle morning team of Kent &amp; Alan and read them the 
riot act, hanging up only after their "attorney" had aired a blustery fusillade 
of obscure legal threats. 
</P>
<P>
Was the threat real or just Mark &amp; Brian-style Memorex? "No, we aren't 
really going to sue them," acknowledged KLOS program director Carey Curelop. 
"If we were, you certainly wouldn't hear about it on the Mark &amp; Brian Show. 
But it's amazing. There are several stations that are using our campaign, with 
children's photo-style pictures of their deejays." Curelop was most impressed 
by the quick response from L.A. legal eagles. "We had five lawyers call from 
their car phones, all offering their services for free. We thought the free 
part was pretty hysterical -- and very much out of character."

ART WORLD: APPEARING IN SANTA MONICA: STEPHEN GLASSMAN'S FIBERGLASS MENAGERIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
FACES 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria," said sculptor Stephen Glassman 
as he glanced with a proud fatherly smile at "Eagle," "Bear" and "Snake," the 
three pieces of his "Zoo" installation in the courtyard next to the Santa 
Monica Museum of Art. "They're like Christopher Columbus' ships -- they're 
vehicles to explore some new frontiers and they're meant to take some risks." 
</P>
<P>
Glassman's animals -- mammoth-sized ambulatory sculptures made of fiberglass, 
bamboo, ropes and fishing net -- are a far cry from his recent ice sculptures 
containing portraits of Presidents that were on view at L.A. Municipal Art 
Gallery in this winter's "Systems" show. For the artist, they represent a 
"ritual" which reconciles his art with other aspects of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Early on, like when I was 19 and 20, I came from a background in touring 
theater. Before I learned to draw and paint, I did things like scene-building 
and kite-making," explained the Venice-based artist, now 34. "I needed a ritual 
-- I needed to find a way where things in art were not separate from life. I 
wanted to travel, and I wanted to do something concerned with the environment. 
. . . So I invented this sort of outdoor touring spectacle, without the 
confines of the galleries." 
</P>
<P>
Glassman looks at his sculptures -- which also contain political symbols such 
as a hammer and sickle, Russian writing and the faces of Ronald Reagan and 
Leonid Brezhnev -- as "a way of exploring the parameters and definitions of 
public art as a necessary, socially fundamental, evolutionary process." 
</P>
<P>
But the pieces, which will remain on view in the museum's courtyard as an 
installation until June 10 (they will also be featured in Security Pacific 
Gallery at the Plaza's "Of Nature and Nations" show beginning June 28), are 
much more than just public sculptures, Glassman said. Their full potential is 
realized when they are "performed." 
</P>
<P>
Such will be the case this weekend when Glassman and a couple of his trainees 
take to stilts to bring the pieces to life as part of a new collaborative 
performance piece -- commissioned by the Santa Monica Museum -- with 
choreographer Sarah Elgart, her troupe of dancers and composer Ed Tomney. 
</P>
<P>
"The physical execution . . . is really a high for me. It's physically 
gratifying to get out into the streets and into the people," said Glassman, 
noting that performances will be held at 8 p.m. on Thursday, Friday and 
Saturday and 3 p.m. next Sunday. Tickets are $8; $5 for museum members, 
students and seniors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
Koplin Gallery is the latest to make the move to Santa Monica. The gallery, 
which formerly had a 3,000-square-foot space in the La Cienega area, opens its 
new 5,500-square-foot space at 1438 9th St. on Saturday, featuring 
"Eternal/Ephemeral," a sculpture installation by Mineko Grimmer along with 
recent drawings by Robert Schultz. The inaugural opening reception is from 3-5 
p.m. and will include the first of several "performances" of Grimmer's 
installation which features a wave-like geometric form topped with pebbles 
encased in ice. As the ice sculptures melt, the pebbles randomly fall onto a 
stone garden. Other performances of the installation will be held on June 9, 16 
and 23 from 2-5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5,500 people attended last weekend's Venice Art Walk, which raised 
about $725,000 for the Venice Family Clinic. "Of course we're very pleased, but 
I think we may have reached our limit," commented Laura Maslon, one of the 
event's volunteer organizers. "I get kind of nervous that if we had any more 
people the studios would just get too crowded." Maslon said. A big hit of the 
annual event was a new feature called "Artists in the Back Room," a show 
featuring works by 18 artists who work as handlers in local galleries. Maslon 
said organizers plan to make the show a permanent feature of the Art Walk. 
</P>
<P>
Works by 32 prominent artists including Lita Albuquerque, Sam Francis, Frank O. 
Gehry, Robert Graham, George Herms, David Hockney, and Ed Ruscha will be on 
view Tuesday through June 9 at Fred Hoffmann Gallery. The works will all be 
raffled off (for $100 a ticket) at DC 3 in the Santa Monica Airport June 23 in 
"Artists Unite for Big Green," a benefit for the Environmental Protection Act 
of 1990 initiative. The works will also be on view on a rotating basis at 
Venice's West Beach Cafe from June 11-22. Information: (213) 395-1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OVERHEARD 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area artist Paul Kos' "Revolution/Counter Revolution" was a big crowd 
pleaser at his opening last weekend at Dorothy Goldeen Gallery, prompting a 
multitude of comments from observers of the piece, which emits ticking sounds 
and Italian, German and Slavian partisan sounds in clockwise and 
counterclockwise sequences. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "It's certainly very modest, they should turn the sound up," said one 
gray-haired man, whose wife received what she described as "an electrical 
shock" when she put her ear too close to one of the piece's speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "This is kind of fun," exclaimed a large man with a silver ponytail as he 
bounced up and down in time to the beats. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "It confuses me, I can't quite follow where the beats are coming from," a 
bespectacled dark-haired woman in her early 30s said quizzically. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "That'd be interesting to have, if you had a wall that big to waste," 
commented a tall, curly-headed fellow glancing at the 132-inch diameter piece. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENTS 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Museum of Art has changed its name. The 50-year-old institution is 
now the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art, but don't go looking for outdoor 
signs and correspondence from the museum to reflect that new name just yet. 
Although the name change was actually made official by the museum's board in 
April, it was not publicly announced until last week, and the transition is not 
expected to be complete until January. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be phased in over the next six months," said museum spokeswoman Diane 
Maxwell, who noted that she was not sure when signs outside of the new museum 
would be redone in the new name. "It's not a black-and-white thing where one 
day you're one (name) and the next day you're something else." 
</P>
<P>
The name change is not expected to bring about any changes in the museum's 
exhibitions program. Instead, it is an attempt to "reflect the full geographic 
identity that is San Diego," museum director Hugh M. Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEBUTS 
</P>
<P>
Painter Robert Kingston has his first solo show opening Thursday at Ruth 
Bachofner Gallery. Kingston, who works with wax, tar, oil and resin, is a 
recent graduate of Claremont Graduate School and last year was included in 
"Dialogue/Prague/Los Angeles" in which several L.A. artists showed in Prague, 
Czechoslovakia. His show runs through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HAPPENING

As part of Ilene Segalove's multimedia exhibition at the Laguna Art Museum, 
KCET-TV Channel 28 on Friday will air "Why I Got Into TV and Other Stories," 
which introduces excerpts from her video art. The half-hour program begins at 
11 p.m., and the 18-year retrospective on view at the museum continues through 
July 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Career Management Skills Workshop for Visual Arts Professionals," a workshop 
covering topics including gallery relationships, grants and jobs, 
documentation, and business management and resources, will be held Saturday

CHALLENGER'S INQUIRY INTO GALLEGLY IS JUST POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past few months, a private detective has been digging into the personal 
affairs of Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), an increasingly common practice 
in the world of political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Although such political tactics usually remain behind the scenes, the 
investigation of Gallegly provides a rare glimpse into how campaigns attempt to 
dredge up embarrassing incidents to hurl at their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The detective, hired by a pollster working for Gallegly's opponent, said he was 
asked several months ago to check out some "embarrassing details" of a boating 
accident last September in Channel Islands Harbor and to look into other 
rumors. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the investigation has failed to turn up evidence substantial enough to 
be raised as an issue by Republican challenger Sang Korman before the June 5 
primary, said Korman's campaign manager, A. Robert Lavoie. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said he is concerned that the opposition might have twisted the truth 
about an innocent boating accident, but he added that he sees nothing wrong 
with Korman's campaign snooping into his private life. Indeed, Gallegly's 
campaign has done background checks on Korman and on other opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is legitimate, and you did something wrong, that's fine," Gallegly said. 
"You should be able to stand up and face the music. But if someone tries to 
twist something, or have someone out and out lie, that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Known in political circles as "opposition research," the practice usually 
consists of scrutinizing voting records, campaign financial documents and other 
official statements. But more and more, campaigns poke into the private lives 
of opponents looking for scandal, sometimes with professional help. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a seasonal thing," said Nicholas Beltrante, who runs an investigation 
firm in Washington. "As we get closer to the election, we get as many as a 
dozen cases going on at one time." 
</P>
<P>
The trend not only reflects a shift in attitudes about what is fair game in the 
political arena, it is also a measure of the political difficulty of unseating 
an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are a challenger, you hope for every opportunity that comes along," 
Lavoie said. "Face it, the only people who have been removed from office were 
removed because of malfeasance or a scandal of some sort." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, 98% of incumbents won reelection to the U.S. House of Representatives 
in 1988. It takes a great deal for an outsider to overcome the incumbent's 
advantage of name identification and ability to raise political contributions 
and send out taxpayer-financed mass mailings to constituents. 
</P>
<P>
In his two terms in Congress, Gallegly has used these advantages to seize hold 
of his safely Republican district. He easily trounced Korman in the GOP primary 
two years ago, as well as a Democrat in the general election. Political 
analysts expect a repeat performance, barring any unforeseen campaign 
bombshell. 
</P>
<P>
Lavoie said the Korman campaign has not had to search for material billed as 
explosive. "During the course of a week, we receive a number of calls giving us 
supposed inside information," he said. "Most of them are a little strange, and 
we dismiss them." 
</P>
<P>
But a rumor about the boating accident kept resurfacing, Lavoie said. "The 
nature of the boating accident had to do with the congressman having left the 
scene . . . and left people in a precarious position," he said. Other related 
rumors, he said, "had to do with what kind of condition the congressman was 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Lavoie asked Robert Danford, an investigator in Los Angeles, to look 
into the incident and conduct other opposition research. Danford refused the 
job and told Gallegly's campaign about the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Danford refused to comment on the matter. But Ben Key, a consultant for 
Gallegly's campaign, said he talked extensively with Danford about what 
Korman's campaign wanted him to do. "Danford said he was turned off by the way 
that Korman's people wanted him to get information," Key said. 
</P>
<P>
Key said Korman's campaign wanted Danford to check out other rumors about 
Gallegly and to conduct 24-hour surveillance of Gallegly in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Lavoie acknowledged that he asked Danford to investigate the boating accident. 
</P>
<P>
When Danford turned him down, Lavoie said, campaign staff asked Gary Lawrence, 
an Orange County pollster, to inquire about the incident. "We asked Gary to 
look into it, check out any reports that were available, conduct any 
interviews," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence turned the matter over to Harry F. Block, a Newport Beach private 
detective, Block said. Through his investigation, Block tracked down the main 
witnesses to the Sept. 4 boating accident at Channel Islands Harbor in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Block said he found one witness who was willing to accuse Gallegly of being 
drunk and leaving the scene of the accident, if he was paid $3,000. The 
detective repeatedly contacted The Times in an attempt to persuade the 
newspaper to publish a story about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The witness' allegations, Gallegly said, are "totally untrue." The congressman 
said the claims are particularly infuriating because he was acting as a good 
Samaritan when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly was returning from Catalina in his 33-foot boat on Labor Day when the 
occupants of a disabled 18-foot speedboat asked him for a tow back to Channel 
Islands Harbor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman said he had managed to maneuver the smaller boat into the 
harbor and to a launch ramp without incident. But at the last minute, the wind 
blew his larger boat into the smaller one, puncturing it with a sizable hole. 
The wind continued to push his boat onto the rocks, knocking out one of its two 
engines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once free of the rocks, Gallegly said, he had to leave to avoid further damage. 
He said he motored across the harbor to his boat slip and then reported the 
accident immediately. He said he left the speedboat safely in shallow water at 
the launch ramp. Gallegly's insurance paid $4,900 to cover damage to the 
speedboat. 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor Patrol and other witnesses, in reports and interviews, backed up the 
congressman's version of events. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, I saw no probable cause to suspect that he was under the influence," 
said Harbor Patrol Sgt. Don Molony, who handled Gallegly's accident. 
"Basically, it was windy, and it was explained to me that they needed to dock 
the boat. And he, on his own volition, was reporting the incident to the Coast 
Guard. So I assumed it wasn't a hit-and-run." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said he believes it is appropriate for political opponents to scour 
the public record for ammunition to use against each other. But he draws the 
line, he said, "at having someone hiding in the bushes -- that kind of 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
Korman said he believes background checks are a legitimate campaign tool. "That 
kind of research is reasonable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he never intended to hire a private investigator, he 
acknowledged that he asked his campaign staff to check out the rumors about the 
boating accident involving Gallegly. He said he told his staff, "maybe we can 
hire someone to find out what kind of person he is, what kind of friends he 
has, what kind of political background he has." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Gallegly campaign did a background check on Korman when the 
Korean-American first challenged the incumbent in the 1988 Republican primary, 
Key said. "We wanted to check out who is Sang Korman," he said. "What we found 
was of no consequence." 
</P>
<P>
Other than routine checks of public records, the Gallegly campaign has not 
mounted another investigation of Korman, said John Frith, Gallegly's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The probe into Korman's affairs was not the first by a Gallegly campaign. In 
1986, his campaign hired a researcher to check out Tony Hope, son of 
entertainer Bob Hope, Key said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout that campaign, Hope was considered the front-runner in the race for 
the vacant seat left by former Republican Rep. Bobbi Fiedler. But Gallegly won 
an upset victory after labeling Hope a "carpetbagger" who was not living within 
the boundaries of the congressional district and after pointing out that Hope 
had not voted in several elections. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of attempting to dredge up embarrassing details about a 
candidate's private life is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
A political operative who once worked for Gallegly was caught plying his trade 
in Texas earlier this year. Former Gallegly aide Gary Maloney became the center 
of a controversy over his research into a Texas GOP gubernatorial candidate in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
According to the candidate's complaint, Maloney asked the ex-wife of one of the 
candidate's employees "several inappropriate questions," including whether the 
candidate drinks or uses foul language and how he treats his employees and 
conducts his personal and business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the complaint hit the newspapers, Maloney was promoted to 
director of strategy of the National Republican Congressional Committee. His 
committee helps finance House campaigns across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Koops, a spokesman for the Republican committee, said there is no 
committee policy forbidding research into private affairs or banning the 
employment of private investigators. But he said the committee believes that 
"suitable issues" can be found in the public record. 
</P>
<P>
His Democratic counterpart takes a firmer position. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a difference between hiring someone to do research and hiring a 
private detective to snoop around in people's lives," said Howard Schloss, 
spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "It is an 
extreme that doesn't have a place in the election process." 
</P>
<P>
Schloss said he wouldn't be surprised if some Democratic candidates have hired 
investigators, but he is not aware of any examples. "We don't condone it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater and co-Chairman Ed Rollins like to 
talk about their $1-million research center in the basement of Republican 
headquarters. But Republican staff members say they don't hire investigators to 
probe into private affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not an investigative agency," said Leslie Goodman, a spokeswoman for 
the Republican National Committee. "We deal with items that are in the public 
record and in the public domain." 
</P>
<P>
Private detectives nationwide suggest that campaign officials underestimate how 
frequently they hire investigators. The leader of one private investigator 
association takes a philosophical view about investigating private lives of 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has a right to know about the honesty and integrity and, to a 
certain extent, the personal habits of the public servants," said Ralph Thomas, 
president of the National Assn. of Investigative Specialists in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
His 1,000 members are frequently summoned by campaigns to do the digging for 
them, he said. "It is very common these days. But it is not a big percentage of 
our work."

CONJUNTOS: MEMORIES FOR SALE, $5 A SONG; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: OXNARD'S LATINO NIGHTSPOTS ARE POPULAR WITH THE BANDS WHO PLAY REQUESTS 
AND EASE LONELINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like thousands of others, Raphael Moreno is a family man without a family. 
</P>
<P>
A poor Mexican gardener who lives in a government-subsidized apartment in 
Oxnard, he earns barely enough to pay his bills and send $150 each month to his 
wife and four children, whom he left behind four years ago in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
For men such as Moreno, whose numbers grow every year as economic necessity 
drives Mexican laborers north, life in America can be an exhausting round of 
work and sleep, relieved only by an occasional beer with a friend -- and the 
sounds of the conjuntos. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring back memories of Mexico," Moreno said recently as he listened to a 
band called El Trio Estrella (The Star Trio) play a request in a smoke-filled 
bar near 6th and Meta streets. "Good memories." 
</P>
<P>
These groups of wandering street musicians are becoming a fixture in Oxnard's 
downtown restaurants and bars, serving as ambassadors of good will for lonely 
men far from home, much as USO performers once brightened the lives of American 
fighting men in Europe. Among the most popular songs is a melancholy tune 
called called Cruz del Olvido (The Cross of Oblivion), about a young couple who 
are separated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of song that makes you cry," a musician said. 
</P>
<P>
One musician said at least five conjuntos -- roughly translated, the name means 
bands -- and two mariachi groups call downtown Oxnard their turf. For the 
groups, the growing number of musicians means more competition. But for 
working-class Mexicans, more conjuntos means more music, more memories of home. 
</P>
<P>
On any given night, as the day begins to fade and the streets begin to empty, 
the conjuntos can be seen carrying their brightly decorated instruments along 
Oxnard Boulevard between 5th Street and Wooley Road. The men -- usually in 
groups of three and including guitar, accordion and stand-up bass -- hit 
nightspots such as El Cielito Lindo (The Beautiful Heaven) and El Nuevo 
Nopalito (The New Cactus), charging $5 a tune. 
</P>
<P>
The conjuntos form a special fraternity with their own code of behavior. Unlike 
the larger and more elaborate mariachi bands, who make the lion's share of 
their earnings at parties and weddings, the conjuntos must pound the pavement 
and hustle requests. 
</P>
<P>
The informal conjuntos usually don't wear the expensive matching outfits 
preferred by mariachis. In most cases they sport Western-style hats, blue jeans 
and boots. The more successful groups sometimes buy matching vests. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Friday evening, El Trio Estrella played three or four requests at 
El Nuevo Nopalito, a small, smoke-filled restaurant on 6th Street. It had been 
a slow night for the group. By 10 p.m. the three men had only collected about 
$50. But the night was still young. By 2 a.m. they expected to visit a total of 
eight bars and restaurants before calling it quits. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Gonzalez, a guitarist from Chihuahua, works in the fields during the 
day. He said sometimes the conjuntos don't make enough for the evening's supply 
of cigarettes and beer, but that half the reward of playing the music is 
spiritual and emotional fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
His partners, Antonio Gonzalez and Jose Luis Hernandez, both fieldworkers, 
nodded in agreement. "Whoever doesn't love music doesn't have a soul," said 
Antonio Gonzalez, the group's bass player. 
</P>
<P>
The members moved from table to table soliciting requests, staying at one 
location until all the patrons have had a chance to hear their favorite songs. 
When they were through, they left to make way for other groups. 
</P>
<P>
The groups never squabble with customers over money, Antonio Gonzalez said. If 
a customer refuses to pay for a song that the group has played, he said, the 
musicians simply take their business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"There are never any problems," he said. "The law of the conjuntos is respect." 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant and bar owners have mixed feelings about the conjuntos. Some say the 
groups attract business, while others complain that the customers spend more 
money on requests than they do on drinks and food. 
</P>
<P>
The groups hustle their songs at eating and drinking establishments in Simi 
Valley, Moorpark, Santa Barbara and Port Hueneme. But they say the best 
business is in Oxnard, where several dozen Latino bars and restaurants are 
located within walking distance of each other. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the bands' names are derived from the Mexican regions that they 
call home: two examples are Los Canarios del Norte (the Canaries of the North) 
from the northern state of Jalisco, and Los Cardenales del Sur (the Cardinals 
of the South), from the southern state of Michoacan. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, three of the Los Canarios del Norte stopped on the 
corner of Oxnard Boulevard and 6th Street to light cigarettes before heading to 
a restaurant down the street. 
</P>
<P>
As the group waited for the signal to turn green, another conjunto passed them. 
The men exchanged greetings, shook hands and wished each other good luck for 
the evening. Guadalupe Cervantez, the accordion player for Los Canarios, said 
that despite the increasing competition from other bands, there are enough bars 
and restaurants to go around. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, at a noisy restaurant called El Cielito Lindo, Calixto Ramirez and four 
of his friends gathered around a table, ordered dinner and a few rounds of beer 
and called upon Los Cardenales del Sur to play a few requests. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, a native of Michoacan who works at Magic Mountain, said he could 
listen to the conjuntos for hours. 
</P>
<P>
After a hearty Mexican meal and a few beers, Calixto Ramirez began to sing 
along with Los Cardenales. When the conjunto began to play a somber song about 
being poor in Mexico, he dropped his head and covered his face with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at the prodding of other customers in the restaurant, Ramirez got up 
from the table, requested a melancholy love song and began to belt out a 
warbled version that won him the enthusiastic applause of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
When he finished he declined to say how much he had spent on the music that 
evening, only that he loved every song.

A Los Robles Regional Medical Center employee was assaulted in the emergency 
room parking lot Friday morning on her way to work at the Thousand Oaks 
hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose name is not being released, suffered two broken ribs and a 
concussion after a man attacked her with a crowbar, said Lt. Kelly McIlvain of 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, a nursing technician at Los Robles, was treated and released, 
McIlvain said. She was assaulted immediately after she stepped out of her car 
just before noon, McIlvain said. "We speculate that she was interrupting him as 
he was about to burglarize a vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Several patrol units, a helicopter unit, a canine unit and detectives searched 
the surrounding areas for the man but were unable to find him.

The attacker is described as a Latino male with black hair and brown eyes, 
about 19 years old, 5 feet 8 inches and 140 pounds. PEGGY Y. LEE

PARENTS' GROUP SAYS AIDS PLAY GIVES WRONG MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A popular play about AIDS prevention that has been touring public high schools 
has come under fire from a group of parents on the Palos Verdes Peninsula who 
contend it unduly promotes the use of condoms to prevent the spread of the 
deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
The group, Concerned Parents and Residents, argues that the 45-minute play 
"Secrets" emphasizes the use of condoms while failing to adequately promote 
abstinence as the only sure-fire prevention method. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it is lopsided," said Sharon Stucki, a mother of six and member of the 
200-member parents group. "We don't feel it is an honest play." 
</P>
<P>
The play, sponsored by the Kaiser Permanente health care organization, centers 
around a high school couple. The young man, Eddie, has the HIV virus from 
sharing needles with a group of soccer buddies. Even before he learns he has 
caught the virus, his girlfriend, Monica, has chosen not to have sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser spokesman Allan Mann said the organization believes the play clearly 
promotes abstinence. Moreover, actors, who participate in discussions with 
students after performances, are instructed to emphasize abstinence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mann added that educating students about the use of condoms is an important 
part of the play. 
</P>
<P>
"Abstinence is a very important message, but at the same time we have to be 
realistic about this and realize many young people are sexually active," Mann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Bales, a member of Concerned Parents and Residents, says group members 
"don't have our heads in the sand. We are not advocating we get into this 
puritanical kind of education of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
However, the group ultimately hopes to persuade Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified 
School District officials to revamp the district's sex education curriculum to 
emphasize traditional moral values. The organization began forming about two 
months ago after a handful of mothers attended a sex-education lecture 
sponsored by the district and thought the speaker was too jocular in her 
approach. The speaker also told several mothers privately that she does not 
believe in abstinence, according to Stucki. 
</P>
<P>
"We really feel the problem here, as well as in lots of other places, is we 
need a new approach to the whole sex and health education curriculum," said 
Bales, a mother of three. "We feel there is a total lack of morals in the 
education program." 
</P>
<P>
In April, the group asked school board members not to allow "Secrets" to be 
performed at the district's three high schools. However, the board did not take 
a stand on the issue and left the decision to administrators at each campus. 
</P>
<P>
On April 30, the play was performed at Rolling Hills High School after a 
videotape of it was viewed by several parents, students and educators, 
Principal Mike Escalante said. The play is scheduled to be performed at 
Miraleste High School in June. 
</P>
<P>
At Palos Verdes High School, Principal Kelly Johnson said he decided against 
showing the play this school year because of the campus' crowded year-end 
schedule and because he wants to see the play before making a decision. Johnson 
said he plans to see the play Wednesday night at the Norris Theater in Rolling 
Hills Estates. Kaiser has rented the theater for the evening so the play can be 
performed as a public service for the community. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser's Mann said the play has been performed 171 times for more than 80,000 
high school students in Southern California. The response has been 
overwhelmingly favorable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In late February, the play was shown at Banning High School in Wilmington and 
drew enthusiastic applause from students. At Rolling Hills High School, 
teachers took a random survey of students after the play was performed and 
received numerous positive responses, Escalante said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things they particularly liked about it is that it didn't talk down 
to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lora Dodell, president of the Parents Teachers Students Assn. at Rolling Hills 
High School, said she has seen the play performed twice and watched it on 
videotape twice. She said that she interpreted the play as strongly urging 
students to abstain from sex and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was outstanding," Dodell said, adding that she would like her 
seventh-grade daughter to see the play. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Concerned Parents and Residents, who viewed the play on videotape, 
said they believe the play sometimes presents the subject of AIDS prevention in 
too frivolous a manner and, in at least one scene, a parent is depicted as 
insensitive to his child's concerns about sex. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the group said they also took exception to a scene in which 
Monica uses a banana to show Eddie how to properly put on a condom -- a scene 
that Kaiser allows schools to delete if they find it objectionable. Escalante 
said he decided to excise the scene before the play was performed at Rolling 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Most members of Concerned Parents and Residents said they believe the play 
focuses entirely too much on the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS 
and erroneously gives children the impression that there is such a thing as 
"safe sex." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Fawell, a retired Kaiser physician who lives in Rancho Palos 
Verdes, said he believes "Secrets" strongly implies that premarital sex is 
acceptable and that the use of condoms ensures protection from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"That to me was the stronger message rather than 100% abstinence," Fawell said.

FORMER CARSON COUNCILMAN HIT WITH 3RD CLAIM OF HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A third sexual harassment accusation by a Carson city employee has been brought 
against former Carson City Councilman John Anderson, who denied the latest 
allegations as well as the earlier ones. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a week before Anderson lost his seat in the April 10 municipal 
election, two female city employees accused him of sexual harassment and filed 
claims against him and the city. The Anderson campaign responded immediately, 
calling the accusations political sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent allegations are contained in a letter to City Atty. Glenn 
Watson. The letter was discussed by the council in closed session Wednesday. No 
claim has yet been filed. 
</P>
<P>
All three sets of charges concern activities that allegedly occurred during the 
two years Anderson was a councilman. All the women are represented by attorney 
George W. Schaeffer of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, Cynthia L. Turner, a counter clerk for the business 
licenses division, is seeking $7,500 in damages from Anderson and the city. She 
has alleged that Anderson frequently asked her visit with him or join him for 
wine; that he kissed her on one occasion in 1988, causing her to drop her 
lunch, and that he fondled the palm of her hand suggestively on another 
occasion about a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson denied the allegations Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"None of it is true. I helped this woman in many ways. . . . It's too bad that 
she didn't tell you that I helped to get her permanent status when she was a 
temporary employee." 
</P>
<P>
Reached at work, Turner, who became a permanent employee on Nov. 17, 1988, 
refused to elaborate on her complaint or comment further. 
</P>
<P>
The city is investigating the claims filed against Anderson in April by Grace 
S. Fauchald, longtime secretary to the council, and Mamie Carter, a clerk at 
the Carson Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Before the election, officials of the employees union, which opposed Anderson, 
acknowledged coordinating those complaints. On Friday, Anderson accused the 
union of orchestrating the latest complaint as well, a contention denied by the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the latest allegation are contained in a statement by Turner, which 
is attached to a letter from her attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Anderson would come by my desk whenever he was in City Hall to ask me how 
I was feeling and to invite me for a glass of wine or to tell me the only 
reason I would not accept his invitation was because I was afraid of him and 
the way he might make me feel," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been many occasions when Mr. Anderson would come by my desk and 
motion for me to shake his hand. He would give me a smile and gently squeeze my 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 22, 1988, she said that she got on the City Hall elevator with Anderson 
and "after the doors closed, Mr. Anderson leaned over and kissed me on the 
neck. This caught me off guard. When I moved away, I lost control of my lunch 
and it fell to the floor. We had to stop the elevator on the first floor in 
order to clean up the mess." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson replied Friday that he remembered "when she dropped her lunch, but it 
wasn't because I was bothering her." 
</P>
<P>
Turner and Anderson agreed that he bought her another lunch. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1989, Turner also claimed, Anderson came by her desk one day and 
motioned for her to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"When I did, he gripped my hand and rubbed the palm of my hand with one of his 
fingers," she wrote in her statement, which adds that "when a man rubs the palm 
of a woman's hand in that manner, it means he wants to have sex with her." 
</P>
<P>
She also wrote that she had reported several of the incidents to her 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Administrator Scott Yotsuya said Turner's superior was Ferrell 
Sneed, who has died. Yotsuya said that Sneed never referred any complaints from 
Turner to the city administrator or the Personnel Department. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Williams, president of Local 809 of the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees, denied that the union was involved in Turner's 
complaint, adding that she is not a union member. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Watson said the city's effort to settle the complaints have been 
rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt the pulse on that issue and said, 'Now that he has gone, there is no 
need to change anything in the workplace because the voters took care of that.' 
. . . In all cases, the attorney says they want money," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer, the lawyer, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson reiterated statements made since April that the entire matter has been 
fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
"All this is totally untrue, believe me. It is easy for me say, but when the 
time comes (that) these people have to face me, you will hear the other side of 
the story," he said.

RIVALS IN 36TH DISTRICT RACE ADDRESS ISSUES; 
</P>
<P>
OVERVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following are answers to questions posed by The Times to the candidates in the 
June 5 Republican primary in the 36th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contenders 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom McClintock, 33, (R-Thousand Oaks) was first elected in 1982 at 
age 26. He is the lead Republican on the Judiciary Committee. He has been a 
newspaper columnist and administrative assistant to state Sen. Ed Davis 
(R-Santa Clarita). An outspoken conservative, he criticizes his own party 
leaders for not pushing alternatives to Democratic proposals in Sacramento. 
Earlier this year, he was stripped of his position as Republican whip after he 
failed in a bid to oust Republican leader Ross Johnson of La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Staker, 35, of Camarillo is the first Republican since 1982 to challenge 
McClintock in the heavily Republican district. A political newcomer, Staker is 
a tax lawyer who manages a small law firm in Camarillo. He was chairman of a 
defunct Camarillo citizens group that investigated the $26-million financial 
loss of the city government. He is a bishop in the Mormon Church. Staker says 
McClintock's "negative" political style has alienated officials in Ventura 
County and state leaders in Sacramento and made him less effective. McClintock 
denies it and says his record shows many accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questionnaire 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates earlier this month. Answers have 
been edited for length. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Do you support the California State University system's locating a 
Ventura County campus on the Taylor Ranch? Briefly, why? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: Yes. After five years and a half-million dollars evaluating 27 
sites, Taylor Ranch is our last opportunity for a university for Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: No. Taylor Ranch is on the far edge of the county, inconvenient for 
students of the county and too close to UC Santa Barbara. It would increase 
traffic congestion in Ventura and air pollution in the county in general. 
Trustees selected Taylor Ranch for its ocean view. The campus should be more 
near the population center of the county, near Oxnard or Camarillo, just off 
the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Under recently introduced legislation, state sales taxes would be raised 
0.25% for 10 years to help finance school construction. Do you favor an 
increase in sales taxes to underwrite new school construction? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. Local bond measures should finance school construction where 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: No. As a tax lawyer, I do not see that we need any more sales taxes 
unless it is to make up for abolishing the state income tax for all but the 
most wealthy. The state has plenty of revenue. It simply needs to make 
education a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
Q: An initiative measure on the June ballot would raise taxes on gasoline sales 
by 9 cents a gallon to finance highway building projects. Do you support the 
concept of higher gas taxes to underwrite road construction? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. Proposition 111 will cost the average family of four $9,160 
over 10 years -- with only $1,450 going for roads. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: Absolutely yes. It is simply an increase in a user fee to try to keep 
up with inflation. Construction costs have increased 326% since the current tax 
was fixed; this increase is only 100% over a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
Q: A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit the spraying of 
pesticides on private property without the written consent of the owner. Do you 
support this measure? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. The Medfly turned Hawaii from a net agricultural exporter into 
an importer. We can't let this happen to California. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: No. Aerial spraying of pesticides to fight the Medfly is for our own 
good. I am concerned about the rights of property owners but do not believe in 
creating a right to sue every time a small amount of pesticide blows onto the 
property of a disgruntled person. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Under current law, the Legislature is responsible for redrawing state 
legislative and congressional district boundaries. Do you believe this system 
should be changed? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: Yes. State-of-the-art gerrymanders by politicians rob the people of 
their votes. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: Yes. Our present system thwarts the will of the people. It particularly 
favors incumbents of both parties. I support the idea of a nonpartisan 
commission to redraw the boundaries to make districts that really do belong 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Earlier this year, Assemblyman McClintock tried unsuccessfully to oust 
Assembly leader Ross Johnson from his leadership post. Do you support keeping 
Ross Johnson as Republican leader? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. Ross Johnson was a character witness for convicted Sen. Joseph 
Montoya and has led Assembly Republicans to support the two biggest tax 
increases in California history. Our party needs new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: Yes. I see no need to rock the boat over who is the leader. All that 
Assemblyman McClintock's attempt to unseat Ross Johnson has done is to get 
himself fired as minority whip, an important position, and to be literally 
relegated to a back seat in the Assembly. McClintock is now politically dead 
and has no prospect of getting anything done for the district. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you support putting limits on the number of terms state legislators can 
serve? If yes, how long should they be? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: Yes. I support the proposed 12-year limit. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: Surprisingly, no. The voters have the good judgment to know when to 
throw out a worthless politician. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you support a woman's right to unrestricted abortions within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. I am opposed to government's financing and promotion of the 
practice and insist on parental consent for minors. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: No. I firmly oppose almost all legalized abortions; the exceptions are 
when pregnancy has resulted from incest or rape, the life or health of the 
mother is in jeopardy in the opinion of competent medical authority or the 
fetus is determined, by competent medical authority, to have severe defects 
that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth. It is reprehensible for 
government to make anyone opposed to abortion pay, through our tax dollars, for 
something we believe to be so wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you support the death penalty for any crimes? If so, which ones? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: Yes, for first-degree murder and treason. I am carrying legislation 
this year to impose the death penalty for the murder of a child. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: Yes. I support the current death penalty statute. I would add killing a 
police officer as a special circumstance that justifies the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you support the state ban on semiautomatic assault rifles? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. This measure enacts an infinitely expanding list of firearms 
and severely threatens the right of the decent population to defend itself from 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: Yes. I believe strongly in the right to bear arms and that government 
should interfere as little as possible in people's affairs. However, I see the 
ban as simply drawing the line in relation to machine guns. These weapons can 
be fairly easily converted into automatic weapons. Our law enforcement 
officials have asked for this ban, and I support them. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you support the so-called "Big Green" ballot initiative, which would seek 
to eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase out pesticides 
known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all new 
developments? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. This proposal would be an economic catastrophe for the people 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: No. I believe that our present governmental environmental regulations, 
if properly enforced, are adequate to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you think the state should require private employers to subsidize 
day-care services for employees who request them? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. Employment benefits should be freely negotiated between the 
parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: No. Government overregulates business already. In addition, I have 
really not heard a hue and cry for such a requirement. By and large, people are 
making their own arrangements for day care quite well. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Proposition 112 on the June ballot would ban speaking fees and limit gifts 
to state legislators while creating a commission that could pave the way for 
higher legislative salaries. Do you support it? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. I am disgusted with the Legislature's response to recent 
scandals, which says, "Double our salaries, and we'll try to behave ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Staker: No. Although I would ban speaking fees and limit gifts to legislators, 
assemblymen are paid enough already. The framers of the state Constitution 
intended that the assemblymen be part-time citizen legislators, not full-time 
politicians who have no idea of what it is like to hold an honest job. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you support Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed constitutional changes that 
would require state prison inmates to work in privately sponsored industries to 
pay for their incarceration? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: Yes. I carried a portion of the proposal last year, and carried the 
original legislation in 1985, long before the governor proposed it. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: Yes. They should earn their own keep, and this is a great way to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you believe our present strategy of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. It doesn't do any good to arrest a drug dealer if he's back out 
on the streets before the officer's paper work is finished. We need Proposition 
115. (Prop. 115 is an anti-crime initiative on the June ballot that would 
toughen penalties for murder and torture and speed up criminal trial 
procedures.) 
</P>
<P>
Staker: No. The only way to really make a dent in the drug problem is to 
educate the public, especially the children, about the evils of drugs, and 
then, if that fails, to impose heavy prison sentences for drug use. If demand 
stops, so will the crimes of the suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Would you consider the possibility of decriminalizing the use of drugs? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. It has been tried in other countries with disastrous results. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: Absolutely not. The opposite should be done: Severely punish drug 
users. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you support raising sales or other taxes to finance anti-drug law 
enforcement efforts and/or anti-drug education programs? If yes, by how much? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. Californians already bear among the heaviest tax burdens in the 
country. We need to change our current spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: No. Our taxes are already high enough. We simply need to get our 
spending priorities straight. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you support full or partial public funding of political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. Thomas Jefferson said it best, "To compel a man to furnish 
contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and 
abhors in sinful and tyrannical." 
</P>
<P>
Staker: No. Our new campaign finance laws, with their spending limits, should 
do the job. However, they should be combined with a ban on speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
Q: A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit foreign individuals 
and corporations from owning land in California. Do you support this? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. Our foreign trade problems have nothing to do with foreign land 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: No. America stands as a beacon of freedom to the world. We should not 
discriminate against an individual simply because he or she comes from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Rising property values in the Santa Monica Mountains have made it more 
difficult for state and federal parks agencies to buy land for public use. Land 
prices have escalated in part because local officials have allowed developers 
to build more houses than provided for under zoning laws. To keep property 
prices more affordable to parks agencies, should governments in Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties refuse such so-called "upzoning"? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. Local land use decisions should stay with local elected 
officials, who are accountable to the voters for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: Yes. We have plenty of developable land away from the Santa Monica 
Mountains. The control of growth in our area is very important, especially in 
wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are you willing to publicly release your tax returns and those of your 
spouse prior to the election? 
</P>
<P>
McClintock: No. 
</P>
<P>
Staker: Yes, if McClintock will do the same. However, all our return shows is 
our income from my legal practice and the usual sort of deductions. It shows no 
speaking fees, as I assume Assemblyman McClintock's should show.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CLOSED LANDFILL TO BE TESTED FOR LEAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County and state officials are holding a public meeting Wednesday to unveil 
plans for a testing program that will attempt to determine whether hazardous 
waste is leaking from the Palos Verdes landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The testing, expected to take up to three years to complete, will involve at 
least 39 test borings on the now closed 291-acre dump in Rolling Hills Estates 
between Crenshaw and Hawthorne boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
If contaminants are found to be leaching from the property, remedial action 
will be taken, delaying county plans to turn 180 acres of the land into an 
18-hole public golf course. 
</P>
<P>
The public meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, from 7 to 10 p.m. at the South 
Coast Botanic Gardens, at 26300 Crenshaw Blvd., Rolling Hills Estates.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: WITH DAYS OF BEACHES AND BATHING SUITS NOT FAR OFF, IT IS 
THE TIME TO TONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Rainey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Gonzalez stood at the threshold of the great "Toning-Tanning-Cult of the 
Body Machine." 
</P>
<P>
In one direction, through glass double doors, flowed the raw materials -- 
clear-eyed men and women with gym bags -- ready to be processed by Lifecycles, 
Stairmasters, free weights and tanning beds. 
</P>
<P>
Out the same doors emerge the finished products -- athletes in a flush of 
endorphins, their eyes glazed in post-aerobic high. 
</P>
<P>
It's Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Summer is coming. 
</P>
<P>
The machine is in high gear. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like it kicks in at this time every year," said Gonzalez, 20, as he 
waited for a friend outside the Torrance Athletic Club. "I'm trying to get a 
little bigger and to get a tan." 
</P>
<P>
But why? 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez blushed, then smiled. "To be a lady-killer, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
This Torrance club is just one of several dozen shrines in the South Bay to 
which devotees like Gonzalez flock at this time of year. With days of beaches 
and bathing suits not far off, it is the time to tone. 
</P>
<P>
It was this spring, in Palm Springs, that the El Camino College student and his 
buddies resolved to build their bodies. In the desert, it seemed all the 
best-looking girls were with the Charles Atlas types, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
To enhance their desire, Gonzalez and five friends are putting $10 each into a 
pool. A panel of female judges will award the $60 pot this summer to the 
hunkiest of the half dozen. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to get bigger all around," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
For Valerie Seitz, 21, of San Pedro, summer preparation is even more intense. 
</P>
<P>
She has joined two health clubs -- one for its superior aerobics classes and 
the other for the weights. To maximize her two-hour workouts at the clubs, she 
often brings along a personal trainer to direct the action. 
</P>
<P>
Seitz said workouts are not an ordeal. She enjoys meeting her friends at the 
gym and socializing. For the real estate office worker, it's worth the more 
than $400 a month for the two gyms, the personal trainers and the supervised 
weight-loss program. 
</P>
<P>
Seitz said she needs to take off eight more pounds. And time is wasting. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Christmas -- you eat all that junk food -- I've been thinking of taking 
it off, taking off that weight," Seitz said. "Summer is definitely on my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Anita Allen, 26, of Torrance shares that feeling. 
</P>
<P>
She joined the Torrance Athletic Club because her roommate goes there. And 
she's thinking about "toning up for my bathing suit." 
</P>
<P>
Even though she feels in good shape, Allen said she always dreads shopping for 
a new swimsuit. "They show every possible flaw in your body," she said. "I 
don't know if I'll ever like it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, health club owners know they can depend on their patrons to keep on 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
"We get more people saying they need new exercises for their stomachs," said 
Tom Doolin, owner of the Torrance club. "And with a lot of the women, they want 
exercises for their bottoms." 
</P>
<P>
He said many new members are taking advantage of a presummer special: $14.95 
for one month of unlimited baking time in one of the tanning beds. "That's so 
they don't have to walk out on the beach butt-white," Doolin explains. 
</P>
<P>
For Doolin, this brawn business is as dependable as the season. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are saying, 'Oh man, I don't want to be here.' They are making 
themselves come. They know they are going to be on the beach soon. It is only a 
matter of weeks now." James Rainey

ROYAL TAKES THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE TO 2-A VOLLEYBALL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Royal High boys' volleyball team, continuing a season-long trend, won its 
second consecutive Southern Section 2-A Division title Saturday with an easy 
15-10, 15-4, 15-4 victory over Canyon at Marina High in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For Highlander Coach Bob Ferguson, whose team swept all but one of its matches 
in an undefeated season, the three-game sweep came as a departure from last 
season's championship match in which Royal struggled to a five-game victory 
over St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we shouldn't have gone five games last year," Ferguson said. "I 
don't want to sound egotistical, but we didn't play well last year. We waited 
to get going." 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders did not hesitate in this year's final, taking only 1 1/2 hours 
to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Ramirez had eight of Royal's 11 service aces, including five in the last 
game, as the Highlanders finished their season 20-0. 
</P>
<P>
Adam White had 13 kills, Ramirez 12 and Mark Fiala 11 to lead a balanced Royal 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Holy smokes we played well," Ferguson said. "This was our best game this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat Canyon in five games earlier this season, and I thought this would be 
tougher. I told everyone at school that they should plan to be here for 2 1/2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, which like the Royal program is in only its third year of 
interscholastic competition, completed its season 16-2. 
</P>
<P>
Royal led, 11-10, in the first game when Fiala went to work. He had two service 
aces and a kill and Miguel Ramirez added a service ace as the Highlanders went 
on a 4-0 run to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
Royal carried that momentum into the second game. Kevin Hambly had four kills 
and two blocks and Fiala added three kills and a service ace to spark a 10-1 
run that turned a 4-3 lead into a 14-4 advantage. Scott Enright's kill gave the 
Highlanders a 15-4 win -- and a 2-0 lead in games. 
</P>
<P>
The serve again played a big role in the third game. Royal trailed, 4-3, but 
five aces by Ramirez keyed a 12-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Coach Ardyce Masters said that her team lost momentum after the first 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we died," she said. "You can't die against a team like Royal 
because (it) will rip your face off." 
</P>
<P>
It seems the Highlanders have been doing a lot of that lately. 
</P>
<P>
The title was the third for the Royal volleyball program in the past 12 months. 
Along with his two boys' titles, Ferguson coached the Highlander girls to the 
4-A title last fall.

BOXING: WITH A LITTLE MORE SEASONING -- AND PERHAPS A FEW MORE POUNDS ON HIS 
LEAN FRAME -- RAFAEL RUELAS OF ARLETA COULD SOON BE MAKING MONEY HAND OVER

When 12-year-old Rafael Ruelas begged his way into the Ten Goose Boxing Club 
gym several years ago and announced that he wanted to be a part of the boxing 
world, trainer Joe Goossen took one look at the kid's body and felt that the 
youngster most certainly had a bright future in the sport. He just didn't know 
as what. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as a ring rope. Or a boot lace. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot and 80 pounds and with a pair of arms dangling at his sides that 
appeared not to be arms at all but threads hanging from the sleeves of his 
T-shirt, Ruelas didn't exactly fit the traditional image of a boxer. 
</P>
<P>
No one would have faulted Goossen had he told the kid to forget about the ring 
and boxing gloves and instead consider a future at Santa Anita with a whip in 
his hand. 
</P>
<P>
But Goossen didn't do that. He gave the boy a chance despite the fact that the 
kid had more ribs on display than a formal Texas dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, perhaps in the next six months or a year, Ruelas very possibly will start 
putting some serious boxing money into his pocket. And Goossen's. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I made a good decision," said a smiling Goossen, who brought boxer 
Michael Nunn from obscurity to the middleweight championship of the world. 
</P>
<P>
The rise of Ruelas, of Arleta, has been brief but remarkable. Starting his 
career with all the strength of a paper sack, Ruelas was thrown into 55 amateur 
bouts. He won 50. He embarked on a pro career just 16 months ago. He is 16-0. 
</P>
<P>
And lest anyone get the idea that Ruelas, now a wispy 5-10 and 126 pounds, has 
been winning these fistic battles by moving and jabbing and waltzing his way 
around befuddled opponents who wished they had trained by sparring against a 
dangling length of clothesline, get a load of this: The kid with the body that 
seems perfect for cable TV has knocked out 14 of his 16 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
He has knocked some out cold, the referee not bothering to count to 10 because 
he knew that, if he wanted, he could count to 50 over some of Ruelas' victims 
without receiving much more than a leg twitch in response. 
</P>
<P>
He has left several others out on their feet, winning by TKO when the referee 
would ask the battered opponent a question such as, "Are you OK?" and receive a 
slurred, glassy-eyed answer such as, "Yes. I own the large lamp." 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas, who just turned 19 and fights in the featherweight division, has become 
a pure boxer, skilled far beyond his years in the ability to deliver a quick 
blow and duck or deflect an opponent's fist. And he also has used his body to 
advantage, learning all about the principle of leverage and the great force 
that can be generated by thin -- but very long -- arms. 
</P>
<P>
Like his his brother, Gabriel, who is also 19 but fights at 130 pounds, Rafael 
has emerged as a legitimate force in boxing. Gabriel (21-1) is recovering from 
a broken bone in his arm, a freak injury sustained in last month in Las Vegas 
during a bout against Jeff Franklin. Rafael will continue his march Tuesday 
night against Vincente Gonzalez of Bell in a scheduled 10-round bout at the 
Country Club in Reseda. A victory over Gonzalez, and perhaps a half-dozen after 
that, will put Ruelas in line for much bigger things. 
</P>
<P>
"Rafael is six months or so away from $50,000 fights," said his manager, Dan 
Goossen. "It's all out there for him. And it's not very far away." 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a thin young man who spent the first eight years of his life living 
high in the mountains of southern Mexico, in the decidedly uncosmopolitan 
settlement of Yerba Buena in the state of Jalisco. There, he spent days in the 
jungle picking garbanzo beans and corn with his brothers and sisters, of whom 
there are plenty. Rafael is one of 14 children of parents who came to the 
United States in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a big change when we moved here," said Ruelas, who knew little 
English as an 8-year-old but graduated a semester early from North Hollywood 
High. "Everything was so different. Just having a bathroom inside the house. I 
had never seen that before." 
</P>
<P>
It was while working as door-to-door candy salesmen that Rafael and Gabriel 
happened to knock on the door of the old Ten Goose Gym in North Hollywood. An 
older Ruelas brother, Juan, was a professional boxer at the time and the kids 
had decided that they liked the excitement of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
They saw the Ten Goose Gym as their big break. The Goossens gave Gabriel a 
chance to work out in the gym, and within three months they cracked the door 
one more time to let Rafael in. 
</P>
<P>
The door of the gym -- in North Hollywood and now in Van Nuys -- has been 
swinging open daily for Gabriel and Rafael ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt early on, after a few months with these guys, that both of them had the 
ability and dedication to become world champions," Joe Goossen said. "I 
honestly believed it. I had been around amateur fighters for a long time and I 
felt I had an educated eye, that I could spot real talent. And these guys were 
real talent." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is not enough in what is likely the toughest and most 
punishing of all sports. There is another ingredient that is just as elusive as 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
"You get kids with great talent, and they don't want to train," Goossen said. 
"And you get kids with mediocre talent who you can't get out of the gym because 
they are so dedicated. To find the combination of great talent and great 
dedication, that is very, very rare. Gabriel has that combination. And Rafael 
has it too." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran boxer Bernardo Pinango of Venezuela, a two-time world champion as a 
bantamweight and a junior featherweight, put his considerable talents and vast 
experience in the ring a month ago with Rafael during a sparring match. He did 
not like what he found. 
</P>
<P>
"Rafael just pounded him," Goossen said. "It wasn't even a match." 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Ruelas said Pinango came over to him and, speaking softly in 
Spanish, delivered a message. "He took out his mouthpiece and told me that he 
would never get in the ring with me again until I was a world champion, and 
then someone would have to pay him a lot of money to do it for the title," 
Ruelas said. "I think he was impressed." 
</P>
<P>
As Ruelas' young body continues to grow, he knows the featherweight division 
will one day be left behind. He reckons he might end up weighing a bit less 
than 150 pounds, making the lucrative welterweight division and its 147-pound 
limit an attractive goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I see myself five years from now as a very well-known and established 
champion," Ruelas said. "I see myself making the million-dollar purses too." 
</P>
<P>
Does all of his early success and his great promise make him think that all of 
this cannot be happening to a former garbanzo bean picker, to a young man who 
marveled a decade ago at indoor plumbing? Does it sometimes seem as though all 
of the success is happening to someone else? 
</P>
<P>
"No," said the thin man with the heavy punch. "I have no doubts. I know it is 
happening to me." 
</P>

HENDRIX, MCBRIDE PREVAIL; CSUN MEN TAKE 2ND

<P>
A seasoned veteran and a relative newcomer used the same tactic to win their 
respective races and lead the Cal State Northridge men's track and field team 
to a second-place finish in the NCAA Division II championships Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Redshirt junior Kevin Hendrix won the 100 meters and freshman Erick McBride 
took the 800 at Hampton University's Armstrong Field. Both started quickly and 
never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Matadors totaled 60 points to finish behind St. Augustine's 
(N.C), which scored 111 points and won its second consecutive team title. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton (56 points), California Collegiate Athletic Assn. champion Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo (53) and Cal State Los Angeles (49) rounded out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
Lolita Pile led the Northridge women to a fifth-place showing by finishing 
second in the triple jump for the second consecutive year, and the Lady 
Matadors' 400-meter relay team placed fourth. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo scored 116 points to win its second consecutive title, followed 
by Norfolk State (72), Abilene Christian (62), Alabama A &amp; M (56) and 
Northridge (44 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't have asked for much more," Northridge assistant Tony Veney said. 
"To have three individual champions is just super." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Hendrix and McBride, freshman Chris Perry won the long jump 
Thursday, marking the first time the Matadors have produced three men's winners 
in the Division II meet. 
</P>
<P>
Set to move to Division I in the fall in all sports except football Northridge 
went out in style. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix, who has been nursing a foot injury all season, got off to the "best 
start of my life" in the 100 in upsetting favorite Kenneth Brokenburr of St. 
Augustine's, 10.50 seconds to 10.52. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix, who teamed with Melvin Jones, Chris Pippins and Wade Smart to place 
fifth in the 400 relay (40.46), would have had a greater margin of victory but 
raised his arms in celebration five meters before the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe how well I got out," Hendrix said. "I couldn't feel anyone 
around me after the first 10 meters and that really surprised me. For a split 
second, I thought I might have false-started, but when I didn't hear a second 
gun, I just kept pouring it on." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hendrix came back to set a Northridge record of 20.87 seconds in the 
200, he finished third behind Terrence Warren (20.67) of Hampton and Brokenburr 
(20.70). 
</P>
<P>
Fourth coming off the turn, Hendrix made up a couple of meters on the leaders 
in the final 100. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of my foot, I just can't run the turns that hard," Hendrix said. 
</P>
<P>
McBride did not finish fast in the 800, but he didn't have to after blowing the 
race open early. 
</P>
<P>
McBride, the Southern Section 4-A Division champion at Palmdale High last year, 
had a 10-meter lead after passing the 400 mark in 52.3. When he had run 600 
meters in 1:19.8, his advantage had grown to 12 or 13 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahamed of St. Augustine's made a rush in the final straightaway but 
finished two or three meters behind McBride, who won in 1:49.34. 
</P>
<P>
"The first 400 felt really comfortable and easy," McBride said. "But I started 
to get scared in the last 200. I kept waiting for someone to come up on me, but 
it never happened." 
</P>
<P>
Shunning conventional tactics, which say that runners win national 
championships in the 800 by outkicking opponents, McBride dared his competitors 
to start quickly with him. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured if he went out fast, he was strong enough to hold off the rest of 
the field," Northridge assistant Bob Augello said. "We thought it would have 
been a bigger gamble to let it turn into a kicker's race." 
</P>
<P>
Pile was hoping to challenge Diana Wills of Army in the triple jump, but the 
two-time defending champion never gave her the chance, bounding a wind-aided 44 
feet 11 3/4 inches in the second round of the first flight of jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
Jumping in the second flight, Pile was forced to play catch-up, but her 
wind-aided 41-10 3/4 in the sixth and final round left her well behind the Army 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
Tonya Conner, Pile's freshman teammate, finished sixth at 40-2 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Other top Northridge performances came from freshman Cela Taylor, who finished 
fifth in the women's 400 in a personal best of 55.32, and Pippins, who placed 
fifth in the 100 in 10.64. 
</P>
<P>
The wins by Hendrix and McBride, which came within 20 minutes of each other, 
helped turn around a day that had started poorly for the Northridge men. Perry 
had placed a non-scoring ninth (47-5 3/4) in the triple jump and Jorge Castro 
and Sasha Vujic had finished out of the money in the 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Vujic, still recovering from a fractured left foot, finished 12th; Castro 
dropped out after 500 meters because he was having difficulty breathing due to 
a chest cold.

SMITH CLEARS HURDLES, HAWTHORNE STUMBLES; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: SOPHOMORE QUALIFIES FOR STATE IN TWO EVENTS, BUT TEAMMATES FAIL TO 
FOLLOW HIS FOOTSTEPS. 
</P>

<P>
Thanks to sophomore hurdler Demond Smith, the three-time defending state 
champion Hawthorne High boys' track and field team won't be forgotten at the 
1990 state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Although the injury-decimated Cougars have no chance to win a fourth 
consecutive title, Smith suddenly rates as a statewide force after taking 
second place in both the 110-meter high hurdles and 300-meter intermediate 
hurdles at Friday night's Southern Section Masters' meet at Cerritos College. 
Smith will be the only Hawthorne boy in the state meet, Friday and Saturday at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a transfer from South Bay Lutheran, established personal bests by 
running the 110 in 14.51 seconds and the 300 in 37.84. Entering the Masters' 
meet, Smith had the third-best qualifying mark in the 110 and the fourth-best 
in the 300. 
</P>
<P>
But Cougar Coach Kye Courtney said Smith's showing was somewhat surprising 
because of the hurdler's lack of experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a sophomore get a second in a Masters' meet before," said 
Courtney, who has coached Hawthorne to six boys' state championships in seven 
years. "But we knew he had the talent. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a question of whether he could mentally make the move as a sophomore 
against guys who are 18 years old." 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne boys' 400-meter relay team was originally entered in the Masters' 
meet but was scratched due to lead-off man Robert Blackburn's blood-pressure 
problems, leaving Smith as the Cougars' only entrant. But Smith, who didn't run 
track at South Bay Lutheran, said he didn't feel any extra pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of pressure on me all year (because) I was really the only 
healthy guy," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Smith has had to overcome a nagging thigh injury, which kept him out 
of the Arcadia Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very coachable and does what he's told," Courtney said. "The thing about 
Demond Smith is that he never missed a practice. He ran when he was hurt. He 
did all the therapy that we gave him." 
</P>
<P>
Muir's Andre Derezin (14.47) won the 110 and Cajon's Charles (37.67) won the 
300. Courtney said Smith's close finishes in each race means he will be a 
factor at the state meet. "If he can run with these guys, he can run with 
anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Morningside girls' 1,600-meter relay team was the only victorious South Bay 
entrant, upsetting favored Pasadena Muir. The Monarchs ran 3:44.79. Sophomore 
Sanoma Nickson, the lead-off runner, said Morningside wasn't intimidated going 
up against Muir, the 1989 state champion. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we run against them, we have to have the attitude that we're going 
to win, no matter what place they are in the state or the nation or whatever," 
Nickson said. "We were pumped up for them, and we had no bad handoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Nickson also qualified for the state meet in the 100-meter low hurdles (14.81) 
and as a member of the Monarchs' 400-meter relay team (46.73). 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne also qualified both of its girls' relay teams. Senior Kee-sha Adams 
anchored the Cougars' 1,600 relay (3:46.61) and ran the second leg of the 400 
(47.27) despite missing much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've only been practicing a month and a week," Adams said. "It's hard because 
everybody is at their peak, but I'm still trying to get in shape." 
</P>
<P>
Other state qualifiers: the St. Bernard girls (400 relay, 47.42), Morningside's 
Santeshia Arnold (100, 12.12; 400, 24.60), Morningside's LaShawn Stringer (400, 
55.63) and Torrance's Jennifer Tully (long jump, 17-7 1/4).

Gary Schroeder of Burbank edged Page Jones of Rolling Hills to win the 20-lap 
United States Auto Club Western States Series Three-Quarter Midget main event 
before 2,225 at Ventura Raceway on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder had just enough power to get past leader Jones, the son of 1960 
Indianapolis 500 winner Parnelli Jones, on the front straightaway on Lap 8 and 
held on to nip Jones by two car lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Drake of Valencia took third. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also moved Schroeder into a tie with Ricky Gray for the most USAC 
main event career wins at 12. 
</P>
<P>
Sleepy Tripp of Costa Mesa won the 30-lap USAC Midget main event. 
</P>
<P>
Midget 10-lap heat race winners were Robby Flock of the City of Industry, 
Tripp, Hank Butcher of San Leandro, and Gary Howard of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Flock's 10-lap heat race victory took only 2 minutes 10 seconds, breaking the 
Midget 10-lap record time on the one-quarter-mile dirt oval of 2 minutes 17 
seconds.

event this season at Saugus Speedway entering Saturday night's feature race 
before a crowd of 4,256. 
</P>
<P>
So, plenty was to be gained when Sigman -- ninth in the division's points 
standings -- and Spangler (fourth) leaped ahead of the pack on the opening lap. 
</P>
<P>
And, although three lengthy yellow flags and one red delayed proceedings 
considerably, they did nothing to alter the positions of Sigman and Spangler. 
</P>
<P>
Sigman, who started on the pole for the 40-lap, Sportsman Division main event, 
went wire to wire for his first victory in two years while Spangler finished 
second. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think about (starting in front)," Sigman said. "I just thought about 
driving 40 smooth ones and not making a mistake. I had some tough guys behind 
me." 
</P>
<P>
They stayed there. Spangler, who finished second in last season's points 
standings, tried unsuccessfully to make several passes. Starting third in the 
race, his second-place finish also was his best of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Points leader and defending champion Will Harper of Tarzana finished ninth. 
Dave Phipps of Simi Valley, who entered the evening fifth in the points 
standings, finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, Oliver Aguilar of Sun Valley and Shannon Flavin of West Hills 
staged a high-speed duel in the 25-lap Hobby Stock oval main event before 
Aguilar held off Flavin to win. 
</P>
<P>
Flavin started in second position and leaped into the lead on the first lap. He 
had trouble holding off Aguilar, who moved from the middle of the pack to just 
behind Flavin by Lap 10. On Lap 13, Aguilar took the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the third in a row for Aguilar who, surprisingly, is not among 
the division's top 10 points leaders. Flavin entered the evening fifth in the 
points standings. 
</P>
<P>
Four drivers held the lead in the 15-lap Jalopy main event, the last being 
Richard Smith of Reseda for the final six laps. Smith shot past Jeffrey Holmes 
of North Hollywood on the backstretch of Lap 9 and sped away to the checkered 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, who entered the evening tied for second in the points standings with 
Smith, led from Laps 5 to 9. John Fleming stole the lead from pole-sitter 
Harrison Bartholomew of North Hollywood on the first lap. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-lap Sportsman Division heat-race winners included Harper, Phipps and Tom 
Eurton of Valencia. Charles Reed of Newhall won the eight-lap Hobby Stock 
figure-eight heat race.

A DISTRICT ATTORNEY WORTHY OF THE TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
OF THE 4 PROSECUTORS ON BALLOT, INCUMBENT CAPIZZI MOST DESERVES VOTERS' SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In these days of mounting concern over crime, the designation of "district 
attorney" after a candidate's name on the ballot is likely to be considered 
pure political gold. 
</P>
<P>
When residents go to the polls June 5 and look at their ballot for Orange 
County district attorney, they will find four candidates, all carrying that 
rich designation of "district attorney" in some form after their name. 
</P>
<P>
There may be some confusion about what each title actually means, but there 
should be no confusion over which candidate to elect. We urge voters to retain 
Mike Capizzi as Orange County's district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, designated as "Appointed Orange County District Attorney" on the 
ballot, was named to the post by the County Board of Supervisors last Jan. 2. 
He was appointed to replace former Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks, who accepted a seat 
on the county's Superior Court bench. He is completing Hicks' unexpired term 
that ends in January. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi was Hicks' chief assistant and had his support for the top post. Now, 
in his effort to win his own four-year term, Capizzi has strong support from 
many areas of the community, including most police chiefs, major law 
enforcement organizations, elected officials, labor unions and the association 
of deputies in the district attorney's office. His challenge, however, is 
coming from three other people in his office, which explains all those 
designations on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district attorney's office has not been as aggressive as we'd like 
in handling last year's still-pending poll guard case involving the election of 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), it still carries a tough reputation 
for dealing with political shenanigans. It earned that renown in the 1970s when 
it prosecuted more than 40 Orange County political figures, including three 
county supervisors and a congressman. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi was instrumental in those successful indictments. He has proven himself 
as a prosecutor. But the large, urban district attorney's office has many able 
prosecutors. What it also needs is an able administrator. With his 26 years of 
standout service in the office, ranging from a starting deputy to second in 
command, Capizzi has proven himself to be that too. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four prosecutors on the ballot, Mike Capizzi is the most qualified. He 
is the right person in the right place at the right time. He was appointed to 
the job in January. On June 5, voters should elect him district attorney.

BIRTH CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found it a bit ironic that, after reading Kevin Williams' letter ("One Fact 
Tips Scales: The Unborn Have No Choice," May 20) where he states: "A pregnant 
woman has the choice to seek financial, material or emotional assistance . . . 
(it is available)," on the front page of the same issue is an article titled 
"Budget Deficit Deepens Crisis for Medi-Cal." The story explains that Medi-Cal 
lacks funding to pay for hospitals, doctors and others tending to the needs of 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
I would then ask Mr. Williams where a poor pregnant woman would go when she 
needs Medi-Cal to pay for prenatal care and the delivery of her child? 
Operation Rescue? And what about afterwards? Who will pay for pediatric care, 
for food, for the day-care expenses? The National Right to Life League? 
</P>
<P>
I would respectfully suggest that Mr. Williams and all of those who share his 
concern join us in supporting increased birth control research to give all 
women (and men) more contraception options to prevent unplanned pregnancies 
from occurring in the first place. Believe me, Mr. Williams, no one who 
considers themselves pro-choice is pro-abortion.

GIL FERGUSON DOESN'T DESERVE REELECTION; 
</P>
<P>
PRIMARY CHALLENGER PHYLLIS BADHAM PREFERABLE TO 70TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
INCUMBENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has been representing the 70th 
District for nearly six years. That's long enough. He has an acceptable 
opponent in the Republican primary this year: Phyllis Badham, a 30-year-old 
public relations manager. 
</P>
<P>
Badham, the daughter of former U.S. Rep. Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach), is 
politically inexperienced, but has energy and ambition. She is preferable to 
Ferguson, whose tenure in the Capitol has been marred by petty partisan 
politics that have done nothing to aid his district. GOP voters should give 
Badham the nomination which, given the solidly Republican makeup of the 
district, would virtually assure her victory in November. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, 67, simply has not represented his district well. While problems with 
traffic and air pollution have grown more serious, he has made himself best 
known for an obsession with Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a former 
anti-Vietnam War demonstrator whom Ferguson declared "a traitor." Ferguson, a 
former Marine, has made numerous attempts to have Hayden ousted from the 
Assembly, prompting one critic to suggest that Ferguson move to Santa Monica to 
run against him. For his efforts, Ferguson got a lot of publicity and the 
nickname "Rambo" but nothing for his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson recently showed his mean-spiritedness by casting tasteless aspersions 
on gay activists -- whom he called "faggots" -- a label he later said he didn't 
know was derogatory. "I could have called them sodomites," Ferguson said later. 
On another earlier occasion, he angered Japanese-Americans when he objected to 
state funding for a memorial that would have recognized California's unfair 
internment of thousands during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when his constituents have been concerned about growth, Ferguson has 
led the fight against local restrictions on development. At a time when the 
majority of his district favors leaving a woman to make the choice over her 
reproductive system, Ferguson strongly opposes it. For the current campaign, he 
even enlisted Operation Rescue, the aggressive anti-abortion group. Ferguson's 
record on environmental legislation has been poor. 
</P>
<P>
The 70th District -- which includes Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, San Juan 
Capistrano, Mission Viejo, El Toro, Dana Point, Costa Mesa and several other 
Orange County cities -- deserves better representation than Ferguson has 
provided.

THIEU, KY BACK IN LEADERSHIP ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You would think that after the fall of South Vietnam in 1975 we would have had 
sufficient time to evaluate the leadership of its former premiers. For that 
reason, I was appalled to read that Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky were 
attempting to reestablish their influence over the Vietnamese community in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Thieu and Ky never demonstrated any qualities of good leadership and, in fact, 
were concerned only with themselves and their own families. It is also 
well-documented that their administrations were nothing more than corrupt 
regimes that showed very little regard for their own people. 
</P>
<P>
The most tragic result of their ineptitude was the loss of more than 58,000 
Americans who fought a war that Thieu and Ky had no interest in fighting. While 
we saw our friends leave the battlefield in body bags, the South Vietnamese 
army conducted "search-and-avoid missions." This was the result of policies 
established and implemented by both Thieu and Ky. 
</P>
<P>
How little have we learned from history and what does it say about our own 
leaders who fail to confront these two "glorious heroes"? Instead, they are 
allowed to live and flourish here and to attempt to recapture a semblance of 
statesmanship.

YEAS AND NAYS FOR IRVINE MAYOR CANDIDATE SALLY ANNE SHERIDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pillars of political integrity are shaking in Irvine after revelations that 
City Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan has engaged in dozens of real estate 
transactions with city employees and Irvine Co. executives that netted the 
Sheridans' real estate partnership a handsome profit of more than $130,000 
since Sheridan joined the council in 1986 (May 17, Orange County Section). 
</P>
<P>
These transactions presumptively taint Sheridan's capacity to render objective 
and disinterested judgments on matters concerning city employees and the Irvine 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
How can we ever know if Sheridan's votes on important policies -- such as the 
Irvine Business Complex, open space preservation or residential developments, 
which all involve the Irvine Co. -- were influenced in any way by her business 
relationships with Irvine Co. executives? 
</P>
<P>
How can we be certain that the explicit or implied promise of future real 
estate deals from the Irvine Co. doesn't color Sheridan's view of what policy 
decisions are in the best interest of all Irvine residents? 
</P>
<P>
We can't, and that fact should outrage every resident in this city! We 
shouldn't have to worry about the judgmental integrity of our elected 
representatives. Their capacity for objective, fair and effective 
decision-making should never be compromised by financial transactions with 
major interests in the city for personal gain or profit.

Yes, I am doing my part in conserving water. A few years back when we went 
through this same emphasis, people in our area pitched in to do their part, 
only to be hit with a higher rate for water because we were using less. 
</P>
<P>
Using less and being penalized? Of course, the rate never came down when water 
became more plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
Now tell me how this encourages people to conserve. Will we again be charged a 
higher rate at the first sign of our using less water? You can just bet we 
will!

GLOBAL DEGRADATION: IT'S ON OUR BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing about a concern of mine with regard to our beaches. Since the oil 
spill in February, I have noticed an increasing number of dead birds and marine 
mammals on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
When the oil spill occurred, I, like so many of the citizens of Huntington 
Beach, rushed to do whatever possible to help. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the dead wildlife on the beaches was quite painful and only reinforced 
my concerns about our overconsumption of resources. 
</P>
<P>
Since the initial days and weeks of that tragedy, I have continued to find many 
dead birds (at least three a week) and mammals along the beaches. Just this 
week I came upon two recently killed baby seals and a wounded sea gull, as well 
as three dead seals in various stages of decomposition. 
</P>
<P>
I am aware of the importance of tourism and wonder if the rush to declare our 
beaches "safe" after the oil spill was valid. We all recognize that the beauty 
of our community lies in the beauty of the beaches out our front doors. As the 
British Petroleum tankers once again appear off our coast, it's business as 
usual. And yet, I wonder about the message coming from the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
As we face the crises of global degradation, we don't have to look far; it's 
right in front of us.

BETTER THINGS TO DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm in agreement with that editorial, "Hey, Let's Not Have a Cow, Man," (May 
12) about some Orange County school administrators barring the Bart Simpson 
shirts on their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
It is undemocratic, unconstitutional and closed-minded to prevent students from 
expressing themselves. As Assemblyman John Vasconcellos stated: "In those cases 
where students do wear Bart Simpson as an expression of their self-doubt, 
administrators who send them home to change are missing a great opportunity to 
help." 
</P>
<P>
Also, La Habra City School District Supt. Richard Hermann misued his authority 
by banning the shirts. School officials have other things to worry about, such 
as the basics of reading and writing about the right to freedom of expression.

5 STRUGGLE TO FIX IDENTITY WITH VOTERS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: IN THE GOP PRIMARY, THERE HAVE BEEN EXCHANGES OF FINGER-POINTING 
REGARDING TIES TO SPECIAL INTERESTS, FUND-RAISING, THE ENVIRONMENT AND 
ABORTION. THE MAN THEY HOPE TO REPLACE, DENNIS BROWN, REMAINS NEUTRAL.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With five Republicans pursuing the GOP nomination in the 58th Assembly 
District, their primary race has evolved into an often-frustrating search for 
money and a sometimes-scrappy quest for identity. 
</P>
<P>
Like the predominantly Republican coastal district they seek to represent, the 
candidates are split between Los Angeles and Orange counties. Three -- City 
Council members Jan Hall and Jeffrey Kellogg, and physician Seymour (Sy) Alban 
-- are from Long Beach. The Orange County contenders, developer Peter von Elten 
and Mayor Thomas J. Mays, are from Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Republican primary will face Democrat Luanne W. Pryor and 
Libertarian Scott Stier in November. Democrat Joel R. Bishop will be listed on 
the primary ballot, but he has withdrawn from the race. 
</P>
<P>
All five of the Republicans were hampered by Los Alamitos Republican Dennis 
Brown's unexpected and late announcement that he would rather do God's bidding 
than continue in the seat he has held for 12 years. Since then, Brown, who is 
studying to be a lay minister, has declined to become involved in the June 5 
primary leaving his would-be heirs to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Mays and Von Elten have in particular have engaged in an exchange of 
finger-pointing regarding their ties to special interests and their 
fund-raising efforts, while Alban, one of the best financed of the candidates, 
has gone after Kellogg and Mays with a flurry of mailers assailing their stands 
on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
A freshman councilman with celebrity good looks, Kellogg has been hobbled by a 
lack of money and a ruptured Achilles' tendon that has left him limping through 
his campaign wearing a cast. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, a 12-year veteran of the City Council and former director of the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District (RTD), has also been hurt by a low campaign 
budget in a city where three local runoffs are soaking up campaign 
contributions and diverting them from the Assembly race. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough," lamented Hall, whose 3rd District base of support is one of those 
areas engaged in an expensive runoff match between the two men who want to 
replace her on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Alban, a prosperous 66-year-old orthopedic surgeon, and Von Elten are pouring 
their own money into their campaigns, giving them an advantage over their less 
well-heeled competitors. Hall, 47, recently joked with a tinge of envy that 
Alban was sending out so many mailers that he must own a printing press. 
</P>
<P>
The boyish-looking Mays has attacked von Elten for a dinner hosted by two 
Orange County planning commissioners who entertained representatives of South 
Orange County developers whose projects must receive commission approval. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten in turn has blasted Mays for a fund-raiser held at the home of a 
Huntington Beach planning commissioner and attended by about 90 people, 
including a major developer with a project due to come before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten accused Mays of engaging in a "developer shakedown," by allowing the 
$150-a-couple event to be held at the home of Huntington Beach Planning 
Commissioner Kenneth Bourguignon. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing (Bourguignon) did was provide his home and some hors d'oeuvres 
and that was it," Mays responded, insisting that the fund-raiser "was 
aboveboard. . . . It was strictly put on by COR-PAC," the conservative 
Republican Political Action Committee. Mays also got an from the Huntington 
Beach city attorney indicating that the dinner was not improper. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten too defends his event. "I maintain there was nothing wrong with what 
I did. . . . It was simply an opportunity to meet me and get to know me. . . . 
Mine was not a fund-raiser where any money was requested, no money was given to 
me, and I have yet to receive any money." 
</P>
<P>
Mays, a 36-year-old analyst for McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co., has 
charged that Alban and Von Elten would have difficulty acting independently in 
the Assembly because of the financial support they are receiving. Mays asserted 
that Alban will be compromised by money from the medical community, while von 
Elten, executive vice president and general counsel of Mola Development Corp. 
in Newport Beach, will be under the sway of the development community. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten, 46, has fired back by branding Mays a hypocrite who has, during his 
four-year Huntington Beach council career, been helped extensively by 
development interests that have contributed directly to his campaigns and 
mounted independent campaigns on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Alban's mailers have infuriated Kellogg, who grumbles that Alban is distorting 
his positions on oil drilling and abortion. Alban has repeatedly characterized 
Kellogg as anti-abortion because Kellogg personally opposes abortion and 
opposes government funding of abortions. But Kellogg, a 36-year-old Roman 
Catholic, has consistently said he would not vote to outlaw abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Alban, probably the most liberal of the five contenders, says he has targeted 
Mays and Alban because their conservative stands differ the most dramatically 
from his. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not pro-choice if it's pro-choice only for those who can afford it," 
Alban said, explaining his attacks on Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of last winter's oil spill off the coast of Huntington Beach, all 
the contenders are portraying themselves as environmentalists. Mays was lauded 
for his involvement in cleanup efforts as Huntington Beach's mayor, but it is 
Alban who has picked up the endorsement of the California League of 
Conservation Voters, an environmental group that rates politicians on their 
environmental positions and votes. 
</P>
<P>
So important is the 58th District race to the league that the organization has 
loaned a full-time worker to Alban's campaign. Alban was one of three 58th 
District candidates interviewed by the conservation league, which rated Brown's 
record as the worst in the Assembly. Neither Hall nor Kellogg responded to a 
questionnaire, said the league's Southern California director, Paul Koretz. Of 
the three who did, Koretz said they "all seemed decent enough on the 
environment" and all would be a vast improvement over Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Koretz said Mays responded very effectively to the oil spill that soiled his 
beach town but said the league ranked him below Alban because he had failed to 
demonstrate environmental leadership on the council until the spill occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Alban is mounting his first political campaign at a time when most people 
retire -- 66. 
</P>
<P>
His age has prompted by another candidate to make snide remarks about going to 
Sacramento to retire, but Alban counters that it can only be an asset that he 
doesn't want to be a career politician. Furthermore, he says no legislator 
should serve more than three terms. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's nine-year RTD tenure gives her name recognition, although not all of it 
is favorable. Widely praised by her board colleagues as a tough and bright 
director, her departure from RTD earlier this year stirred up controversy when 
she immediately took a job as a private consultant lobbying on behalf of the 
transit district. 
</P>
<P>
The board, stung by criticism, canceled the contract, although Hall remained 
with CBC Consulting Inc. of Torrance, a small firm that primarily helps 
developers obtain government permits.

<P>
What is your position on abortion? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Opposes legislation outlawing abortions or requiring minors

privately funded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: Opposes legislation outlawing abortions and requiring parental 
consent for minors. Supports government paying for poor women's abortions. 
</P>
<P>

Supports parental consent requirements. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Peter von Elten: Supports a woman's right to have an abortion and government 
funding for abortions. Opposes parental consent requirements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What is your position on Proposition 112, which would bar speaking fees and 
limit gifts to state legislators while creating a commission that could pave 
the way for higher legislative salaries? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Supports the limits on speaking fees and gifts but would 
prefer the reform not be tied to pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: Concerned about tying ethics reform to pay raises but supports the 
limits on gifts and speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kellogg: Opposes the ballot item because it ties ethics reform to 
legislative pay, supports the limits on gifts and speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Mays: Supports it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter von Elten: Opposes a pay raise for legislators but supports limiting 
gifts and barring speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What is your position on the death penalty? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Favors death penalty in selected cases, such as those 
involving multiple murder victims, atrocities or the murder of a law 
enforcement officer.

<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: Favors it. 
</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter von Elten: Favors it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What is your position on Proposition 111, which would gradually raise the gas 
tax by 9 cents to pay for highway projects and also loosen limits on state 
spending? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Supports it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: Supports it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kellogg: Opposes it, arguing that while transportation improvements are 
necessary, he favors neither the tax increase nor lifting the spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Mays: Supports it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter von Elten: Supports it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What is your position on the so-called Big Green initiative, a sweeping, 
environmental proposal on the November ballot that would phase out 
cancer-causing pesticides, protect redwood forests and require efforts to slow 
global warming? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Supports much of the initiative but would vote against it, 
because of concerns that it will hurt state agriculture and because it is 
co-sponsored by the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: Supports it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kellogg: Opposes it because of Van de Kamp's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Mays: Doubts he would support it because of its cost and Democratic 
sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter von Elten: Opposes it. "Big Green I think is just too big." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Do you support prohibiting the sale of assault weapons? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kellogg: No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Mays: Probably, although generally opposes gun control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter von Elten: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would you require employers with five or more full-time employees to provide 
them with basic health care coverage? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Yes, and might support giving those employers state tax 
credits. Would also consider providing health insurance to the unemployed, 
perhaps financed by increased alcohol taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: Yes, and might give the employers state tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kellogg: No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Mays: "I don't know." Says a task force of state and private 
representatives is needed to find ways of providing health insurance coverage 
to all Californians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter von Elten: No. Suggests that the state might regulate insurance industry 
profits on medical coverage, hand out stiffer penalties to physicians caught 
double-billing and more closely monitor the use of medical tests and X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What is your position on offshore oil drilling? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Opposes all new offshore oil drilling, except in a national 
emergency. Would require oil tankers to be double-hulled and supports creating 
an oil spill fund financed with a per-barrel tax on oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: "I've seen areas where it works (such as Long Beach), but I think 
there are areas that are very fragile -- and I would state categorically that 
Huntington Beach is one of them -- and it's totally inappropriate and shouldn't 
be pursued." Supports double-hulling of tankers and a spill fund financed by 
the oil and shipping industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kellogg: Says the decision of whether to drill offshore should be made 
"case by case." Would prohibit drilling in environmentally sensitive areas, 
such as near wetlands. Opposes creating an industry-financed oil spill fund, 
supports double-hulling of some smaller tankers and would support requiring oil 
companies to post bonds when drilling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Mays: Opposes offshore oil drilling along the entire California 
coast, says tankers should be required to come into port rather than use 
offshore moorings to unload, supports double-hulling. Does not object to a 
spill fund but says, "I think it should be done at the federal level." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter von Elten: Opposes new oil drilling off the California coast, supports 
creating an industry-financed spill fund and double-hulling requirements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would you support legislation barring discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kellogg: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Mays: No. "Everybody is guaranteed the same rights under the 
Constitution," he said. "I don't feel special-interest legislation is the right 
way to go." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter von Elten: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Do you support Proposition 115, an initiative that would amend the California 
Constitution to speed trial proceedings and set broad new limits on the rights 
of criminal defendants? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Cost to Employers 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 187 to 213, the House rejected an amendment to limit the cost to 
businesses of accommodating disabled workers under the Americans With 
Disabilities Act (above). The cost of providing for a handicapped employee was 
to have been capped at 10% of the pay for the job in question. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) said, "This is the small-business amendment in 
this legislation." Opponent Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.) said, "Arbitrary 
formula limits are not what this legislation is about." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to cap the bill's cost to employers.

Cost to Employers

By a vote of 187 to 213, the House rejected an amendment to limit the cost to 
businesses of accommodating disabled workers under the Americans With 
Disabilities Act (above). The cost of providing for a handicapped employee was 
to have been capped at 10% of the pay for the job in question. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) said, "This is the small-business amendment in 
this legislation."

Opponent Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.) said, "Arbitrary formula limits are not 
what this legislation is about." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to cap the bill's cost to employers.

Talks to resolve Poland's week-old railway strike collapsed, ending prospects 
for a settlement before today's local elections. Signs of an accord emerged 
briefly when workers unblocked several rail lines and strike leaders from the 
coastal city of Slupsk entered negotiations with the government. But strikers 
abandoned the talks when the government refused to discuss their pay demands, 
the official news agency PAP said. Today's balloting is for 48,000 seats in 
local government.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met with nuclear weapons experts to discuss their 
concerns about the safety of a nuclear-tipped, short-range missile deployed on 
strategic bombers, but Cheney made no decision about withdrawing the weapons 
from service, a spokesman said. Directors of three U.S. nuclear weapons 
laboratories made presentations about risks associated with the continued 
deployment of Short-Range Attack Missile-As, or SRAMs, on "alert" B-52, B-1, 
and FB-111 bombers -- those ready for takeoff on short notice.

Gov. George Deukmejian ordered all state agencies and departments to curtail 
water use by at least 10% to leave more for farming and firefighting. "As bad 
as things are in the state this year, we must also prepare for the possibility 
of a fifth straight year of drought," Deukmejian said in his weekly radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do not conserve this year, next year we may have more severe water 
rationing, higher water prices and increased adverse economic and environmental 
consequences." His executive order directs department managers to seek ways of 
saving water, such as repairing leaks, limiting landscape irrigation, limiting 
washing of state cars and windows, eliminating washing of sidewalks and 
driveways and turning off decorative fountains. The drought, now in its fourth 
year, is expected to hurt farmers, particularly in the southern San Joaquin 
Valley, and cause losses in wildlife, fisheries and water-oriented recreation, 
he said.

BOAT CAPTAIN WON'T FACE FELONY CHARGES

<TEXT>
<P>
Felony charges have been dropped for lack of evidence that a San Francisco 
commercial fishing boat captain attacked a woman crew member who jumped ship. 
"His actions, while outrageous, were not felonious," Municipal Judge Robert 
Atack said in finding there was not enough evidence to try Paul Batsford, 49, 
on criminal charges of assault and false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Christine McGuire, however, said she would file 
misdemeanor battery and weapon brandishing charges against the boat skipper. 
Karla Dalton, 28, testified that Batsford beat her, held her prisoner and 
threatened to kill her with a .22-caliber rifle. The Petaluma woman, a new crew 
member, said she jumped from the 40-foot Dorothy L at sea on May 8 and hailed a 
passing fishing boat to escape Batsford, who was arrested by the Coast Guard as 
the Dorothy L sailed from San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf to Monterey Bay.

WHAT IS EXPECTED OF 14-YEAR-OLD JENNIFER CAPRIATI? ANYTHING LESS THAN BEING THE 
BEST WOMEN'S TENNIS PLAYER OF ALL TIME COULD BE A DISAPPOINTMENT 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's see, now. What are we to make of this? The future of women's tennis is 14 
years old, wears men's size-8 1/2 sneakers, hits the ball so hard it leaves a 
vapor trail, was a millionaire at 13, has no idea of the words to the national 
anthem, knows the rap song "Busta Move" by heart, loves pink, thinks negative 
vibes are gross, practices so hard she gets callouses on her hands and already 
has an idea of how she wants people to remember her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like, you know, when I retire, like, you know, when I go down the street, 
people would say, 'There's Jennifer Capriati, the greatest tennis player who 
ever lived,' you know." Thus spoke Jennifer Capriati, a true teen-age tennis 
phenom on track for a rendezvous with superstardom, wealth, fame and, possibly, 
a date. 
</P>
<P>
Boys, oh, boys, she likes them, sure, but there isn't any one particular 
boyfriend in the picture yet, for goodness sakes. Capriati said she really 
doesn't have any boyfriends and for a very good reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to treat them as friends because I don't want to break their hearts," 
she said and then giggled. 
</P>
<P>
Neither does Capriati have a car, of course. Why, when she made it to the final 
of the Family Circle Cup at Hilton Head, S.C., it was her second final in the 
first three tournaments she played, all of them wheel-less. Capriati lost to 
33-year-old Martina Navratilova, who won $100,000 and a new car. Navratilova 
accepted the keys in a postmatch ceremony at center court and then looked over 
at Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just as well that I won the car because if Jennifer had won, she couldn't 
drive it anyway," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati had a quick comeback: "Got any golf carts?" 
</P>
<P>
Most of what Jennifer Capriati has done in tennis has been quick. After only 
four professional tournaments, she was ranked No. 24, had won 16 of 20 matches, 
had reached two finals and one quarterfinal and had beaten reigning French Open 
champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, 6-1, 6-1, on clay. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati's junior titles were legendary. At 12, she won the U.S. Tennis Assn.'s 
18-and-under national championship, the youngest to take that age-group title. 
At 13, she won junior championships at the French Open and the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
At 14? Many believe she'll be ranked in the top five by the end of the year. 
Although Capriati is not seeded in the French Open, which begins Monday at 
Stade Roland Garros, her mere appearance will probably represent a footnote 
when the history of women's tennis is written: Capriati's first Grand Slam 
event. Can she win it? Sanchez Vicario thinks not. 
</P>
<P>
"She is too young," said Sanchez Vicario, 18. 
</P>
<P>
Some are not so sure, among them Billie Jean King and Capriati's coach, Tom 
Gullikson. King, 47, played doubles with Capriati, someone just about young 
enough to be her granddaughter, in Capriati's first tournament and came away 
with a healthy respect for the teen-ager's prowess. 
</P>
<P>
"She is the most powerful person of her age I have ever seen, without any 
question," King said. "Chris (Evert) proved that if you're going to be a great 
player, by the time you're 14, 15, you're there. And she's there, believe me, 
with bells on. For her, the sky's the limit." 
</P>
<P>
Like many others, Gullikson sees Capriati's potential blazing brightly, a 
maturity level that belies her age and an advanced game built on lessons 
learned about solid groundstrokes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she can do extremely well in the French," Gullikson said. "She's very 
receptive to coaching, and she is a very advanced player for her age. Certainly 
her backhand is her real strength, but she's also got a very good first serve. 
She's got a great service motion -- a nice, smooth, continuous swing. 
</P>
<P>
"She is definitely a power-dictating type of player. She is extremely good." 
</P>
<P>
Gullikson shares coaching duties with Capriati's father, Stefano, a former 
professional soccer player in Italy and Spain and a one-time Hollywood stuntman 
with credits in "100 Rifles" and "Patton." Stefano Capriati belongs to the 
USTA, which means Jennifer is eligible for coaching help from the association. 
</P>
<P>
Gullikson works under Stan Smith, who heads the USTA's touring pro program 
designed to help talented American youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our viewpoint that (Capriati) is without question the most talented young 
pro in the world, man or woman," Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
This is weighty stuff, to be sure. It wouldn't be surprising for a more fragile 
teen-ager to find such expectations suffocating. But Capriati is not your 
normal teen-ager, and neither is she your normal teen-age tennis phenom. If 
pedigrees are important, then Capriati has been groomed for greatness. She is 
blue-ribbon material. 
</P>
<P>
Born on Long Island, 3-year-old Jennifer accompanied Stefano and her mother, 
Denise, a Pan American Airways flight attendant, to the tennis court in Spain 
because they could not afford a baby-sitter. Stefano quickly realized that his 
daughter had ability, so the family moved to Florida to be able to play all 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer's first coach was Jimmy Evert, Chris Evert's father. Capriati was 5. 
John Evert, Chris' brother and agent and now Capriati's agent, recalled the 
first time Chris heard about the player who would eventually be called her 
second coming. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad came home one night and said to Chrissie, 'I think I've finally found 
someone as talented as you,' which was kind of neat," John Evert said. "My dad 
said this when Chrissie was No. 1 in the world. But Jennifer really had 
something special when she was 5, 6, 7 years old, and you can only notice that 
in a couple of kids." 
</P>
<P>
Capriati was coached by Rick Macci for four years, ages 10 to 13, at Grenelefe, 
Fla., as she became something of a legend in the junior ranks. When she won the 
18-and-under national title at 12, Capriati knew she might be something 
special, although her father said he sensed such prospects long before. 
</P>
<P>
Stocky and dark-haired, 54-year-old Stefano is Jennifer's primary coach as they 
plunge together into the international professional game as rookies. 
Circumspect and protective of his daughter, the elder Capriati is somewhat wary 
of journalists, but he also understands their value. 
</P>
<P>
Stefano watches all of Jennifer's practice sessions, including a recent one at 
her home in the Saddlebrook resort at Wesley Chapel, Fla. She was working with 
Gullikson and her practice partner, Richard Ashby, also of the USTA. Stefano 
interrupted a question to make a point to Jennifer, who was practicing a court 
away. 
</P>
<P>
He waved and she smiled. She ran down a drop shot in a drill and sent it back 
over the net, just out of Gullikson's reach. Next, Jennifer sent a two-handed 
backhand screaming into the corner of the court and shouted: "Hey, baby!" 
</P>
<P>
From his chair in the shade, Stefano smiled. "She loves, she enjoys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is vital, he said, that Jennifer like what she does. Yes, he is a "tennis 
father," he admitted, but only in the purest sense. He does not push, he said 
-- he only aids, a philosophy he chose to adopt when Jennifer was very young. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids, until they have their own personality or mind, which is around 8 or 
9 years old, you must tell them what they are doing," he said. "You try to 
direct her in the right way, and you see she has the potential. I see she 
enjoys it. After 9-10 years, you cannot direct them anymore. They must want 
it." 
</P>
<P>
According to Stefano, it is also important that his family carry on as normal a 
life as possible, regardless of Jennifer's rocket-like ride to stardom. 
</P>
<P>
"Tennis, they train alone, they think alone, they play alone," he said. "They 
are always alone. So (it) is important in life to switch from tennis. So (it) 
is good for the brain, is good for the mind, is good for everything." 
</P>
<P>
Denise Capriati has kept her job as a flight attendant, even though her 
daughter already has two endorsement contracts worth an estimated $5 million, 
with more on the horizon. Said Stefano: "We don't know what is going to happen, 
so we don't want to put all the eggs in one pot." 
</P>
<P>
John Evert believes that there will be plenty of eggs to spread around. He has 
been given the assignment at International Management Group to make the most of 
the business opportunities that surely await a budding young tennis star. 
Actually, better make that a budding young American tennis star. 
</P>
<P>
Evert first put himself on the trail of Capriati when she was 10, and he tried 
to make sure she would replace his retired sister as IMG's top female tennis 
client. 
</P>
<P>
But 10 years old? 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of early," Evert admitted, "but gosh, she was awesome." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Capriati's marketability is awesome, too. With Evert's guidance, 
Capriati became a millionaire before she turned pro. Diadora, an Italian 
sportswear company, signed Capriati to a five-year endorsement contract with 
performance clauses that could be worth $1 million a year. She also signed a 
three-year contact, which is believed to be worth $1 million a year to use 
Prince tennis rackets. 
</P>
<P>
"There were obviously a lot of companies interested," Evert said. "The Nikes, 
the Reeboks, the Adidases, Ellesse, a couple more. But Diadora, the position 
they would put her in, make her the flagship of women's tennis, well, they're 
strongly European and want to make an impact in the American market. 
</P>
<P>
"When she signed with Prince, she wanted a new wide-body, big-surface-area 
racket, and her dad gave her the go-ahead," Evert said. 
</P>
<P>
Many other companies are pursuing Capriati, who has picked up two additional 
endorsements recently. She signed a deal with a diet food product and will wear 
a Gatorade patch on her shirt during the French Open. Evert prefers to move 
slowly in the endorsement area and to exercise caution. 
</P>
<P>
"From a time standpoint and an image standpoint, I think we can be a little 
choosy with Jennifer because someone like her only comes along every 20-25 
years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Capriatis are discussing an offer for Jennifer to leave Saddlebrook and 
become a touring pro at Broken Sound Country Club in Boca Raton, Fla., near the 
Polo Club, where Chris Evert is the touring pro. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati's earning power for endorsements is considered very high. Fewer people 
are playing tennis and they are buying fewer tennis products, such as clothes 
and shoes. According to Business Week, the National Sporting Goods Assn. 
estimated that the number of men and women recreational tennis players in the 
United States in 1988 was 17.3 million, or 2.2 million fewer than in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
One explanation for such a plunge is that women have taken up sports such as 
aerobics and running, the magazine speculated. But another reason is that the 
emphasis of women's tennis has shifted to Europe, which is being dominated by 
No. 1-ranked Steffi Graf of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati seems to have arrived in the right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
"She's an unbelievable tennis player with unbelievable talent, but she's also 
got a very dynamic personality," John Evert said. "And probably one of the most 
important things, she's an American. 
</P>
<P>
"She's filling that void, so to speak, between, you know, it was Billie Jean 
and then it was Chrissie, and there really hasn't been anybody since Chrissie," 
he said. "There have been a lot of European players, but there hasn't been any 
American player who has come up and really made an impact." 
</P>
<P>
Evert is devoting himself entirely to handling Capriati, passing to others at 
IMG accounts such as Mary Joe Fernandez, Lori McNeil and Susan Sloane. Evert 
jokes that he is too busy forming Capriati's image. 
</P>
<P>
"I want her image to be just as she is right now," he said. "A happy-go-lucky 
kid, a 14-year-old having fun out on the tennis court who has a great 
disposition on the court, but also who has some personality off the court. You 
talk about media training, you talk about working with her on certain things, 
I'm not sure that's all good for Jennifer because she's so natural and she's 
good at it. 
</P>
<P>
"Her interviews and her speeches are ad-lib and they're great," he said. "I 
think, right now, it's better not to let her think too much, just to kind of 
let her be herself." 
</P>
<P>
Interviewers find a 14-year-old who is an expert at answering questions she has 
heard many times by now. In fact, she already has come up with pat answers. 
Before her professional debut at the Virginia Slims of Florida, Capriati twice 
fielded questions from 40 reporters in two separate conference calls. Some 
answers did not vary, possibly because the questions didn't: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Are you missing your childhood? "I'm not missing anything. I mean, if I do 
miss a party or something, I'm willing to make a sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Are you afraid of burnout? "I won't get burnout unless I want it. I think 
it's because you don't want to be out there and you're frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Are you like Chris? "I mean, it's an honor to be compared to her. In 
another way, I don't want it, either, because I want to be my own, you know. I 
want to be the first Jennifer Capriati." 
</P>
<P>
When she hears an all-too-familiar question, Capriati wrinkles her nose and 
whispers, "Instant replay." 
</P>
<P>
She is at the same time a chatty teen-ager and a world-class tennis star in 
ascent. At the Palmer School near Capriati's home, she studied Spanish and 
history and was just another one of the girls. Even in the glare of celebrity, 
Capriati still finds that modesty mixed with teen truth comes easily. She was 
asked if she feels she is something special. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a kid, kidwise," she said. "But tenniswise, I feel I guess I have 
talent, I guess. When I'm on the court, I just block out everything I'm 
thinking about. I bring out my tennis stuff. When I'm off, I'm just a kid." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer is comfortable in kid-dom. She has a dog, a Shih Tzu named Bianca. Her 
bedroom is basically pink. She has stuffed animals on her brass bed, which is 
covered by a Laura Ashley bedspread of roses. There are pink-striped pillows 
and pink roses on her bed. She also has a compact disc player and likes dancing 
alone in her room. She wants a television set in her room but hasn't convinced 
her parents yet. 
</P>
<P>
King said Capriati retains some of the trappings of being a little girl. 
</P>
<P>
"You see it in the dressing room (when Capriati is) talking to other people," 
King said. "She's hysterical. Like when we played doubles down in Florida, she 
said, 'Now, clasp our hands, now you got to snap our fingers while we're 
holding hands.' I'm going, 'Oh, my God, all these funny little things already?' 
</P>
<P>
"And I really met my match as far as talking (goes). 'Whoa,' I thought. 'Oh, 
she'll be quiet, I'll leave her alone,' right? Just the opposite. In fact, two 
points went by and we hadn't talked, and she goes, 'What's wrong? Are you all 
right?" It was fun for me being as old as I am, but I was thinking, if I were a 
teen-ager today, oh, that would have been fun, too. We could play doubles for 
20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Capriati plans to play until she's 35, long enough to have settled once and for 
all the burnout question she hates to be asked. So many times she is compared 
to Tracy Austin and Andrea Jaeger, teen-age stars who left pro tennis in their 
prime. In fact, Capriati considers the burnout question her least favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like, you know, it's not my fault," she said. "Why does everybody think 
it's going to happen to me? How do they know what my limit is?" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Austin probably dislikes being asked about burnout more than 
Capriati. Austin, 27, stopped playing on the tour in 1983 after a series of 
injuries. She lives in Southern California, is rehabilitating a leg broken in 
an auto accident and hopes to play TeamTennis with the Los Angeles Strings. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time a reporter writes a story about burnout, my name comes up," Austin 
said. "It just makes me sick. What happened to me was not burnout, it was 
injuries. I loved to play when I couldn't. I still do. If there's anything 
Jennifer needs to say when she's asked about burnout, it's to just talk about 
her love for the game. She'll be all right then." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to avoid any physical problems, Stefano Capriati twice took 
Jennifer to the Virginia Sports Medicine Clinic in Arlington, Va. The USTA's 
Jim Loehr discovered that her right shoulder was weak and susceptible to 
injury. Loehr immediately placed Capriati on a training program to increase 
flexibility and strength. 
</P>
<P>
On the court, her game grows stronger, too. Gullikson is pushing Capriati, 5-7 
and 130 pounds, to come to the net more, where she can take advantage of her 
quickness and maneuverability. 
</P>
<P>
"Like taking the second serve, for instance, and coming in," Gullikson said. "A 
lot of times, those are the shortest balls you ever get in tennis. She should 
step in and take it on the rise. Also, to come in behind her second serve. 
She's doing it right now." 
</P>
<P>
Capriati is developing a one-handed forehand volley, which John Evert believes 
will eventually separate her from Graf and Gabriela Sabatini. Capriati's 
groundstrokes already are regarded as being as powerful and technically 
proficient as anyone's on the women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
"She has a winner's mentality, and she is at least the second-hardest hitter 
after Graf," King said. "She could even hit the ball as hard, I'm not sure." 
</P>
<P>
Capriati is also hitting the books, although in her own way. When she made her 
pro debut at Boca Raton, she had her Palmer School homework faxed to her. The 
night she beat Sanchez Vicario at Hilton Head, she was in the library working 
on a history paper. 
</P>
<P>
A day after Sabatini beat her in the quarterfinals of the Italian Open, 
Capriati visited the Colosseum and the Forum in Rome. She wrote a paper for her 
eighth-grade history class about them. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations for Capriati are high. After all, she has played in only four pro 
tournaments, is about to play in her first Grand Slam and won't be 15 until 
next March. In fact, Navratilova had won seven tournaments before Capriati was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Capriati said she is not afraid of any player on the court. But surely 
she is, well, maybe a little nervous? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably scared of just going out there and just, like, people expecting 
you to do something," she said. "Just like, you know, maybe you're scared 
you're there playing the finals of the French Open or maybe Wimbledon with all 
these people there, the princess and everything and playing Steffi Graf." 
</P>
<P>
She paused for a breath. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's more exciting than nervous," she said. "It's exciting-nervous. I'm 
not scared, though. Because if you're scared, then why are you out there? 
You're not going to do good. Might as well go for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to go out and play well. You know, I mean I'd like to win the 
French and Wimbledon, but I just want to play well, try my best and have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but Jennifer, what if you really do win the French Open and then really do 
win Wimbledon? What then? Would all the pressure of all those expectations be 
realized? Would all the corporate bigwigs throw their endorsement money at you? 
Would the world of tennis crown its new young queen? More important, would you 
get all the dates you want? 
</P>
<P>
The future of women's tennis giggled. She sounded a lot like a 14-year-old 
schoolgirl. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it would be great, but it wouldn't be it," she said. "Mrs. Palmer, the 
headmaster at school, she hears me talk and she corrects me. She always 
corrects me. She knows everything I say." 
</P>
<P>
Capriati affected an authoritative voice. 
</P>
<P>
"She says, 'You've got to learn now that you're going to be in the public a 
lot, so please act so they won't think you're stupid.' She hears, like, 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
Like, OK. Maybe even one day Mrs. Palmer will be walking down the street with 
her former pupil, and people will turn and look. Maybe then Mrs. Palmer will 
hear the words by which Jennifer Capriati wants to be remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest ever?" 
</P>
<P>
Hey, like give it a few years.

ANGELS' 10 RUNS PLENTY FOR BLYLEVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because the Oakland Athletics are matching them victory for victory, the 
Angels' ascent from the depths of the American League West seems like a climb 
up a down escalator: No matter how earnest their effort, they seem simply to be 
running in place. 
</P>
<P>
Not that their effort is being wasted. The Angels are running in fourth place 
after their 10-3 rout of the Milwaukee Brewers Saturday night at Anaheim 
Stadium, and that was progress enough to encourage them in their climb, even 
though they haven't gained so much as a half-game on Oakland during their 
six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a matter of time before we got it going," outfielder Dante 
Bichette said after the Angels' eighth victory in their nine games moved them a 
game ahead of the Seattle Mariners and into fourth for the first time since May 
3. "If you noticed, we really didn't get down on ourselves when things were 
bad. . . . The talent, like I said before, is there, and now it's showing, and 
we'll be in this thing before too long. 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland is a great team and we're going to have to play our best to come back 
and win this. But I know we can do it. Before, we only talked about playing 
well, and talk is cheap. Now we're doing it." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had a season-high 15 hits and benefited from the determined pitching 
of Bert Blyleven (3-3), who got his first complete game of the season and only 
the second for the Angel pitching staff. Blyleven struck out four and walked 
one as the Angels won their fifth consecutive game in Anaheim and improved to 
21-23. 
</P>
<P>
More than his fastball or his curve or his oofus-goophus pitch, Blyleven 
credited his will with propelling him through his first complete game since 
last Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
"My stubbornness was working for me best," said the 39-year-old right-hander, 
who gave up a run in the first on a walk, a single and a force play but was 
presented with three runs in the bottom of the inning. "I was just trying to 
get into a good groove. My offense really picked me up. When we scored that 
many runs early, I said, 'I want to go nine.' I hadn't gone nine and I wanted 
to get into a good groove. That's what nine innings gives you." 
</P>
<P>
Every starter except Gary DiSarcina managed at least one hit off Mark Knudson 
(3-2), Tom Edens and Bill Krueger. 
</P>
<P>
Max Venable, Johnny Ray and Chili Davis each contributed three hits, with Davis 
driving in two runs and Wally Joyner driving in two as the Angels matched their 
largest margin of victory this season. 
</P>
<P>
Three consecutive singles produced the first run, in the first, and Davis put 
the Angels ahead to stay with a two-run double to center. Venable's second home 
run of the season stretched the lead to 4-1 in the second, and an RBI-single by 
Rick Schu and a ground-rule double by John Orton padded that to 6-1 in the 
third. The Brewers, who still lead the AL East despite a four-game losing 
streak, added to their league-leading error total by committing two in the 
fourth, setting up two more Angel runs. 
</P>
<P>
When Milwaukee scored twice in the sixth, the Angels need not have worried. But 
Blyleven took it as an insult, and was even more determined to go the distance. 
Chuck Finley's 6-0 victory over Baltimore May 8 is the staff's only other 
complete game. 
</P>
<P>
"When they scored those two runs in the sixth, I got really upset," Blyleven 
said. "After my team came back and scored two more for me, I'm the kind of guy 
who likes to finish what I start and I hadn't been doing that. Hopefully, I'll 
get in a good groove now." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels hope their slow start won't preclude a fast finish. But where they 
are in relation to the A's is less important to them than how they're playing. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't worry about what Oakland does. They're a good ballclub," said 
Venable, who is hitting .310 in an occasional role. "We can't be looking up to 
see what Oakland does. We've got to take care of ourselves. The past week, 
we've really come together. It's not just one guy -- it's been the whole team. 
We can't be worried about somebody else trying to help you -- you've got to 
help yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader agreed. "We're playing the golf course, not the leader 
board," he said. "We're playing our own program, our own approach and if it's 
good enough, the rest of it will fall into place. You can't let your thought 
processes be that peripheral. You have to focus on what you're doing. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether we can overcome (the club's poor start) remains to be seen. You don't 
know how other ballclubs are going to play. We've moved by a couple of clubs 
and we need to keep doing that. The farthest we can look is one rung at a 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Kirk McCaskill took his infant son, Riley Nicholas, home from the 
hospital Saturday, a week after the baby contracted pneumonia and required 
intensive care. "He got a clean bill of health," said McCaskill, who missed a 
start last week in Toronto to rejoin his family in California. "It was scary 
for a while, but he's going to be fine." 
</P>
<P>
With Saturday's start, the 654th of his career, Bert Blyleven moved into 11th 
place on the all-time list. . . . Donnie Hill (bruised left knee) sat out his 
third consecutive game, his longest inactivity since the first week of the 
season. . . . Brian Downing was not in the starting lineup for the seventh game 
in a row. His last start was May 19 at Toronto. . . . The Angels are 6-1 in 
games Dave Winfield has started. He was not in Saturday's lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Mark McLemore, sent to triple-A Edmonton on rehabilitation 
assignment, played nine innings for the Trappers Friday and was 0 for 4.

HARRIS HITTING NOTABLY; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: MESSAGE FROM ERIC DAVIS SPARKS STREAK. BASES-LOADED TRIPLE KEYS 
DODGERS' 8-0 VICTORY OVER CARDINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Lenny Harris arrived in Chicago this week to begin a trip with the 
Dodgers, there was a message awaiting him. It had been left by a player from 
the team that occupied the hotel the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
According to Harris, the message read: "Good luck. You're swinging the bat well 
now, keep up the good work." 
</P>
<P>
Since reading it, Harris has had seven hits in 15 at-bats, including his second 
bases-loaded triple in three days Saturday to lead the Dodgers to an 8-0 
victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis is probably hoping his Cincinnati Reds never find out he wrote the 
note. 
</P>
<P>
The makeshift Dodgers used all sorts of Cincinnati inspiration Saturday in 
winning their fourth consecutive game. They remain eight games behind the 
first-place Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a former Red, said he appreciated the note from his close friend Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Other Dodgers said they appreciated the Busch Stadium scoreboard flashing news 
of the Reds' victory over the Montreal Expos during Saturday evening's batting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
And virtually every member of the second-place Dodgers said they can't wait for 
next weekend's series against Cincinnati at Dodger Stadium, marking the first 
four of 18 games between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us are wanting to see just how tough the Reds are," Harris said. "We 
know now, if we play as good as we are playing, they are going to have their 
hands full." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have won nine of 12 games but have gained only a half game in the 
standings during that time. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I looked at that score on the board tonight. I think we should look at 
their scores," Hubie Brooks said of the Reds' 5-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Said Harris: "We could have looked at it like, well, it don't matter whether we 
win or not, we still aren't going to gain any ground. But we looked at it the 
other way." 
</P>
<P>
And then, before 47,077, they played their usual game of late. Meaning they won 
and all sorts of weird things happened that only Manager Tom Lasorda could 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Morgan, four days after allowing the New York Mets nine runs in 2 1/3 
innings while pitching with flu, threw his major league-leading third shutout. 
He allowed five singles and only three other balls to leave the infield, ending 
the game by retiring the final six batters in about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank goodness it ended as quick as it did," Morgan said. "About the seventh 
inning, I had hit the bottom. My legs were wobbling." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Harris, batting leadoff for only his fourth time this season, increased his 
average in that position to .421 with seven runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like batting leadoff," Harris said. "There's no reason I don't like 
it, but every time I say I don't like it, I get to play there and I do good 
there. So like I said, I don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
In 34 starts at third base by Harris and platoon mate Mike Sharperson since 
Jeff Hamilton injured his shoulder, they have a combined .339 average. The 
rehabilitating Hamilton, still about a month from returning from shoulder 
surgery, can officially begin to look over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"You put them together and you have one heckuva third baseman," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Harris' three-run triple in the fourth inning off Cardinal starter and 
loser Bryn Smith, giving the Dodgers a 5-0 lead, was preceded by errors by 
third baseman Terry Pendleton and shortstop Ozzie Smith. Smith has won 10 Gold 
Gloves, Pendleton has won two. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't give them five outs," said Bryn Smith, who was beaten by the Dodgers 
for the first time since May 27, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chris Gwynn, playing center field after not even shagging a fly ball there 
this season, caught a fly ball and did not embarrass himself. Sharperson, 
starting at first base for the third time in his career, had 15 putouts and 
three assists. 
</P>
<P>
And Stan Javier, benched for a second consecutive night, had the comeback of 
the evening after entering in the seventh inning as a defensive replacement. He 
sealed the game with the Dodgers' second bases-loaded triple, a ninth-inning 
grounder down the first-base line off Scott Terry. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson, in triple-A Albuquerque on a rehabilitation assignment, took an 
off day as scheduled Saturday. He will play again today with Fred Claire, 
Dodger vice president, watching. In two rehabilitation games thus far, Gibson 
has played just one four-inning stretch in center field, making it doubtful he 
could return to the Dodgers by next weekend's showdown in Cincinnati, as many 
had hoped. He has said he will probably need to play a full game and feel good 
the next day before risking his legs in a major league game situation. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray missed his fourth consecutive start with a strained left 
hamstring, but he is expected to return to the lineup today. Murray has missed 
four games this season, the most since 1986.

Michael Jordan, who seemingly has crashed every barrier except Mach 1, broke 
the rules Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons, who played Jordan into a rare display of frustration 
Tuesday in Michigan, were on the receiving end when the pendulum swung back. In 
one motion, the alleged stability of a 14-point third-quarter lead and the most 
trustworthy of all Bad Boy defensive schemes, those so-called Jordan Rules, 
were sent crashing by the person they were designed to stop. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 47 points -- 31 in the second half -- as the Chicago Bulls 
rallied to beat the Pistons in Game 3 of the NBA Eastern Conference finals, 
107-102, at Chicago Stadium. The result seemed to say that Jordan still rules 
and said little about the worth of the Jordan Rules. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, it wasn't exactly a brilliant move that cut the Pistons' lead 
in the best-of-seven series to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit had held Jordan to 20 points on five-of-16 shooting in Game 2. It was 
another example of Detroit keeping the game's premier offensive player in 
relative check better than any other team. Chicago's answer was to have Jordan 
starting the offense at the top of the three-point circle with the ball in his 
hands, rather than waiting for point guard John Paxson to get it to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He can always score 47 points if he has the ball all the time," Coach Chuck 
Daly said after the Pistons surrendered more than 100 points for only the 
fourth time in 28 playoff games dating back to last season. "They completely 
abandoned their offense." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls -- who had 21 offensive rebounds, nine more than the Pistons -- 
laughed at such a notion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'd call it 'abandoned,' " Coach Phil Jackson said. "That's a 
good choice of words by Chuck, but we used the offense the same way, only off 
the dribble and putting Michael on top instead of on the wing. That stretched 
their defense a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Broke it, actually, rare a sight as that was. Having gone through all other 
possibilities, Detroit let Dennis Rodman try Jordan late, largely one on one. 
</P>
<P>
"They went with their best player, the defensive player of the year, and I 
think I am one of the league's best offensive players, frankly," said Jordan, 
speaking with the media again after saying that his Game 2 outburst had been 
blown out of proportion. "I took it as a challenge. I felt I had the advantage 
offensively. I'm sure they felt they had the advantage defensively." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 13 points in the third quarter and 18 in the fourth. He was 
especially unstoppable when it mattered most, connecting on back-to-back jump 
shots from the right side 23 seconds apart with about seven minutes left in the 
game. That put the Bulls, who host Game 4 Monday afternoon, in the lead for 
good, 86-82. 
</P>
<P>
They had trailed, 67-53, with 5:48 remaining in the third quarter, Isiah Thomas 
having opened the half by scoring nine of his team-high 36 points. With the 
lead, Chicago had to hold on to beat Detroit for the second time in eight tries 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen's tip-in of a miss by Jordan gave the Bulls a 101-94 cushion 
with 1:03 to play. Forty-eight seconds later, after a three-point basket by 
Thomas, it was 105-102. 
</P>
<P>
A bad entry pass by Pippen at halfcourt after a timeout by the Bulls resulted 
in a jump ball and, subsequently, another Piston possession. Detroit called 
timeout with 8.3 seconds left. Even with Bill Laimbeer, an outside threat, 
having fouled out, there were still plenty of three-point possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve Mark Aguirre, who had made nine of 13 shots and scored 22 points, sent 
the ball in to Vinnie Johnson, who passed it back to Aguirre on the right side. 
Aguirre launched a three-point shot that went long and hit the far side of the 
rim, bounding off to the Bulls. Jordan was fouled, and his two free throws gave 
Chicago its final margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago didn't beat us, we beat ourselves," Rodman said. "They played well, 
but not that well." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons had 18 turnovers that accounted for 30 points by Chicago, but 
Rodman's accuracy ends there. For once in this short series, Bulls other than 
Jordan played well. 
</P>
<P>
Pippen had 29 points -- 16 in the second half -- and 11 rebounds. Horace Grant 
had 10 points and 11 rebounds, helping Chicago to a 53-42 advantage in that 
category. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it came back to Jordan. This was his game, no matter the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael was definitely more aggressive offensively than in those first two 
games," said Detroit's Joe Dumars, usually the first line of defense against 
Jordan, who averaged 40.2 points and shot 54% in the first two rounds of the 
playoffs but opened at 27.0 and 40% in the first two games against the Pistons. 
"When he's aggressive and playing like that, you just hope he misses a few 
shots and play him as best you can. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, with Michael hitting his jumper, it makes it really tough to stop him. 
In fact, it's almost impossible."

Jeff Treadway, hardly known for power, hit three home runs to drive in six runs 
Saturday night as the Atlanta Braves beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 12-3, at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Treadway had only 14 lifetime home runs in 591 at-bats entering the game and 
never more than one homer in a major league game. He is the first Atlanta 
player to hit three homers in one game since Ken Griffey did it on July 22, 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves scored five times in the third inning. Greg Olson led off with a 
walk, moved to second on Ron Gant's one-out single and Treadway followed with 
his third homer of the season. Jim Presley and David Justice added RBI singles 
in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Gant singled, stole second and scored on Presley's two-out 
double. The Braves added three runs in the fifth inning. Gant's fly ball scored 
a run and Treadway hit his second homer of the game. In the seventh, he hit a 
two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
The loss knocked the Phillies out of first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies retired the jersey number of former third baseman Mike Schmidt 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 8-12, Chicago 1-3 -- Glenn Davis, who had only two hits in his previous 
23 at-bats, hit three homers and drove in nine runs at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The homers tied a club mark for a doubleheader set by Roman Mejias against the 
Milwaukee Braves on May 2, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, Davis had two homers and five RBIs. His bases-clearing double in 
the eighth inning of the second game combined with a homer to give him four 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 5, Montreal 3 -- Barry Larkin singled off reliever Tim Burke with 
the bases loaded in the ninth inning at Montreal to break a 3-3 tie give the 
Reds the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds have won 17 of 21 road games. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 10, San Francisco 4 -- Wally Backman had three hits and drove in 
three runs and Doug Drabek won his sixth consecutive game at Pittsburgh as the 
Pirates moved into first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Backman's two-run double keyed Pittsburgh's three-run second inning against 
Scott Garrelts (1-5). 
</P>
<P>
New York 11, San Diego 0 -- Sid Fernandez pitched seven shutout innings and the 
Mets took advantage of bad fielding by shortstop Joey Cora at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall walked with one out in the second inning, and Daryl Boston and 
Mackey Sasser followed with singles to load the bases. After Fernandez singled 
to score Marshall, two more runs scored when Gregg Jefferies' potential 
double-play grounder went through Cora's legs for an error. Fernandez scored 
the fourth run of the inning on a wild pitch.

NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
* Gold Medal: John Hoover became the 17th member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic 
baseball team to reach the major leagues when he pitched in relief for the 
Texas Rangers Wednesday night against the Detroit Tigers. Hoover, however, was 
sent back to Oklahoma City Saturday. Of the 20 Olympians in '84, only three 
failed to play in the majors and each is out of baseball. They are: pitcher Sid 
Akins, the Rangers' third-round draft choice from USC; catcher Bob Caffrey, the 
Montreal Expos' first-round pick from Cal State Fullerton; and second baseman 
Flavio Alfaro, the Atlanta Braves' fourth-round selection from San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
* Wallach Wallop: Expo third baseman Tim Wallach had 26 hits in 66 at-bats in 
his last 17 games through Thursday, including eight home runs, six doubles and 
23 runs batted in. "I had a streak in '87 when it seemed like I had a run 
batted in every at-bat, but I've never had a home run stroke like this," said 
Wallach, who has been particularly damaging to the San Diego Padres, going nine 
for 14 with three home runs and 13 RBIs in their last three meetings. 
</P>
<P>
* Stat Wars: The comparison between baseball's two best outfields doesn't start 
and stop with their statistics, but in that regard it's a virtual standoff. The 
Pittsburgh Pirates' outfield of Bobby Bonilla, Barry Bonds and Andy Van Slyke 
was batting a cumulative .307 through Thursday with 23 home runs and 86 RBIs. 
The Oakland A's outfield of Jose Canseco and the Hendersons, Rickey and Dave, 
was batting .311 with 28 home runs and 78 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
* Mismanaged: Jeff Russell saved 38 games for the Rangers last season, but his 
use by Manager Bobby Valentine this year has been open to question. Valentine 
has used Russell in three tie games and five games in which Texas was trailing. 
The back-breaker was April 30, when Russell, who has seven saves, was allowed 
to make 43 pitches and work three innings of a tie game against the Chicago 
White Sox. Since then, he has allowed six earned runs and 12 hits in six 
innings in eight games. And now Russell is nursing a sore elbow stemming from 
bone spurs. 
</P>
<P>
* Odds and . . . : A's relief ace Dennis Eckersley continues to exhibit 
remarkable control. Eckersley has faced 149 batters since issuing his last 
walk, last August. He is 13 for 13 in 1990 save opportunities and has allowed 
one run in 19 1/3 innings this year. . . . Of Ken Griffey Jr.'s 26 major league 
home runs, 21 have tied games or put the Seattle Mariners ahead. . . . The 
Houston Astros, with their touted pitching and defense, were the only major 
league team without a complete game until Mike Scott pitched one Saturday. The 
Astros lead the NL in unearned runs allowed. Houston's starting pitchers have 
an 8-18 record, failing to get through the sixth inning in 26 of 43 games. . . 
. The recall of Shawn Boskie, 23, gave the Chicago Cubs six pitchers 25 or 
younger. The others: Mike Harkey, Greg Maddux, Mitch Williams, Jeff Pico and 
Steve Wilson. . . . The Braves went into Friday's game against the Phillies at 
Philadelphia with a May record of 11-10 and a shot at their first winning month 
since May 1987. 
</P>
<P>
* . . . Ends: Jeff Torborg, in his second year as manager of the Chicago White 
Sox, continues to do it with mirrors. Three of the regular White Sox infielders 
-- Carlos Martinez, Scott Fletcher and Robin Ventura -- were hitting .195, 
.192, and .138, respectively, through Thursday. . . . The disintegration of the 
Toronto Blue Jays' rotation continues. Mike Flanagan has been released, John 
Cerutti sent to the bullpen with a 1-5 record and Jimmy Key is sidelined by a 
pulled hamstring and strained earned-run average of 5.80. The decision to move 
230-pound David Wells into a starting role prompted George Bell to cite the 
once-every-five-days' work schedule and say: "He'll weigh 300 pounds by the end 
of the year." . . . Add Wells: When he was at triple-A Syracuse, the Blue Jays 
fined the team trainer for failing to carry a scale on the road so that he 
could be weighed regularly. . . . Marty Barrett, displaced when Jody Reed was 
moved to second base, has asked the Boston Red Sox to trade him. Barrett 
displayed his frustration the other day by engaging coach Richie Hebner in a 
shouting match, prompting Hebner to say he was not Barrett's baby-sitter. . . . 
In his first 101 games with the Rangers, Harold Baines drove in 31 runs and hit 
.191 with runners in scoring position. "It's one of the great mysteries of our 
game," a disappointed Valentine said. ROSS NEWHAN

NUMBERS, DOLLARS ADD UP FOR CANSECO 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
What do you apply to Jose Canseco's home runs, a tape measure or a calculator? 
</P>
<P>
The distant drives of the Oakland Athletics' right fielder are about to become 
far-reaching in a financial manner, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco has the A's over a barrel to the extent that they have no choice but to 
hand over the keys to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
With each game, as the stupendously talented Canseco enhances his stature as 
baseball's best active player and generates comparisons to the best ever, he 
drives up his price. 
</P>
<P>
A's General Manager Sandy Alderson, who began negotiations with Canseco's 
agent, Dennis Gilbert, on a multiyear contract Tuesday, doesn't know whether to 
laugh or cry. 
</P>
<P>
"He's making it tough on us," Alderson said of Canseco's daily display of 
power. "We might have to go from negotiating to begging." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco seems destined to make Don Mattingly and Will Clark look like paupers. 
</P>
<P>
In the culmination of baseball's madcap salary signings of last winter, Clark 
agreed to a four-year, $13.2-million contract with the San Francisco Giants, 
and Mattingly signed a five-year, $19.3-million deal with the New York Yankees. 
Outstanding players, those two first basemen, but their overall skills don't 
compare with Canseco's. 
</P>
<P>
Neither runs as well, hits with as much power or plays as challenging a 
position as Canseco, 25, whose defensive skills have improved to the point that 
he merits Gold Glove consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that you have to equate salary to ability," Gilbert said. "Jose is the 
best player in the game right now. Therefore, we feel he should be paid the 
most." 
</P>
<P>
The A's are believed to have made a five-year, $20-million offer. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, eligible for free agency after the 1991 season, is believed to be 
thinking in terms of $25 million, with the first pure $5-million-a-year salary. 
</P>
<P>
He has talked about the free-agent potential of New York and Los Angeles, but 
"if the money is right, he would be happy to stay in Oakland," according to 
Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
Said Canseco: "As long as they want me here, I'll stay. I can't imagine 
leaving. I wouldn't mind having a 10-year deal. But the longer the A's take to 
sign me, the more difficult it's going to be. They see what I do in opposing 
ballparks. I mean, the Oakland ballpark could cost me 40 points a year on my 
batting average and 15 to 20 home runs, and if I get the chance, I'll prove it 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
Some of that is negotiating rhetoric, though there is no doubt that he pays a 
statistical price in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent eight-game trip, Canseco batted .424, drove in 16 runs and hit 
eight homers, including a grand slam in the Toronto SkyDome that bounced off 
the windows atop the center-field restaurant and revived memories of his 
international launching there in Game 4 of last year's American League playoff 
series against the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 79 homers hit in 27 games at the SkyDome this year, and Canseco 
said, "60 (by one player) would not be safe in a place like this" if he played 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Would he consider it? 
</P>
<P>
"Being paid in Canadian money and being taxed twice? Forget it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Presently, Canseco looks as if he can hit 60 anywhere, even Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco has hit 10 homers and driven in 26 runs in the A's last 14 games. He 
has 18 homers, 47 RBIs, a .340 batting average and 11 stolen bases in 41 games. 
He leads the majors with 38 runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably think he's better than he thinks he is," A's Manager Tony La Russa 
said. "As far as pure talent, I think he's in the echelon with anybody you want 
to mention, anybody who has ever played." 
</P>
<P>
Said third baseman Carney Lansford, of the current negotiations: "I'm not the 
one laying out the iron, but from a business standpoint I'd tie that guy up for 
as long as I could, as soon as I could. I've played with some Hall of Famers, 
and he's the best. I have to believe he's the best who ever played." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco is being paid $2 million this season. Last winter, the A's signed 
Rickey Henderson to a four-year, $12-million contract and gave Dave Stewart a 
two-year, $7-million extension. They also considered a multiyear deal for 
Canseco, but Alderson said that with the threat of a work stoppage and severe 
financial damage to the franchise, "We weren't prepared to take the risk with 
another big contract." 
</P>
<P>
Too bad, for them. Canseco said he probably would have signed for less than 
Clark at that time. If so, his price has doubled. 
</P>
<P>
"The A's and Sandy Alderson had a chance to sign me for peanuts and didn't do 
it," Canseco said. "Thank you, Sandy Alderson. Thank you, Oakland A's." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco is making an attempt to improve his image, ensuring the A's interest. 
</P>
<P>
The profits from his 900 talk line are being used to bring underprivileged 
children to his summer baseball camp. 
</P>
<P>
And the other day, when Stewart handed him a $10,000 check as payoff on his 
1988 bet that Canseco would not get married before the 1989 season, Canseco 
said he will match it and buy a van for a handicapped fan in his hometown of 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
All of that is to be applauded, but Canseco still marches to the beat of his 
own bat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like Madonna," he said the other day. "We don't abide by the same norms 
and don't put limitations on what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
The political conventions might want to consider Angel pitcher Bert Blyleven as 
their keynote speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Since his blistering indictment of the club's offense on May 12, including the 
conclusion that "We stink," the Angels had a 9-3 record going into Saturday 
night's game, the awakened offense averaging 5.6 runs and 10.6 hits per game. 
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Expos' Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd had not pitched a shutout since June 
9, 1985, before adding to the San Diego Padres' misery by shutting them out 
twice in a 10-day span. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd is 1-2 with a 5.08 earned-run average against the rest of the National 
League and 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA against the Padres, whose manager, Jack McKeon, 
said he didn't think Boyd was that good, "but he ought to send these guys plane 
tickets so he can see more of them." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of his arm problems, the Can has become a finesse pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes on the mound, I mess with the ball now," he said. "I don't do 
anything illegal, but I take extra equipment with me -- my thinking cap." 
</P>
<P>
One aspect of the Houston Astros' disappointing start was the poor play of 
catalytic center fielder Gerald Young, who was optioned to Tucson the other day 
with a .179 batting average and some private concern among club officials 
regarding his work habits and habits in general. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be for two weeks, it could be for two months and it could be for a 
year," General Manager Bill Wood said of the demotion. "It's up to him to get 
his game turned around." 
</P>
<P>
On the day of Young's departure, the Astros stole eight bases, including four 
by center-field successor Eric Yelding. 
</P>
<P>
Two deserving players, Philadelphia Phillie outfielder Len Dykstra and White 
Sox shortstop Ozzie Guillen, had some thoughts about their chances to be voted 
into the All-Star game by the fans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to break the mold," Dykstra said. "You know the big-name guys are 
going to get the votes." 
</P>
<P>
Said Guillen: "No one knows who I am. I'd have to kill all the other 
shortstops. I'd have to take care of Cal Ripken, Alan Trammell, Tony Fernandez 
and Kurt Stillwell, and then I'd be in jail and couldn't play anyway."

Keith Clearwater isn't worried about the pressure of leading a golf tournament 
going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of this at all," Clearwater said Saturday after shooting a 
bogey-free, six-under-par 66 that gave him a two-shot lead in the third round 
of the Atlanta Classic. "Golf is not important enough to be afraid of it." 
</P>
<P>
He had a 54-hole score of 204, 12 under par on the 7,018-yard Atlanta Country 
Club course. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked 164th on this year's money list, Clearwater held his two-shot advantage 
over second-round leader Larry Mize, South African Nick Price and Wayne Levi. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just frustrating because I couldn't get anything going," Mize said after 
a 71 that included two birdies and a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Price had a 69 that included four consecutive birdies during one stretch, and 
Levi capped an erratic round when he rolled in a 40-foot downhill eagle putt on 
the final hole. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Douglass shot a four-under-par 66 to take a one-stroke lead over Gary 
Player and Charles Coody after the second round of the rain-delayed $500,000 
Seniors event at the Chester Valley Golf Club in Malvern, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Douglass, who began the round three strokes off the pace, completed two rounds 
at 136. Both Player and Coody shot 68s on a dark, misty afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
At 138 was Lee Trevino, who shared the opening-round lead at 67 with Mike and 
Dave Hill, and Ken Still, who has never won on the Seniors Tour. Trevino had 
two bogeys and a birdie for a one-over 71. Still had five birdies against two 
bogeys for a three-under 67 over the 6,406-yard layout. 
</P>

Nancy Lopez scored two of the only four birdies managed in winds that gusted to 
45 m.p.h. and won $95,000 on the front nine of the LPGA's first Skins Game at 
Frisco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez won $45,000 with a downhill 20-foot birdie putt on the sixth hole at the 
Stonebriar Country Club course, and added another $50,000 with a 12-footer on 
the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King, the current holder of the U.S. Women's Open and Dinah Shore titles, 
was the only other money-winner. King won $45,000 with a putt for par-five on 
the third hole. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Stephenson, trying to make a comeback from a career-threatening finger 
injury, and veteran JoAnne Carner were shut out. 
</P>
<P>
The ninth was halved, so the $25,000 prize on that hole is carried over to 
today, when the final nine holes will be played, with $310,000 up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley's 10-foot birdie putt on No. 18 capped a round of 66 that provided 
a four-shot lead over Patty Sheehan after the third round of the LPGA Corning 
(N.Y.) tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who started three strokes behind 36-hole leader Alice Ritzman, birdied 
Nos. 2, 4, 7 and 9 to vault into the lead, then overcame a bogey at No. 10 with 
birdies at 12 and 15 to take charge. 
</P>
<P>
The birdie at No. 18 allowed Bradley to keep a safe margin over Sheehan, the 
1983 Corning champion who followed 16 consecutive pars with birdies at 17 and 
18. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's Susan Slaughter, who was second a year ago, birdied the first hole in 
a sudden-death playoff to beat Michiko Hattori of Texas to win the NCAA women's 
championship at Hilton Head Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Arizona State won its first title, shooting a final-round 304 for a 
1,206 four-day score, 16 strokes ahead of UCLA on the 6,141-yard, par-72 Arthur 
Hills Course. Florida was third at 1,223, followed by San Jose State at 1,225.

Brian Milne, despite being diagnosed as having cancer two months ago, won the 
Pennsylvania small school discus championship at the state high school meet in 
Shippensburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Milne learned he had Hodgkin's disease -- cancerous enlargement 
of the spleen and lymph nodes -- during a routine examination in March. 
</P>
<P>
He had complained of stiffness in his back while weight lifting. 
</P>
<P>
Milne, who had surgery to cut a cancerous growth off his heart only six weeks 
ago, threw the discus 178 feet 2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Milne will have his spleen removed in an operation that will 
determine if the cancer has spread and if chemotherapy or additional surgery is 
required. The operation also may determine if he can play football in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4, 225-pound Milne rushed for 2,419 yards and scored 31 touchdowns 
for his school, Fort LeBoeuf, last season, and was expected to be heavily 
recruited.

BARNES (75-9 1/2) NEARLY SETS RECORD AGAIN;

<P>
TRACK AND FIELD: SHOTPUTTER'S EFFORT AT JENNER MEET IS SECOND ONLY TO HIS 75-10 
1/4 THROW THE PREVIOUS WEEKEND.

<TEXT>
<P>
There were no balloons bordering the shotput area, and there wasn't as much 
pre-meet hype in regard to a possible world record. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Randy Barnes came ever so close to breaking the world record of 75 
feet 10 1/4 inches that he set last Sunday at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
He had only one fair throw out of six Saturday at the Bruce Jenner Invitational 
meet at San Jose City College. However, it was a quite an effort -- 75-9 1/2, 
the second best mark of all time. 
</P>
<P>
The throw broke the listed world record of 75-8, set by East Germany's Ulf 
Timmermann in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
So Barnes has made the two best throws of all time in less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said he was emotionally drained from last Sunday's meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I was strung out after the record and I had to do some traveling," he said. 
"Also, I wasn't as isolated this week as I was last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't as sure of myself in the ring and I was little out of control. I'm 
not excited about my consistency, but the bottom line is that I got that throw 
and I'm really excited about that." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes' big throw came on his second appearance in the ring, as it did in last 
Sunday's meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the chalk kick up, and I knew it was close (to a record), but I wasn't 
convinced," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, 23, then fouled on his remaining throws. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said he had a low-key training week and didn't have any "bombs" like his 
79-2 1/2 practice throw the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just tired emotionally from last week," he said. "As much as I tried to, 
it's impossible not to get caught up with every thing." 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Barnes averaged 73-10 3/4 on his six throws without a foul, the 
best series ever. Actually, his average was better Saturday since he had only 
one fair throw. 
</P>
<P>
He said he visualizes his throws before he steps into the ring. "But there was 
a blank spot on my tape when I was throwing today," he said, referring to his 
fouls. 
</P>
<P>
In the high jump, Hollis Conway came close to breaking his American record of 7 
feet 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
After Conway cleared 7-8, he had the bar raised to 7-10 1/2. He barely brushed 
the bar on his second attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"The 7-8 jump was perfect," said Conway, the silver medalist in the 1988 
Olympic Games in Seoul. "And, at 7-10 1/2, I was trying to relive my jump at 
7-8." 
</P>
<P>
Conway said he's not as ready as he wants to be technically, but he's not 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to jump eight feet," he said. "Last year I was just hoping to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Javier Sotomayor is the world record-holder at eight feet even. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Falcon, who won the mile last Sunday at UCLA, easily won the 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
He sprinted away from the field in the final 500 meters and was easing up at 
the finish line. His time was 3 minutes 38.95 seconds, equivalent to a 3:56 
mile. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Scott, the U.S. mile record-holder, lagged in eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something wrong with me physically," Scott said. "I'm not sure what it 
is, but I've been fatigued all week." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, 34, has been America's premier miler for virtually the past 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Falcon, 23, the former Arkansas star, was asked if he's now replacing Scott in 
that designation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not the end of an era. I was just fortunate to beat him," Falcon said. 
"He has everything to lose, and I have nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Scott was more competitive in finishing second to Falcon last Sunday at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe's in great shape and he's going to be tough to beat," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Falcon said his goal is to run a 3:48 mile and then move to the 5,000 meters. 
Scott's U.S. record is 3:47.69. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
Six Cuban athletes expected to compete, notably Javier Sotomayor and Ana 
Quirot, did not. They were reportedly denied U.S. entry visas four times in Sao 
Paulo, Brazil. When the visas were finally approved Friday, the Cubans had 
already left Sao Paulo and were on their way to a meet in Madrid. Quirot was 
top ranked in the women's 400 and 800 meters in 1989. . . . In one of the most 
competitive races of the day, Doug Padilla out-kicked Algeria's Nourredine 
Morceli in the 3,000 meters. Padilla's winning time was 7:59.02, while Morceli 
was timed in 7:59.81. Morceli, who competes for Riverside City College, and 
Padilla sprinted furiously together down the final stretch, but the experienced 
Padilla had the better burst at the end. . . . Svetlana Kitova of the Soviet 
Union won the women's 1,500 meters in the meet-record time of 4:05.96.

UCLA's Jason Netter gave a performance Saturday his grandfather would have been 
proud to see. 
</P>
<P>
Netter, a 21-year-old junior from Beverly Hills, took three match points in the 
third set tiebreaker to defeat Miami's Conny Falk in a NCAA men's tennis 
championships singles semifinal, 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 (12-10), before 1,239 Saturday 
at Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather didn't come, but he's so nervous, he keeps calling," Netter, 
unseeded and ranked 30th in the nation, said of Dick Netter, who owns a film 
company at which Netter worked last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Falk seemed just as nervous. Serving for the match at 5-4 in the third set, he 
was broken by Netter and later lsot three match points. Falk, a 23-year old 
sophomore from Stockholm, Sweden, said he was too tense and played it too safe, 
the opposite of Netter, who became increasingly aggressive in the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured if I was going to lose, I'd make him beat me instead of me playing 
tentatively," Netter said. 
</P>
<P>
Netter will face University of Texas sophomore Steve Bryan today for the 
singles championship. Bryan, ranked No. 3 nationally and seeded alphabetically 
in the five-through-eight group, defeated heralded Stanford freshman Jared 
Palmer, 6-0, 6-1, in only 42 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I got up, ate breakfast, then started warming up," Netter said. "But I wasn't 
even finished with my warmup when Palmer's match was over. I couldn't believe 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Netter and Falk's match, with long rallies from the baseline, 
lasted 2 hours 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the tiebreaker, Conny started to play tentatively when he was serving 
for the match at 5-4, so I just stuck with him," Netter said. "I missed a 
couple of easy shots, but I told myself to concentrate on every shot, no matter 
what the score." 
</P>
<P>
Netter broke Falk at 15-40 with a passing shot, to tie the set at 5-5. Both 
held serve to force the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Netter survived Falk's two match points and hit a crosscourt forehand to set up 
his first match point, serving at 8-7. Falk tied it with a forehand winner in 
the corner, and Netter hit a backhand wide. Falk moved ahead 9-8 and to his 
third match point. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, when it's tight, all I was trying to do was make the first 
couple of shots," Netter said. "There is so much pressure and I thought maybe 
he would give up a few easy shots, which I think he did." 
</P>
<P>
Falk made errors on the next two points, hitting a forehand long, and the other 
into the net, to put Netter ahead 10-9. Then Falk, serving at Netter's match 
point, tied the score again with a backhand passing shot down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Netter, serving at 10-10, moved ahead when Falk hit a backhand long. Falk, 
serving at Netter's third match point, hit Netter's forehand approach into the 
net for the match. 
</P>
<P>
Netter said his match against Bryan today at noon could be likened to looking 
in a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
"We both play the same," he said. "Both of us run down balls and hit the short 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Bryan admittedly is playing the best tennis of his life. However Palmer, the 
No. 2 Stanford singles player who has had arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 
the last five months, said he wasn't as fit as he should be. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that I was playing my game and losing; I just wasn't playing my 
game, period," said Palmer, who played nine singles matches and four doubles in 
nine days of the tournament. "I first had to get myself moving and try to play 
my game and it never worked." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer won only three points in the first set, all on his serve. In the second 
set, only one game went to deuce. Palmer never held serve.

SELES-CAPRIATI IS THE RIVALRY OF THE FUTURE 
</P>

PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No, Paris isn't burning yet, but the water temperature of the Seine is probably 
rising now that Monica Seles has hit town. 
</P>
<P>
Only 16, Seles is all the rage, no matter what kind of attention is stirred up 
by 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati in her rookie year on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
So who's better? Monica or Jennifer? There's no question, said Chris Evert. 
</P>
<P>
"Monica is more advanced and more experienced," Evert said. "That doesn't mean 
that Jennifer can't catch up. After all, she has just started playing. But this 
should be an interesting rivalry for a number of years." 
</P>
<P>
If Evert's words come to pass, a Capriati-Seles rivalry would look similar to 
the one Evert had with Martina Navratilova, which brought interest, money and 
fans to women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, whose idol is Evert, was even coached by Chris' dad, Jimmy, in Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla. Seles is from Yugoslavia, Navratilova from Czechoslovakia. 
Like Evert and Navratilova, there is a two-year gap in Seles' and Capriati's 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
Seles is the hottest player in tennis. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Seles upset No. 1-ranked Steffi Graf in 63 minutes and straight 
sets to win the German Open and end Graf's 66-match winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Graf was a seven-time defending German Open champion. Soon after the match with 
Seles, passers-by on West Berlin's Kurfurstendam saw an unfamiliar message on 
the huge electronic screen that flashes the latest news headlines: 
</P>
<P>
"The Countess has been dethroned." 
</P>
<P>
That may be premature, but Seles' fifth consecutive tournament victory put her 
into the No. 3 spot in the rankings and extended her own match-winning streak 
to 24. 
</P>
<P>
"I am much more experienced now, and I wasn't afraid of her as much as before," 
Seles said of Graf. 
</P>
<P>
Before Seles beat her, Graf's last loss was a year ago at Roland Garros when 
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario upset her in the French Open final. 
</P>
<P>
That was long ago, but not long enough for Graf to have forgotten: "You never 
forget losing." 
</P>
<P>
There can be no question that Seles and Capriati represent a new wave of 
youngsters coming into prominence. The only question is when they will take 
over. It may happen here. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Seles said she is glad to share the spotlight with Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever Jennifer does, I'm really glad because it will probably take the 
pressure off me to have somebody else who is young and a good player around." 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen years old? 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years old? 
</P>
<P>
Graf, who will be 21 on June 14, looks positively ancient.

THE FINE ART OF MAKING THE DEAL

<TEXT>
<P>
If it sometimes seems that all of Hollywood's filmmaking community is 
scrambling from power breakfasts to pitch meetings to deal lunches to rewrite 
sessions, with lots of call-waiting jockey time in between, there's a reason. 
</P>
<P>
Timing. 
</P>
<P>
It's the key to getting studio features into production -- placing the right 
script in the right hands at the right moment. And when major stars become 
involved -- as they so often do with summer's high-concept, big-budget 
productions -- timing becomes crucial. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a film comes together in 12 minutes," says independent producer Dan 
Melnick, who has the $30-million-to-$35-million "Air America," starring Mel 
Gibson, on this summer's schedule of releases. "More often, not. Getting 
pictures off the ground today defies all the laws of gravity." 
</P>
<P>
However, liftoff often occurs because of luck -- key creative elements 
interested and available for assembly -- rather than irrepressible quality. 
</P>
<P>
"A PICTURE HAPPENS because the right people want to do it, not necessarily 
because of the intrinsic merits of the project," says screenwriter Nora Ephron, 
who doubles as an executive producer on this summer's "My Blue Heaven," which 
stars Steve Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with a laugh, she adds: "I don't necessarily mean my project." 
</P>
<P>
Ephron ("Heartburn," "When Harry Met Sally") pitched the idea for "My Blue 
Heaven" to actress Goldie Hawn and her partner, Anthea Sylbert, in the fall of 
1987. The story line: A mid-level Mafioso -- an important murder witness -- is 
sent by the Federal Witness Protection Program to a bucolic California 
community, where he starts a crime wave because it's the only thing he knows 
how to do. A beleaguered FBI agent tries to keep him in line, and a frustrated 
local district attorney tries futilely to bring him to justice. 
</P>
<P>
Ephron, along with Hawn -- who was interested in the D.A. role -- took the idea 
to Warner Bros., which put it into development, with studio production 
executive Allyn Stewart assigned to coordinate. Shortly after Ephron started 
writing, however -- in March, 1988 -- the 22-week Writers Guild strike 
intervened. 
</P>
<P>
Following the strike and after revisions were made in the script, says Warners 
production chief Mark Canton, "It became very clear that it might not be a 
Goldie Hawn role." (Translation: According to a source close to the project, 
the part was not of star stature.) 
</P>
<P>
When Hawn dropped out early in 1989, the project needed a name actor to 
maintain momentum. "I sent the script to Steve Martin, who responded very 
quickly," Ephron says. Martin wanted to play the lesser role of the FBI man. 
But Danny DeVito turned down the sizable and more offbeat part of the Mafioso, 
and Arnold Schwarzenegger never responded to studio queries, Ephron recalls. 
She then suggested that Martin play the gangster, and he agreed. For the FBI 
role, Martin's agent, John Gaines, suggested another client, Rick Moranis, who 
had become hot on the heels of "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" and other hits. 
Fast-rising Joan Cusack ("Working Girl") agreed to play the D.A. 
</P>
<P>
But a top-flight comedy director was needed quickly -- before the stars moved 
on to other commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Director Herbert Ross ("The Turning Point," "Steel Magnolias") had a project 
delayed and "was available -- immediately." "My Blue Heaven" went into 
production in October, 1989, about two years after being pitched. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a package in place that could be made immediately," Ephron says. "It 
was very pleasant -- the fastest of my career." 
</P>
<P>
While Canton heaps high praise on the script ("You can't believe how much 
easier a good screenplay helps in making the movie"), Ephron is more modest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a perfectly all-right script that happened to interest the right people," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
IF "MY BLUE HEAVEN" WAS relatively painless to put together, "Air America" has 
been an operation sometimes in need of anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
A bombastic adventure about pilots in the CIA's covert airline during the 
Vietnam War, "Air America" had been in development for several years as a labor 
of love under director Richard Rush ("The Stunt Man") for Carolco Pictures. In 
September, 1987, when Melnick sold his IndieProd company to Carolco, he took 
over the project. 
</P>
<P>
"They hadn't been able to get a good script on it," says Melnick. "It couldn't 
attract stars. It was just lumbering along." 
</P>
<P>
Excited by the research material, Melnick brought in screenwriter John Eskow, 
who journeyed with Melnick and director Bob Rafelson to Malaysia and Thailand 
to scout locations. Malaysia was ruled out for shooting ("A repressive society, 
very grim," says Melnick), but its government did have many of the aircraft -- 
some 40 planes -- needed for the picture. 
</P>
<P>
A logistically difficult film was slowly coming together. 
</P>
<P>
Then the trio returned to the delays of the writers' strike. Because of the 
picture's scope and budget, an international star was needed, Melnick felt. 
"But no way can you get a star to commit unless something's written." 
</P>
<P>
Further complicating matters: Shooting had to take place during the Thailand 
dry season, roughly October through April. "My colleagues at Carolco were 
disturbed, because they had counted on the picture." 
</P>
<P>
Rafelson and Melnick went to Africa to shoot "Mountains of the Moon," while 
Eskow -- with the strike over -- went back to work on "Air America." 
</P>
<P>
Melnick had envisioned an older actor -- "a Connery or a Newman" -- to portray 
the more experienced pilot in the piece, with Mel Gibson as the youthful 
sidekick. But Gibson, sizzling at the box office again after the success of 
"Lethal Weapon," ended up in the top role, his commitment nailed down by 
Melnick after a special flight from Africa to New York. The script was 
adjusted, and up-and-coming Robert Downey Jr. was cast as the younger pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some reservations by Carolco, Melnick hired Roger Spottiswoode to 
direct. "He had never done a breakout picture, but I thought 'Under Fire' was 
terrific," Melnick says. "I had admired his work for 23 years and had real 
conviction about him." A "very complicated shoot" followed, much of it in 
primitive Northern Thailand where the film company had to install 200 toilets. 
Up to 15 cameras were at work, Melnick says, during 14 weeks and 84 shooting 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The producer takes primary credit for giving the film "the thrust it needed. . 
. . Each time a tough movie gets made, it's the passion of one person 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
Yet he can't dismiss the importance of a major star saying yes at the right 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"If I hadn't gotten Mel or someone comparable," Melnick says, "it probably 
wouldn't have gotten made." 
</P>
<P>
WHEN UNIVERSAL releases "Ghost Dad," starring Bill Cosby, this summer, it will 
also be because the fates smiled. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1989, Cosby was preparing to make a feature film for Columbia 
during his hiatus from NBC's "The Cosby Show." But when the latest revision on 
the script proved unsatisfactory, the star of the unsuccessful "Leonard, Part 
6" was left without a project. 
</P>
<P>
Things looked bleak. Cosby would only be free until the first week in August, a 
seven-month window. 
</P>
<P>
Then Lennie Hirshan, an agent with the Norman Brokaw Agency, which represents 
Cosby, remembered a script by Phil Alden Robinson ("Field of Dreams") called 
"Thursday" that had been languishing at Universal, intended at one time for 
Steve Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Stanley Robertson, partnered with Cosby, got a copy. The comedy, 
replete with special effects, centers on a widower, a workaholic executive who 
is emotionally neglectful toward his three kids and who finds himself a ghost 
after an auto accident. Frantic to provide his children with financial 
security, he learns that what they really crave is love. 
</P>
<P>
It looked promising. "Cosby did not want to play Cliff Huxtable (his TV 
character)," Robertson recalls. "He wanted to play a character who is not a 
good father." 
</P>
<P>
Time, however, was of the essence. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 3, a contingent of six exe- cutives, including Universal production 
president Tom Pollock, visited Cosby at the Las Vegas Hilton, where the 
comedian was performing. There was a "creative meeting of the minds" on script 
revisions, and Cosby suggested Sidney Poitier as director. Within a week, a 
deal was set. Rewrites began in earnest -- "it needed to be 'Cosby-ized' " -- 
with Denise Nicholas cast as Cosby's love interest and Kimberly Russell, Salim 
Grant and Brooke Fontaine as the kids. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghost Dad" -- the new title -- began principal photography on April 26, 1989, 
about four months after Cosby first read the script. Sixty-seven shooting days 
later, the film was in the can. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the screenplay, says Robertson, "was exceedingly lucky, because so much 
of what was being submitted to Cosby would never do." Poitier was also an 
important element, because of his longtime relationship with the actor. "The 
rapport was there, a trust that would have taken time" to develop with another 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson calls the production "smooth in every aspect, from the time we 
decided to do it, all the way through production. We were very fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
"PRESUMED INNOCENT," based on the best-selling 1987 novel by Scott Turow, was 
likewise graced, according to Warners' Canton. 
</P>
<P>
Filmmaker Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa," "Tootsie") had bought rights to the 
novel for a reported $1 million when it was still in book galleys. A sexy 
suspense drama, it features a prosecuting attorney -- a solid, deeply moral man 
unjustly accused of murdering a seductive colleague with whom he's had an 
affair -- who must track down the killer. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack and his partner, Mark Rosenberg, first developed the project at MGM/UA, 
with Frank Pierson adapting. But a little over two years ago, with that studio 
up for sale and divesting itself of properties, "Presumed Innocent" was put on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
"We immediately jumped into the fray and went after the material," Canton says. 
"We felt it was a big-time opportunity for us." 
</P>
<P>
Pollack and Rosenberg offered Warners a package that included director Alan J. 
Pakula ("Klute," "All the President's Men"). As his star, Pakula wanted 
Harrison Ford and his forthright, Everyman quality. "We had a list of 
possibilities, but it was never offered to anybody else," Pakula says. And the 
actor happened to be willing and available. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed we were all in sync (creatively)," Canton says. "We decided very 
quickly to green-light the movie -- which is very rare, especially with 
elements (at such a high level). 
</P>
<P>
"Then (late last year) Alan went off and made the movie." 
</P>
<P>
With a cast that includes Brian Dennehy, Bonnie Bedelia, Raul Julia, Greta 
Scacchi and Paul Winfield, "Presumed Innocent" appears to be one of the 
classier productions of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Canton calls the experience "a very smooth ride. I'd even call it delightful, 
which is not a term I've thrown around, because I've been at both ends . . . . 
It was a lot shorter period than 'Batman.' " 
</P>
<P>
Pakula gives his executive producer, Susan Solt, much of the credit: "The fact 
that we came in on schedule and within budget -- she gets enormous 
responsibility for that." 
</P>
<P>
The director acknowledges the significance of fortunate timing on such a big 
project but insists that a filmmaker must be patient until the right 
"confluence of factors" occurs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a collaborative medium," Pakula says. "The best script with the 
wrong actor can fail, and the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
"If Harrison Ford had said, 'I can't do it for another seven or eight months,' 
I would have waited."

In the village where I grew up, there were movies to be seen in the summertime, 
but there were no summer movies in the modern sense. Hammondsport, N.Y., was so 
far down in the releasing pattern that even a movie released in early summer 
would have been unlikely to get to the Park Theater before late autumn at the 
earliest, and, more likely, it would have been winter, spring or, entirely 
coincidentally, the following summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Park was what distributors call a subsequent-run house, and we were such a 
subsequent run that by the time the prints got to us they would be jumpy with 
splices, the last frames of every reel a snowstorm of scratches where the tails 
had been allowed to flap during changeovers. The splices would fail and the 
screen would go white, and then black, amid terrible groans from the audience 
and roars of rage from the projection booth. 
</P>
<P>
After a delay, the picture would resume, somewhat further on into the story. I 
hardly remember a movie that went from start to finish without a break. 
</P>
<P>
But they were movies, and that was all that mattered. And the movies were then, 
far more than they are in the age of television and automobiles (scarce in 
Depression days), a window on other worlds, other lifestyles. Big cities, not 
less than the Wild West, were illuminated for us at the Park. The window may 
have been rose-tinted and full of distortions, but it offered a thrilling 
glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
If we didn't get summer movies as such, promptly, the movies of summer 
nevertheless had a very particular excitement. Presuming you had a sufficiency 
of dimes (that being all too briefly the price of the pre-adult ticket), you 
could go any night of the week, there being no school the next day. Otherwise 
it was Friday or Saturday night only. (The Park had no matinees.) 
</P>
<P>
The bill changed three times a week. Friday and Saturday we almost invariably 
had a Western, a newsreel, a cartoon or a live-action comedy short and a 
serial, which was itself often a Western. With luck, the feature and the serial 
would both star my favorite, Charles (Buck) Jones. I even remember a Buck Jones 
double feature plus a Buck Jones serial, a sort of one-night festival. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday most often gave us a musical or a comedy. When those 
legendary madcap comedies came along, they opened Sunday (two shows, 7 and 9). 
The prime reward of school-less summer movie-going was the chance to see those 
Sunday features, because they included such treasures as the Fred Astaire 
musicals, the Dick Powell-Ruby Keeler musicals and the W. C. Fields comedies 
and other items that have stood the test of time for their nostalgic appeal but 
also for their creativity and their craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Midweek -- Wednesday and Thursday -- were given over to drama and melodrama. It 
was the least appealing change of program to the young viewers, of whom I was 
one. They were apt to star the likes of Warner Baxter, George Brent, Kay 
Francis and Bette Davis, and a high proportion of them seemed to come from 
Warner Bros. Many of them were about romance, a low-appeal screen subject in 
grade school, material dismissed as intolerably mushy, what with people 
misunderstanding each other or being separated for one reason or another but 
eventually getting back together again, usually outdoors at sunset or on the 
terrace of a penthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, I wish I had been precocious enough to want to spend more summer 
nights seeing those midweek attractions. I can catch up with them now, of 
course, at 3 in the morning, generally interrupted by commercials for all the 
ingenious things you can buy by calling an 800 number. 
</P>
<P>
The summer movie as a kind of sub-genre within the movies has come into its own 
in more recent times. In earlier years, there was never a time that wasn't 
right for action pictures, raucous comedies and horror flicks calculated to 
make you shiver on the hottest summer nights. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the monopoly of mindless fun within the summer-release schedule has 
never been total. Just as you couldn't really detect any significant 
differences between summer and winter programming in Hammondsport (Buck Jones 
was a man for all seasons), so there are always surprises within the summer 
fare now. 
</P>
<P>
My memories of summer movie-going do not end at the Park Theater and its 
non-upholstered and stern-testing seats. With a little prompting from the 
files, I've been remembering some of the later films that I first watched when 
they came out in the good old summertime. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's summer success, "Dead Poets Society," caught the industry by 
surprise. It was thought to be anything but escapist stuff. It was a dark 
drama, although with comedic overtones, and it involved the suicide of a 
sympathetic figure. It was also about school, of which the young target 
audience had presumably had enough by then. 
</P>
<P>
Yet on the up side, the story was enormously sympathetic to the young (and a 
good deal less so to their elders, represented by a nasty headmaster and an 
obsessive father). And the film had a big lure in Robin Williams as its star. 
Not least, it was, by the standards of any month, a superior film. 
</P>
<P>
The moral of the triumphant release, and of the film itself, was never 
underestimate the young. The wider moral is, or ought to be, don't sell summer 
audiences short at all. They are ready for more than distributors and 
exhibitors sometimes give them credit for. 
</P>
<P>
You'd have said that certain high-quality films were inevitable summer fare. 
You can't imagine that matchless ode to youth and summer, "American Graffiti" 
(July, 1973), for example, appearing at any other time. Nor "Roger Rabbit" 
(June, 1988) nor the Beatles and "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" (July, 
1978) nor "Alien" (May, 1979) or "Aliens" (July, 1986). 
</P>
<P>
"Stand By Me," Rob Reiner's warm and dramatic tale of four boys on a purposeful 
summer hike, was well-placed in August, 1986, and so was a slick thriller, 
"Stakeout" (August, 1987), with its strong doses of comedy and romance. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there have been other summer releases that were less predictable in terms 
of conventional wisdom, and with varying consequences. I suspect that 
"Chinatown" (July, 1974) would have been a success at any time. 
</P>
<P>
Woody Allen's "Zelig," released in July, 1983, was not a box-office smash, but 
it is a fair guess that his technically ingenious film did at least as well in 
summer release as it would have in another season, and perhaps better. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Coppola's "Tucker" was released in August, 1988, perhaps on the 
reasonable ground that summer is high season for automobiles, and what better 
time to celebrate a Detroit-defying car maker? But despite Coppola's name and 
some enthusiastic reviews, the film fared poorly. Would it have done better in 
late fall or mid-winter? The question, as they say, is moot. 
</P>
<P>
"Carnal Knowledge" came out in July, 1971, and while sexiness is a desirable 
criterion for summer fare, that film's view was many shades darker and more 
cynical than the norm. But it found audiences. Yet "Portnoy's Complaint," 
another summer release (July, 1972) with a comparably dark view of 
relationships, disappointed commercially. 
</P>
<P>
"A World Apart," with Barbara Hershey's excellent performance as a courageous 
white South African journalist imprisoned for her views, opened in June, 1988, 
and despite fine reviews did not find audiences. Would it have been more 
successfully placed somewhere between Labor Day and Easter? The answer is 
unknowable. 
</P>
<P>
The marketing of movies has struck me as an art struggling to become a science, 
hoping to supplant hunches and experience with preview samplings and exit 
polls. My hunch is that the idea of what makes a summer release is under 
review, following the evidence of "Dead Poets Society" that a summer picture 
not less than a winter picture can engage the mind and the heart. 
</P>
<P>
My corollary hunch, which began to form years ago on the Park Theater's 
splintery seats, is that a good picture will find audiences in any season. It's 
probably true that in Upstate New York the appeal of escapist fare was stronger 
in winter than in summer. But the real joy of summer movies was that you didn't 
have to walk home in the snow.

<P>
With summer comes a literal festival of big movies. Box-office records will be 
challenged this year as Tom Cruise shifts gears, Eddie Murphy gets "Another 48 
HRS," and Arnold Schwarzenegger muscles his way to Mars. "Dick Tracy" may even 
beat "Batman." Here's what you'll be seeing in the months ahead. First, a 
caution: The following release dates may change, so stay close to your 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
<P>
"BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART III" -- Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea

Masanori Hata directs. (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>
"ANOTHER 48 HRS." -- Eddie Murphy, Nick Nolte and plenty of action are offered 
in this sequel to the 1982 smash that established Murphy as a celluloid cash 
cow. Director Walter Hill also returns as the story picks up eight years after 
the original. This time out, Murphy and Nolte lay justice on some disagreeable 
Aryan-supremacist biker dudes. (Paramount) 
</P>
<P>
"BAIL JUMPER" -- Joe and Elaine, a pair of social misfits, meet at a beer party 
and begin a life of love and travel punctuated by petty theft. They soon drift

directs. (Hemdale) 
</P>
<P>
"DAYS OF THUNDER" -- Tom Cruise fans are expected to generate box-office 
thunder when this one hits the marquees. "Top Gun" producers Don Simpson and 
Jerry Bruckheimer join forces with "Gun" director Tony Scott as Cruise pushes 
himself to the limits on the NASCAR racing circuit. Can he reach the checkered 
flag before self-destructing? Nicole Kidman nabbed the coveted spot opposite 
Cruise in this Robert Towne screenplay. (Paramount) 
</P>
<P>
"DICK TRACY" -- The Disney gang hopes to cash in with this Warren 
Beatty-directed vehicle as Warner Bros. did last summer with "Batman." Beatty 
as Tracy saves the world from the nefarious with the help of Madonna (the 
warbling Breathless Mahoney), Glenne Headly (Tess Trueheart), Charles Durning 
(Police Chief Brandon), Mandy Patinkin (88-Keys) and William Forsythe 
(Flattop). Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino chip in with cameos as Mumbles and the 
villainous Big Boy. Songs by Stephen Sondheim. Get your seat early to see the 
companion "Roller Coaster Rabbit," a Roger Rabbit cartoon. (Buena Vista) 
</P>
<P>
"DIE HARD 2" -- Bruce Willis returns as New York Ultra Cop John McClane, this 
time matching wits with an elite but malicious special-forces unit. This 
unfriendly organization -- led by a former U.S. military officer -- has assumed 
power over a major international airport. "Die Hard" vets Bonnie Bedelia, 
William Atherton and Reginald Veljohnson reprise their characters. Franco Nero, 
Bill Sadler and John Amos also appear under Renny Harlin's direction. (20th 
Century Fox) 
</P>
<P>
"GREMLINS 2: THE NEW BATCH" -- The furious fur balls take a bite out of the Big 
Apple. Director Joe Dante returns with human actors Zach Galligan, Phoebe 
Cates, John Glover, Robert Prosky, Robert Picardo, Christopher Lee and Haviland 
Morris. Effects and makeup wiz Rick Baker make the creatures come alive. 
(Warner Bros.) 
</P>
<P>
"JESUS OF MONTREAL" -- This Denys Arcand satire won an astonishing 12 Genies, 
which are Canada's answer to our Oscars. Lothaire Bluteau is the ac- tor who's 
hired to play God's son, and soon art begins to eerily imitate life. Arcand, in 
both writing and directing, demonstrates Jesus' age-old message and how it's 
been obscured throughout the centuries. A Canadian production. (Orion Classics) 
</P>
<P>

At $70 million-plus, "Total Recall" may very well be the summer's most 
expensive spectacle, but with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it, Tri-Star feels it's 
money well spent. Warners' "Gremlins 2: The New Batch" and Buena Vista's "Dick 
Tracy" also have been reported in the $50-million range, though their 
respective studios claim $30 million apiece. "Back to the Future III" and "Die 
Hard 2" both carry $60-million price tags. Paramount's reported $40-million 
babies are "Days of Thunder" and Eddie Murphy's "Another 48 HRS." Paramount 
also has late summer's "The Two Jakes," Jack Nicholson's troubled "Chinatown" 
sequel, which looks as though it's headed toward 30something. In "RoboCop 2," 
Orion has a good bet to recoup its $25-million investment. Warner's "Presumed 
Innocent" and Buena Vista's "Ducktales" are reported to have cost a 
bargain-basement $20 million each.

Bill Murray has enough clout to order up a director's chair. Or maybe half a 
chair. Murray is co-directing "Quick Change" with screenwriter Howard Franklin 
-- a first time for both. The multiple-director system works sometimes, as 
witness Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker helming the hits "Airplane!" and "Ruthless 
People."

THE SON OF SEQUELS, PART 2 
</P>
<P>
Movie sequels seem eternally with us. This summer has eight follow-up films, a 
pair of which -- "Exorcist III and "Back to the Future III" -- are sequels to 
sequels. 
</P>
<P>
* Longest sequel gestation period this summer? "The Two Jakes" shows up 16 
years after its inspiration, "Chinatown." The span from "Exorcist I" to "III" 
was one year longer, but "Exorcist II: The Heretic" came between them. 
</P>
<P>
* Summers with more than five sequels have become commonplace. There were 10 
last summer, led by "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," "Star Trek V" and 
"Ghostbusters II." 
</P>
<P>
* In 1988, 10 flicks were imbued with deja vu. During one weekend that year, 
"Short Circuit 2," "Phantasm II" and "Arthur on the Rocks" opened. What they 
all did in total business, "Batman" last year did in its first three days. 
</P>
<P>
* This year mirrors the summer of three years ago, when eight films were deemed 
sequel-worthy. Only six movie derivatives were trotted out in 1986, and 1985 
was relatively free of sequels, offering but five.

CLAY'S FEAT 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Dice Clay may wallow in irony should his summer release -- "Ford 
Fairlane" -- hit big and play into August. That's when his concert film bows. 
Will Andrew Dice Clay hurt Andrew Dice Clay at the box office? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHO'S ON FIRST? 
</P>
<P>
"RoboCop 2" and "Total Recall" are two different stories by two different 
studios with something in common. "Recall" director Paul Verhoeven will compete 
against the sequel to his own "RoboCop," which packed them in three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
TOP 10 SUMMER HITS 
</P>
<P>
"The Godfather" made much of its $134 million during the summer of 1972 but was 
technically a spring release. The following year, "American Graffiti" became 
the first summer film to crack the $100-million barrier. What follows is the 
very cream of the summer crop, not adjusted for inflation. That is, "Jaws' " 
$245 million in 1975 dollars might be considered more impressive than 
"Batman's" $251-million take of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
1. "E.T. The Extraterrestri- al." Universal (1982), $368 million (initial 
release). 
</P>
<P>
2. "Star Wars." Fox (1977), $323 million. 
</P>
<P>
3. "Return of the Jedi." Fox (1983), $264 million. 
</P>
<P>
4. "Batman." Warner Bros. (1989), $251 million. 
</P>
<P>
5. "Jaws." Universal (1975), $245 million. 
</P>
<P>
6. "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Paramount (1981), $242 million. 
</P>
<P>
7. "The Empire Strikes Back." Fox (1980), $223 million. 
</P>
<P>
8. "Ghostbusters." Columbia (1984), $221 million. 
</P>
<P>
9. "Back to the Future." Universal (1985), $208 million. 
</P>
<P>
10. "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade." Paramount (1989), $197 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
Zenia Fernandez picked a box of brown sugar off the shelf, adjusting her 
glasses to scrutinize the English-language label. "What kind of sugar is this?" 
</P>
<P>
Well might she ask. Until last year, Mexican supermarkets had only one type of 
sugar, an off-white, large-grained domestic variety. 
</P>
<P>
Then came stores such as Super Americano, where Fernandez was shopping 
recently. On its shelves, boxes of light brown, dark brown and powdered sugar 
are stacked beside paper bags containing bleached-white, highly refined, 
small-grained sugar. All are imported. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar is only a small part of what is happening here. Import stores offer 
Mexican shoppers everything from short-wave radios to canned blueberries -- 
delicacies until recently available only on trips abroad or to Tepito, Mexico 
City's rough-and-tumble contraband district. 
</P>
<P>
Now, thanks to a government policy of trade liberalization, Mexicans can buy 
cordless phones and Swatch watches at trendy boutiques in fashionable 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
And they are doing so -- with enthusiasm. Consumer-goods imports rose 82% to 
$3.5 billion in 1989, compared with the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to say they have European cookies," said Gabriel Szekely, 
assistant director of U.S.-Mexico Studies at the University of California, San 
Diego. "Foreign is fancy. People start to do it just for status." 
</P>
<P>
By indulging in such whims, consumers are contributing to an import explosion. 
"Whatever may have been saved by debt relief is being eaten up by imports," 
Szekely said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the country's $645-million trade deficit, Mexican Commerce Secretary 
Jaime Serra Puche said the increase in consumer-goods imports does not worry 
him. "The percentage looks big because it started from such a small base," he 
said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the potential for growth of imported consumer goods is limited. In a 
country where one-third of the work force earns the minimum wage of less than 
$4 a day, how many households can pay 50 cents for breakfast-bowl-size 
containers of Wheaties? 
</P>
<P>
Still, as small as the consumer-goods category is, compared to total imports -- 
about 15% -- enough Coleman lanterns, Thankyou apple juice, Giorgio perfume and 
similar goods have entered to create a booming niche market. 
</P>
<P>
"These have become necessities for the upper class," said the manager of one 
import store. "We have customers who come every week." 
</P>
<P>
Import boutiques appear on nearly every block of fashionable neighborhoods and 
are beginning to spill into middle-class areas. 
</P>
<P>
At Shopping, a store in the tony Polanco Commercial Center, clerical workers 
Margarita Contreras and Norma Lopez Miranda took a break from their jobs at an 
adjacent office tower to squeeze stuffed Teddy bears and rabbits, then giggle 
over a telephone in the likeness of Garfield, the comic-strip cat. 
</P>
<P>
"Imported goods are often better quality," Contreras said. The difference is 
most noticeable in electronics, household appliances and stuffed animals, she 
said, adding, "You see it in the quality of the (stuffed animals') cloth and 
the material used in the stuffing." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Fernanda Siegrist picks up a can of hair mousse. "These containers are 
so much lighter," she said. "They are convenient for traveling. You have to pay 
a little more, but it is cheaper than going to the United States for them, as 
we did before." 
</P>
<P>
However, she left without buying. Dressed in a green jogging suit, she had 
stopped to window-shop on her way to an aerobics class at Beverly Hills Workout 
in the same shopping center. Prices are better at neighborhood import stores, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants worry that such price-consciousness is a sign of saturation. 
</P>
<P>
And, indeed, imports are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Display windows at Woolworth are filled with Nintendo sets, Barbie dolls, Tyco 
building blocks and electronic toys such as Drag Strip Duel -- all with Made in 
USA on the box. 
</P>
<P>
Besides filling their racks with U.S. and European designer clothes, department 
stores have created import sections to sell everything from Japanese 
motorcycles to California and French wines. Barbecue sauce and even imported 
chicken appear on grocers' shelves and freezers. 
</P>
<P>
LA Gear is the hottest-selling brand at Chiquitines, a children's shoe store 
that opened in September. 
</P>
<P>
"The finishing is much better than on Mexican-made shoes," store owner Elias 
Sambra said. "Besides, there's the question of fashion. Even children notice 
the difference. That's the influence of television." 
</P>
<P>
Salchichoneria Alemana, a 30-year-old German-style deli, has added imports. 
Boxes of foreign liquor and tins of Royal Danish Butter Cookies stand 
waist-high on the floor of the shop. 
</P>
<P>
When you add the growing number of imported items to the proliferating number 
of import boutiques, you have fierce competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the first ones to open in this neighborhood a year ago," said Maria 
Carmen Terrazas, cashier at the Polanco Super Americano store. "Now we have 
fewer customers because there are more stores. Another one just opened down the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Super Americano plans to inaugurate another store soon, this time 
in a slightly less glitzy neighborhood called Colonial del Valle. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Chayet, owner of Shopping, also has expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much competition that I have to lower prices," he said. "The only 
way to make up for it is higher volume." 
</P>
<P>
Lower prices could give the import drive another push, bringing imports to a 
whole new market of less wealthy consumers.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: GOING OUT OF STATE FOR HIGH YIELD CAN BE EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many newspapers, including The Times, publish lists of the highest-yielding 
savings accounts nationwide. But getting one of these accounts is an unfamiliar 
-- even intimidating -- process for many savers. 
</P>
<P>
That's because many of the banks and thrifts listed are far away. Most of us 
know how to deal with people at local institutions, but sending money by mail 
or wire -- that's tricky, we think. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the process -- although requiring care -- is not difficult. And it 
can be well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
Highest-yielding accounts usually pay 1 to 3 percentage points more than the 
national average, says Hugo H. Ottolenghi, editor of 100 Highest Yields, a 
North Palm Beach, Fla., newsletter that provides listings for The Times. For 
example, Ottolenghi says, the nation's highest-yielding money market deposit 
account, at Blackstone Bank &amp; Trust in Boston, pays 8.33%, versus the 
national average of only 6.21%. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't think that's a big deal, note that for each $10,000 on deposit, a 
percentage point gain in yield amounts to additional interest earnings of $100 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
There are downsides to going out of town, but they aren't onerous. First, you 
might have to wait two weeks to get your money back if the institution is 
closed and there is a deposit payout, versus the typical wait of one to two 
days for a local institution that you can walk into. But deposit payouts are 
rare; in nearly all cases of bank and thrift failures these days, deposits are 
transferred to another institution. 
</P>
<P>
Another drawback: If the institution fails and your deposit is transferred to 
another, your high certificate of deposit rate may be dropped by the acquiring 
firm. You may have to accept a lower rate or deposit move your money (which may 
be to your benefit if rates have risen since you opened your CD). 
</P>
<P>
Here are key steps for opening an out-of-town account, courtesy of Ottolenghi 
and 100 Highest Yields: 
</P>
<P>
* Call or write the institution; a growing number have toll-free numbers. You 
can get them by calling directory assistance for toll-free numbers, (800) 
555-1212. 
</P>
<P>
* Direct your call or letter to the person in charge of consumer deposit 
accounts. Some institutions have a "national desk" that handles inquiries from 
individuals outside its local area. 
</P>
<P>
* Explain exactly how much you plan to invest and for how long. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask for the latest rate and yield on the account you want. Although newspaper 
listings try to be up to date, banks and thrifts are free to change rates 
daily. "Most change their rates weekly, so you want to make sure the rate you 
think you should get is the rate you are actually offered," Ottolenghi says. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask when your money will begin earning interest. You want to be sure that's 
as soon as possible after it's received; some institutions delay this for a few 
days. If you are opening a money market account, ask how many days you will 
have to wait before you can write checks on it. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask for an account form. "Don't assume the bank will give it to you," 
Ottolenghi says. 
</P>
<P>
* Decide whether to open your account by mail or by wire. Mail is cheaper but 
slower. You could miss out on the rate you wanted. Or the mail could get lost, 
stolen or delayed. For added security, consider certified or registered mail, 
or use an express mail service. 
</P>
<P>
Having your local bank or thrift wire the funds is faster; wired funds usually 
arrive the same day and begin earning interest that day or the next. Wiring 
also can be safer. But fees for wiring typically run $10 to $20 per 
transaction, which -- for smaller deposits -- could wipe out any interest you 
gain from having your money there faster. 
</P>
<P>
* If you mail, make your check payable to the institution, not an individual, 
endorsed "for deposit only." 
</P>
<P>
If the institution doesn't provide a deposit form, attach a letter specifying 
how much you are depositing, the type of account, the rate and yield, and the 
check number and account. This is critical to ensure that you get what you 
want, Ottolenghi says. You can even specify that the institution cancel the 
deposit order if its rate falls by the time your check arrives. Be sure to keep 
a duplicate copy of the letter and any other correspondence, if problems arise. 
</P>
<P>
* Include on the letter your name, address, phone number and Social Security 
number. The two biggest mistakes depositors make are omitting their Social 
Security number and a phone number, Ottolenghi says. If the Social Security 
number is missing, it holds up processing. And if there's no phone number, the 
bank can't contact you quickly if there's a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously you want to give as complete information as possible," Ottolenghi 
says. 
</P>
<P>
* If you wire funds, include all key information with the wire. Be sure to 
include the correct name and location of the institution, plus your name, 
address, phone number and Social Security number. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, you would send the wire directly to the branch you're dealing with, 
routing it with an ABA number (a form of electronic mail address). The wire 
should go to the attention of the person helping you open your account. 
</P>
<P>
Make arrangements for the institution to call you, or for you to call it, to 
confirm that the wire has arrived. You should normally allow about four hours 
for the wire to arrive, but it could take longer.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS IRA 'HARDSHIP' 
WITHDRAWAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: About three years ago, I withdrew $2,500 from my individual 
retirement account to help purchase a condo. I dutifully paid income taxes and 
a 10% penalty on the withdrawal. But now I hear there could be a "hardship" 
case exemption that would allow early withdrawals for the purchase of a primary 
residence. Is that so? And what do I do about claiming the exemption now? -- R. 
P. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Unfortunately, you don't do anything, because there is no hardship 
withdrawal provision for IRAs yet. Congress has been talking about it for 
years, but so far there's nothing on the books. The exemption to which you are 
referring applies only to 401(k) savings programs at work, which are not as 
generous as you have been led to believe. 
</P>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service allows taxpayers to withdraw funds from their 
401(k) tax deferred savings plans for certain "hardships" -- a catch-all 
category that includes illness and the purchase of a primary residence. 
However, the withdrawals are still subject to taxation as ordinary income. 
Further, if the withdrawal is made before you turn age 59 1/2, you will be 
slapped with a 10% penalty for early withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Law Spouse May Get Some Benefits 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been living with my boyfriend for about 10 years. We are both about 
50 years old. Am I eligible to collect his Social Security as a common-law 
spouse when he dies? -- M. B. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your eligibility to collect Social Security as a common-law spouse depends 
primarily on where you live. Some states recognize common-law marriages; 
others, including California, do not. 
</P>
<P>
However, even if you don't live in a state that recognizes the legal standing 
of your union, you may still be eligible for spousal Social Security benefits. 
According to a spokesman for the Social Security Administration, if you have 
temporarily lived, or perhaps even just spent a few weeks in a state 
recognizing common law marriages, the agency may recognize your claim. Our 
experts say you should contact your local Social Security office for advice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home's Value in Past Can Be Determined 
</P>
<P>
Q: Over the years, you have referred to the fact that the IRS allows taxpayers 
to upgrade the cost basis of community-owned assets, such as a house, to their 
fair market value on the date one spouse dies. But how does one reach back six 
or more years to determine the value of a house in a way the IRS will accept? 
Property inflation varies so greatly from one area to another that I doubt a 
general inflation factor would be accepted. -- E. T. L. 
</P>
<P>
A: You're right. A general inflation factor, or even a cost-of-living index 
adjustment for a particular geographic area, isn't precise enough. You will 
need comparable sales figures for homes in your neighborhood for the period in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
Although this might sound difficult to find, a qualified real estate broker, 
real estate appraiser or probate referee should be able to locate the 
information you need. In fact, you may discover that if you list your home for 
sale with a real estate broker, the realty may provide the information at 
little or no fee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
If Benefits Seem Small, It May Pay to Check 
</P>
<P>
Q: The company for which I have worked for the past 17 years will be closing in 
the immediate future. I have received written notice of the amount of my share 
of the company's "defined benefit plan" that I can expect to receive. However, 
this amount seems to be about half of what it should be. Where do I go from 
here? -- D. K. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your first stop should be your employee relations department where you 
should ask why your perceptions of what you are owed are so different from what 
the company is now saying. Perhaps there is a simple explanation. One possible 
reason is that what you thought you were entitled is an amount you were told 
you would get if you continued working at the company until age 65 at a certain 
wage scale. Now, however, the company is closing and you won't be working there 
until retirement, so your benefits are lower. 
</P>
<P>
If this is not the case, you can pursue the matter further by filing a claim 
under the benefits claims procedure of your pension plan. The procedure should 
be detailed in the fine print of your plan. Follow it carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, you may be covered by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. Again, check 
the fine print of your plan. If you are covered, and you feel that your plan 
has not been terminated correctly, you can write to the corporation at 2020 K 
St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20006. Mark your envelope to the attention of the 
Coverage and Inquiries Division.

Early Retirement Can Affect Payout 
</P>
<P>
Q: I understand a wife gets half of her husband's Social Security benefits 
whether or not she has worked. Further, if the wife has worked and her own 
Social Security benefits are less than half of her husband's, she gets the 
larger of the two amounts. Well, my husband and I both retired at age 62 and 
all these years I have been getting my own Social Security, which is less than 
half of his. How can I have this corrected? -- J. S. C. 
</P>
<P>
A: You probably don't have a problem to be corrected. A spouse who retires at 
age 62 is entitled to just 37.5% of the Social Security benefits of the other 
spouse. The answer here is that your benefits are probably higher than 37.5% of 
your husband's benefits. If they weren't, you would be getting 37.5% of his 
benefits.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: BONDS NOT AS RISK-FREE AS THEY MAY APPEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine.

<P>
The modern investment world, like the world of the ancient Greeks, has its 
share of myths, one of which asserts that bonds and the mutual funds that 
invest in them aren't very risky. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, bond funds and other types of fixed-income securities can be quite 
perilous. In certain cases, they can be more volatile than stocks. 
</P>
<P>
That might surprise some people. Many bond fund shareholders aren't aware of, 
or choose to ignore, the downside potential of their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, however, the market won't let them turn a blind eye forever. "You can 
tell people about risk, but until they feel it in their wallet, they might not 
recognize it," says Robert Rodriguez, portfolio manager of the FPA New Income 
Fund in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
What's needed is an understanding of the types of risks that investors assume 
when they put money into a bond fund. There are several varieties of dangers, 
and they don't apply to all categories of fixed-income portfolios to the same 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
Take credit risk, perhaps the most obvious type of danger. This measures a 
borrower's ability to pay back principal when due and make all interest 
payments on schedule. In other words, it estimates how likely an issuer would 
be to default on its debts. 
</P>
<P>
Several rating services evaluate the financial strength of corporations and 
municipalities (state and local governments) and rate their bonds accordingly. 
Standard &amp; Poor's, for example, ranks bonds from AAA down to D (for issues 
in default). Anything below BBB is considered speculative, "junk" or 
"high-yield" debt. Why high-yield? Because riskier issuers must offer a higher 
interest rate on their bonds to entice investors to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
Just keep in mind that higher yields won't necessarily translate into superior 
total returns. When bonds prices fall, for whatever reason, that can more than 
offset the interest income received, resulting in a net loss for the holder. 
</P>
<P>
That's been happening lately to junk bond mutual funds, many of which have 
fallen flat on their faces despite paying double-digit yields. "Many fund 
investors look too closely at yield when they should be focusing on total 
return instead," notes Dave Schulz, manager of the Milwaukee-based Newton 
Income Fund. 
</P>
<P>
For all practical purposes, Treasury bonds and other debt issues directly 
backed by Washington carry no risk of default. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't mean these bonds are necessarily "safe." Some people assume that 
government securities and the funds that hold them can't drop in price. Not so. 
All bonds, even Treasuries, fluctuate according to interest rate movements. 
Picture a seesaw with interest rates on one seat and bond prices on the other. 
When one goes up, the other goes down. 
</P>
<P>
Individual bonds, and thus bond funds, carry different amounts of interest rate 
risk. Several factors come into play, especially time remaining until a bond 
matures. That is, long-term bonds drop more sharply than short-term ones when 
there's an increase in the general level of rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Benham fund group of Mountain View, Calif., provides an example. When 
market interest rates rise by 1 percentage point, a one-year Treasury will drop 
in value by roughly 1%, a 10-year Treasury will decline by 6.5% or so and a 
30-year will tumble 10%. But if rates ease by one percentage point, the reverse 
would happen: Prices would climb by about the same magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
When shopping for fixed-income funds, inquire about the "average maturity," 
expressed in years, of the bonds held. The annual report may list this 
information, or you can check with a representative of the fund company. 
</P>
<P>
You might also ask about the portfolio's "duration," a more accurate measure of 
interest rate risk, Schulz says. Trying to calculate duration can get 
complicated, so just keep in mind that lower numbers represent less volatility. 
Newton Income, for example, has a duration of 3, which indicates that the 
fund's price would rise or fall by a modest 3% or so if rates changed by one 
percentage point, Schulz says. 
</P>
<P>
Portfolios with relatively long average maturities of, say, 20 years or more 
will expose you to greater interest rate risk, for better or worse. Short-term 
funds, which hold bonds coming due within a year or two, offer the most price 
stability. The trade-off, of course, is that short-term funds usually pay lower 
yields and don't rise as much during a bond market rally. 
</P>
<P>
Credit and interest rate risk are the big ones. But bond fund investors face 
additional dangers. These include: 
</P>
<P>
* Currency risk. Portfolios that hold foreign debt securities usually slip in 
value if the U.S. dollar rises. Conversely, a declining greenback tends to push 
up the prices of international bonds and bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, many advisers recommend having some exposure to foreign bonds, 
because this can increase your overall diversification and profit potential. 
Think of it this way: If you don't have any foreign holdings, you're 
essentially betting that the U.S. bond market will post the best returns in the 
world in any given year. That rarely happens. 
</P>
<P>
* "Call" risk. This is the threat that a bond might be redeemed by the issuer 
before maturity. In return for having to surrender the bond, the holder 
typically receives a payment that includes a slight premium to the face value. 
</P>
<P>
Is this bad? It can be, because issuers usually call bonds only after interest 
rates have dropped, allowing them to replace costly debt with bonds paying 
lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate bonds that face possible calls in the near future might not 
appreciate much in a bond market rally. "You don't get the same upside price 
movement on corporates as with governments, which generally aren't callable," 
says George Stasen, chief operating officer of the Rushmore group in Bethesda, 
Md., which offers a mutual fund that holds nothing but Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, governments as a group have slightly outperformed higher-rated 
corporate bonds on a total-return basis from 1972 on, Stasen says, citing 
numbers supplied by Shearson Lehman Hutton. That's odd, because corporates 
carry credit risk and thus should offer higher returns to compensate investors. 
Stasen attributes this anomaly to the fact that corporates, unlike Treasuries 
and many other government issues, can be called away, depriving investors of 
market profits. 
</P>
<P>
Certain municipal bonds also face call risk. In fact, some observers estimate 
that 20% to 40% of the current supply of munis could be retired prematurely by 
the mid-1990s. If so, that might cause problems for investors in tax-free bond 
funds. A broker can tell you whether a specific bond has call provisions, but 
it's harder to size up an entire mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the bond market isn't monolithic; different types of debt carry 
different degrees of risk. "There's a lot to be said for the flexibility to 
move between fixed-income sectors," says Rodriguez, who can do so in the FPA 
New Income Fund. "Few people realize that when they invest in a specific type 
of bond fund, they're really investing in a narrow sector portfolio." 
</P>
<P>
That's a good argument for holding a couple of types of bond funds, or at least 
one that can move around as the risk-return trade-off changes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BOND RISK 
</P>
<P>
What makes some bond funds more risky than others? Usually, the more volatile 
portfolios hold a large proportion of long-term bonds, lower-rated issues or a 
combination of the two. 
</P>
<P>
The following table lists some of the lowest- and highest-risk bond funds 
around, as identified by Mutual Fund Values, a publication of Morningstar Inc. 
in Chicago. Significantly, portfolios in the latter group tend to have more 
erratic long-term returns. However, this doesn't mean volatile fixed-income 
funds necessarily make less suitable investments -- that depends on each 
person's tolerance for risk.

SUNUP TO SUNDOWN, LAUNCHES KEEP A VERY SPECIAL PROMISE

LAGO DOS BOCAS, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The captain of the 50-passenger boat pulled alongside the pier to deliver a 
gallon and a half of fresh milk to the 13-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Joel Acueda, can be found dockside every afternoon waiting for one of 
the boat captains to bring his family milk from the farmer with 10 cows who 
lives across the lake. 
</P>
<P>
No, the captain isn't a milkman. But milk delivery is part of his job as 
skipper of one of the five launches on Lago Dos Bocas -- the Two Mouth Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cargo, the captains and crews of Las Lanchas -- the launches -- 
carry it. And they do it for anyone who needs their service, delivering 
supplies from one house to another along the shores of this remote lake high in 
the mountains of Central Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
For the 300 Puerto Ricans who live here, Las Lanchas de Lago Dos Bocas are the 
lifelines to one another and to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
They call the boats "the promise the government kept." 
</P>
<P>
"When the government completed Dos Bocas hydroelectric reservoir in 1943, the 
people who lived here asked: 'How are we going to get back and forth to our 
homes and farms now that you made the reservoir?' " said Ismael Serrano, 58, a 
boat captain for 21 years on Lago Dos Bocas. 
</P>
<P>
He said the government told the people not to worry. "They said they would 
always provide free boats -- all day, every day of the year for the people of 
Lago Dos Bocas. They said they would transport the people, their supplies, 
their crops. They said the government owes them this for flooding their 
valleys." 
</P>
<P>
And the government has done what it said it would do, Serrano said. 
</P>
<P>
The large passenger launches run sunup to sundown seven days a week, along the 
lush, green shores of the two-fingered lake. They board and discharge riders 
wherever passengers want to get on or off. People wave from shore and the boats 
head in to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
Generations of the same families have lived and farmed on the steep mountain 
slopes above the lake, raising livestock, vegetables, coffee, bananas, oranges, 
grapefruit, lemons and coconuts. 
</P>
<P>
Before this two-finger lake was here, rivers flowed through its deep canyons. 
The farmers used horses and small boats to travel in and out, to transport 
their supplies, to take their crops to market. 
</P>
<P>
Now the five government-operated boats -- each with a two-man crew -- take the 
people to and from their homes, deliver the mail, leave packages from merchants 
on the docks, and carry bags of coffee, stalks of bananas and crates of other 
crops to the main landing. And they do it all for free. 
</P>
<P>
Schoolchildren ride the boats. Neighbors visit neighbors using the launches. 
Men and women ride them to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
And hundreds of Puerto Ricans on family outings come here every weekend just to 
ride the boats in the beautiful mountain surroundings, to picnic, to fish on 
the lake. Even for visitors, there is no charge. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone is sick and needs to go to a doctor we head straight for the main 
landing with them. We've had close calls with women about to have a baby," said 
Serrano. 
</P>
<P>
There are two restaurants reached by Las Lanchas De Lago Dos Bocas and one 
hotel open only on weekends with five rooms, each renting for a total of $65 
for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano, who earns $700 a month as captain, was born in the canyon that is now 
Lago Dos Bocas, as were his parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid I had a row boat and would row people for 10 cents from one 
place to another on the river. It would take me an hour sometimes to get them 
where they were going. Then it would take me an hour to row back home again," 
said Serrano. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no electricity here until 1960. For those of us who live here, Lago 
Dos Bocas is a paradise. It is quiet, peaceful and about as pretty a place as 
you'd ever want to see. I've lived other places, even in the States. But 
nothing can compare to Lago Dos Bocas. 
</P>
<P>
"And we have a great transportation system." 
</P>
<P>
He ought to know. He's the captain. 
</P>

<P>
A long time ago, the pen was mightier than the sword. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, few people are lifting pen to paper, especially when it comes to 
writing personal letters. We are far from the days when it was common to enjoy 
correspondence over late, sunny breakfasts on Saturday mornings. The mail is 
delivered later these days, of course, but the fact remains that the 165 
billion pieces of mail delivered each year in this country are mostly bills, 
advertising messages, periodicals, and little of human interest. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey found that people listed reading personal letters as their 
favorite household activity. Yet they also described writing letters as their 
least favorite chore. 
</P>
<P>
"Letter writing really is a dying art," says Jean McGarry, assistant professor 
of writing seminars at Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
Adds etiquette expert Letitia Baldrige, author of "The New Manners for the 
'90s": "Letter writing started to go out in the '70s. Now, after 20 years, 
there is practically nothing left to go out. . . . We are communicating with 
telephones and fax machines and computers. We are not expressing ourselves. 
Without letters, what will be left to show of our culture but videotapes of 
Roseanne Barr? Good God, it's a calamity." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of letters is borne out in numbers. In 1977, when the U.S. Postal 
Service began recording such figures, 7.6% of mail in all classes was sent from 
one household to another -- in other words, personal correspondence. In 1987, 
such letters dropped to 4.9% of all mail, and in 1988 to 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977 the average number of person-to-person letters delivered each week to a 
household was 1.8; a decade later that figure shrunk to 1.5. In 1988, the 
average amount of all mail delivered to households for the year was 1,217 
pieces. Of that figure, only 59.5 pieces were household-to-household letters, 
excluding greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, personal letters are decreasing because "we are seeing 
tremendous growth in the other classes of mail," says Irene Lericos, Baltimore 
Division Communications Manager of the U.S. Postal Service. The Postal Service 
politely calls that other mail "bulk business"; we call it junk mail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to call someone these days than sit down and write a letter," says 
Gary Thomas, a Baltimore mail carrier for more than 17 years. "In the old days 
there were not as many cars and it wasn't as easy to get around, so people 
would write. Now, instead of writing a letter to someone who lives in the next 
town, people will just drive down there. What we are finding is the personal 
mail we get is mostly coming from older people because they have more time, or 
younger people who are more confined to the house -- the ones without cars, the 
teen-agers." He sees an increase in personal mail around holiday time, but it's 
mostly greeting cards, not full-blown letters. 
</P>
<P>
The 19th and early 20th centuries were the golden age of letter writing, 
McGarry of Johns Hopkins says. People traveled widely and carried tales of 
their adventures home through letters to friends. Henry James, James Joyce, 
Franz Kafka and Marcel Proust all wrote amusing and magnificent letters that 
were the subject of study for scholars. 
</P>
<P>
What are some situations that should motivate a letter, instead of the more 
mundane phone call? 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a chance encounter and run into someone on the street or in the 
airport, that's good enough reason to send a note and get them caught up in the 
news," Baldrige says. "If someone's in the hospital, don't send a get-well card 
and just sign your name. Sit down and write a letter that says you're so sorry 
to hear they are hit with such a problem, and now, here's the news. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
How does one with rusty writing habits get started again? 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important to take a slice of time to be devoted to it," Baldrige 
advises, "maybe a Saturday afternoon from 4 to 4:30. Be sure it's free time, 
that there's no telephone to answer. Write in an attractive place, where you're 
looking out the window at a tree, or you have a vase of flowers. Spread some 
ambience around the work area. Get a really good pen, some beautiful 
stationery, and that will inspire you. . . . "

AT 3 P. M., WORKING PARENTS WORRY

<P>
When school dismissal bells ring, working parents hear the sound miles away. 
</P>
<P>
No matter that these adults are in stores, offices and factories, waiting on 
customers, answering telephones, assembling automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Working parents begin to let their minds wander, taking mental note of their 
children's whereabouts, tracing their routes home or to after-school 
activities, gauging the time it should take them, checking the clock, waiting 
for the phone to ring. 
</P>
<P>
And when it doesn't, calling home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's 3 p.m. Do you know where your children are?" is the question that tenses 
America's working parents -- and slows down workplaces -- in the afternoons. 
When the answer is yes, workers relax; business picks up again. 
</P>
<P>
It's been called the Three O'Clock Syndrome and the Angst Hour -- a time when 
worker productivity dips and business phone lines jam and parents come face to 
face with balancing their work and family lives. 
</P>
<P>
Although hard data on the Three O'Clock Syndrome is difficult to come by, 
parents, child-care advocates and even employers agree that it happens. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'Hi, Mom, I'm home' phone calls start hitting office switchboards as 
school lets out across the country," John Fernandez wrote in his 1986 book, 
"Child Care and Corporate Productivity: Resolving Work-Family Conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
"The Three O'Clock Syndrome sets in, with employees hunched over phones, 
whispering admonitions about homework and directions about making dinner," he 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
"Employers can hear what goes on at 3 o'clock, the phone calls coming in and 
going out," says Susan Ginsberg, associate dean of the Bank Street College of 
Education in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an accepted phenomenon," says Dr. Patricia Fossarelli, a pediatrician at 
the Johns Hopkins Hospital Children's Center, who has studied and counseled 
latchkey children. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a pressure cutter. "Being able to reach your kids at The Angst Hour 
may function as a safety valve," said Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work 
Institute in New York City. "Fathers who did not think it was cool for them to 
call their kids had fantasies" about what evils were befalling them, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"I just need to know they are home," said Jean Page of her 11- and 12-year-old 
youngsters. "I just look at the clock; by 3:10 I start calling and getting real 
nervous," said the Baltimore County mother whose problems finding care for her 
children when they were younger led her to establish the Open Door, an 
after-school program that operates at 16 sites around the county. 
</P>
<P>
The child, too, often needs to hear a parent's voice. Jay Belsky, an expert on 
child development and professor at Pennsylvania State University, told the 
Chicago Tribune in 1988: "The issue is not so much if someone is there when a 
child gets home from school as whether someone is there psychologically for the 
child. Does he have someone to call and ask if he needs something? . . . The 
psychological connection is more important than the physical one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Three O'Clock Syndrome is an outgrowth of the increasing number of 
"children in self care," a relatively new term that is replacing "latchkey" to 
describe children who go home alone or with siblings. National surveys last 
year indicated that from 2 million to 6 million children under 13 cared for 
themselves after school or on weekends. And in its "Resource Guide on 
School-Age Child Care," the National Assn. for the Education of Young Children 
says that 18 million to 20 million children will spend "part of their day alone 
or with school-age siblings" this year.

In a 1989 study, Fernandez found that 59% of the management and non-management 
employees surveyed said they had a problem handling before- and after-school 
care and vacation time. Those arrangements have consistently been the third 
most frequent child-care concern (after day care for sick children and finding 
time for school conferences) among working parents in three major studies 
Fernandez has conducted over the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
A single father "all of my life," Fernandez did some of the studies during his 
15 years as an employee of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. He continues 
to write books on work and family relations and is president of Advanced 
Research Management, a Philadelphia consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez considers the Three O'Clock Syndrome "absolutely detrimental" to 
employers. "If you are worried about your child . . . you are not going to 
concentrate on your work; you're liable to make mistakes . . . and you could 
develop health problems" related to stress, he says. 
</P>
<P>
There are ways to ease the Three O'Clock Syndrome, Ginsberg and other 
child-care experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Employers who limit phone access can relax their policies to allow workers to 
receive and make necessary calls freely. 
</P>
<P>
Employers should be sympathetic to the needs of their parent workers, 
scheduling overtime in advance and avoiding meetings late in the day, Ginsberg 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Companies should support after-school programs, such as YMCAs and Boys' and 
Girls' clubs, so they can expand their services, Ginsberg says. 
</P>
<P>
Companies might also spend money to provide transportation to and from 
after-school activities. 
</P>
<P>
And, Ginsberg says, after-school hours should be looked upon as a time for 
enrichment, not just baby-sitting. "There are all kinds of wonderful things 
that kids can learn," she says.

STANDING UP FOR 'REAL' WORKING WOMEN; 
</P>
<P>
LIFESTYLE: SYNDICATED COLUMNIST NIKI SCOTT WRITES ABOUT WHAT SHE KNOWS BEST -- 
WOMEN WHO HAVE REGULAR JOBS, NOT GLAMOROUS CAREERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA FRENKIEL, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the image columnist Niki Scott says the glossy women's magazines 
promote about working women: 
</P>
<P>
"They almost all live in New York, they all earn more than $45,000 a year, they 
have nannies at home for their kids, and they have adoring husbands who do 
everything but breast-feed." 
</P>
<P>
This is the image Niki Scott has of the women she writes about: "They're like 
me, people who usually have jobs, not glamorous careers, not rewarding life 
work. They have jobs like most people have jobs. They get a paycheck every week 
and they stretch it out, and they are good mothers, good wives, good sisters 
and good workers, and they're just good folks." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Niki Scott used to be a lot more like some of her readers -- with her 
struggles as a divorced mother of two trying to meet the rent -- but more and 
more she's become the success her readers may dream about. Scott, 46, married 
for the second time, writes her Working Woman column -- reaching millions of 
readers in 120 newspapers -- from her Mount Desert Island, Maine, home, and 
travels around the country reaching thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for all working parents, especially working women, she says, "is 
that we not get complacent" about gains in the workplace "because it isn't 
over. We can't let any semblance of a backlash happen." 
</P>
<P>
The top five concerns among working parents, she says, are: pay, recognition at 
work, child care, time and stress. 
</P>
<P>
"The working woman in particular," she says, "is concerned with having it all, 
for lack of a better term. I think we're still pretty confused about what that 
means. Do we want it all? Can we do it all? I don't think anybody should 
underestimate the stress that's involved when we're trying to work at the 
office and waiting for the phone to ring, wondering if our children are being 
properly taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
In her childhood, one of privilege in New York, Scott had two working parents. 
Her father was a top advertising executive; her mother, Martha Dean, was the 
host of a radio talk show that Scott recalls as being ahead of its time. "My 
mother was supposed to be interviewing people about fashion and gardening, but 
she interviewed authors and playwrights and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was a terrific role model, and I feel in some way she was a feminist 
before there was the word for it." But Scott says the guilt her mother felt 
"about whether or not she was doing the right thing with her children" was very 
much like the guilt she felt. 
</P>
<P>
Scott had dropped out of Washington College to marry her sweetheart, who worked 
in advertising. She worked part time over the years at odd jobs, but after 10 
years of marriage and two children, she became a full-time reporter with the 
Charlotte (N.C.) News. 
</P>
<P>
While working in the "women's section" in the early 1970s -- "where they were 
still telling readers how to fix elegant Beef Bourguignon" -- she decided she 
wanted to write a column about women like herself at work. After a year, she 
says, "I decided to follow my own advice and set my goals higher, to take a 
risk that scared me to death." She was newly divorced when she set up a career 
as a free-lance writer. Much to her amazement, Universal Press Syndicate bought 
the column in 1976, signing her to a 10-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
That allowed her to move to Maine -- a place where she had always wanted to 
live and raise her children -- but contrary to popular misconceptions, she 
insists she's not rich, merely comfortable enough to live where she pleases. 
</P>
<P>
Four months of the year, she and her second husband, Joseph Valliant Jr., the 
former editor of the Waterman's Gazette, live near Easton, Md. on the Eastern 
Shore. 
</P>
<P>
She may live on an island in Maine, but she insists she's not isolated from the 
real world. The mail from readers -- almost a third of whom she estimates are 
men -- keep her in touch: 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, things are more difficult and in some ways easier than they were 
14 years ago. When I started this column, women were agonizing about whether 
they could go to work. Now that question is resolved for most of them. They 
have to work. What hasn't changed is that we're still doing full-time jobs at 
work and full-time jobs at home, and at the end of the week we're wondering why 
we're so exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
But while she believes "some men are taking great strides forward in seeing the 
women in their lives as equal partners," others are coming up short in sharing 
the role at home, which leads to resentment among many working women. 
</P>
<P>
But would women go home again? "I don't know a single working mother who 
wouldn't go home for a year if she could, but I don't think many would want to 
stay home longer than that," she says, noting that surveys indicate women 
derive as much satisfaction from work as men do. But the reality of women at 
work is that one in three is working in a clerical job and nine out of 10 earn 
less than $25,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The most common conflicts, she says, are generational. "Women my age have heard 
young women say 'I don't understand what the problem is. No one's 
discriminating against me.' The answer is if you don't think there are any 
problems left, you aren't looking. If there are fewer problems, the women ahead 
of you made the way." Lowering her voice, she adds, "We cleared the path, 
darling."

WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT 
</P>
<P>
Dense, satisfying, feverishly inventive and a technical marvel, this 1988 
live-action/animation blockbuster hit is a sort of inked-in film noir with 
outrageous sight gags. Bob Hoskins stars as a seedy gumshoe, and the film's 
mystery plot involves a last, great roundup of cartoon stars. Directed by 
Robert Zemeckis, with Oscar winner Richard Williams as director of animation.

COVER STORY: THEY SAID IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN: CNN TURNS 10; 
</P>
<P>
"WE HAVE TO REACH FOR THE STARS AND WHEN WE GET THERE, FIND OUT WHAT'S BEHIND 
THEM AND SEE IF WE CAN CARRY IT LIVE." -- CISSY BAKER, CNN VICE PRESIDENT AND 
MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before there were controversial reenactments of news stories, before there were 
stand-up prime-time news shows and long before comedians moonlighted as weather 
reporters and home video clips became commonplace on national newscasts, 
somebody came up with a really bizarre idea for TV news. 
</P>
<P>
A nonstop newscast. Seven days a week, 24 hours a day. To be broadcast around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
When media magnate Ted Turner announced his ambitious Cable News Network 10 
years ago, he was roundly laughed at. Not surprising, considering the 
announcement came from a man whose WTB' "superstation" in Atlanta used to 
fulfill its federal broadcasting requirements with a pie-throwing anchorman who 
once invited a German shepherd to co-anchor his newscast. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the pending cable TV explosion had barely started to crackle. 
Still, Turner forged ahead, his sights set on unsettling the Big Three 
networks, which he compared to dinosaurs. "You know why they're not here 
anymore?" he said in 1980. "Because the mammals ate their eggs. I'm a mammal." 
</P>
<P>
CNN's beginnings were less than auspicious. During the Republican National 
Convention in Detroit a decade ago, CNN's slipshod broadcasting booth was 
located in the rafters above the band, so that every time the band played 
"You're a Grand Old Flag," anchor Bernard Shaw was drowned out. 
</P>
<P>
In time, however, Turner would sue the Reagan administration and the three 
networks for CNN to be included in the White House press pool. The network's 
paltry audience of 1.7 million U.S. households would swell to more than 50 
million. Its broadcasts would reach-indeed span-the globe to about 90 
countries. And CNN's continuous live coverage of breaking news events would 
become a reliable trademark that no broadcast station could match. 
</P>
<P>
The Times asked some CNN veterans to briefly reminisce about their early 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner, president, CNN 
</P>
<P>
"I came up with the idea for CNN back in 1975, when TBS first went up on 
satellite. Home Box Office was already in existence. Since they had the new 
movies and we had the old movies and non-network sports on TBS, I thought the 
next channel that would be convenient would be an all-news channel. That's 
where I got the idea. . . Even though I did not have the money and did not know 
anything much about the news business, I just figured the concept was good 
enough to go ahead and give it a shot. 
</P>
<P>
"The networks pooh-poohed us a little bit at first. But I really cannot say 
that I minded in retrospect." 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Shaw, Washington anchor 
</P>
<P>
"In 1980, I was dissatisfied with the new contract I was being offered at ABC 
as senior Capitol Hill correspondent. I was tired of the network pool I had 
been swimming in. (ABC News president) Roone Arledge spent an hour in his 
office warning me it would be very bad for my career to go do something called 
CNN. When I left, most people weren't even trying to conceal their derision, 
their snickers. My attitude when I walked into CNN was the same attitude I had 
at Marine Corps boot camp the first day. "I'm here. Let's get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
"The moment I knew we were really onto something was when we carried Reagan's 
speech before a labor group at the Washington Hilton Hotel. During a break, we 
were monitoring the Secret Service radios. Suddenly someone said, "They're 
shooting at the President.' We turned up the audio, and you could hear agents 
running, screaming and cursing. I said, 'Let's get on the air,' and we didn't 
get off until 10 hours later. We stayed with the story, no commercials. Our 
coverage of the assassination attempt convinced me that we were onto something. 
I wasn't making as much money as Dan, Peter or Tom-I still don't-but I knew I 
was in the right place." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Turner, executive vice president of news gathering 
</P>
<P>
"We started out in half terror and half confidence. We all ran scared. Hell, we 
still do. The conventional wisdom was that CNN was not going to make it. They 
told us, 'First, there's no way you guys are going to get on the air. Second, 
if you get on the air, there's no way you're going to stay there. Third, if by 
some remote chance you do stay on the air, you'll bankrupt Ted (Turner).' Other 
than that, it was a lot of encouragement." 
</P>
<P>
Lou Dobbs, vice president of business news 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what to expect competitively. My principal concern was not that 
we couldn't pull it off. But I wanted to know would CBS emulate? Would ABC 
duplicate? That was my fear. I knew that after we were on the air for six 
months, we would be very vulnerable to the networks. Starting a 24-hour news 
network required an investment by Ted Turner that could have bankrupted him, 
but to the networks that kind of money is pocket change. The fact that a 
successful imitator hasn't arisen astounds me to this day. The networks' 
failure to react to the competitive threat of CNN was the answer to my 
prayers." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Kenyon, senior entertainment correspondent 
</P>
<P>
"When I first walked into the Washington bureau, it was like going backstage at 
a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland MGM musical. They were still building the bureau 
about three weeks before air time. George Watson, a giant in journalism, was 
testing a microphone. Producers were literally hammering the sign of the bureau 
into place. And Daniel Schorr was walking around saying, 'This is just what CBS 
was like after World War II.' As a young journalist, I felt like this big ship 
was leaving, and I knew I had to be on it or get left behind. 
</P>
<P>
"Ted (Turner's) master stroke was to install a satellite dish and put CNN in 
the offices of Congress. The powerful people in the country turned to CNN the 
day shots were fired at Reagan to find out what was happening. Bernie (Shaw) 
was the hero of that one. He was the only network anchor not to declare Jim 
Brady dead, which was extraordinary given the pressure to do so. The three 
established networks had declared him dead, and Dan Rather held a moment of 
silence for him. That's when I knew we were on our way." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Schorr, senior news analyst, National Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
(Schorr was a CBS News correspondent before being hired as CNN's first 
employee. He left in 1985 over a dispute for editorial independence.) 
</P>
<P>
"Ted Turner approached me a year before he started CNN. He asked me to join him 
at the cable convention in Las Vegas, and then hired me 15 minutes before the 
press conference to give legitimacy to what he was going to propose. I didn't 
know anything about cable. But as he outlined CNN to me, I saw the vision 
there, something inherently viable, a way to give people news 24 hours a day so 
that they could turn it on and off like a water tap. I liked the idea of live 
coverage as opposed to capsule coverage. I don't know where he got his 
conceptions from, because I could tell he didn't know anything about news. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew CNN would be a success. What I didn't anticipate was the extent of 
CNN's success today. It would have been like asking me to foresee a revolution 
in Eastern Europe, the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. I didn't foresee that 
CNN would be seen in hotel rooms around the world. That CNN would be the pearl 
in Ted's crown." 
</P>
<P>
Cissy Baker, vice president and managing editor 
</P>
<P>
"I thought CNN would be successful. I always believed it would be. It was 
everybody else I had to convince. That became a second full-time job, really. I 
wish I had a tape recorder in the beginning, when I was running the Washington 
desk, trying to get an interview with a congressman or official. I would say, 
'Hi, this is Cissy Baker. I'm calling from CNN, Cable News Network, Ted 
Turner's all-news, 24-hour network, based in Atlanta, Ga., with a bureau here 
in Washington. Do you get cable? Let me tell you about cable.' And then after a 
while, I would get this, 'I'm sorry, could you repeat that please?' " 
</P>
<P>
Mary Alice Williams, anchorwoman, NBC's "Sunday Today." 
</P>
<P>
(Williams left for NBC last year after nine years as a CNN anchorwoman.) 
</P>
<P>
"It never occurred to us we couldn't make this thing appen. In January of 1981, 
when we welcomed the hostages back at West Point, we set up cameras all along 
the bus route where they were arriving. But we didn't have a switcher to cut 
between cameras. I was standing on top of this building in the freezing cold 
with an engineer, and the buses were coming. I said, 'How do we do this? We 
have to switch between cameras!' He said, 'No problem,' and he pulled some 
wires out of this box and touched them together, and the pictures switched. 
Nobody told me or him that it wouldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"That was our mentality. The networks had a giant generator truck, and we were 
manipulating wires by hand. 
</P>
<P>
"In the industry, CNN was a quiet revolution. But the fact is there was nothing 
quiet about it. On June 1, 1980, we went on the air at 6 p.m., Eastern time. 
Our lead story was live. Vernon Jordan had been shot, and we showed President 
Carter walking out of the hospital where Jordan was staying. At 6:30 p.m. 
Eastern time, the broadcast networks went on with their evening newscasts, and 
their lead story was Carter walking out of the hospital, and the footage said 
'Courtesy of CNN' in the corner. That was our first night on the air."

<P>
HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF WATCHING THE INDIANAPOLIS 500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Indianapolis 500 is more than a bunch of colored cars going around and 
around a track 200 times in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
It is, as the late Sid Collins called it, "The greatest spectacle in racing." 
It is the richest, most watched and most prestigious race in the world, with a 
lot of things for even a casual TV viewer to look for. 
</P>
<P>
The start alone could be called the "The greatest spectacle in sports." You 
could, perhaps, tune in late during the first inning of a World Series game or 
even skip the kickoff of a Super Bowl and not miss a memorable moment. But 
whatever you do, don't miss the start of Sunday's Indianapolis 500. The sight 
of 33 cars-25,000 horsepower's worth- charging down the long straightaway to 
take the green flag and then channel through a tight 90-degree left-hand corner 
is a sight never to be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
A.J. Foyt, who has won the 500 four times and has made that dash to the first 
turn in 32 consecutive Indianapolis races, says, "Turn 1 at Indy isn't much by 
itself, it's just getting through it that's hard. Particularly on the first 
lap, when all the cars are coming down like a herd of longhorns tryin' to get 
in position." 
</P>
<P>
To fully appreciate the Indy 500, watch before the race, when the cars are 
sitting silent, drivers and crews nervously fidgeting around them as if they 
were some religious object of worship. 
</P>
<P>
Crucial is hearing that racing cliche, "Gentlemen, start your engines" and 
watching thousands of balloons drift into the sky while Jim Nabors warbles, 
"Back Home Again in Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
If that doesn't get the goose-bumps to bumping, nothing will. Now on to the 
raceI and there's more to it than watching 33 moving billboards racing three 
hours for a purse of nearly $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Pit stops. When a car comes into the pits, six crewmen will swarm over the wall 
and in 14-15 seconds fill the tank with 40 gallons of methanol, clean the 
windshield, hand the driver a drink of water, change two-maybe four-tires and, 
if necessary, make a change in the car's suspension. It will look like chaos, 
but it is a highly orchestrated detail of the race. Cars travel 100 yards in a 
second while racing, so each second spent in the pits is extremely critical. 
During yellow flag stops, when more than half the field may pit at the same 
time, the traffic can be worse than the Dodger Stadium parking lot after a 
sellout. 
</P>
<P>
The track. Look how narrow it is. When it was built in 1909, the average speed 
for a hot lap was around 70 m.p.h. Today the cars will be running 230 m.p.h. on 
the straightaways and averaging 215 for a lap, yet the dimensions have never 
changed The track is 50 feet wide on the straights, widening to 60 feet in the 
middle of the nearly flat 90-degree corners. 
</P>
<P>
On-board cameras. This is where the TV viewer has it all over the fan who has 
paid $100 for a seat in Turn 1: You watch part of the race from behind a 
driver's shoulder. Note two things: one, how much the driver's head bounces, 
and two, how the car drifts back and forth across the track, first right up 
against the wall and then down along the line next to the infield grass. If you 
drove like that, you'd be arrested for erratic behavior-but the 33 guys in the 
500 don't have to worry about cross-traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd. More than 400,000 spectators will jam into the grandstands and the 
infield, making it the world's largest paid sporting event To put it in 
perspective, there will be more people than who live in the city of Long Beach 
or more than enough to fill the seats at four Rose Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Safety crews. When a wreck occurs, and there surely will be one, safety trucks 
will arrive on the accident scene almost before the crippled car stops 
spinning. It is a testimony to their speed and skill that there has not been a 
driver fatality in the 500 since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The crashes. A good thing to remember is that the worse a crash looks, the 
better the driver may be. Race cars are made to disintegrate when they hit 
something. The more pieces that fly off, the more energy is absorbed and the 
less impact it will have on the driver. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't get your fill of racing during the 500 miles, stick around for the 
International Race of Champions. It will be coming right up as soon as the 
winning driver in the 500 takes his swig of milk, kisses his wife and thrusts 
his fist in the air to signify how many times he has won the race.

</P>
<P>
While your friendly neighborhood theater dishes up the summer blockbusters, 
from "Dick Tracy" to a whole slate of sequels, the two coastal cinemas operated 
by Los Angeles-based Landmark Theatres will continue to offer local movie 
lovers a chance to step out of the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
* "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!" by the irrepressible Spanish director Pedro 
Almodovar opened Friday at the Port Theatre in Corona del Mar, while the 
successful run of the Academy Award-winner "Cinema Paradiso" moved from the 
Port to the Balboa Cinema in Newport Beach. Almodovar's latest film made 
headlines when it was slapped with an X rating; the distributor elected to 
release it unrated. 
</P>
<P>
Bookings for later in the season have yet to be finalized, but cineastes can 
probably look for the county premieres of the following: 
</P>
<P>
* "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed," a French fairy tale about a cleaning woman 
who tips the boss of a yogurt company to the intrigues against him. The writer 
and director is Coline Serreau, who also created the original French version of 
"Three Men and a Baby." 
</P>
<P>
* "Jesus of Montreal," in which a Montreal actor puts on a revisionist play on 
the death and resurrection of Christ and sees his life begin to parallel his 
art. Director Denys Arcand made a splash in 1986 with "The Decline of the 
American Empire." 
</P>
<P>
* "May Fools," director Louis Malle's latest, is a social comedy set in the 
south of France that tells the tale of a family brought together by the death 
of a grandfather, against the background of the May 1968 general strike.

</P>
<P>
* On the local television front, summer plans are modest at Orange County's 
only commercial station, KDOC-TV Channel 56. One new wrinkle is "90% certain," 
according to station spokeswoman Tricia Krause: That will be coverage of the 
newest Team Tennis entry, the Newport Beach Dukes, who will play at -- you 
guessed it -- the John Wayne Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, more of those holiday rerun marathons are planned -- "Perry 
Mason" on Memorial Day, "The Bob Newhart Show" on July 4 and "The Beverly 
Hillbillies" on Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
Summer programming plans are also quiet at KOCE-TV Channel 50 in Huntington 
Beach. However, the county's public television station is planning a couple of 
fund-raising events, including a luncheon presentation by management guru Tom 
Peters on June 15 and a July 12 lecture by John Bradshaw, host of the PBS 
series "Bradshaw On: The Family" (the series will begin airing on KOCE June 11, 
weekdays at 1:30 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
The station's next pledge drive, meanwhile, will take place Aug. 17-26.

Orange County wades into its second hundred years facing a summer that's filled 
with a wider range of arts and entertainment activities than ever. 
</P>
<P>
The Calendar staff of the Times Orange County Edition selects highlights among 
the hundreds of choices offered at the county's theaters, art museums, outdoor 
amphitheaters, concert halls, comedy clubs, movie theaters and elsewhere to 
stave off any summer doldrums that might dare to take roost. 
</P>
<P>
* War and revolution, race and culture, gender and economics are among the 
weighty topics to be explored in a major exhibit at the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum that may well be the summer's most promising and provocative. "Committed 
to Print: Social and Political Themes in Recent American Printed Art," July 
15-Sept. 23, will include 144 prints and other works on paper from the '60s, 
'70s and '80s by more than 110 artists, all participants in the three-decade 
resurgence in politically charged and socially conscious art. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by New York's Museum of Modern Art, the exhibit's illustrious artist 
roster boasts such names as Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Jonathan 
Borofsky, Barbara Kruger, Chris Burden and Andy Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
Running concurrently at the Newport Beach museum will be a solo exhibit of 
works by Los Angeles artist Charles Ray, whose sensibility bridges sculpture, 
installation and performance art. 
</P>
<P>
* The Laguna Art Museum will also host two meaty shows this summer: 
</P>
<P>
"Jay DeFeo: Works on Paper," July 13-Oct. 7, gives the late California 
abstractionist her first major museum survey. DeFeo, a San Francisco artist, 
was associated with the poets and artists of the Beat generation. The exhibit, 
with more than 50 works on paper from 1956 on, is being organized by the 
University Art Museum, UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"Turning the Tide: Early Los Angeles Modernists, 1920-1956," July 13-Sept. 16, 
features 80 paintings and 10 sculptures by 10 leading Los Angeles modern 
pioneers including Lorser Feitelson, Helen Lundeberg, Hans Burkhardt and Rico 
Lebrun. 
</P>
<P>
During July and August, the Laguna Art Museum will be open Fridays until 8 
p.m., in addition to normal hours of 11 a.m.-5 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Conceptual Impulse," coming to Security Pacific Gallery in Costa Mesa, 
will feature works in a variety of media. Seven artists who are "aggressively 
investigating ideas" are included in the exhibit, says curator Mark Johnstone. 
The show runs June 17-Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
* The Irvine Fine Arts Center is celebrating its 10th anniversary with "Top of 
the Crop: 10 Year Pick," through July 22. The multimedia exhibit is composed 
mostly of works by Orange County artists, selected by curator Dorrit Kirk 
Fitzgerald who has chosen one old and one new piece by each participant. 
</P>
<P>
The center will also host "Island Indonesia: Reflections of Art, Mirrors of 
Culture," a traveling, 160-piece exhibit of Indonesian artifacts presented in 
conjunction with the Festival of Indonesia, a national touring program. 
Textiles, ritual sculptures, jewelry and paintings from the 12th to the 20th 
Centuries will be on view from Aug. 18- Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
* The Orange County Center for Contemporary Art has once again chosen a 
superior Southern California curator to select artists for its annual juried 
exhibition. Judi Freeman, associate curator of 20th Century art at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art, will officiate OCCCA's 10th annual juried show 
(to take place at its main location at 3621 MacCarther Blvd.) from July 18-Aug. 
17. Artists from the Western United States will be included. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally, a range of ethnic groups should be represented in "Cross Cultural 
Currents in O.C.," July 18-Aug. 3 at Rancho Santiago College Art Gallery. 
Artists in the multimedia exhibit, curated by local artist Emigdio Vasquez, 
have either worked or lived in Orange County. Summer gallery hours (from June 
11 to September) are Tuesdays, 6 to 8 p.m.; Wednesday through Friday, 10 a.m. 
to 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A list of summer arts and entertainment activities for children will appear in 
Wednesday's Calendar.

DIANNE KLEIN: ALLEGED MOLESTER KEEPS HIS PAST BEHIND A LEGAL WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Say you own a small business. One of your employees is stealing. You confront 
him and he leaves. The theft was relatively small, not worth the expense of a 
lawsuit. You consider yourself fortunate to be rid of a bad egg. 
</P>
<P>
A short while later another company calls you, checking on the guy's 
references. Do you mention the theft? 
</P>
<P>
My bet is that you don't. This time, your former employee could sue you -- 
perhaps for defamation of character or invasion of privacy or for preventing 
him from getting a new job. And even though the guy is a thief, a court of law 
has found him guilty of no crime. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts would advise you to keep your mouth closed. Even if you win, 
lawsuits cost money and time. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of thing happens time and again, the byproduct of an imperfect legal 
system that never protects everybody's rights all of the time. You stonewall, 
the guy gets a job, and then he steals again. Life stumbles on. 
</P>
<P>
Now change the facts of the case by several degrees, although the legal premise 
remains the same. 
</P>
<P>
A junior high school teacher, in the city of Orange, is arrested for felony 
child molestation. This actually happened in early 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office charges him, initially, with 41 counts. One of 
his female students, the prosecution contends, was repeatedly abused. 
</P>
<P>
I looked at the court files on this case. The prosecution's evidence was 
graphic and frightening. Included were obscene notes the defendant allegedly 
wrote to the victim about what he would like to do to her the next time around. 
</P>
<P>
The defense brought out its own heavy guns. Many character witnesses -- 
students, teachers and friends -- testified as to what a good guy this man 
really was. He was married, with two daughters of his own. The counts were 
reduced in a preliminary hearing, then later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
But the D.A.'s office felt strongly about the case. Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan 
Sturla filed again, this time on 32 counts. Three of those were later thrown 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Then a new deputy D.A. took over the prosecution and moved that the charges be 
dropped. The case was dismissed, if not quite closed. The prosecution felt the 
time and money involved just didn't justify any further ado. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Unified School District, however, wanted this guy out of its 
schools. The teacher, too, said he would rather be someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
A quiet agreement was worked out. The district bought out the remainder of his 
contract and agreed "not to disclose the reasons for the resignation, nor the 
facts surrounding the resignation." 
</P>
<P>
If potential employers called the district inquiring about its former employee, 
they were to be told that the resignation was voluntary, that the teacher left 
for personal reasons and that his performance evaluations were satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
This, really, is S.O.P. Attorneys have built careers around crafting just such 
terms. But is it right? That, for the most part, is what the courts avoid 
trying to find out. They are there to uphold the law, strictly according to 
code. 
</P>
<P>
I found out about this case because the alleged victim, now 24 years old, 
called me, quite upset. The man who was charged with molesting her is still 
teaching school, this time in Whittier. He has been for years. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents show that his employers in Whittier never checked with Orange 
Unified, not even to confirm that he had held his former job. 
</P>
<P>
Here's where the legal story picks up. The teacher, after being turned down for 
five jobs since Orange, sensed that there was something wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there anything you would like to tell me about your resignation from Orange 
Unified School District?" one Anaheim high school principal asked him during a 
follow-up interview. 
</P>
<P>
This, to the teacher, was the first red flag. Orange Unified officials, he 
later found out, were telling potential employers they weren't at liberty to 
discuss the "case" regarding his resignation and that they should contact the 
teacher if they wanted the details. 
</P>
<P>
Then the teacher called his former principal at home. He said he objected to 
the word case, which implied something taboo. According to court records, the 
principal suggested he "be a man . . . and tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think I'm guilty?" the teacher asked. The principal said that he didn't 
know. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have never let myself get into that situation," the principal said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're preventing me from getting a job," the teacher went on. 
</P>
<P>
"You have done that to yourself," came the reply. 
</P>
<P>
Bingo! The principal's words were all that the teacher needed to hear. He sued 
Orange Unified for breach of contract, after he had already accepted the 
Whittier job, and he won. 
</P>
<P>
An arbitrator awarded him $31,475 in December, 1988 -- $25,000 of that for 
emotional damages. The arbitrator called the principal's comments "outrageous, 
causing severe emotional distress of a substantial and enduring nature." 
</P>
<P>
I don't share the arbitrator's dismay. I am looking at this from another side. 
</P>
<P>
As a potential employer, I would want to know if a job applicant had been 
placed under arrest. As a parent, I would want to know if my daughter's teacher 
had been accused of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
But the law is the law, imperfect at best. The rights of a few trample the 
rights of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The arbitrator ruled that Orange Unified broke a legal agreement. Except now 
the school district, which says it did nothing wrong, has asked for a trial. It 
is scheduled for August. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher's lawyer told me that his client was satisfied with the 
arbitrator's award, but now that they will be going back to court they plan to 
"go for broke." 
</P>
<P>
The jury, he said, will undoubtedly be told about his client's arrest, but "I'm 
going to do everything I can to keep it out. It's irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
The district, meantime, plans to introduce evidence suggesting that its former 
employee was indeed guilty of molesting a child he was assigned to teach. The 
alleged victim who called me is expected to take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe that this man is still teaching," she said. "I wonder what he 
has done since. None of this makes sense. It's not right." 
</P>
<P>
But that's the law. I know -- we've all heard that before.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: ROAD EXPERT HITS ONE OF LIFE'S LITTLE BUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some call me Dr. Chuckhole. Others prefer simply Stick Shift. Whatever the 
moniker, I often suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous colleagues, all 
because I write a weekly question-and-answer column about traffic and 
commuting. It's dubbed "Street Smart" and appears Mondays in the Orange County 
edition. You've seen it. Some of you may have even read it. 
</P>
<P>
The good-natured ribbing from my peers hardly bothers me. Lord knows I deserve 
it. And along with the kidding come some serious queries about life on the 
roadway. One staffer wanted to know if an out-of-state ticket would catch up to 
him. Another asked me about a troublesome railroad crossing. Still another 
pestered me about when that darned car-pool lane is going to open. 
</P>
<P>
Warranted or not, it seems some of my colleagues view me as their trusty 
transportation consultant. Even my neighbors occasionally pop a question when 
I'm out front mowing the lawn. If I don't know the answer, I at least know 
where to get it. Ask good old Dr. Chuckhole. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the good doctor's reputation took a tumble. We're not 
talking malpractice, just a teensy-weensy oversight. And this one hit very 
close to home. 
</P>
<P>
I was talking with a county transportation official who happens to live a few 
blocks away from my house on the northern flank of Santa Ana. We were 
exchanging small talk when we got on the topic of the flood of commuters who 
chug through the neighborhood each day. I wasn't taking notes, but as I recall, 
the conversation went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
Transportation expert: "Well, things will get lighter when Caltrans closes the 
Flower Street off-ramp." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Chuckhole: "Flower Street off-ramp? What Flower Street off-ramp?" 
</P>
<P>
Expert: "You don't know about the Flower Street off-ramp? It's been there 
forever. Dumps cars right onto Flower." 
</P>
<P>
I could hear it in his voice, the sort of veiled derision saved for only the 
truly uninformed. I was, of course, aghast. Profoundly embarrassed. Humiliated. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Southern California, one must know one's off-ramps, especially around 
one's home. 
</P>
<P>
Clinging to the faint hope that the expert was mistaken, I set out to 
investigate. I pulled out my trusty jalopy and headed north on the freeway. 
Swinging south again, I steamed toward the moment of truth. Say it ain't so. 
</P>
<P>
It took several passes to find the proper route along the knot of overpasses, 
transition roads and cloverleafs. But, alas, it was true. There it was, a neat 
little slice of asphalt that conveniently slips traffic virtually into my back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery has been weighing on me ever since. Indeed, this has been the 
first time I've come clean. Admitting my faux pas will undoubtedly subject me 
to abuse from friends and colleagues. "Doc! Where have you been?" I can see 
them now, gleefully tittering in the corner, pointing my way. 
</P>
<P>
It was a humbling lesson. Never again would I assume to have mastered all the 
nooks and crannies of the Southland freeway system, let alone the streets 
outside my front window. 
</P>
<P>
But let's face it. I'm not alone. In this land of endless asphalt, keeping 
track of the twists and turns of the freeways and thoroughfares that make up 
our dizzying transportation network is downright impossible. Indeed, I surveyed 
several of my neighbors, and none but the most veteran residents had set a set 
of tires on the cursed Flower Street off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
Thank God Monday is a holiday. On Tuesday, I will return to work, tail between 
my legs and resume my duties as Orange County's transportation answer man. 
Perhaps by baring my soul I have compromised my hard-won credibility on traffic 
matters. Perhaps this sad little episode will have cost me my title. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a doctor no more. Call me Chuckhole.

STICKING AROUND FOR THE RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
FUND-RAISER: GARY STEWART BOARDED HIS POGO STICK FRIDAY, HOPING TO BREAK HIS 
WORLD RECORD OF 130,077 JUMPS. TWENTY HOURS LATER, HE HAD 177,737.

<P>
Gary Stewart of Cincinnati had a lot of ups and downs Friday and Saturday -- 
more than 170,000 of them. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, the world pogo-stick jumping champion, climbed aboard his custom-made 
stick outside of a Beach Boulevard Burger King at 2:37 p.m. Friday, determined 
to break his world record of 130,077 consecutive jumps. A little more than 20 
hours later -- shortly before 11 a.m. Saturday -- he jumped into the Guinness 
Book of World Records again with 177,737 repetitions. 
</P>
<P>
"My ankles are extremely sore," Stewart said from his hotel room Saturday 
night. "I have trouble walking -- steps kill me. But I'm happy about it." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, a medical student at the University of Cincinnati, set the record 
during a promotional fund-raiser to introduce actor Paul Newman's salad 
dressing to Burger King restaurants. Burger King pledged 10 cents for each of 
Stewart's jumps to Cities in Schools Inc., a nationwide dropout-prevention 
program. The pledge was matched by Newman and his company, Newman's Own Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart attributed his pogo-stick jumping success to his custom-made pogo 
stick, which he said was firmer than an ordinary stick and, because it didn't 
propel him too high into the air, allowed for more repetitions per minute. 
</P>
<P>
While Stewart was happy to break the record, he said he would have quit soon 
after reaching the 150,000-jump plateau -- his goal for Saturday's event -- had 
it not been for the restaurant promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a huge production," Stewart said. "It was orchestrated, and Burger 
King had something planned for 10:30 (a.m.), so I had to go until 10:30. I was 
dead by then. I was dying." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the charitable aspect of the event, Stewart said he had another 
motivation for attempting to break his record. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I did it in 1985, they put down my name (in the book) as Guy 
Stewart instead of Gary," he said. "When I went to the ceremony in New York, I 
talked to (Guinness Book of World Records author) Mr. (Ross) McWhirter, and he 
said they'd correct it, but they never did. That was a major reason I did it 
again. Being in the Guinness Book of World Records was my childhood dream." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said he was uncertain whether he would attempt to break the pogo-stick 
jumping record again, but added that he might try for a Guinness record in 
another category. 
</P>
<P>
"The record height for having a grape dropped into your mouth is 380 feet," he 
said. "Maybe I can do that."

Police said Jorge Sanchez Lua was looking for gasoline, not trouble, but he 
wound up with plenty of both. 
</P>
<P>
Around 2 a.m. Saturday, Lua was peacefully filling his tank at a station on 
West 19th Street when an angry man walked up and began berating Lua for no 
apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the man, known only as "Byron," had just been thrown out of a 
nearby bar for causing trouble and was still in a trouble mood. 
</P>
<P>
Byron had a one-gallon milk jug with him. He filled it with gasoline, then 
began pouring it onto Lua's car and tried to splash some on Lua himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Get back or else!" Byron shouted, and Lua complied. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Byron then took out a cigarette lighter and ignited the car. Before 
firefighters doused the flames, the car -- a 1983 Pontiac Firebird -- and part 
of the gasoline pump station were reduced to rubble. Lua was unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Byron walked away and disappeared, police said. If found, he will be arrested 
on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, they said.

BAYLOR COMES HOME AGAIN;

BASEBALL: MILWAUKEE BREWERS' HITTING COACH BECOMES THIRD MEMBER OF ANGELS' HALL 
OF FAME.

Don Baylor stood behind home plate at Anaheim Stadium Saturday and said it was 
still home, so many uniforms later. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it's happening and I'm in another uniform," he said in the 
hours before the Angels made him the third member of their Hall of Fame. "I 
always thought I'd be like Brian Downing or Bobby (Grich). We came here 
together in 1977." 
</P>
<P>
Grich, who became the first member of the Angels' Hall of Fame in 1988, was on 
the field to honor Baylor. Downing, nearing the end of his career, is still in 
an Angel uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor wore a suit, but after handshakes and hugs and an honorary first pitch 
-- a lob in the dirt to former teammate Downing -- Baylor put on No. 25 for the 
Milwaukee Brewers and spent the evening in the visitors' dugout, a hitting 
coach at 40. 
</P>
<P>
The home plate where Baylor had stood was his own plot of dirt in 1979, the 
year the Angels won their first division championship. It was also the year 
Baylor became the only Angel to be named MVP of the American League, the year 
he hit .296 with 36 homers and 139 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
It was home in 1982, when the Angels won the AL West again, only to blow a 2-0 
lead to the Milwaukee Brewers in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, it was at home plate in Anaheim Stadium that Baylor, then a member of 
the Boston Red Sox, hit a two-run homer off Mike Witt in the ninth inning of 
Game 5 of the League Championship Series. It became the prelude to the Angels' 
most wrenching failure to reach the World Series, after Dave Henderson's home 
run off Donnie Moore sent the game into extra innings and an eventual Boston 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys had a chance to go to the World Series, up three games to one," 
Baylor said. "I wanted to go to one, too." 
</P>
<P>
Some people thought Baylor's part in that game was a measure of revenge against 
Buzzie Bavasi, the former Angel general manager who had publicly criticized 
him, and who was content to let Baylor leave for the New York Yankees after the 
1982 season, failing to re-sign him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to stay here," he said. "It was bitter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Not bitter," he said, looking for another word, but not finding one. "I had 
ties here. I felt I was part of the community. I felt I was part of the 
building process with the Angels. It was very, very difficult for me to leave 
and go to New York." 
</P>
<P>
In the years since, he has gotten revenge in triplicate, going to the World 
Series in the final three years of his playing career with the Boston Red Sox, 
the Minnesota Twins and the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor said he has not spoken to Bavasi since 1982, expressing whatever 
feelings he has by his very restraint. 
</P>
<P>
While going through some personal belongings this winter, he found a letter 
Bavasi had written to him in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still sealed," Baylor said. 
</P>
<P>
It could be an apology, but Baylor said he does not wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a check for $2 million," he said, laughing. "I doubt it. . . . 
Maybe someone will open it in a hundred years." 
</P>
<P>
The mood Saturday was a sentimental, as Baylor joined Grich and Jim Fregosi in 
the Angels' Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Autry, the man Baylor called "the best owner in baseball" was there to 
call him a friend. Dave Winfield, his Yankee teammate and now the player meant 
to become the kind of clubhouse leader Baylor had been, was there to do the 
same, as was Grich. 
</P>
<P>
"When I come into this ballpark," Baylor said. "I still call this home."

HANSEN-DENT CELEBRATES SINGLES VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
After he hit one last unreturnable shot Saturday, Brett Hansen-Dent paused a 
moment, reached for the second ball in his pocket and belted it high and deep 
into the SeaCliff Tennis Club parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
It was a rare show of emotion for Hansen-Dent, a senior at Newport Harbor High 
School who takes carefully measured steps on a tennis court. There never seems 
to be room in his game for outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a time and place for celebration, and Hansen-Dent found it after 
defeating Ari Nathan of Brentwood, 3-6, 6-0, 6-3, to win the Southern Section 
singles title. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Hansen-Dent laughed when someone mentioned his home run ball. He 
acknowledged it was a dramatic break from his method of operation. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he defeated practice partner Jon Leach of Laguna Beach to win the 
Ojai Valley tournament's 18-and-under title last month, his calm demeanor never 
waivered. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of thought Ojai was bigger because all the colleges play there," said 
Hansen-Dent, whose father, Phil Dent, was once the fifth-ranked player in the 
world. "For high schools this was bigger. This is the real CIF." 
</P>
<P>
Winning the Southern Section title was something of a breakthrough for 
Hansen-Dent, who though he is older than Leach, has played in his friend's 
shadow. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until this year, my high school career was all right," Hansen-Dent said. 
"Now, it's really happening for me." 
</P>
<P>
In the first set, Nathan ran Hansen-Dent ragged, blistering one passing shot 
after another. 
</P>
<P>
"No one could have beaten him in that first set," Hansen-Dent said. "Not Leach. 
No one." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen-Dent maintained his composure and rallied, winning the second set 
easily. When he broke serve for the second set in a game that had seven deuce 
points and four set points, Hansen-Dent also seemed to have broken Nathan's 
spirit. Nathan didn't offer much resistence in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think I played much different," Hansen-Dent said. "He was just 
so hot. I just waited for him to cool down." 
</P>
<P>
When Nathan did, Hansen-Dent was ready to pounce. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen-Dent did not get a second shot at beating Leach this season. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan, down 4-1 in the third set, rallied to beat Leach, 5-7, 6-3, 7-5, in the 
semifinals Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Leach, a junior, had advanced to the final the past two seasons, winning as a 
freshman and losing last year. 
</P>
<P>
It was his last high school match. He will graduate early and begin classes in 
January at USC, where his father is the tennis coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny," Leach said. "My game is getting better each year, even though my 
record got worse. I'm improving. I think I'll be ready for college next year." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's Jason Harnett and Adam Jarrett, who began playing doubles together 
three weeks ago and only to qualify for the Southern Section tournament, won 
the title, 7-5, 7-6 (7-4), over Sean McKenna and Derek Shinden of Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Harnett, a senior, and Jarrett, a junior, played together they 
advanced to the quarterfinals of last year's Southern Section tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Thousand Oaks players) were a lot better than we expected," Harnett 
said. "We didn't think they'd be able to raise the level of their game that 
much."

MIRA COSTA SWEEPS PAST EDISON FOR TITLE

Edison High School's hopes for its first Southern Section 4-A boys' volleyball 
title went down quietly Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa ended Edison's 13-match winning streak with a 15-6, 15-12, 15-11 
victory at Marina High School. The championship was Mira Costa's second in the 
past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa (18-0) has handed Edison (17-2) its only defeats this season. The 
Mustangs won a five-game, three-hour match at Edison in March. 
</P>
<P>
But Edison did little Saturday night against the Mustangs, winners of 39 of 
their last 40 matches over the past two seasons and ranked No. 1 nationally by 
Volleyball Monthly. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't take us out of our game but they played extremely well," Edison 
Coach Brian Rofer said. "They put up a big block." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa Coach Mike Cook said the key to the Mustangs' easy victory was their 
blocking. The Mustangs had 27 blocks, including eight by Pat Ivie and seven by 
David Swatik. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference was we blocked tonight," Cook said. "We didn't have half as 
many blocks the first time we played Edison, and that one went five games 
instead of three." 
</P>
<P>
Swatik and Ivie also had seven kills each for Mira Costa. Steve Snyder had 11 
kills and Karl Van Reusen and Daryl Ayers had seven each for Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said the victory solidified his team's claim as the best high school 
volleyball team in history. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's just for one year," he said. "This isn't a dynasty. Laguna Beach 
won all those titles (five in the late 1970s and early '80s) but they didn't 
have a team like this." 
</P>
<P>
Rofer wasn't about to argue. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to say they're the best high school team ever," he said. "We have 
nothing to be ashamed of. Mira Costa just worked hard and played well." 
</P>
<P>
Edison, playing in its second final in the last five years, fell behind 5-0 and 
11-3 in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
Edison opened the second game with a 5-0 run, but Mira Costa rallied with an 
11-1 streak on four kills by Mark Shoptaw and three each by Ivie and Mike 
Ashenfelter. 
</P>
<P>
Edison came back to trim the deficit to 13-12, only to have Mira Costa win the 
game on consecutive hitting errors by Steve Snyder and Jason Curry. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers fell behind again early in the third game. Mira Costa raced to a 
6-1 lead, but Edison, sparked by three kills and a block by Snyder, fought back 
to tie it at 9-9. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa pushed ahead, 11-9, on a kill by Ashenfelter and an ace by Ivie, but 
Edison again rallied to tie it, 11-11. 
</P>
<P>
A kill by Swatik, a hitting error by Edison's Joe McCarthy and an ace by 
Ashenfelter gave Mira Costa a 14-11 lead. Brian Thurston's ace gave the 
Mustangs the game, match and championship.

ALLEGED BRUTALITY BY DEPUTIES COSTS COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: EXCESSIVE-FORCE LAWSUITS HAVE NEARLY DOUBLED IN RECENT YEARS. 
SHERIFF BLOCK STANDS BY DEPARTMENT POLICIES AND HIS OFFICERS.

A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy confronts a South Gate man at his home 
with an unpaid traffic ticket. A fight breaks out and the man is clubbed to 
death. The county settles the subsequent lawsuit for $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen deputies break up a family birthday party for a 15-year-old girl in 
Lynwood, and seven party-goers are injured. Five are charged with various 
crimes, but all charges are later dismissed. In settlement of their lawsuit 
against the county, 20 family members receive $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
A Newbury Park salesman suspected of drunk driving is stopped and clubbed by 
two Malibu Station sheriff's deputies. The motorist's legs are shattered. The 
county pays $500,000 to settle the salesman's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Violent encounters like these between Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and 
people they confront while on patrol have cost taxpayers millions of dollars 
and forced the department to repeatedly defend itself against allegations of 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, 151 excessive-force lawsuits were filed against the Sheriff's 
Department, a total estimated to be nearly double that of five years ago. Over 
a three-year period ending in September, 1989, such cases cost the county $8.5 
million in major settlements and jury awards, including a $1.75-million 
settlement last year, a Times review found. 
</P>
<P>
Some deputies are named repeatedly in such lawsuits, according to an 
examination of court records. Half the deputies involved in major cases had 
been sued in the past for alleged brutality. One training officer was sued 10 
times in 10 years. Another officer, later promoted to sergeant, was named in 
five suits that resulted in payments totaling about $280,000. 
</P>
<P>
Disputes over the use of force have strained relations between the Sheriff's 
Department and some of the neighborhoods it patrols. Leaders in the black, 
Latino, Korean, Samoan and gay communities have accused sheriff's officers of 
acts of unjustified violence, including five fatal shootings in the last 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, critics inside and outside the department complain that 
administrators have done little to identify abusive deputies and take them off 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
"We have deputies using a lot of force frequently," said former Sheriff's Lt. 
Patrick Maher, who retired in August after 23 years in the department and who 
now works as a consultant on peace-officer training. 
</P>
<P>
Maher, a veteran watch commander, said he complained to superiors for years 
that deputies routinely were striking suspects on the head with nightsticks and 
flashlights, which police training experts say should be done only in 
life-and-death situations. Maher argued in a 1986 memo that department policies 
were "insufficient to adequately direct deputies in the use of force and to 
prevent serious injury or death." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block said in interviews that department policies are adequate 
to prevent and punish the use of unnecessary force, and he dismissed Maher as a 
frequent complainer about departmental practices. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff attributed the rise in excessive-force lawsuits to an increasingly 
litigious and violent society. He said that inner-city problems such as gangs, 
drugs and random shootings have spread to outlying communities patrolled by his 
7,000-officer department. 
</P>
<P>
Block said deputies who are sued repeatedly are not necessarily guilty of 
misconduct. "We're not going to sacrifice deputies at the altar of public 
relations," said Block, a 34-year veteran who has headed the nation's largest 
sheriff's department since 1982. "We're going to deal with (complaints) as they 
arise." 
</P>
<P>
Excessive force has been a concern of the department, Block acknowledged, since 
a 1985 internal study cited it as one of several ethical problems that needed 
attention. The study led to a $300,000 program requiring every deputy to attend 
a daylong seminar on ethics, including techniques to avoid violent 
confrontations, Block said. 
</P>
<P>
Block also acknowledged that some violence-prone officers have been lured off 
the street with better jobs, such as coveted investigative or high-technology 
communications work. This, he said, has led other deputies to grumble, "Well, 
geez, I guess . . . you have to go out and get enough complaints" to get 
desirable jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But Block said the offending officers can seldom be fired because union 
agreements protect their jobs except in the most extreme cases. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Shinee, principal attorney for the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy 
Sheriffs, said most officers accused of excessive force are only responding to 
a rising level of violence against them. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally, you'll see somebody who may have overreacted or who lost his 
temper," Shinee said. "But by and large, those are folks out there on the 
streets in very trying circumstances fighting for their own survival." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department generally has enjoyed a reputation for even-handed law 
enforcement. But several high-profile encounters in the last year and a half 
have raised questions about deputies' use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, routine incidents have escalated into violence. The January 
shooting of two Black Muslims erupted after a traffic stop by deputies. One man 
was killed and another wounded after they allegedly attacked the deputies and 
took a gun from one officer, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Community activists reacted with angry protests. Block, noting the "heightened 
tensions," advised his officers against taking "enforcement action in minor 
incidents" in black neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Protests also arose when an unarmed black man was fatally shot in his own 
driveway by deputies who mistook him for a robbery suspect; when a videotape 
showed that a deputy responding to a noise complaint repeatedly clubbed a guest 
at a Samoan bridal shower; when, in the Antelope Valley, a black woman, a 
Latino man and an Asian student were fatally shot by deputies in separate 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident, a Korean student was shot to death in March, 1988, after a 
15-mile chase that began when he ran a stop sign. Deputies said he attempted to 
run them down; Long Beach police disputed that account. The county has offered 
his parents a $1-million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown rallies, civil rights groups have called for creation of an 
independent agency to investigate brutality claims. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sheriff's Department really needs to be put on the griddle," said attorney 
Thomas Barham in an interview. Barham, a former sheriff's lieutenant who now 
specializes in police misconduct cases, declared: "They are letting deputies go 
out into the community and beat people senseless and virtually nothing is 
happening to them." 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think the message is getting through (to deputies)," said Johnnie 
Cochran, a Los Angeles attorney who has represented both deputies and people 
who claim to be their victims. 
</P>
<P>
The department, he said, has failed to show that it is serious about punishing 
deputies for excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Sheriff Jerry L. Harper disagrees. "I don't think you're going to 
find any deputy who's going to say that . . . we are soft on discipline," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Barham said the department does not do an "honest and forthright job" of 
investigating brutality complaints. Investigators frequently do not ask even 
obvious questions if the answers might implicate deputies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors in a court case last July cast doubt on the department's credibility 
when they awarded an East Los Angeles man $106,000 in damages stemming from a 
1984 encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Chacon, then 25, suffered a fractured skull after Deputy Robert Armes hit 
him with his baton after a traffic stop. Armes said he struck Chacon because he 
refused to lie on the ground as ordered and raised his fist in a threatening 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon was hospitalized. Sheriff's investigators concluded that Armes had acted 
properly because Chacon -- who later pleaded no contest to being under the 
influence of PCP -- had posed a danger. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, after four years of litigation, a Superior Court jury rejected 
Armes' version of the events. 
</P>
<P>
"Our basic finding was that the deputy had used excessive force and there was a 
cover-up," said jury foreman Richard Hudson. "The police report was simply 
written in such a way to validate what they did. 
</P>
<P>
"Officers and witnesses who saw what happened were not mentioned in the report 
and, overall, there was a conspiracy by the county." 
</P>
<P>
Armes refused comment but his attorney, Carol Ann Rohr, said the officer pulled 
his baton because he smelled PCP on Chacon's breath and that "changes the 
amount of force that is reasonable." The deputy testified that he did not 
intend to hit Chacon on the head. 
</P>
<P>
Rohr said that the verdict has been appealed. 
</P>
<P>
One high-level source familiar with the department said misconduct 
investigations sometimes go nowhere because deputies are reluctant to testify 
against fellow officers, even those who may repeatedly use excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
"Deputies who get caught in that situation are hoping that the department knows 
how heavy-handed or prejudiced (his partner) is and . . . will do something 
about it," said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Some former 
sheriff's employees are even blunter. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Feliciano, a former sheriff's sergeant who ran against Block in the 1982 
election, has testified as an expert witness in several civil rights suits 
accusing deputies of brutality. Feliciano said that, as a deputy, he sometimes 
lied to department investigators in an effort to protect his partners. The 
practice, he said, was then commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Block, while disagreeing that an actual "code of silence" exists, said 
the department is addressing the issue in workshops. In those sessions, 
deputies have said that they are bothered by the acts of other officers but 
maintain silence because "they think they're out of step with everybody else," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're learning that there is a lower tolerance for misconduct than (they) 
may have thought," the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
County authorities agree that excessive-force lawsuits against the Sheriff's 
Department have increased -- but they blame overzealous attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a stepping up (in excessive-force filings)," said Robert S. 
Ambrose, chief of civil litigation for the county. "Attorneys are simply 
getting individuals to file lawsuits in the hopes that they are going to get a 
large award." 
</P>
<P>
Documenting the extent of the increase is difficult. The Sheriff's Department 
says it keeps no separate records of deputies who are sued for excessive force, 
or the outcome of those suits. 
</P>
<P>
Until two years ago, the department maintained a card file listing lawsuits of 
all kinds against deputies. But that was declared obsolete and abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Los Angeles County counsel's office is using a computer system to 
track lawsuits against deputies. But the system, in operation since last 
summer, does not separately tabulate suits charging excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the county estimate that about two-thirds of all suits filed 
against the Sheriff's Department in any given year involve excessive force. To 
test this estimate, The Times reviewed all lawsuits filed in 1989 against the 
department and found that 151, or 66%, of the 228 suits alleged excessive 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Applying the two-thirds rule of thumb to lawsuits in previous years, The Times 
estimated that excessive-force suits against the Sheriff's Department have 
about doubled in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
When The Times compared the Los Angeles Police Department's experience during 
1989, it found a far lower percentage of excessive-force lawsuits. Of 288 suits 
reviewed, 141, or 49%, claimed excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the city said they have no way of telling whether that percentage 
has changed from past years. But if the ratio has held constant, it would mean 
that the number of such suits against the Los Angeles Police Department has 
declined by an estimated 13% over the last five years. During that period, the 
Police Department has had about 1,000 more officers than the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The Times review also found that excessive-force lawsuits were filed against 
the Sheriff's Department last year at a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
About 22 such lawsuits were filed for every 1,000 deputies, while 18 were filed 
for every 1,000 Los Angeles police officers, according to court records and 
statistics from the county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
How the Sheriff's Department compares to other police agencies across the 
country is undetermined. Experts say there is no reliable way to make such 
comparisons because there is little useful data on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In its study, The Times found that excessive-force cases accounted for 
three-fourths of all major legal settlements and jury awards involving the 
Sheriff's Department over a three-year period ending in September, 1989. The 
major payouts from these excessive-force cases -- 61 in all -- ranged from 
$20,000 to $1.75 million, and totaled $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
There are other ways to measure the extent to which deputies may be using 
excessive force. But Block and his aides said they could not or would not 
provide the necessary data. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the department keeps records of general misconduct complaints 
filed by citizens and the department itself against deputies -- a requirement 
of state law. But these are not categorized or tracked in a way that would tell 
department administrators when a deputy is accumulating an unusual number of 
excessive-force complaints. 
</P>
<P>
When The Times attempted to review these records to determine how many involved 
excessive force, the Sheriff's Department refused to grant access. A spokesman 
said the records are confidential under state law. 
</P>
<P>
When asked for a simple tally of the number of misconduct complaints alleging 
excessive force in recent years, the department said it was unable to comply. A 
spokesman said no separate count is kept of such complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Even the question of how many deputies are disciplined each year for excessive 
force, and whether that number has increased or decreased, drew a blank. The 
department would not disclose the data, saying it was confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Some other California police departments -- including those in San Francisco 
and Oakland -- have experimented with computer programs that warn 
administrators when repeated complaints are filed against a single officer. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami-Dade Police Department has gone a step further, tracking not only 
complaints and lawsuits by computer, but also requiring officers to file 
reports when they use even minimal force in making arrests. A computer issues a 
warning whenever the totals reach two complaints or three uses of force over 
three months -- or four complaints and seven uses of force in a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department by reputation takes pride in 
putting aggressive deputies on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"(Suspects) know if they get lippy they're going to be taking some lumps," said 
a deputy who worked inner-city patrol for years. "It's just a general attitude 
indoctrinated from Day 1. . . . We don't take (anything) out on the street. And 
(supervisors) are proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
But critics of the department say the aggressive behavior too often leads to 
unnecessary force, souring community relations and embroiling the department in 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Some think that the case of Deputy Gary B. Hellman illustrates this style of 
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, Hellman, 49, was the silver-haired dean of patrol at the 
Norwalk Sheriff's Station, where he has served 17 of his 21 years on the force. 
An officer who actively seeks out criminals, he has been held up as a role 
model for younger deputies sent to him for field training. 
</P>
<P>
Hellman has been accused of excessive force in 12 lawsuits since 1972, 
including 10 suits in the last decade, according to court records. Six of the 
suits were dismissed and he was found not liable in the seventh. Four other 
suits have resulted in cash settlements totaling $160,500. One suit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Hellman has averaged one lawsuit every year and a half, about 30 times greater 
than the departmental average last year. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, Hellman was taken off patrol and assigned to assault investigations. 
At the time, he was being sued in federal court for allegedly kicking a young 
man and striking him with a baton. That civil trial ended with a hung jury and 
was settled in February for $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief hallway interview during the trial, Hellman said he is not overly 
aggressive, "but if taking control of a situation is aggressive, then I would 
count myself as aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Although refusing to discuss Hellman specifically, Assistant Sheriff Harper 
said he thinks that an aggressive officer "by being out there in a radio car 
for many, many years is going to have more opportunities" for abuse complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Such an officer, Harper said, "can still be rated outstanding and deemed worthy 
of a training officer." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some deputies with a history of abuse complaints or lawsuits end up 
getting promotions, according to interviews and county documents. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Robert Crume was sued seven times between 1975 and 1985 as a patrolman, 
but was promoted in 1986 to sergeant. Five of the suits ended in county payouts 
of about $280,000, including $110,000 to a Whittier man for two physical 
encounters four years apart. The other two cases were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
In a Crume case settled in 1986 for $35,000, the deputy struck a 17-year-old 
Pico Rivera youth trespassing in an unfinished house. Nightstick blows to the 
youth's abdomen resulted in removal of his spleen. 
</P>
<P>
County lawyers concluded that there was "sparse justification" for striking 
Jaime Silva. Silva was 5-feet-7 and weighed 150 pounds, while Crume and his 
partner were each about seven inches taller and 60 pounds heavier, county 
lawyers noted in recommending the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Crume did not respond to a request for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Block said that as a matter of policy, he would not comment on any individual 
case. 
</P>
<P>
When misconduct complaints are upheld by the department, the punishment usually 
ranges from a reprimand to suspension. Firings are far less frequent. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Brian J. Stover, for example, drew a seven-day suspension without pay 
for an incident that grew out of a traffic stop in June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Civil Service records give this account of the episode: 
</P>
<P>
Stover pulled over a Jeep after the driver made an illegal turn outside a 
Temple City gym. The vehicle had no license plates and the driver, Robert 
Nelson, had no valid driver's license or car registration. 
</P>
<P>
When Stover attempted to pat him down, Nelson pushed the deputy's hand away. 
Stover drew his revolver, pointed it at Nelson, told him to sit down, then 
kicked him. As a crowd gathered, Stover tried to handcuff Nelson, who pulled 
his hand away. Stover hit him with his baton, handcuffed him and continued to 
club him. 
</P>
<P>
At his Civil Service hearing, the 5-foot-7 Stover said he acted out of fear for 
his safety against Nelson, a body-builder who stood over six feet tall. But the 
hearing officer said that while Nelson was "not cooperative, at most, he was 
passively resistant." 
</P>
<P>
Although Nelson suffered only minor injuries in the incident, department 
officials concluded that Stover's use of force was unjustified. And they 
disclosed that the deputy previously had been counseled about angering people 
to such a degree that he felt compelled to use force against them. 
</P>
<P>
Stover declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Firings for abusive behavior sometimes become a prolonged process, as 
illustrated by the case of Deputy Ricki L. Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
When the Sheriff's Department moved to fire Jackson in 1988, it accused the 
seven-year veteran of beating a handcuffed man with his flashlight outside a 
Santa Fe Springs bar and striking another bound suspect so hard that a rib was 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
The department noted that Jackson already had been suspended three times over a 
five-year period for excessive force -- twice for assaults on motorists and 
once for abusing a county jail inmate. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until 1989, after a series of county Civil Service Commission 
hearings, that his firing was upheld. Now, the two injured men and a bystander 
who was arrested and then released are demanding damages. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my clients' biggest concerns is, what was Jackson doing out there on 
patrol when he already had a history of (excessive force)?" said attorney 
Michael Portner, who is representing the three. 
</P>
<P>
The county has offered his clients a $105,000 settlement, Portner said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's attorney, Richard Shinee, argued in Civil Service documents that 
other deputies who committed similar offenses were merely suspended, and it was 
unfair to fire Jackson. To prove his point, he produced copies of disciplinary 
letters sent by the department to half a dozen other deputies. They included: 
</P>
<P>
* A deputy suspended for 10 days in 1988 for hitting a theft suspect in the 
face and chest with a flashlight and kicking him while he was on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
* A deputy suspended for seven days in January, 1988, after he repeatedly 
stomped on the ankle of a Central Jail inmate who was being restrained by five 
other deputies. 
</P>
<P>
* A deputy suspended for 10 days in June, 1985, for using excessive force after 
stopping a suspected car thief. The deputy pulled the man's hair, bloodied his 
nose and arrested him for obstructing and resisting a police officer. The 
deputy at first denied using excessive force, then recanted after learning that 
a security camera had captured the incident on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
The most powerful sanction against deputies accused of excessive force is 
criminal prosecution. In Los Angeles County, it happens only rarely. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, said Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner in an interview, is the level of proof 
required. 
</P>
<P>
"An officer may have been negligent, may have been acting, as they say, out of 
policy . . . and, yes, the result can be wrong as well as tragic, but as a 
matter of law, it is not a crime," Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence needed to uphold departmental charges against a deputy is much 
less than that required to support a criminal prosecution, Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in the last four years, the Sheriff's Department has referred 26 
excessive-force cases to Reiner's office for review; five of them have been 
prosecuted. During the same period, the Los Angeles Police Department referred 
36 cases; three have been prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner refused to discuss the specifics of any case rejected for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
But the 1984 beating death of a 54-year-old security guard from South Gate may 
illustrate the balancing act that prosecutors say they face in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Thomas Kirk traced William Sisoyev to his home and confronted him with 
an unpaid traffic ticket. A fight erupted, and Kirk repeatedly struck Sisoyev 
with a short, leather-covered baton called a sap, breaking his skull and 
killing him. 
</P>
<P>
After a six-month investigation, a deputy district attorney, declaring his 
decision "a close" call, said he could not disprove Kirk's claim that he had 
acted in self-defense. But the prosecutor's report noted that Kirk was unmarked 
and there was little sign in the dead man's home to indicate that a violent 
brawl had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
The county closed its books on the Sisoyev case last June, paying his survivors 
$150,000 to settle their lawsuit against the Sheriff's Department. Kirk has 
since left the department. 
</P>
<P>
Victims of excessive force, by contrast, often are charged with crimes -- only 
to be cleared later when independent witnesses contradict the testimony of 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
In The Times' study of excessive-force cases that led to large payouts by the 
county, most of the victims were initially charged with criminal violations. 
The charges, based primarily on assertions in police reports, usually involved 
resisting arrest or assault on an officer. But the majority of defendants 
ultimately were cleared. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, for example, the county paid $57,500 to settle lawsuits filed by a 
Bellflower husband and wife beaten by deputies during a ruckus outside a City 
of Commerce restaurant. The husband, Charles Porter, 58, was charged with 
assault but acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
Porter said he never had been accused of anything more serious than a traffic 
violation until that day. He was preparing to leave the restaurant, on his way 
to his Moose lodge in Norwalk, when deputies arrived in response to a robbery 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies told Porter not to leave. Porter said that when he asked how long 
he would be detained, the deputy responded by angrily cursing him. He said that 
when he objected to the deputy's use of profanity, he was struck in the face 
with a nightstick, knocked to his knees and clubbed 16 times. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies testified that he was struck no more than six times and then only 
after a struggle of several minutes. Porter said he offered no resistance. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Georgia, said deputies hit her in the back with nightsticks after she 
threw herself across her husband's body. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery turned out to be a false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to paying the Porters a settlement, the county also paid $12,500 to 
a witness who remembers screaming, "Stop those animals! They're going to kill 
him!" while trying to get other deputies to intervene. The witness was jailed 
briefly and later sued the county for false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Porter said the experience changed his view that peace officers rough up only 
street criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's plain people, too," he said. "All they have to do is open up their mouths 
the wrong way, say the wrong thing or make the wrong move, and they can get in 
just as much trouble as I did." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STORIES BEHIND THE PAYOUTS 
</P>
<P>
Wilma Franklyn, 55, was shot in the stomach during a 1981 narcotics raid on her 
60-acre ranch in Lake Sherwood. She claimed that deputies broke into her home 
unidentified, shot at her and finally fired dozens of rounds into a closet 
where she cowered. Officers said she fired first and continued shooting from 
the closet. She testified that she was dragged from the closet by her heels. 
Deputies found a drug operation at the ranch, but Franklyn was not linked to 
it. Jury award of about $2.4 million, then settlement of $1.75 million in July, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Whealon, a Newbury Park salesman, was clubbed after being stopped for 
suspected drunk driving by Malibu Station Deputies Lewis Scott McAfee and 
Ronald Raul Gomez. Whealon's legs were shattered. Both deputies were accused of 
undue force in three other incidents during the same four-month period in 1984, 
including the fatal shooting of an unarmed man that was settled for $40,000. 
McAfee has left the force. Settled for $500,000 in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Asmirez Ramirez of Duarte was shot twice in the stomach when Deputies George 
Markel and Joseph Gagliardi stormed into his garage in 1986 after reports of 
gunfire at the house. Deputies said they accidentally wounded Ramirez, who was 
unarmed, while shooting at another man who pointed a gun at them. Jury award of 
$450,000 -- an amount reduced to $150,000 by the judge. Settled in December, 
1988, for $228,000 after an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
O. Z. McGowan, 74, was wounded after he shot at a deputy who entered his 
bedroom during an early morning SWAT raid of the wrong house in 1983. McGowan's 
4-year-old grandson was in bed with him. McGowan's daughter told investigators 
she was threatened and insulted racially while handcuffed in her nightclothes 
on her front lawn. Settled for $250,000 in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
William Randall, a former movie studio grip, was allegedly kicked by Deputy 
Chester Mitchell for not promptly following instructions during a 1982 traffic 
stop in Marina del Rey. Randall had six back surgeries and was permanently 
disabled from injuries. Settled for $500,000 in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Curiel and 19 family members and friends sued the county after 12 deputies 
broke up a quinceanera birthday celebration in 1985 for a 15-year-old girl in 
Lynwood. Seven party-goers claimed medical expenses of $15,000. Five of six who 
were arrested were criminally charged, but charges later were dismissed by the 
trial judge. Settled for $225,000 in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
David Ferguson of Carson was punched and clubbed by Deputy Julian Castorena in 
1981 after he called 911 asking for help in a family dispute. Ferguson suffered 
a fractured skull and brain hemorrhages that resulted in epileptic seizures. 
Officers said he was drunk, his phone calls were blocking emergency lines and 
that he resisted arrest. Settled for $325,000 in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell Vance Jr. of Whittier was doing carpentry work on a house in the Athens 
area near Inglewood in 1985 when Deputy Steven Jaramillo followed a fleeing car 
thief into the home. Vance, mistaken for the thief's accomplice, was struck and 
kicked for allegedly resisting arrest. Injuries included broken ribs and a 
ruptured spleen. Settled for $55,500 in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
John Bradley, 24, was shot twice in 1985 when Industry Station Deputies Harold 
Chilstrom and Dennis Robinson, on a narcotics stakeout at a Rowland Heights 
motel, charged his car and opened fire with shotguns and revolvers. The 
officers wounded the unarmed man as he dove toward the floor of his car. 
Settled for $120,000 in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Jeong Wook Byun, a 22-year-old student and son of a South Korean movie 
director, claimed he was repeatedly kicked and beaten by Deputy Michael Duran 
at a Marina del Rey restaurant in 1986. Byun said he was an innocent bystander 
who was struck because of his nationality. Deputies had responded to complaints 
of an unruly crowd that included Koreans. Jury award of $65,000 in February, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
John and Gail Quesenberry of La Verne and their 14-year-old daughter were 
returning from church during the Christmas holidays in 1984 when stopped for 
alleged erratic driving. They claimed that, after an exchange of words, Deputy 
Ed Teel threatened John Quesenberry with a nightstick, then flung his wife into 
the street, breaking her tailbone. Teel said that he pulled his baton for 
defensive purposes when Quesenberry refused to sign a traffic ticket and to be 
handcuffed. The couple were acquitted of assault and resisting arrest charges. 
Settled for $30,000 in September, 1986.

80,000 AFRIKANERS LAUNCH WHITE 'FREEDOM STRUGGLE' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The frightened, the angry and the bitter gathered in their tens of thousands on 
the grassy slopes of Afrikanerdom's holiest shrine Saturday to launch a white 
"freedom struggle" against the government for betraying the Afrikaner heritage. 
</P>
<P>
As families nibbled at picnic lunches, lovers held hands and older folks teased 
their grandchildren, one man raised a handmade cardboard sign that seemed to 
speak for the assembled masses: "Viva Witman" -- "Long Live the White Man." 
</P>
<P>
"We whites are here to stay. We are here to fight," said Adriaan du Preez, a 
58-year-old machinist. "We have no problem with the black, the Indian, the 
(mixed-race) Colored. It's this government we've got a problem with." 
</P>
<P>
About 80,000 Afrikaners, descendants of the first white settlers of South 
Africa, turned out at the Voortrekker Monument in a significant show of support 
for the right-wing Conservative Party, which favors continued apartheid and a 
separate homeland for Afrikaners. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the conservatives have gained support among whites who oppose 
President Frederik W. de Klerk's rapid reforms and his willingness to speak 
with the African National Congress and its ally, the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, the object of their disdain, stepped off a plane in Johannesburg 
earlier Saturday after an 18-day journey to European capitals that was widely 
praised for opening doors long closed to South African leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa's pride has been restored," De Klerk said. He added that the 
positive response to his reform initiatives from European leaders suggests that 
the days of South Africa's economic and diplomatic isolation are coming to a 
close. 
</P>
<P>
"A substantial change in the relations between Europe with South Africa will 
come soon," De Klerk told about 1,000 people at the airport to welcome him 
home. "And through Europe, the international community will follow." 
</P>
<P>
ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela, meanwhile, told 60,000 blacks in a 
township west of Pretoria on Saturday that the Conservative Party is fomenting 
white opposition to peaceful solutions, and he urged whites to support De 
Klerk's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
But Mandela said he is unhappy with the slow pace of reform and he said he 
would soon be making his own journey to Europe to urge heads of state to 
continue sanctions until De Klerk takes irreversible steps to end apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's reform plans and his talks with Mandela and the ANC are under attack 
by the growing numbers and increasing militancy of right-wing whites. Clashes 
between far-right extremists and blacks in the mining town of Welkom in recent 
weeks could spread to other conservative towns in South Africa, political 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the liberal Human Rights Trust Monitor found that 
more than 50% of all Afrikaners, who themselves account for about half of the 5 
million whites in South Africa, now support the Conservative Party. And the 
poll indicated that between 9% and 13% of the ruling National Party's support 
has swung to the Conservatives since the last election. 
</P>
<P>
National Party leaders maintain, however, that they have more than made up for 
that drain by gains from the liberal white Democratic Party, which has 
supported all of De Klerk's reforms. Together, the National and Democratic 
parties collected 75% of the vote in last September's elections. 
</P>
<P>
The right-wing gathering in Pretoria coincided with the anniversary of the 
National Party's 1948 victory, which ushered in the legal system of apartheid. 
The Conservative Party was formed in the early 1980s after a split with the 
National Party over the first steps of reform. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Party leader Andries Treurnicht made a ceremonial journey to the 
rally on horseback Saturday, stopping to place floral wreaths at the foot of 
several Afrikaner monuments. He arrived to cheers at the Voortrekker Monument, 
a stone edifice that commemorates an Afrikaner "pact with God" that allowed a 
band of settlers to defeat a much larger Zulu force in 1838. 
</P>
<P>
Treurnicht, a theologian, said God "had divided people into separate lands" 
because he expected them to live apart. And he said the talk of "togetherness, 
harmony and fellowship among the races is not the true meaning of the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
Treurnicht also said his party would use "the constitutional road" to fight the 
government, and he outlined a political strategy that includes a petition to 
force De Klerk to call new elections, a party membership drive and an effort to 
win an upcoming election to fill a vacant parliamentary seat. 
</P>
<P>
Treurnicht also called on moderate black leaders, such as Zulu Chief Mangosuthu 
Gatsha Buthelezi, "to stand with us against the terrorism of the ANC and its 
Communist allies." 
</P>
<P>
The Conservative leader stopped short of encouraging right-wing violence, but 
he criticized the government for "integrationist, abdication politics" and 
warned De Klerk "not to force our people to stand in the road so you have to 
run us over." 
</P>
<P>
If the government thwarts the Conservatives' efforts, he said, Afrikaners will 
be forced to resort to the tactics of black revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Rebellion is allowed if you're a proud people," Treurnicht said. "And this is 
our fatherland. You haven't got enough jails to hold the Afrikaner nationalists 
captive." 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives have an uneasy relationship with militant right-wing groups, 
such as the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, or AWB, which has been arming and 
training its members to fight any attempt to take Afrikaner land. 
</P>
<P>
Far-right groups have in recent weeks mounted vigilante patrols in Welkom and 
other communities, and several blacks have been killed. A few days ago, 
suspected far-right extremists triggered an explosion at a Pretoria museum 
where the Boera(Afrikaner farmer) republics surrendered to the British in 1902 
after the Anglo-Boer war. 
</P>
<P>
At the rally Saturday, AWB members carrying their flag, which bears a 
swastika-like insignia, attempted to join a procession of Afrikaner flags. But 
the flag-bearers were turned back by apologetic Conservative Party officials, 
who said only flags of the old Boer republics were allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was mostly peaceful, with a choir singing Afrikaner folk songs, 
merchants dispensing soft drinks and traditional Afrikaner dishes and hawkers 
selling T-shirts bearing the words: "The Boer Is Here to Stay." 
</P>
<P>
An American black reporter was turned away from the rally by angry whites, one 
of whom hurled a rock that missed. A police officer on duty suggested the 
reporter leave, saying he could not guarantee her safety. 
</P>
<P>
Many whites at the rally said they were alarmed by the beginning of 
negotiations with the ANC, which represents most of the black majority of 27 
million. And they fear that a black government is not far away. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll just give everything away to the blacks," said Arthur Nicolls, a 
44-year-old civil servant. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't hate blacks," added Adriaan du Preez. "We are Westernized. We are 
Christians. We aren't aggressive people. We are civilized people. And we want 
to stay in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"But when threatened we will respond," Du Preez said. "That's as sure as the 
heaven beyond the sun." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch-descended Afrikaners' most important holiday, the Day of the Vow, 
commemorates Dec. 16, 1838, when a band of frightened white farmers, heavily 
outnumbered by Zulu warriors, circled their 64 wagons and promised to set the 
day aside to praise God if they emerged victorious. So much blood was spilled 
in the battle that the place was named Blood River. The victory was crucial to 
the Great Trek, the mass journey of Afrikaner rebels from the Cape Colony and 
British rule. The survivors settled in what later became the Boer republics of 
the Orange Free State and the Transvaal.

GORBACHEV'S WOES TO SHAPE SUMMIT; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: PRESIDENT BUSH MAY WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON OLDER ARMS CONTROL ISSUES, 
BUT THE TROUBLED SOVIET LEADER'S INTERNAL AGENDA COULD BE MORE PRESSING.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marking a watershed between the Cold War and post-Cold War eras, this week's 
U.S.-Soviet summit will have a two-part agenda: It will cover "old" business, 
especially arms control, and "new" business, particularly the shape of a more 
unified Europe. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's first priority will be to focus on the old issues. "We want to 
get these deals finalized," he said of agreements made in the strategic arms 
reduction talks (START) and other arms negotiations. "I don't want to have two 
ships pass in the night." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's priorities may be overshadowed, however, by internal developments in the 
Soviet Union -- Lithuania's drive for independence and President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's reluctance to undertake radical economic reforms in the face of 
increasing social unrest. 
</P>
<P>
"Serious instability in the Soviet Union is much more thinkable than it was six 
months ago," when Bush and Gorbachev last met, a senior Administration official 
said. Specifically, summer strikes could ex acerbate the increasing ethnic 
battles, hoarding and struggles for independence, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"To a degree that we have never seen before, this summit and U.S.-Soviet 
relations are affected by preoccupations by Soviet domestic affairs," the 
official argued. 
</P>
<P>
Even the personal rapport between Bush and Gorbachev may have changed since 
their Malta meeting in December. Asked whether their relationship had cooled, 
Bush said last week: "I'll have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
The new circumspection reflects both uncertainty about Gorbachev's true 
situation and a division within the Administration over a fundamental question 
of strategy: While all agree that Bush is heading into this summit holding the 
best hand of cards of any recent U.S. President in a meeting of this kind, some 
U.S. officials think he should now distance himself from the Kremlin leader and 
begin embracing some of Gorbachev's opponents, who favor faster democratization 
and economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
For this summit, at least, the President's answer is "not yet." Bush will 
continue to link U.S. interests with the success of Gorbachev's perestroika 
program of political and economic restructuring, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the single most important 
priority of this week's summit will be to break the impasse over slashing 
conventional forces in Europe (referred to as CFE) -- the armed forces of the 
Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- that have faced each 
other across the Iron Curtain for 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets appear to be having second thoughts about the CFE reductions, which 
call for roughly four times as many cuts by the Warsaw Pact as by the NATO 
alliance. They also are beginning to balk at a proposed requirement that any 
discarded equipment -- more than 100,000 tanks and other weapons on the Soviet 
side -- be destroyed rather than just withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
"Those CFE negotiations were begun two years ago, a vastly different time -- on 
a different planet, almost -- before the Warsaw Pact and the entire Soviet 
position in East Europe collapsed," one Administration analyst said. "The 
Soviets have to convince themselves, or be convinced, that they will be better 
off with a treaty than without it. It will be a close call whether they buy it 
(the CFE treaty) now." 
</P>
<P>
Difficult as it may be for him to accept, Gorbachev's willingness to go ahead 
with the CFE treaty is seen by Washington as the "litmus test of Soviet 
intentions" for the new Europe. If Moscow refuses to go forward with the deal, 
it will "send a bad signal," Bush told a news conference here last week. 
</P>
<P>
But the bargaining is not going easily. Earlier this month, Baker took Moscow a 
package of ideas for resolving outstanding CFE issues and offered to present 
them to NATO to use as the basis for alliance-wide proposals for the talks. The 
Soviets showed no interest. 
</P>
<P>
According to one official, Bush will tell Gorbachev that completion of a CFE 
accord is the "fundamental precondition" for moving ahead on proposals that the 
Soviets want, ranging from an all-European summit and a push toward a 
European-wide security system to cuts in NATO short-range nuclear weapons in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't expect Gorbachev to compromise on the spot on aircraft, tanks and the 
other categories," the official said. "And he'll say we understand Soviet 
concerns and are prepared to seek reasonable compromises. But what he wants is 
a new impetus given to the negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Closely linked to conventional force cuts is the question of where a newly 
united Germany will fit. Bush hopes to persuade Gorbachev that a reunified 
Germany should remain a member of NATO, within its integrated command 
structure, as the best way to control the powerful new state emerging in the 
center of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev opposes participation by a unified Germany in NATO's military 
structure and wants to place a ceiling on German military strength before 
unification takes place. He also wants a breathing space of several years 
before the Soviets must withdraw their forces from East Germany. And the 
Soviets want major economic help from West Germany as part of the price for 
accepting East Germany's absorption by the West. 
</P>
<P>
A second set of summit issues will deal with completion of the bilateral arms 
agreements that have been under negotiation for so long. Although some key 
issues remain outstanding, the two leaders are expected to announce agreement 
on the fundamental principles of the START nuclear treaty. The accord, which 
calls for cutting the offensive nuclear arsenals of the two nations by 
one-third to one-half over the next seven years, should be ready for signing 
before year's end. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev also will initial an agreement to begin dismantling their 
chemical weapon arsenals -- although details on verification must still be 
worked out. They also will sign protocols that should bring into force two old 
treaties limiting the power of underground nuclear weapon tests. 
</P>
<P>
Third on the agenda will be regional or Third World issues, such as ending the 
conflict in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Baker said, will be "the area of human rights and democratization" -- 
a much-broadened category that enables the United States to bring up not just 
emigration and the plight of political prisoners but also Baltic independence 
and demands for greater autonomy by Soviet republics. These are issues that 
Moscow could otherwise contend are strictly internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Baker predicted that Bush will spend "a good bit of time" discussing Lithuania, 
Latvia and Estonia, "emphasizing that their right to self-determination cannot 
be denied." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also will seek to go over the economic situation in the Soviet Union, 
which U.S. experts believe is on the brink of serious decline -- certain to get 
worse before it gets better. 
</P>
<P>
Ed A. Hewett, a Brookings Institution expert who briefed Bush on the Soviet 
economy last week, blames Gorbachev for five wasted years of inadequate 
reforms. The Soviet leader is finally facing up to the need for a coherent 
program, he said, but meanwhile "the population has lost faith in the 
leadership's ability to do anything well." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the formal agenda items, what is being called "the flavor of the summit" 
will be affected primarily by Lithuania and the growing political and economic 
turmoil inside the Soviet Union. Lithuania's March 11 declaration of 
independence is fast replacing Jewish emigration as perhaps the most rancorous 
issue in U.S.-Soviet relations. Under pressure from Baltic supporters here, key 
members of Congress have told the White House that most-favored-nation (MFN) 
trading status for Moscow would be "a hard sell" as long as Gorbachev bullies 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gorbachev's retrenchment on domestic reforms may be an even more 
significant factor in deciding whether U.S.-Soviet relations will deteriorate 
in the future. With the outlook worsening daily, the Administration is coming 
under increasing pressure to begin distancing itself from Gorbachev on other 
issues as well. Hard-liners argue that Gorbachev's train has run out of steam 
and that more democratic forces among Gorbachev's critics in the Soviet Union 
deserve added American support. 
</P>
<P>
The question now is not whether Gorbachev will last, one senior Administration 
analyst said, but "can he stay relevant?" And, he added, "Can he manage what 
he's unleashed?" 
</P>
<P>
The debate within the Administration has surfaced publicly in comments by 
non-government experts on Soviet affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have too many eggs in one basket," complained Dmitri Simes, a Soviet 
specialist at the Carnegie Endowment. He compared the Administration's 
"friendly obsession" with Gorbachev just as the Soviet leader is losing ground 
at home to U.S. support for Egypt's late President Anwar Sadat a decade ago 
just before Sadat, who made peace with Israel, was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
Simes said the United States, by identifying closely with Gorbachev, is losing 
credibility with Soviet political forces that are demanding more democracy and 
free-market reforms than Gorbachev is proposing. And, Simes added, it is also 
losing credibility with the Lithuanians and other ethnic groups seeking 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
But others point out that, if the United States switched support to national 
independence movements and more radical democratic forces in the Soviet Union, 
American policy could become hostage to a long, bitter and possibly bloody 
process now under way there -- one that is far more important to the Kremlin 
than the dissidents and refuseniks of the 1970s ever were.

'GREAT LAW OF PEACE' LOST IN INDIAN GAMBLING FEUD

ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A voice squawks over a walkie-talkie at the headquarters of the Mohawk Warriors 
Society: "Tommy just got arrested." 
</P>
<P>
Stopped at one of the New York State Police roadblocks that dot the sprawling 
reservation at the U.S.-Canadian border, the Warriors Society member is being 
held on a warrant for smuggling cigarettes into Canada. 
</P>
<P>
His fellow Warriors are angry but not about to confront the well-armed troopers 
occupying the reservation. "We can wait," one says. "We've been here forever. 
We'll be here when they leave." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have been the focal point of tensions here for 10 months, ever 
since they drove off legions of FBI agents and troopers trying to raid the 
warehouse-sized gambling casinos that line Route 37, the two-lane highway 
through the 14,000-acre American part of the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
And since two men died in a shoot-out between the Warriors and anti-gambling 
forces May 1, the Warriors have been trying to live down allegations that they 
are an intimidating, vigilante police force -- "thugs and terrorists," in the 
words of one tribal official. 
</P>
<P>
"They call us smugglers, they call us drunkards, they call us dope addicts, 
they call us a cult," says the group's war chief, Francis Boots, "but that's 
all a slick propaganda campaign against the Warriors Society." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Warriors are the true keepers of the tribe's centuries-old "Great 
Law of Peace," he says, defenders of the sacred homeland against "external 
governments whose hands are still stained with the blood of our people." 
</P>
<P>
Even their fiercest critics admit that the militant sovereignty stance of the 
group has drawn dozens, perhaps hundreds, of converts on a reservation with a 
history of activism and Indian pride. 
</P>
<P>
"Who do you think took care of Custer?" asks a burly ironworker who calls 
himself Joe Warrior. "Them were warriors." 
</P>
<P>
The St. Regis Reservation -- most residents call it Akwesasne -- "Land Where 
the Partridge Drums" -- has long been a place of political turmoil. Straddling 
the St. Lawrence River, it falls not only in two countries, but in two Canadian 
provinces and two New York counties. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the complex internal political scene. Many tribes have two 
competing governments -- an elected regime recognized by outside authorities 
and a traditional one that claims authority through age-old custom. But here 
there are elected councils on both the Canadian and New York sides of the 
reservation, as well as "longhouse" chiefs who would restore the tribe's 
traditional values. They claim authority over the entire reservation through 
their appointment by "clan mothers." 
</P>
<P>
On top of that comes the Warriors Society, which does not recognize the 
authority of any of the other three entities. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is," says Francis Boots, "we have too many chiefs around here and 
not enough Indians." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors trace their modern roots to an incident in 1968 that provided an 
emotional moment of unity for the reservation. Angered by a Canadian ruling 
that they were not exempt from paying duties on goods carried across the 
border, Mohawks led by Mike Mitchell -- now "grand chief" of the Canadian 
council -- blockaded the international bridge leading to Cornwall, Ontario. 
Forty-eight were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, a 26-year-old tribal member, Richard Oakes, spearheaded the 
takeover of Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay by Indians from across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, about 100 armed men from the St. Regis reservation occupied land in 
Upstate New York that they claimed had been stolen from the tribe. A three-year 
standoff ended only after mediation by Mario M. Cuomo, then New York's 
secretary of state and now its governor, when the Indians agreed to accept 
another parcel of land. 
</P>
<P>
"It all (the modern Warriors Society) started Dec. 9, 1968, when the Mohawk 
people stood up for their right to travel" at the international bridge, said 
Boots. 
</P>
<P>
But in the current dispute, pitting Mohawk against Mohawk, Mike Mitchell is 
Boots' enemy -- a leader of the faction that sees gambling, and the Warriors, 
as the ruin of the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the most dangerous type of terrorists," says Doug George, another of 
the anti-gambling leaders. "They know how to disguise their criminal activity 
behind a cloak of patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
The casinos divided the reservation from the moment they started popping up 
along Route 37 in the mid-1980s, their slot machines and blackjack tables 
drawing thousands of customers each day from Ottawa and Montreal, both within a 
two-hour drive. 
</P>
<P>
Although the gambling houses never were approved by any of the tribal councils 
and were declared illegal by federal and state officials, many residents 
welcomed the money and jobs they brought. The anti-gambling Indians complained 
that the casinos attracted unsavory investors and compromised tribal values. 
One bingo hall operator in turn dismissed traditionalist opposition as "phony 
Indian beads-and-braids bull. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Last July, the dispute escalated well beyond words after the FBI and state 
police raided the largest casino, Tony's Vegas International, removing 
truckloads of slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
Decrying the "invasion," the Warriors, some wearing masks, began guarding 
entrances to the American part of the reserve. State police -- clearly seeking 
to avoid a bloody confrontation such as the one that took two lives in 1973 at 
the village of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge reservation of the Sioux in South 
Dakota -- decided to pull back. 
</P>
<P>
In the months following, the Warriors -- left, in effect, in control of the 
U.S. side -- clashed repeatedly with anti-gambling residents and the 14-member 
Akwesasne Mohawk Police, who operate on the Canadian part of the reservation. 
The nighttime echo of automatic weapons became a regular part of life. Cars 
were rammed. Bullet holes in the sides of homes and vehicles became almost 
badges of honor for some Mohawks. 
</P>
<P>
On March 23, the anti-gambling Indians set up roadblocks on Route 37 to stop 
the buses and cars carrying bettors to the casinos. During the weeks after 
that, there was a series of tense skirmishes with the barricades being torn 
down, then put up again by the opposing sides. Finally armed Warriors set up 
their own roadblock at an intersection on a road leading from the Canadian 
side. The windows of several cars and a school bus were smashed there. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-gambling forces retreated to the border, setting up a new roadblock on 
scenic River Road near the home of one of their members Dave George, the 
42-year-old bricklayer brother of Doug George. They chopped down 
</P>
<P>
a tree and sprawled it across the road. Dave George erected a sign announcing a 
"Warrior Free Zone," put on his camouflage coat and stood sentry with a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Doug George, also armed himself with a rifle. "If he stood," Doug George says, 
"I was going to stand with him. . . . If we would have left and retreated, they 
would have controlled the whole area." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses say that the early morning of Tuesday, May 1, sounded like open 
warfare. 
</P>
<P>
"The two factions were shooting at each other. I got my family out of there," 
says John Gray, who lives near the blockade set up by the Georges. When he 
returned in the morning, there were bullet holes in a pickup truck behind his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Doug George says that everyone kept firing, even though in the darkness, "we 
didn't see anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Pyke, 22, stationed with the anti-gambling forces, was shot in the 
back. In the morning, the body of 32-year-old Harold Edwards Jr. was discovered 
on the Warriors' side of the skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the anti-gambling Indians and hundreds of other residents were 
evacuated from the reservation to Cornwall, some crossing the river by barge. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, saying that they had nothing to fear from an investigation, 
agreed not to interfere with outside authorities seeking to reach the murder 
scene -- which is on Canadian turf near the international border, although it 
can be reached only from the U.S. side. And that concession set the stage for 
the arrival of hundreds of State Police. Two weeks later, they are still 
around. 
</P>
<P>
"As you can see, we are under siege," says Melvin White, standing at the door 
of the Warriors Society headquarters. "They (the police) said they were merely 
here for investigative purposes. Instead, we have a mass invasion, an invading 
army." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Cuomo has said that the troopers will remain until tribal leaders can 
establish an official Mohawk police force for the New York side of the 
reservation. Meanwhile, patrol cars and armed officers are stationed at 
entrances to the reservation, at main intersections on the reservation and in 
front of casinos. Logs smolder in metal trash cans to provide warmth on the 
12-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
The troopers grumble about how the Indians are allowed to sell cigarettes 
tax-free in the United States and smuggle them across the border -- often by 
boat at night -- for illegal profits in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"Look in there and you may see a few packs of gum, along with the cigarettes," 
one young officer says, nodding at a roadside shop where cartons of Winstons 
and Marlboros are piled to the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Troopers search cars and check the identity of everyone coming in and out. 
Nonresidents are kept off the reservation. The casinos are closed. 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti attests to the long conflict: "Gambling Will Die" appears in red paint 
on a warehouse. "Warriors 1" appears on a fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
While the criminal investigation continues -- there have been no arrests -- two 
federal mediators and a representative of the governor are trying to work out a 
compromise among the factions that perhaps would include a referendum on 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
"The immediate answers are obvious," says John Vance, one of the federal 
mediators. "Remove roadblocks. Stop illegal gambling. Reinstate law 
enforcement. . . . The Mohawk situation cries out for armistice." 
</P>
<P>
But "after the police leave, you're going to see wholesale retribution," 
predicts Doug George, who calls the Warriors paid goons of gambling interests 
who are "in it for self-interest, fast and easy money." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not over by any means," agrees Harold Tarbell, the anti-gambling head 
chief of the American-side tribal council, who runs for reelection next month. 
"I do think we're in for a long, hot summer." 
</P>
<P>
Two flags fly atop Warriors Society headquarters, a blue aluminum-sided 
building. One flag is bright blue with a pattern taken from an ancient wampum 
belt that symbolizes unity of the six Indian nations of the Iroquois 
Confederacy, which includes the Mohawks. Below that flag is a red one featuring 
the legendary warrior Hiawatha, who is credited with bringing the six tribes 
together. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen cars and pickup trucks are parked in the muddy lot outside the 
headquarters. Traditional music -- drums and chanting -- filters from speakers 
in a neighboring house. There are no windows in the headquarters building. The 
only glass, on the small front door, has a large spider-web crack. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, blue jean-clad warriors sit at long bingo tables, monitoring radios and 
waiting for instructions. Virtually everyone is smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the men work in the casinos, but many are ironworkers, installing 
girders on high-rise buildings across the country in the daring trade in which 
many of the tribe's men work. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing the (anti-gambling forces) ever did for the Warrior Society was 
to put up those roadblocks," says Joe Warrior, who is a member of the Los 
Angeles Ironworkers Union local but is home with his wife and four children 
awaiting his next job. 
</P>
<P>
The roadblocks brought the troopers, he reasons, and that outside presence will 
only gain the Warriors more support as the "occupation" becomes an 
inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have here is a struggle for control of the territory of Akwesasne," 
says spokesman Boots. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, two women enter the building leading a flock of children. 
Kathleen Oakes angrily describes how one of the troopers tried to search her 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'You have no right doing that,' " she recounts. "I said: 'That's 
getting a little too damn personal.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I just wonder if they know what they're getting into?" asks a 37-year-old 
ironworker who calls himself Runner. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I supposed to be holding an AK-47 in there?" Oakes continued, waving her 
small black purse. 
</P>
<P>
"You can push people just so far," mutters Runner, who has a scraggly beard and 
hair well down his back. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to see Mohawks united, let them start killing people," declares 
Joe. "If something happens, say they attack here, there will be one big 
massacre." 
</P>
<P>
"They'll get massacred," says Runner, "because they'll be surrounded. We can't 
fight them in one big group but we got them split up. 
</P>
<P>
"They say they have us surrounded, but you ask the troops out there who feels 
uneasy. . . ."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; 
</P>
<P>
NO SPECIAL INTEREST HELP TO PAY LOANS, 2 CANDIDATES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two Democrats who have loaned their campaigns hundreds of thousands of dollars 
in their bid for insurance commissioner will not repay themselves after the 
election by raising money from special interests they may be regulating, 
according to statements made Saturday. State Board of Equalization chairman 
Conway Collis, who has loaned himself $673,000 while raising only $75,795 from 
outside contributors, said: 
</P>
<P>
"If I lose this election, I am prepared to repay the loans out of my own funds. 
If I win, I am on record supporting an initiative that would limit attorneys' 
fees and create a nonprofit system of auto insurance, so it is simply 
ridiculous to think that I will get any support from those same special 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
The initiative Collis referred to, however, failed to qualify for the ballot 
this year and would have to be recirculated for 1992 or a later ballot. Also, 
after his election to the Board of Equalization, Collis raised hundreds of 
thousands of dollars from interests subject to board action. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the campaign manager for state Sen. John Garamendi, who loaned 
himself $700,000 while raising $417,372 from contributors, said Garamendi 
intends to repay himself later by soliciting "a variety of people who are 
interested in good government." 
</P>
<P>
"The senator is not planning to take any money from insurance companies at any 
time after he becomes commissioner," said Revels Cayton. "He does not believe 
that one should accept contributions from an industry that he is going to 
rigorously regulate." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such assurances, two leading rivals of Collis and Garamendi in the 
Democratic primary said Saturday they are convinced that one special interest 
or another will end up paying off Garamendi or Collis, if either is elected 
insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Former Common Cause director Walter Zelman, who has raised $78,898 from 
contributors, $3,000 more than Collis, but who has $670,000 less to campaign 
with because he has not loaned himself any money, said: 
</P>
<P>
"Special interests would be the only possible source to which Garamendi or 
Collis could turn in order to repay their $700,000 or $673,000 campaign debt, 
owed to themselves. That kind of money is just not available from any other 
source." 
</P>
<P>
Zelman added that the way Garamendi or Collis could prove that they won't be 
raising money from special interests after the election would be to turn their 
loans into direct campaign contributions. "Only if this is done can the public 
be guaranteed that Collis and Garamendi would not use their position of public 
trust for personal economic gain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Press -- who raised $603,040 from contributors, more than Garamendi and 
Collis combined, but, because he did not loan himself any money, has less to 
campaign with than either -- said: 
</P>
<P>
"These two are waging this campaign like two typical cash register politicians. 
They're the S and L candidates, Stealth and Loan. They refuse to release their 
tax returns, fund most of their campaign with personal loans and then refuse to 
reveal the true sources of the loans, and how they'll be paid back." 
</P>
<P>
Collis said in his statement that the loan he had made to himself was made on 
the value of his Santa Monica home. 
</P>
<P>
But Press questioned that. "Lenders I have talked to say there is no way he 
could draw down $673,000 on a second mortgage on a million-dollar home," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Garamendi said that he has abandoned advocacy of no-fault auto 
insurance and no longer accepts it as a solution for California. Garamendi had 
unsuccessfully authored no-fault legislation in the late 1970s, but in this 
campaign has come under fire for that position because no-fault is backed by 
the insurance industry.

BATS SWOOPING DOWN IN TOWN HALL DRIVE EVERYONE, WELL, YOU KNOW . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
OLIVENHAIN, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For almost a century, the bats have provided a creepy footnote to the history 
of the Olivenhain town hall, a sturdy redwood meeting place built in 1895 by 
the German farmers who settled this north San Diego County community. 
</P>
<P>
Old-timers say the migratory creatures moved into the rafters of the rustic 
hall not long after the last nails were pounded in. Soon, they became part of 
the folklore -- on some nights diving down by the scores, herky-jerky, to 
startle square-dancers or disrupt meetings held by the eerie light of a 
kerosene lamp. 
</P>
<P>
"They were always part of the local color -- the trick was to keep the bats out 
of your hair while the meeting went on," said Dave McCollom, assistant manager 
of the Olivenhain Water District, which met in the hall until 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, when the bat guano would start dropping to the floor, you knew it 
was time to call a quit to things." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, after several bats were found to have rabies, officials decided that 
the furtive, furry animals would have to go. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, they placed green mesh screening around the bottom of the roof of 
the hall -- protection that officials hope will have the opposite effect of a 
roach motel: The bats check out, but they can't check back in. 
</P>
<P>
"We've also built four bat houses in the surrounding trees that hold 100 bats 
each," Olivenhain Town Council President Bob McAndrews said. "We're not trying 
to kill them off, just move them someplace nearby. These creatures really don't 
hurt anything, they actually help man by eating a lot of bad bugs." 
</P>
<P>
The relocation of the colony of Mexican free-tailed bats, which measure about 6 
inches from head to tail, is part of a project to refurbish the town hall with 
a $136,000 grant from the state Department of Parks and Recreation's Office of 
Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
But some veteran users of the venerable building say the bats are too vital a 
part of the hall's history and should be left undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
"I say, 'Leave them alone,' " said 79-year-old Howard Golem, an ex-cattle 
rancher who sits on the water district board. "Thousands of people have been 
exposed to those bats over the years, and nothing has happened to them. 
</P>
<P>
"They stay to themselves during the day. And they won't bother anyone if you 
don't bother them. So what's the point?" 
</P>
<P>
Local bat advocates say the nocturnal creatures have been given a bad rap -- 
not only on the possible spread of rabies but also because they have 
illogically been associated with Dracula and the devil just because they are 
usually seen at night. 
</P>
<P>
Harley Denk, 68, says he recalls seeing the bats in the hall as far back as the 
1930s. He says he can understand the concern over the creatures. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the Depression, we used to have a bat party now and then," he said. 
"We'd get up in the rafters with clubs and tennis rackets and kill hundreds of 
them to keep the population down." 
</P>
<P>
Officials eventually installed a dropped ceiling to stop the bat droppings from 
bombarding people who gathered in the A-frame hall for 4-H Club get-togethers, 
weddings and Halloween and Christmas parties. 
</P>
<P>
"But these days," Denk said, "with people getting more conscious of diseases 
and sprays and lawsuits, they just feel uncomfortable with the bats flying 
around." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent bat attack began last summer when several dead and injured bats 
were found on the building's floor. A dozen of the 97 bats tested were found to 
have rabies, so a Berkeley bat expert was called in. He suggested using the 
nets as a way to move the bats without harming them. 
</P>
<P>
The bat houses, placed near the top of four nearby trees, are about the size of 
a back-yard birdhouse but have three compartments in which the creatures can 
cluster. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going real well," McAndrews said of the project. "Sometimes, bats will 
ignore these types of bat houses for a year before they decide to move in. But 
it looks like they're moving in faster than that." 
</P>
<P>
Some bats have stubbornly stuck to their crevices inside the building, which 
has been declared a California landmark. Bat guano still litters the floor and 
has stained the walls. 
</P>
<P>
And, 95 years after they first moved in, the bats of the Olivenhain town hall 
are still startling people -- as if they were the ones who deserved squatter's 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first came in here, they scared the daylight out of us," said 
20-year-old Eric Barton, a worker on the refurbishment project. "One day, we 
lifted one of the shutters from the window and about five bats flew out at us. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of funny to think now. We took off running around the room, the bats 
were flying around overhead. Back then, we'd never seen a bat before. But we're 
kind of getting used to them now."

Former Gov. George Ariyoshi, in his first public response to a recent Los 
Angeles Times report that Imelda Marcos paid him $50,000 in 1982, has confirmed 
that he received a package of cash from the Philippines then-first lady but 
said that he had returned it. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ariyoshi, Mrs. Marcos tried in vain to persuade him to keep the 
money and use it on unspecified "Filipino projects" in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not done anything wrong, and this unfortunate incident was not one of 
my making," Ariyoshi said in a written statement delivered to Hawaiian news 
offices late Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Existence of the secret cash payment was discovered recently in a Marcos travel 
expense ledger, part of the voluminous evidence submitted already in the 
ongoing fraud and racketeering trial of Mrs. Marcos in New York. The ledger 
does not note the return of the cash. 
</P>
<P>
Ariyoshi, who retired in 1986 after three terms, said the cash was delivered to 
the governor's mansion in an envelope along with other gifts. He said that 
after discovering the contents he rewrapped it without counting the cash. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not want to touch the money and do not know how much there was," he said 
in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I subsequently returned it, at which time Mrs. Marcos said it could be used to 
assist various Filipino projects in Hawaii. I declined, realizing that there 
would never be enough to meet all such requests and suggested she could do this 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
According to the court documents filed in New York, Mrs. Marcos presented the 
gift to Ariyoshi on July 20, 1982, during a stopover en route to Manila after 
visits to the Soviet Union, Morocco and New York. The sole ledger entry, 
handwritten by Mrs. Marcos' private secretary, said simply: 
</P>
<P>
"$50,000 -- Given to Gov. Ariyoshi." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors contend that Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, former 
Philippines President Ferdinand E. Marcos, looted their nation's treasury and 
spent hundreds of millions of dollars on art, jewelry, real estate and other 
personal expenses in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Mrs. Marcos argue that the spending by the ousted Philippine 
leaders was to finance anti-communist policies and other proper official 
responsibilities. They also deny that Mrs. Marcos gave Ariyoshi an envelope 
containing $50,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Ariyoshi, now a private lawyer, did not return repeated calls from The Times 
prior to publication of the original report on May 19.

<P>
Teamsters Union Vice President Harold Friedman sat in the witness chair of a 
nearly empty federal courtroom and fought back the tears. "Am I still going to 
have a job -- do I go on pension?" he asked plaintively. 
</P>
<P>
One of the nation's highest-paid unionists, Friedman, 68, was reeling from the 
pointed questions of a Justice Department lawyer about perks that he had 
extracted from his hometown Cleveland local after his conviction on federal 
racketeering charges last year. 
</P>
<P>
Was it true, demanded prosecutor Randy M. Mastro, that Friedman secretly had 
engineered $300,000 in severance pay from his Ohio Teamsters in case a judge 
should remove him from office? Had his wife recently gone on the payroll, too 
-- at $150,000 a year -- in case Friedman later were ousted? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the hefty 6-foot-2 union leader could no longer hold back his 
emotions. "I'm . . . sitting here crying like a little girl -- I never did this 
in my life," he told U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein. Never before had 
Friedman been questioned so closely about his conduct. "These things you're 
asking me are not easy," he pleaded to Mastro. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman is not the only Teamster who is being questioned closely these days. 
His own case -- which unfolded with little notice last winter -- parallels a 
broader government crackdown on the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 
which itself had never undergone such scrutiny until recently. And both 
Friedman and the Teamsters are chafing under the experience. 
</P>
<P>
The intense government intervention -- which is being watched closely by 
leaders of other labor unions, who are wary that it may set a precedent -- grew 
out of a groundbreaking federal lawsuit filed in 1988, charging leaders of the 
1.6-million-member union with maintaining ties to organized crime. To avert the 
possibility of a court order that might oust them from their jobs and pension 
benefits, Friedman and others on the union's national executive board agreed to 
allow a three-member, court-appointed panel to oversee the organization's 
affairs. In return, the Justice Department withdrew its suit. 
</P>
<P>
Over the 14 months that the consent order has been in effect, however, the 
agreement has turned sour, both for the Teamsters as a group and for Friedman 
personally. The court-appointed overseers have suspended Friedman from his 
$500,000-a-year post and are forcing even more sweeping changes on the giant 
union, pressuring longtime leaders to get out and revamping the rules and 
procedures for elections. Never before has a national union -- much less the 
country's largest -- been under such tight government controls. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not surprisingly, Friedman and other Teamster leaders have been 
fighting these actions inch by inch, claiming that the procedures are much 
tougher than they foresaw and that they violate the union's constitution. In a 
clearly orchestrated move, top Teamster officials have filed lawsuits in 
several key cities attacking the court agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the original consent order, Edelstein was empowered to 
decide such appeals on his own, but now even that is up in the air: The union 
is asking the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York to nullify the 
judge's authority. 
</P>
<P>
The fierce opposition has managed to slow steps toward a thorough cleanup, but 
there still has been some progress to show for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Among the steps taken so far: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Besides the suspension of Friedman, one of the nation's most powerful 
Teamsters, more than 20 other national and local officers have been charged 
with misconduct by Charles M. Carberry, the court-appointed "investigations 
officer" who is a former U.S. prosecutor. They include Theodore R. Cozza of 
Pittsburgh, Pa., and George J. Vitale of Detroit -- both of whom, like 
Friedman, are union vice presidents -- as well as four Teamster leaders in 
Chicago, four in New York and more than a dozen others in New Jersey, 
Connecticut, Michigan and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Most are charged with having longtime associations with organized crime bosses 
or with remaining in office after having been convicted of theft or 
embezzlement. All have requested formal hearings in advance of any expulsion. 
Another Teamster vice president, Daniel Ligurotis of Chicago, has been held in 
contempt of court for allegedly trying to impede court-ordered steps toward 
election reform. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frederick B. Lacey, the former federal judge who is serving as the 
court-appointed administrative officer under the consent order, has been 
conducting closed-door disciplinary hearings. But besides suspending Friedman 
and Tony Hughes, a close Friedman associate, Lacey has not yet formally ousted 
anyone from a union office, preferring instead to steer cautiously through 
uncharted waters. Three local officers, however, have resigned following 
Carberry's initial investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Under the court agreement, Lacey needs only to find "just cause" for removing 
union officers -- a much lower threshold of proof than the standard of "beyond 
a reasonable doubt" required for conviction in a criminal trial. "The 
resistance of the IBT leadership to the work of the court officers . . . has 
not lessened," Lacey told Edelstein in a recent report. As a result, he 
reported, the three court officials "have found themselves distracted from 
their principal tasks" by having to defend legal challenges to their authority. 
</P>
<P>
If the consent order is so onerous, then why did Teamster leaders voluntarily 
sign it? 
</P>
<P>
Critics contend that the union's well-paid but aging hierarchy was worried that 
if the government were to win its lawsuit, then Teamster leaders who had been 
named as defendants might be removed from office without pay and be forced 
personally to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal costs that they had 
incurred. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes of a closed-door Teamster board meeting obtained by The Times show that 
some older members were convinced that settling the suit would enable them to 
retire gracefully, with full pensions. 
</P>
<P>
But the Teamsters became angry when the deal didn't work that way in practice 
and Carberry disclosed that he intended to file charges against members of the 
ruling executive board. The union leaders sought legal advice on whether they 
could abrogate the court agreement on grounds that they had been deceived by 
Justice Department attorneys, but their outside counsel, Jed S. Rakoff of New 
York, advised against it. There was nothing in the agreement about an exemption 
for anyone, Rakoff said. 
</P>
<P>
More embarrassing, in a remarkably blunt court filing, John R. Climaco, the 
union's former general counsel, recently accused Teamster board members of 
having acted out of self-interest in settling the lawsuit. In New York court 
papers submitted on behalf of some of the organization's 700 local unions, 
Climaco declared that the settlement resulted from "inherent and self-serving 
conflicts-of-interests" on the part of these board members, who he said acted 
mainly out of their own professional and financial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Climaco argued in his brief that the consent order should not be binding upon 
the activities of local unions across the country, an issue that the New York 
appellate court is expected to decide later this year. Climaco, who was a 
protege of Jackie Presser, the late Teamster president, was replaced by James 
T. Grady when new president William J. McCarthy took office two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Some law enforcement officials, congressional watchdogs and labor law experts 
still are hopeful that the court-ordered reforms eventually will result in a 
cleaner, more democratic and less corrupt union. "I'm relatively optimistic 
that long-term reforms will come about, particularly with the (union) elections 
in 1991," said a veteran Capitol Hill investigator who has followed the 
Teamsters for years. "That is, if Teamster officials don't first wear down the 
court supervisors with all their legal challenges," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A federal enforcement official is similarly confident: "The IBT will be cleaned 
up because we have the law on our side," he said. "It's a combination of having 
disciplinary procedures in place that can result in dismissal of corrupt 
officers, and having an electoral process that will give members a voice in 
determining who their future leaders will be." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Michael H. Holland, a Chicago labor lawyer who is serving as 
court-appointed elections officer, has developed guidelines that would require 
all 700 Teamster locals to select delegates democratically for a national 
Teamster convention in June, 1991, at which candidates for the 21 
highest-ranking positions in the union will be nominated. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, most delegates had "earned" the right to attend Teamster 
conventions, either by virtue of the local offices they held or because they 
were the cronies of Teamster leaders. It was they who selected the union's 
national officers, often by acclamation. But under the new procedures, in 
December, 1991, Holland and his assistants will supervise the first direct, 
secret-ballot election of top Teamster officers by rank-and-file members. 
</P>
<P>
"The new rules go farther than any labor union in the country presently goes to 
provide free and fair elections," John Bell, a deputy to Holland, said. 
</P>
<P>
Outsiders generally have given the government's cleanup efforts above-average 
grades. Carl McKenry, a labor law specialist at the University of Miami, said 
that the Teamsters have been so infiltrated by organized crime for so many 
years that the court-ordered consent decree was "a necessary step" to get the 
union back on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
"The Teamsters traditionally are a pretty tough bunch, so you're not going to 
wind up with a totally pure union as a result of the court order," McKenry 
said. "But I am mainly encouraged by the election process, because the open 
participation of all concerned should keep this organization from getting 
locked in (with organized crime) again." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Aaron, a labor law professor at UCLA, said that the court-appointed 
officers have achieved "some limited success" in recent months but noted that 
disciplinary proceedings against individual Teamster officers "can be terribly 
time-consuming, given their propensity for litigating everything." 
</P>
<P>
Describing the task as Herculean, Aaron said: "It's quite clear that cleaning 
up the Teamsters Union on a national basis is equivalent to cleaning the Augean 
stables of the gods, as Hercules was forced to do. The main hope, however, lies 
in giving a chance to the forces of democracy within the union." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Charging that the 18 top officials of the Teamsters had allowed their union to 
be corrupted by the Mafia, the Justice Department, in June, 1988, filed suit to 
oust any of the 18 found to have violated racketeering laws. After nine months 
of legal sparing, the two sides agreed to a settlement. It provided for direct 
election of officers and created a court-appointed panel to fight organized 
crime in the union. Most Teamsters leaders were pleased with the settlement 
because they did not have to cede power directly to the government. They did 
not foresee that the panel would use its power to look at Teamster books and 
interview members, searching for corruption at the top.

<P>
Soviet negotiators arrived in the United States on Saturday for a final 
pre-summit round of arms talks, seeking to eliminate the last obstacles to a 
draft nuclear weapons agreement and to restart stalled talks on conventional 
armed forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the Soviet delegation, arms control expert Viktor P. Karpov, told 
reporters that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev plans to seek limits on the 
military power of a reunified Germany when he meets with President Bush 
beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We need some guarantees that this new Germany will respect European security 
and that the armed forces of the new state will be under some control," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they are optimistic that the two sides can work through the 
remaining issues in the nuclear strategic arms reduction talks (START) when 
they begin meeting today. Bush and Gorbachev are scheduled to approve its terms 
in a declaration this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just about there," said a senior Administration official, noting that 
the remaining problems in the proposed START accord are "not major policy 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
On conventional arms, U.S. officials said they hope for a positive Soviet 
response to several compromise proposals made by Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III in Moscow two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The talks on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) have been at an impasse for 
months while Moscow reconsidered its security posture after the collapse of 
Eastern Europe's Communist regimes. The negotiations are intended to produce a 
treaty under which the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact 
would make deep cuts in troops, aircraft, armored vehicles and artillery. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Baker took the Soviets a package of U.S. "ideas" intended to explore 
Soviet flexibility and re-energize the negotiations, but he received no 
concrete response. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the U.S. suggestions covered most of the issues on which NATO 
and the Soviets are at odds in the talks: limits on aircraft and armored 
forces, destruction of weapons that are withdrawn, manpower ceilings for each 
alliance and verification procedures. 
</P>
<P>
One major issue stems in part from Soviet worries that a reunified Germany 
might become a major military power again. The Kremlin has proposed a troop 
ceiling of about 750,000 on each alliance, a provision that would have the 
effect of constraining German troop levels. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the United States had argued that no such limits were necessary. 
But in his recent Moscow meetings, Baker hinted at a new, more flexible U.S. 
position, according to one official. He said Baker told the Soviets that NATO 
would attempt to "accommodate Soviet concerns about German force levels in the 
current (CFE) negotiations or later." 
</P>
<P>
In START negotiations, half a dozen "second-order" issues remain to be 
resolved: 
</P>
<P>
* Warheads on mobile land-based missiles. The United States has backed off its 
longstanding proposal to ban all land-based mobile multiple-warhead missiles, 
so now both sides are trying to set a limit on the warheads carried by mobile 
launchers. 
</P>
<P>
* Limits on the Soviet Union's modernization of its heavy SS-18 missile. The 
United States had proposed banning production and flight tests of these 
weapons. The Soviets already have agreed to halve their SS-18 force from 308 to 
154; but during the eight-year course of the START negotiations, they have also 
developed an improved version, called Mod 5. The new U.S. proposal is to limit 
flight testing and end production of the Mod 5, but Moscow has shown no 
interest in that. 
</P>
<P>
* The Soviets' Backfire bomber. Moscow refuses to include these under the START 
limits because it says they are medium-range aircraft, not long-range. The 
United States wants them included but may drop the issue. 
</P>
<P>
* Perimeter and portal monitoring. The two sides disagree on the kinds and 
numbers of nuclear weapon facilities where on-site inspectors from each side 
would police operations. 
</P>
<P>
* Non-circumvention. START bans both countries from giving the weapons limited 
by the pact to other countries, but the United States wants to maintain a 
longstanding program to help Britain develop sea-based nuclear forces. The 
Soviets are expected to agree. 
</P>
<P>
* "Follow-on" negotiations. At the summit, Bush and Gorbachev are expected to 
issue a joint statement promising to follow the START treaty with START-2 
talks. But the two sides haven't agreed on what should be included in the next 
negotiations. The United States wants to reduce the Soviet arsenal of SS-18s 
and ballistic missiles with multiple warheads; the Soviets want more limits on 
air- and sea-launched cruise missiles. Arms control experts predict the 
statement will be vague, leaving the question of the START-2 agenda to be 
worked out later.

Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin failed Saturday to win a majority in 
balloting for president of Russia, the largest Soviet republic, but said he 
will start a new campaign Monday for another election. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress of the Russian Federation will take new nominations then, and 
Yeltsin said he will stick to his platform of transferring economic and 
political decision-making power from central authorities to the republic -- 
despite opposition from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to change on matters of principle," he said as he strode 
through the Kremlin grounds after Saturday's runoff election in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev accused Yeltsin on Wednesday of being anti-socialist and said his 
demands for Russian sovereignty would mean "the breakup of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's first round of balloting, Yeltsin won 497 votes, forcing a runoff 
Saturday. Yeltsin received 503 votes in the second round; he needed 531. 
</P>
<P>
His principal opponent, Krasnodar Communist Party chief Ivan K. Polozkov, won 
473 votes in the first round and 458 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, Moscow city authorities pleaded with citizens to stop hoarding 
food and accused the government of panicking the thousands who thronged shops. 
</P>
<P>
Mass buying was sparked when Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov appeared on 
television Thursday to outline government plans for a market economy, under 
which basic food prices would soar. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the chaos, the Moscow city council postponed until Monday a 
two-week ban on food sales to out-of-town residents, which was to take effect 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov, appealing for calm, told a news conference: "The 
situation in the city is getting critical. There is a real danger of things 
getting out of control. Hundreds of thousands of people are in the shops."

FOREIGN AFFAIRS: THE PRESIDENT SPENDS THE DAYS BEFORE GORBACHEV'S ARRIVAL ON

<P>
Four days before Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives in Washington, 
the President of the United States was on the fairway Saturday, joined by his 
secretary of transportation -- the two of them aggressively pursuing a weekend 
of recreation. 
</P>
<P>
The President's predilection for golf in even the foulest of weather has led 
him to the links in near gales and wintry gloom. But on this day, he was 
blessed with crystalline sunshine on a becalmed afternoon at the Maine 
seashore. 
</P>
<P>
If the weather was remarkable for the President's four-day Memorial Day 
holiday, his golf game was not, and the topics of the day -- Soviet SS-18 
missiles, the dilemma posed by German reunification, the Kremlin's objections 
to Baltic independence and the obstacles to greater U.S.-Soviet trade -- were 
just so many pages in the thick briefing books he carried up from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Is this any way to get ready for a superpower summit? 
</P>
<P>
If you are George Bush, it most certainly is. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't detect that he's a crammer," a senior White House official said 
Saturday in a world-class display of understatement. 
</P>
<P>
It is to Kennebunkport and hamlets like it up and down the rocky coast that 
many of the well-heeled residents of Boston, New York, Philadelphia and 
Washington and their suburbs have flocked each summer for the better part of 
the century. Although schools do not let out for several more weeks, and the 
nighttime temperatures still dictate an extra blanket on the bed, the Memorial 
Day weekend marks the start of The Season -- for the innkeepers, lobster shacks 
and T-shirt salesclerks who depend on the steady flow of summer people. And for 
George Bush, too. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Ronald Reagan returned to California for rejuvenation throughout his 
eight years in the presidency, Bush recharges himself in Kennebunkport. He just 
does it at a pace that would wear out the batteries on others. 
</P>
<P>
So this is what he did Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
* He reviewed his national security and intelligence briefing, a daily report 
updating him on events around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
* Aboard his blue-hulled speedboat Fidelity, he crashed about the North 
Atlantic, through a moderate chop that lapped against the shores of his 
storybook home. 
</P>
<P>
* He played tennis on his private court. (He won, he claimed). 
</P>
<P>
* He played horseshoes. (Ditto). 
</P>
<P>
* He played golf, of course. (Ditto). 
</P>
<P>
And it was on the golf course -- the first tee of the Cape Arundel Golf Club, 
to be exact -- where the business of recreation and the business of the 
presidency collided. 
</P>
<P>
In the days before the summit, which gets down to business Thursday after 
Gorbachev's Wednesday evening arrival in Washington, the air is fairly electric 
with signal-sending.

In the view of Administration officials, Gorbachev's seemingly alarming threat 
on Friday -- to pull the Soviet Union back from talks intended to reduce 
conventional arms in Europe if the West persists in its demand that a unified 
Germany retain West Germany's membership in NATO -- was pre-summit posturing 
intended to send a message of resolution directed as much to his own right 
flank and still-powerful Soviet military professionals as to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to it for the first time in public Saturday, Bush changed his approach 
not one iota from what he had said Thursday, one day before the threat was 
aired. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that's . . . a subject for real discussion, and my job is to convince him 
that there is no threat to the Soviet Union from a united Germany in NATO," 
Bush told reporters as he was about to tee off. 
</P>
<P>
"Really I can make the case that it is in their interest. So that's what we'll 
be talking about," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a different position than we do right now. I think it's going to 
take a while before we have agreement on how a post-German-unification Europe 
looks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight months ago, the presidency, presidential golf and superpower summitry 
were similarly entwined on the same golf course. 
</P>
<P>
On a blustery September afternoon, Bush took a telephone call there from 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who reported from Jackson Hole, Wyo., 
that he and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze had just reached 
agreement on holding the summit conference that is about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Did he crack open his briefing books? Yes, reported deputy national security 
adviser Robert M. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
But did he spend much time with them? Bush was asked on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
"Not much," he confided. 
</P>
<P>
"Brought two big fat ones," he added, with a disapproving frown that suggested 
he thought he should be spending more time hitting the books. 
</P>
<P>
The seasons have nearly gone full cycle since the summit was first announced. 
In the late spring of northern New England, the forsythia, tulips and jonquils 
that faded two months ago in Washington are painting the landscape with precise 
dots of red and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim since September, Bush has met at the storm-tossed Malta summit 
with the Soviet leader. His secretary of state has met in Washington and Moscow 
with Shevardnadze. While a summit may focus attention on the superpower 
relationship, the issues with which it deals are never a great distance from 
the top of a presidential agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, positions are constantly being updated, and although the President has 
met in recent weeks with a variety of academics and other experts from within 
the Administration, preparations for this week's meetings are "careful but 
fairly relaxed," a Bush aide said. "There's not a rush-rush. It's a fairly 
steady diet." 
</P>
<P>
The final briefings will wait until Tuesday and Wednesday, after Bush returns 
to the White House.

With the superpower summit only days away, the Soviet Union cranked up its 
public relations campaign Saturday with the first in a series of high-glitz 
press briefings designed to buff the gloss on glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet media machine ran smoothly enough, but it seemed to leave some 
American news correspondents less than satisfied. While the five Soviet experts 
who presided over the first session were eager to respond, they had little in 
the way of news to offer. 
</P>
<P>
The five daily briefings, being held at the National Press Club in downtown 
Washington, will deal with the subjects of Soviet political reform, economic 
restructuring, human rights, foreign policy and independence movements. 
</P>
<P>
The last session will be Wednesday, only hours before Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev arrives in Washington for four days of meetings with President 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The briefings -- complete with glossy press kits, high-profile Soviet experts 
and fresh coffee -- illustrate Moscow's improved image management, a science 
born with Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, and developed over the 
course of five previous summits. 
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's briefing, which ostensibly focused on political reform, the five 
Soviets fielded questions on topics ranging from Gorbachev's controversial new 
economic plan to the availability of free abortions to Soviet women. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei S. Grachev, a Soviet spokesman, directed the disparate gathering. The 
briefing, attended by several dozen reporters, appeared to be designed less to 
make news than to make friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are all interested in the food situation," one reporter ventured. 
"What are you getting from the United States now in the way of food, and what 
do you need?" 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing we would like from the United States is a new spirit, a new 
style of relations," Grachev answered, proceeding to speak of U.S.-Soviet 
relations in general terms as an official interpreter provided a simultaneous 
translation into English. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand," the reporter persisted. "Can you tell us what you all 
need, what you want?" 
</P>
<P>
Just "to be on good terms," Grachev finally responded, switching in 
exasperation to English. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet experts were carefully chosen to represent a range of views and 
experience. The most prominent was Alexander Bovin, a stout, peppery political 
commentator for the government newspaper Izvestia, who criticized Soviet 
inertia in guaranteeing freedom of the press. So far, he said, there is only 
"semi-glasnost." 
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned reporters not to read too much into Soviet actions, including 
the recent decision to hold a referendum on Gorbachev's new economic program. 
"Sovietologists look for logic in the actions of the Kremlin," he said, "but 
there is no logic in life and there is no logic in this situation." 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Golik, chairman of the Law and Order and Battle Against Crime Committee in 
the Supreme Soviet, drew smiles with his response to a question on whether 
domestic troubles have caused the Soviet people to become less interested in 
international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think our interest is shrinking," he said. "In the first quarter of 
this year the amount of money spent on foreign trips is 20 times what it was 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
Bikhodzhal Rakhimova, vice chairwoman of the Supreme Soviet's Committee on 
Women's Affairs and Family, Mother and Child Protection, was the only woman and 
the only non-Russian to serve on the panel. Asked about independence sentiment 
in her native region of Central Asia, she responded diplomatically that it is 
important to remember that all of the region's economic development occurred 
under Soviet rule. As for secession, she said, "The Supreme Soviet has passed a 
law on this question."

MEXICO REPORTEDLY TO SEEK EXTRADITION OF DEA OFFICIAL

Mexico will seek the arrest and extradition of a Drug Enforcement 
Administration official for his role in the abduction of a Mexican physician 
facing trial in the death of a U.S. drug agent, according to news reports. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico City newspapers reported Saturday that the attorney general's office 
will seek the extradition of DEA supervisor Hector Berrellez, for alleged 
involvement in the kidnaping of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain. The physician 
faces trial for alleged participation in the 1985 slaying of DEA agent Enrique 
Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
Berrellez testified Friday at a federal hearing in Los Angeles that up to 
$50,000 was authorized for the capture of Alvarez. He said that DEA Deputy 
Director Pete Gruden knew of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the doctor from his office has caused tension between the U.S. 
and Mexican governments. Mexico has demanded his return, saying his delivery to 
the United States violated Mexican sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, a Guadalajara gynecologist, was arrested April 3 after being taken to 
El Paso to face charges that he administered drugs to Camarena during the 
kidnaping, torture and murder of the drug agent and his pilot. 
</P>
<P>
DEA spokesman Frank Shults in Washington denied that the government offered a 
reward for the people who captured Alvarez, saying the $20,000 payment was for 
"services." He said it could have covered such things as rental of the plane 
that flew Alvarez to El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mexican police officer Antonio Garate Bustamante, who is wanted by the 
Mexican government, testified he paid $20,000 in DEA money to the people who 
captured Alvarez, and was continuing to pay their expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Garate said he arranged for the doctor to be brought across the border with the 
approval of DEA officials. He said he found friends who would do the job 
without advance payment. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that no money would be provided up front, and they would have no 
assistance from the DEA," he said. "Whatever they were doing they were doing on 
their own." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office said Friday that it would present formal 
accusations against Berrellez and Garate in a Mexico City district court, 
according to news reports. After obtaining warrants, it will present the 
accusations to the Foreign Ministry to seek the official's extradition, the 
newspapers said. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials call Garate the "connection" between DEA officials and the 
Mexicans who abducted Alvarez, the news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
On April 28, the attorney general's office announced the arrest of six people 
for alleged involvement in Alvarez's capture. 
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said Friday that the abduction "does not 
help in the fight against drug smuggling." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern state of Chihuahua, Salinas said that the U.S. and 
Mexican governments should conduct themselves with mutual respect. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony at the trial of three other men in 1988 showed that Camarena was 
tortured and interrogated by drug lords. Prosecutors maintain Alvarez gave 
Camarena drugs to revive him for additional torture before his slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The drug lords reportedly were angered because Camarena's undercover work had 
led U.S. and Mexican authorities to a desert marijuana plantation, where they 
seized 10,000 tons of the drug worth billions of dollars.

GROUND CREW SEES ENGINE FIRE, FORCES KOREAN AIR LINES 747 TO RETURN TO LAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 with 286 passengers aboard was forced to return 
to Los Angeles International Airport shortly after takeoff Saturday after 
airport tower personnel saw flames and smoke shooting out of one of the 
airplane's four engines. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Tornquist, regional duty officer for the Federal Aviation Administration, 
said the fire was also seen by ground personnel about 12:50 p.m. The pilot shut 
down the engine and flew to the Pt. 
</P>
<P>
Mugu area, where the aircraft circled for 50 minutes dumping fuel, which 
Tornquist said is normal procedure before making an emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency crews were sent to the airport, but the plane, which was en route to 
Seoul via Honolulu, landed safely at LAX at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was not determined.

<P>
Actor Robert Wagner and actress Jill St. John were married Saturday at the 
actor's home, Wagner's publicist said. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, 60, and St. John, 49, were married in a small private ceremony in the 
garden of the actor's home in Pacific Palisades, publicist Alan Nierob said. 
</P>
<P>
Nierob said Wagner, the former husband of the late Natalie Wood, and St. John, 
who have been together for eight years, were joined in the ceremony by the 
daughters of Wagner and Wood: Kate, 26, who served as maid of honor; Natasha, 
19, and Courtney, 16, both of whom, served as bridesmaids. 
</P>
<P>
J. Watson Webb Jr. served as Wagner's best man and Wagner's sister, Mrs. Albert 
Scott, was matron of honor, according to Nierob, who said Wagner's and St. 
John's mothers both attended the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage is Wagner's fourth, including two marriages to Wood, who drowned 
Nov. 29, 1981. It was also the fourth marriage for St. John.

AN INDY REPEAT FLAUNTS HISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO RACING: LAST YEAR'S WINNER, EMERSON FITTIPALDI, STARTS ON THE POLE WITH 
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT NO ONE HAS WON CONSECUTIVE INDIANAPOLIS 500S IN ALMOST 20 
YEARS. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Emerson Fittipaldi rolls off the starting line today in defense of the 
title he won so dramatically in last year's Indianapolis 500, history will be 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
No driver has repeated at Indy in almost 20 years, and only four have 
successfully defended their championship in 73 years. The last one, Al Unser, 
who won in 1970 and '71, is in today's race in an Alfa-Romeo. 
</P>
<P>
The others were Bill Vukovich, 1953-54, whose grandson, Bill III, is also in 
today's race as the youngest driver among the 33 starters; Mauri Rose, 1947-48, 
and Wilbur Shaw, 1939-40. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it is very difficult to repeat here, but the pressure has only made me 
work harder to try and win again," Fittipaldi, the Brazilian veteran, said as 
he watched a midweek rain wash the Indianapolis Motor Speedway clean for 
today's race. The weather forecast calls for an overcast sky with early-morning 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew before I came to Indianapolis that there would be a lot of pressure on 
me and my family," Fittipaldi said, "because there would be such a demand on my 
time, but I feel I have managed to control the situation so that I am relaxed. 
It is the price of being the champion, but it is a price I am happy to pay." 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old, two-time former Formula One world champion, who retired for 
two years before joining the American open-wheel racing circuit in 1984, will 
start on the pole today in a new Penske Chevy V-8. He qualified two weeks ago 
at a record 225.301 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Starting on the pole could be another historical footnote indicating that 
Fittipaldi won't repeat. Only twice in the past 18 years has the pole-sitter 
won the 500. Both times it was Rick Mears, Fittipaldi's teammate, who did it in 
1979 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is different for Fittipaldi this time. Today he is with a different 
team, having taken his Marlboro sponsorship from the Pat Patrick-Chip Ganassi 
team to the Super Team of Roger Penske. The switch was part of a reported 
$30-million, three-year contract between Penske and the Philip Morris Tobacco 
Co. for his cars to carry the red-and-white colors of their product. 
</P>
<P>
The move took Fittipaldi from a one-car operation to a three-car team with 
former Indy 500 winners Mears and Danny Sullivan as teammates, a situation he 
likes. 
</P>
<P>
"(Among) three cars, I get much more information," Fittipaldi said. "That's the 
big advantage. I remember last year, at Phoenix and Long Beach, then 
Indianapolis, to set up the car was much more difficult. Because I was by 
myself, the information I was getting in testing the car and I was giving (team 
manager) Morris Nunn, I would say, was less than half the information I get now 
after practice." 
</P>
<P>
Being on the Penske team should give Fittipaldi another edge. The team has a 
record seven 500 victories, five in the last decade: Mark Donohue, 1972; Mears, 
1979; Bobby Unser, 1981; Mears, 1984; Sullivan, 1985; Al Unser, 1987; and 
Mears, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi won in a PC-18 that Penske sold to the Patrick-Ganassi team last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Mears will start in the middle of the front row, with the surprising Dutchman, 
Arie Luyendyk, on the outside. Mears will be making a record 10th front-row 
start. He and Bobby Unser had been tied with nine each. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan is in ninth position, on the outside of the third row. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not complaining," Sullivan, 40, said. "Rick and Emmo (Fittipaldi) came 
here in March and tested and got ahead of me. I was at home having a baby -- or 
rather, my girlfriend was having a baby -- so I missed that and fell behind. 
But all the guys put their heads together after each race or each practice, and 
I feel like my setup for the race is just the same as theirs." 
</P>
<P>
In the second row is another former winner, Bobby Rahal, with the Andrettis, 
son Michael in the middle and father Mario, who won back in 1969 and is still 
looking for No. 2, on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a much closer race than it was last year," Fittipaldi said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's race was decided on the next-to-last lap when Fittipaldi, trying to 
pass Al Unser Jr. for the lead, touched wheels with Unser's Lola and sent him 
into the wall. However, the rest of the field was six laps or more behind. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi said: "I would say you have about seven, eight drivers with a good 
chance of winning: Rick, Danny, Al Jr., Mario, Michael, Bobby and Arie, he's 
been a surprise to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a good feeling about my own car and my own chances, but I think I will 
have close competition the whole race." 
</P>
<P>
The younger Unser, who had been favored to win the pole after an unofficial lap 
of 228.502 m.p.h. during practice, will start in the seventh position after 
being able to average only 220.920 in four qualifying laps. 
</P>
<P>
"Qualifying was a setback," Unser said. "I made some changes (to the car) I 
shouldn't have done and I learned from it. A.J. (Foyt) kind of put it best. He 
said he made some changes, rolled the dice and won. I rolled the dice and it 
came up craps. I learned from it and we'll go on from there. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't second-guessed last year at all. It's still with me. The day I lose 
it is the day I reach 198 laps again. I would like to complete the 500 miles 
here, which I have yet to do." 
</P>
<P>
Rahal, Unser's best friend and teammate on the Galles-Kraco team, believes that 
repeating in the 500 is no more difficult than trying to repeat in any other 
race. Rahal won in 1986 in a race delayed one week by rain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult enough to win here one year, much less two," Rahal said. "Five 
hundred miles is a long way to go, and the length of the race multiplies the 
problem of repeating. Multiple wins at the same track, like mine at Laguna Seca 
(1985-86-87) or Little Al's at Long Beach (1988-89-90) are not the norm. They 
are unique. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, though, Emmo is highly motivated and seems hungrier than ever to 
win again. When you've won something, you know what it tastes like and you want 
to taste it again. He will be very tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
One thing is fairly probable, and that is that a 1990 model British-built car, 
powered by a British-built Chevrolet Ilmor engine, will win. 
</P>
<P>
The first three rows are all Chevrolets. The Penske trio of Fittipaldi, Mears 
and Sullivan are driving Penske cars made in Poole, England. The other six -- 
including Foyt -- are driving Lolas made in Cambridgeshire, England. 
</P>
<P>
Foyt will be making a record 33rd consecutive start in the 500. At 55, he also 
will become the oldest driver to start the race, surpassing Dick Simon, who was 
54 years 8 months in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolets have won the first two races, Mears at Phoenix and Unser at Long 
Beach, and in both races the first seven finishers were Chevys. 
</P>
<P>
The only Chevrolet not in the first three rows will be driven by rookie Eddie 
Cheever, who took over for the Ganassi team after Fittipaldi left. Cheever, who 
drove for nine years in Formula One, is the fastest qualifier of three rookies. 
The others are Scott Goodyear and Dean Hall.

<P>
A lawsuit seeking to overturn a state policy that denies foster care payments 
to children placed in homes with relatives was filed in federal court by the 
city-county of San Francisco and the National Center for Youth Law. Deukmejian 
Administration officials estimate foster care support would cost an additional 
$50 million for 11,000 children who fall within this category. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Senate Health Committee approved and sent to the Appropriations 
Committee a bill by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) to accomplish the 
same goal. Gov. George Deukmejian has vetoed such legislation in the past, but 
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last fall ruled in an Oregon case that 
denying foster care funding to children who live with close relatives was 
unconstitutional. "If we don't do it in the Legislature, the courts are going 
to make us do it," said Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), who chairs the 
Health Committee.

U.S. ACCUSES 12 OF SMUGGLING POT

A federal grand jury has indicted 12 people, accusing them of being members of 
a Tulare County-based marijuana smuggling ring that has been operating for more 
than a year. The indictments charged the 12 with 22 counts each of conspiracy 
and smuggling marijuana. U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
David Levi said members of the alleged ring, which operated in three states, 
brought more than 1,000 pounds of marijuana into the United States from Mexico 
in 11 trips between January, 1989, and Dec. 31, 1989, by concealing it in 
secret compartments built into motor homes. He said the marijuana was smuggled 
across the border crossings in Texas, Arizona and California. Levi said Amador 
Barragan, 35, and Alberto Barragan, 32, both of Porterville, were the leaders 
of the smuggling ring. All suspects are in custody, Levi said.

MIRA COSTA TOPS EDISON TO FINISH 22-0 SEASON

"Unbeatable?" Mira Costa High volleyball Coach Mike Cook asked his team before 
the season started. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbeaten," the team answered back Saturday night at Marina High. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa, ranked No. 1 in the nation in boys' volleyball by USA Today all 
season, proved it belongs there by capturing the Southern Section 4-A Division 
championship with a 15-6, 15-12, 15-11 victory over Edison Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Mira Costa might have fulfilled the prophecy of senior setter 
Canyon Ceman, who said before the season that the Mustangs wanted to be "the 
best high school volleyball team that ever played." 
</P>
<P>
Cook was asked after the match how perfection felt. 
</P>
<P>
"Perfect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs (22-0) lost only two games all season -- those coming in a 
preseason victory over Edison in March. 
</P>
<P>
In that match, Mira Costa won the first two games, only to have Edison rally 
back to tie and turn the match into a three-hour marathon. 
</P>
<P>
It was easier for Mira Costa this time around, however. The Mustangs, who have 
five starters that are taller than 6-foot-3, played a more physical match than 
Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa won the first five points, three of them on Edison hitting errors. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa's David Swatik, a 6-4 outside hitter that Volleyball Monthly 
magazine has called the best prep player in the country, put the first game 
away with a towering block. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (17-2) rallied back to take the first five points of the second game, 
but Mira Costa's Brian Thurston started an eight-point run for his team with a 
kill, and the Mustangs led the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
The game ended when Edison's Steve Snyder missed on a spike attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The third game see-sawed, with Edison pulling even, 9-9, when Pat Ivie's kill 
attempt sailed long. But Mike Ashenfelter, Mira Costa's 6-7 middle blocker, 
soared high above the net to put down a block to snap the tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs got their 14th point of the game when Ashenfelter served an ace 
off the arm of Edison's Karl van Reusen. 
</P>
<P>
The point that clinched perfection for Mira Costa also came on an ace -- 
Thruston's spike that van Reusen couldn't dig.

THE RUSH TO CAPITALIZE ON GLASNOST; 
</P>
<P>
THE MAJOR U.S. PLAYERS ARE VYING INTENSELY TO IMPORT SOVIET PERFORMERS -- AND, 
SUDDENLY, ARTISTIC FAMINE BECOMES MARKETING GLUT 
</P>

<P>
They know each other quite well for all three are rivals in the same field -- 
doing their best to capitalize on the new, open Soviet Union by importing music 
and dance performers into the United States. They conduct business in that 
tight little enclave of mid-town Manhattan that's virtually a baton's throw 
from Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, and these days might just as easily bump 
into each other on Moscow's Gorky Street as on Manhattan's West 57th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Of course Lee Lamont, 58, president of ICM Artists Ltd.; Charles Dillingham 
III, 47, president of the Entertainment Corp. U.S.A., and R. Douglas Sheldon, 
48, a vice president and division head at Columbia Artists Management Inc., 
knew each other before glasnost. Only now their agencies' rivalry has 
intensified. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't lunch," Sheldon says. 
</P>
<P>
During the rush to import Russian and other Soviet artists in the 4 1/2 years 
since former President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev 
renewed cultural ties, these three agencies have moved to the top in snapping 
up the best of classical and traditional Soviet artists. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a downside in all this, it is excess. After a virtual six-year 
absence, there was such a rush for Soviet performing artists in music, dance 
and theater that agencies now face the problem of glut. Agencies can control 
what they bring but not what their rivals bring. Already in dance there have 
been conflicts. And notes Sheldon: "You face the possibility that three 
different orchestras could come in the same concert season. I don't think 
there's any agency in New York who believes the market could handle all of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Cultural exchange had essentially shut down with the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan at the end of 1979, and that coincided with the expiration of a 
cultural treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. So, when things 
opened up again, a lot of people saw -- or thought they saw -- a golden 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly the United States got Russian fever," Lamont said. "Everybody -- 
whether it was a manufacturer of goods or a promoter of rock troupes -- decided 
they were going to become very wealthy by going to the Soviet Union, getting a 
contract and presenting attractions. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet authorities happily cooperated, and still do. In their rush for hard 
foreign currency, Sheldon noted, "they'll sell absolutely anything to 
absolutely anybody . . . . I don't even know the names of the (buyers here) 
because they come out of nowhere. Any organization that would put up hard cash. 
Or who they thought could put up hard cash. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Giving the rivalry an edge is the fact that like American and other Western 
artists, the Soviets have gotten into the habit of defecting from one American 
management to another. A significant change under perestroika, or 
restructuring, is that increasingly Soviet artists and companies have a say as 
to who their Western managers will be. 
</P>
<P>
While money is always a motivator, there are other forces in this particular 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"Direct From the U.S.S.R." on the bill brings a certain amount of prestige and 
visibility. And then there is always the emotional factor. "This is a country 
that has been shut off in many cases," says Dillingham, "and their artists 
deserve to perform in the West and be seen." 
</P>
<P>
But primarily it is the art. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally they have produced fantastic artists -- artists of the highest 
international standard," explains Sheldon. "The history is full of these people 
whether it's (cellist Mstislav) Rostropovich or (violinist David) Oistrakh or 
(pianists Emil) Gilels or (Sviatoslav) Richter. And no dance companies in the 
world had the renown (of) the Kirov and the Bolshoi . . . . Of course, the 
Russian culture is one that is to most Americans a little mysterious." 
</P>
<P>
And for American audiences getting over the Cold War, there is something heady 
in hearing a Soviet company, having learned the words phonetically, singing 
"America, the Beautiful," as did a folk dance troupe from Soviet Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
For nine years -- longer than its rivals -- Columbia was treated, Sheldon said, 
as if it was "persona non grata" with the Soviet Union, having been blamed for 
the 1979 defections of a number of Bolshoi Ballet members including principal 
Alexander Godunov. Allowed back in early last year after some quiet 
negotiating, the 60-year-old agency is fast becoming a major player once more. 
</P>
<P>
The largest classical artist management agency in the world, with nearly 800 
clients and 14 divisions, Columbia carries considerable clout. As Sheldon, who 
does most of Columbia's negotiations with the Soviets likes to note: "My 
division is larger than some artist agencies -- 77 clients or something like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia has already signed the U.S.S.R. State Symphony and its chief conductor 
Yevgeny Svetlanov (formerly with ICM) for a major national tour in early 1991, 
and the Soviet Philharmonic Orchestra and its chief conductor Gennady 
Rozhdestvensky (formerly with Entertainment Corp.) for a tour in early 1992. 
The agency now lists the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra and the Leningrad Kirov 
Orchestra and is looking to add ethnic dance companies, balalaika orchestras, 
chamber orchestras, vocalists and instrumentalists. "You have to work at this 
all the time," Sheldon says. 
</P>
<P>
Since glasnost, ICM Artists, with about 200 clients, has been in the forefront 
of the Soviet market with nine company tours. ICM got back in during the summer 
of 1986 with the Kirov Ballet (now with Entertainment Corp.). The 14-year-old 
agency is a direct descendant of the company founded by impresario Sol Hurok, 
who in the 1950s and '60s essentially had the Soviet show to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Probably ICM's best-known Soviet client is the Moiseyev Dance Company, which, 
in 1958 under Hurok, became the first Soviet troupe in decades to break the 
cultural ice. The Moiseyev returns for its third trip since glasnost in the 
fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Besides about 15 soloists, ICM has toured the Leningrad Symphony Orchestra, the 
Moscow Philharmonic and next season brings in the Leningrad Philharmonic, the 
Lezginka Folk Dance Company, the Moscow Soloists and the 101-year-old Andreyev 
Balalaika Orchestra -- the old Royal Court Orchestra. "I really had no 
intentions of bringing a balalaika orchestra. Balalaikas are native instruments 
that look like moons . . . ," Lamont said. "But then I heard them. They invited 
me to a recording session when I was in Leningrad." 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment Corp., the fast sprinter in the field, has brought in seven 
Soviet companies and 15 Soviet soloists starting with conductor Yuri Temirkanov 
and pianist Nikolai Petrov -- the first under the new exchange treaty in 
January, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The agency -- formerly known as Classical Artists International -- makes a 
major splash this summer co-presenting (with James M. Nederlander) the Bolshoi 
Ballet in a 7-city, 11-week tour -- which is on a somewhat grander scale than 
the 1987 Bolshoi tour brought by Metropolitan Opera. Entertainment Corp., with 
50 clients overall, is also sponsoring for return visits for the Kirov Ballet 
(mainly in the Midwest) and the Georgian State Dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Bolstering its prestige and perhaps its coffers, the parent London-based 
Entertainment Corp. Group has signed separate six-year exclusive agreements 
with the Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow, the Kirov Theatre of Leningrad, and 
Gosconcert -- the state artists agency -- to develop marketing and promotional 
opportunities, including jewelry, perfume, a line of clothing, books and 
videos. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement is 60% for the theaters -- which could use hard foreign 
currency -- and 40% for the agency. If this seems larger than what might be 
considered a normal 20% commission, company co-chairman Peter Brightman and 
Victoria Charlton explained at a press conference that they're responsible for 
all investments including start-up costs, so far amounting to over $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
The British husband-and wife team have been dealing with the Soviets since they 
founded their agency in London in 1982. According to Dillingham, the Soviets 
suggested that Brightman and Charlton open an office in the United States. "And 
you can do some business," he quoted the Soviets as saying. "Not all of our 
business but some business because we trust you and enjoy doing business with 
you." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a business relationship," Dillingham explained. "Once you have a business 
relationship, it's just like where you get your cleaning done. You keep going 
until you have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
The Bolshoi and the Kirov did not become clients in this country until last 
summer -- about the time that Dillingham, who had been general manager and 
executive director of American Ballet Theatre for eight years, joined 
Entertainment Corp. The agency, Dillingham said, had to build "a relationship 
with the Bolshoi and the Kirov companies first of all, and with Gosconcert and 
the Ministry of Culture . . . . We had to convince all these people. It didn't 
just fall in our lap." 
</P>
<P>
Is there big money to be made in capitalizing on glasnost? 
</P>
<P>
Lamont, who began working for Hurok in 1957, notes that overall "your (profit) 
margin is very small compared to what it was in the '50s and '60s, and the 
costs are going up. It used to be relatively inexpensive to tour a group. Never 
mind hotels. . . . Union costs eat away most of your profits. Travel -- you 
have to fly somebody. We have a very large country. You can't bus tours around 
the United States. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon explained that normally in the West, managers make all the arrangements 
for booking an artist or orchestra with presenters of classical music events 
and take a 20% commission. "The normal arrangement is an orchestra receives all 
fees minus the commission and pays all bills. The Soviet arrangement is a 
buy-sell. . . . They always wanted to sell for a given fee and make you pay all 
the expenses possible." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "In the early days, or part of the early days when Hurok did it, he'd 
have to pay to Gosconcert $1,000 for Rostropovich, and he'd sell for $5,000, 
and he was able to make some money. And, when he brought the Bolshoi tour, he 
was able to buy it very inexpensively and make tons of money. (Then) the 
Soviets became more sophisticated, the costs kept going up and it became really 
impossible to do that . . . . What you hope to do is perhaps create a scenario 
where perhaps you make the same 20%." 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not fail-safe," he noted. Touring a major Soviet orchestra costs 
$55,000 per concert -- including the fee and all expenses. He figures a likely 
profit is 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Lamont says that costs can be three times as much as the basic fee and she's 
satisfied "if I can pull 8-12% on an attraction -- an orchestra or a dance 
ensemble -- because of the costs. The margins are small but that's OK, this is 
fine. . . . I also represent some major artists and I get commissions out of 
them. I'm not just making my money out of the Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
As manager/producers or co-producers on many tours, Entertainment Corp. -- and 
sometimes ICM -- assumes other financial risks including rental of the hall, 
local advertising, local production costs, and myriad details. "It's 
financially riskier," Dillingham said, "but if you're successful at it the 
rewards are greater." 
</P>
<P>
On individual artists, the agency executives say they sometimes reach the 
standard 20% profit. 
</P>
<P>
On the negative side, there is the problem of market glut, particularly in 
dance. This year at least 10 companies have come in or are scheduled to come. 
They are: the Bolshoi, the Kirov, the Georgian State Dance Company, the Rustavi 
Company (also from Soviet Georgia), the Don Cossack Song and Dance Company, 
Lezginka from Daghestan in the Caucuses north of Georgia, the Koslov Youth 
Ensemble, the Moscow Chamber Ballet, Leningrad Ballet -- and the Leningrad 
State Music Hall Dance Company, currently performing at City Center Theater in 
New York. That last troupe was brought here by Leon Zemshman, a car-leasing 
company executive in Queens, and an emigre from the Soviet republic of 
Moldavia. 
</P>
<P>
ICM's Lamont, who said she was having a problem "properly booking" Lezginka 
this fall because the Georgian State Dance Company is also coming this fall, 
discussed her recent tour of the Don Cossacks. "They did, in some places, very, 
very well and in other places very, very poorly. It did not do well in Chicago 
(in March). There was an article in the Tribune which said basically it's a 
good company, they kick as high as all the other folk dance companies, but do 
we need another Russian attraction?" 
</P>
<P>
At Entertainment Corp., Dillingham said "the people here who have been booking 
the Georgian State Dance Company have heard from some people (who) feel there 
have been too many, or enough, Russian ethnic dance companies in (certain) 
cities . . . . There is, either in some cities or in some art forms, a glut. 
But the market will rectify that . . . if you look at it over a five-year 
spectrum. And there probably are some areas that haven't seen the Georgian 
State dancers. But, instead of going to the old circuit everybody knows about, 
you've got to find new places to go." 
</P>
<P>
John Ballard, president of Space Agency Inc. in Salt Lake City, who brought 
Soviet jazz groups in the early years of glasnost, co-sponsored the Red Army 
Chorus tour last year with Atlanta entertainment promoter Alex Cooley and 
Canadian John Cripton. Neither Ballard nor Cooley has any immediate plans to 
bring more Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
In fact Ballard said he recently canceled a prospective tour by the Krasnoyarsk 
dance troupe from Siberia because it's simply "too much." He also said he 
turned down an offer to bring a folk ensemble from Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hughes, president of International Attractions Inc. in La Jolla, who has 
brought a number of Soviet dance and acrobatic troupes since last summer, 
estimates that he will lose several hundred thousand dollars on the Rustavi's 
recent massive 26-city, 12-week tour. The tour, which he produced, ended April 
27. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes blames the glut. "Theatrically, they were an enormous success; we didn't 
have a bad review anywhere. Financially, I think we were up against too many 
folk dance companies coming through at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
But Hughes, who is bringing the Koslov this fall, says he has done well on 
other attractions like the Soviet Acrobatic Revue. He was back in the Soviet 
Union earlier this month to finalize arrangements for the Obraztsov Puppet 
Theatre, his enthusiasm undiminished. "There's not been a glut of puppets." 
</P>
<P>
It's "a mess, a total mess" dealing over there, says Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
It's "confusing . . . unsettled," notes Lamont. 
</P>
<P>
And Dillingham points out that "the rules are changing, the laws are changing, 
the regulators are changing . . . (but) once you are attuned to that, business 
can be conducted." 
</P>
<P>
For the Soviet artist, the agents agree, it's better. Gosconcert, a division of 
the Ministry of Culture -- gos standing for government or state -- no longer 
holds the monopoly on who can perform abroad and for how much. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a question of (us) making money," Lamont said. "These are people 
who have been locked up or limited in their touring . . . . I have to tell you 
I really feel for these people. I see the lines they stand on. I see the way 
they live. I know the way they've been paid in the past. Gosconcert may have 
received $3,000; that artist might have gotten $250 . . . . We're talking about 
people coming out, sharing their arts, and there's some very great art in the 
Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Gosconcert's monopoly ended 13 months ago. Artists can go through other 
government agencies such as the cultural ministries in the various republics, 
through certain unions, through an organization called Sovinart run by a former 
top official at Gosconcert and through the state record company Melodia. 
</P>
<P>
Artists can also have exit permits arranged through certain cooperatives -- 
government-licensed private businesses -- such as Unex, an export/import 
company whose business is recycling paper goods or trash. In La Jolla, Hughes 
flashes a business card from the Moscow-based cooperative. Through Unex, he 
pays his representative in Moscow -- Galena Bokareva who worked at Gosconcert 
-- who will help bring the Koslov Youth Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Phillips, director of international operations for Entertainment 
Corp.'s parent company, said he believed "(conductor Gennady) Rozhdestvensky 
was instrumental in getting the legislation changed." 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1988, after reported mistakes in scheduling and repertory, the 
conductor canceled several U.S. appearances claiming that he did not have to 
abide by the contractual arrangements made by Gosconcert. There had also been 
an apparent dispute over his fee. Brightman later revealed that after the 
dispute was resolved, Rozhdestvensky's share was "more like 50-50" -- as 
opposed to his previous share of only 20%. And he got an open visa. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor's current contractual relationships in the Soviet Union are 
unclear. Asked whether he still has the 50-50 arrangement, Columbia Artists 
President Ronald Wilford -- who now handles the account -- allowed: "I don't 
know that he pays Gosconcert. I don't even know if he's with Gosconcert." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly Soviet artists and companies consult with their Western managers, 
though the actual contracts are drawn up by Gosconcert or some other agency. 
"Now they mostly all have a say," notes Lamont. " 'We only want to do four 
concerts a week, we won't travel more than four hours on the day of a concert' 
-- that's getting closer to the European/American level of working, where at 
least the artists have some control over what they do." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile there has been a change at the top of the Ministry of Culture. The 
new minister is Nikolai Gubenko, an actor at Moscow's Taganka Theater who was 
playing the title role in "Boris Godunov" at the time of his appointment last 
November. The year before, Gosconcert -- an arm of the ministry -- also got a 
new chief: Vladimir Panchenko, a top official of the Composers Union. 
</P>
<P>
"He speaks very good English," Dillingham said of Gubenko. "Very quiet -- not 
shy, but reserved. And he's very serious about continuing the perestroika, 
restructuring the whole arts infrastructure in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Dillingham disclosed that at Gubenko's request, his agency prepared two 
reports. "He asked us to give him a comprehensive report on the contractual 
relationships between performing artists and their employers and unions in this 
country, and secondly on social welfare programs as they impact performing 
artists -- unemployment insurance, health insurance, disability . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The reports were sent to Moscow in January. 
</P>
<P>
In late March, Lamont was in Moscow for a seminar at the Ministry of Culture. 
"I had suggested to USIA (United States Information Agency) and the Soviet 
Embassy that we carry on something like this," she said. "With the co-opting 
and privatization of enterprises in the Soviet Union, there are suddenly a lot 
of people who are getting into touring or presentation of the performing arts 
who've never had to go through the mechanics before and truly don't know the 
steps that have to be taken . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We dealt with the crowded market, we dealt with contracts, we dealt with 
negotiations," Lamont said. "Basically the Russians have always felt that we in 
the United States are there to cheat them out of money . . . just a suspicion 
that exists that 'you're trying to take advantage of us,' that 'you're really 
making all of this money and it should be coming to us' without understanding 
or ever having had to deal with expenses." 
</P>
<P>
And Sheldon explained that "it's almost impossible to find someone who speaks 
with real authority. Previously if you spoke to Gosconcert, if you made a deal, 
that was it" -- though he also pointed out that there have been times when an 
artist was promised and failed to show when the plane landed at Kennedy 
Airport. "Now they're in an era where they can't be authoritative. They have to 
go and get the artist's consent just like we've had to do for decades . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They don't trust the West," Sheldon continued, "so they always think if 
somebody offers them something, there's a reason they didn't offer them more . 
. . . And when you say, 'Do we have an agreement?' and they say, 'Yes,' you 
really have to find out if that means anything. 
</P>
<P>
"What's hard is that their need and their drive for hard currency make the 
negotiations a little difficult," he added. "And they have had 70 years, maybe 
more, of distrust. Of themselves as well . . . . You never know who is the 
informer, you never knew who was your friend, so there is a psychology of 
mistrust." 
</P>
<P>
With the street-smart scrappiness of someone who rose from a secretary to the 
head of her company, ICM's Lamont laces her conversation with little needles at 
her major agency rivals. She's hardly alone. Going from one agency to the 
other, you hear bits of sniping on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
Puffing away at a cigarillo, talking about her tour with Yevgeny Svetlanov and 
the U.S.S.R. State Symphony (billed then as the Moscow State Symphony), she 
whispered: "He's now with CAMI (Columbia Artists). For a long time, Gosconcert 
would not work with Columbia, and then they started to work with them." And she 
said the "logical thing" for Gosconcert to say to Columbia was, " 'Moscow 
State, you can have that . . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't bid for the Bolshoi or the Kirov," she said, "although it was put up 
on the block. 'You can have it if you pay X dollars.' . . . (The amount) I'm 
not going to quote. I can tell you it was above the logical market value. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Of the Bolshoi, she adds: "There aren't the big stars there used to be . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Over at Columbia, using a cigarette for emphasis, Sheldon had already raised 
the matter of the Svetlanov acquisition. "Svetlanov, who had toured with ICM, 
wouldn't do it anymore for reasons I don't know. He just wouldn't do it," he 
said with lawyerly deliberation. "He wanted to be in Columbia. He made his 
decision before I ever went to Moscow. . . . So it was incumbent on Gosconcert 
to get him with another tour manager for the future, so literally that was the 
first thing they presented . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The same applied to violinist Vladimir Spivakov and his 28-ensemble Moscow 
Virtuosi chamber orchestra, which had been with Entertainment Corp. "Once the 
Soviets would deal with Columbia," noted Sheldon, "he wanted to be back. His 
mind had never been different." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon quickly moves onto a tour in early 1989 handled by Entertainment Corp. 
"The Osipov Balalaika Orchestra should have been a success. We brought it a 
couple of times in the '70s with a lot of success . . . . I have been told by 
different people, including some from Classical Artists, that the tour lost 
$300,000." 
</P>
<P>
Dillingham says that the Osipov tour happened before he went to the company 
last summer. On the Bolshoi he dismisses the notion that the company went to 
the highest bidder as well as the devaluation of its company. "Look at the 
those (star) names on our press release." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be very professional," he says. "We're not going to run down 
other people's tours or tell you that this company or that company's been doing 
lousy business. . . . It's an insult to the artist and may not have been his 
fault . . . . You're not going to get ICM to tell you, 'Oh yeah, we took a bath 
on that.' " 
</P>
<P>
And about their "active" competition, Dillingham laughed. "Competition is 
competition. That's what perestroika is all about. We're an embodiment of 
Western capitalistic competition."

HITCHCOCK'S THROWAWAY MASTERPIECE; 
</P>
<P>
THIRTY YEARS AGO, ALFRED HITCHCOCK TOOK A MODEST TALE OF A PSYCHOPATHIC MOTEL 
KEEPER AND HIS EVER-PRESENT MOM AND TURNED IT INTO A HIT HORROR CLASSIC. IT 
MADE TAKING A SHOWER A TEST OF NERVES FOR YEARS TO COME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"The Cape Canaveral Monsters," "The Stranglers of Bombay," "Mill of the Stone 
Women," "Circus of Horrors." Let's be kind; 1960 was not shaping up as a banner 
year for horror movies. 
</P>
<P>
So no one expected much when Alfred Hitchcock, in a seeming act of creative 
slumming, chose -- as his last official act for Paramount Pictures -- to direct 
a disturbing, offbeat tale of a psychopathic motel keeper and his ever-present 
mom in an adaptation of the Robert Bloch novel "Psycho." 
</P>
<P>
"Psycho" opened nationally on June 16, 1960, and screen horror has not been the 
same since. Remember . . . the classic shower sequence, Bernard Herrmann's 
screaming string score, the gritty black-and-white shadowy images deftly 
choreographed by the inventive director. All have combined, nearly 30 years 
after its release, to make what was initially intended as a low-budget 
"programmer" the seminal film in a new era of cinema horror. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a classic," says Jonathan Kuntz, an assistant professor of 
film and television at UCLA. "It was one of the first horror films to make the 
horror come out of the American family." 
</P>
<P>
Critic and author Leonard Maltin wrote in his "TV Movies and Video Guide": "The 
picture, despite decades of parody and imitation, has lost none of its power to 
manipulate audience's emotions." 
</P>
<P>
But "Psycho" is not a consensus masterwork. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think 'Psycho' was Hitchcock's best work," claims actress Vera Miles, 
who played Lila Crane in "Psycho" and appeared in Hitchcock's earlier film "The 
Wrong Man." "He did so much better work but, unfortunately, 'Psycho' has become 
his trademark and I think that's sad." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its standing on individual hit lists, "Psycho" has left indelible 
impressions in the minds of subsequent filmmakers, those shameless -- and often 
unabashed -- imitators of the Hitchcock style. Brian de Palma has rejected 
parallels drawn by critics between his and Hitchcock's style, but few others 
have objected to their films being given that evocative label "Hitchcockian 
thriller." 
</P>
<P>
"Psycho" has done less well at spawning sequels than imitations. "Psycho II," 
released in 1983, and "Psycho III," released three years later, didn't remind 
many people of the original, even though Anthony Perkins reprised the role of 
Norman Bates in both outings. Universal Pictures is now planning "Psycho IV." 
Meanwhile, the pilot to a sitcom, "Bates Hotel," didn't cause a ripple on the 
Nielsen ratings. (At the same time, Robert Bloch has continued to sequel his 
original book, as well. Part three in his series -- "Psycho House" -- was 
published in February.) 
</P>
<P>
Whatever made "Psycho" work, and most people think it was Alfred Hitchcock, 
nothing has worked quite so well since. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 'Psycho' bothered people on a level that the horror films that came 
before and after never even attempted," says Joseph Stefano, who wrote the 
original "Psycho" screenplay. " 'Psycho' gave us nice people who we learned to 
like and then forced us to watch them being brutally murdered by another 
seemingly nice person, Norman Bates, who was also easy to care about." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Louis J. West, a professor of psychiatry at UCLA, says that "Psycho" was 
not the first movie to address the subject of homicidal maniacs, "but it was a 
film that very much surprised people. What had the greatest effect was the 
shower sequence. The blood running down the drain was a major startle effect 
that broke the usual pattern of expectation that people in 1960 had. You also 
could never be sure who was wielding the knife, which added to the surprise." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the most daring thing Hitchcock did was to kill off the lead 
character, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), in the first reel," says Saul Bass, a 
graphic designer who storyboarded and, with Hitchcock's assistance, directed 
the famous shower sequence. "That was the most shocking thing in the film and 
is still considered an outrageous notion in today's filmmaking circles." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA professor Kuntz agrees with Bass's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"The death of Marion in the shower scene is an incredible moment in the film 
because it leaves the audience wondering who they are going to identify with 
next. And the only one they are left to identify with is somebody who turns out 
to be a maniac. It is a style Hitchcock toyed with in the films 'Vertigo' and 
'Rear Window' but finally introduced in 'Psycho' in a totally unique way." 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, who was already an established mystery and horror writer prior to 
writing "Psycho," says the movie "made people realize that it was possible to 
utilize non-supernatural and alien elements as sources of suspense and horror." 
</P>
<P>
"Psycho's" screen birth came about in 1959 as the result of a professional 
challenge to Alfred Hitchcock by Alfred Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
"Hitchcock was just coming off the picture 'North By Northwest,' " remembers 
"Psycho" assistant director Hilton Green. "That had been Hitchcock's 
highest-budgeted picture to date and he wanted to prove that he could make a 
quality film and not spend a lot of money." "Psycho" was made for about 
$800,000. 
</P>
<P>
Stefano claims that Hitchcock's desire to do a film quick and dirty was 
inspired, in large part, by the work being done at the time by Roger Corman. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Hitchcock telling me, 'There's a company called American 
International Pictures that is doing fantastic things with suspense and 
thriller movies made for under $1 million.' He wondered what would happen if he 
put the same hand that usually got multimillion-dollar budgets to a film with a 
budget of well under a million." 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle for Hitchcock's vision arrived in the form of a recommendation that 
the director read "Psycho," a fictional story loosely based on the real-life 
grizzly murders and mutilations committed by a Michigan man named Ed Gein. 
Hitchcock fell in love with what he viewed as Bloch's "workaday characters and 
dingy locales" and purchased the film rights to the novel in May, 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, who says he had no idea his novel had the potential to be made into a 
movie, was happily surprised when he discovered someone had bought the film 
rights. He was pleased when he discovered it was Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
"The rights had been bought through a blind bid and so I had no idea who had 
bought it," he said. "When I found out it was Hitchcock, I was greatly relieved 
because I felt he was the only one who could adequately handle the material." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Bloch recalls that Paramount did not share his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was looked upon by Paramount as a potential bomb and so the studio put 
every possible roadblock in Hitch's path. They gave him a small budget and told 
him there was no sound stage on the Paramount lot for him to use." 
</P>
<P>
Stefano, likewise, remembers "that Paramount felt the movie would not do very 
well or have much of an impact." 
</P>
<P>
Hitchcock, who was shooting his TV series "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" for 
Universal, finished "Psycho" for Paramount -- using his TV crew -- but never 
worked for the studio again. (Universal eventually acquired the rights to 
"Psycho" and the sequels have been Universal productions.) James P. Cavanaugh 
was assigned to write the "Psycho" script, but when Cavanaugh's first draft did 
not measure up, Hitchcock brought in Joseph Stefano, who had just written the 
well-reviewed film "The Black Orchid" and Playhouse 90 TV movie "Made in 
Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Stefano read Bloch's novel and, during his initial meetings with Hitchcock, 
expressed some problems he had with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Bloch's novel started with Marion Crane arriving at the motel and immediately 
being killed," he remembers. "My feeling was that, since I did not know 
anything about this girl, I wasn't going to care about her when she was killed. 
So we backed the story up a bit and learned something about her so that when 
she was killed it would have more impact. 
</P>
<P>
"I also had a problem with the fact that Norman Bates, in the novel, was a 
40-year-old drunk who looked like Rod Steiger. He was a character who was so 
obvious and unsympathetic that it wouldn't take long for people to figure out 
who the killer was. Hitchcock came back with 'What if Anthony Perkins played 
Norman?' It brought to mind an image that I knew would really upset people," 
says Stefano. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, then 27, was a star on the rise and, like Hitchcock, owed Paramount 
one more film on an old contract. Perkins readily agreed to what was a chancy 
career move. 
</P>
<P>
For the pivotal role of Marion Crane, Hitchcock considered such actresses as 
Eva Marie Saint and Shirley Jones before deciding on Janet Leigh. Vera Miles, 
fresh off the film "Five Branded Women" and consequently forced to wear a wig 
throughout the making of "Psycho," agreed to the secondary role of Lila and 
claims to have not been bothered by the film's subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I read the book but was not concerned because I knew Hitchcock's style was not 
overt," she recalls. "I never felt Hitchcock would be guilty of extreme gore 
and eyeballs popping out of the screen." 
</P>
<P>
"Psycho" began filming on Nov. 30, 1959, on Soundstage 18 at Universal Studios 
under a cloak of secrecy. Hitchcock insisted on a closed set at all times and, 
in order to keep the film's title secret, insisted that all in-house 
communication regarding the film be tagged with the code name "Wimpy." A lot of 
secrecy for a film that even those connected with the project felt was headed 
for B-movie oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody working on the film had a clue that 'Psycho' would end up being a 
classic," says assistant director Green. "As the film progressed, however, we 
did begin to get the feeling that it would end up being more than just an 
exploitation picture. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, 'Psycho' was typical of Hitchcock in that he was trying . . . to 
take a sequence or two and attempt, with a camera move or a different angle, to 
achieve something different. I know there was a lot of discussion about how to 
shoot the scene where Arbogast comes up the stairs and is attacked by Mother. 
Hitchcock did not want Mother's true identity revealed at that point and so a 
device was designed to lift the camera up and behind Mother and shoot her from 
the back. And then, of course, there was the shower scene." 
</P>
<P>
Bass recalls that the montage effect he designed for that scene was contrary to 
Hitchcock's normal bag of camera tricks. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the shower scene was laid out was very un-Hitchcock. Hitchcock loved 
long convoluted shots that contained a lot of tracking and camera moves. I 
wasn't sure how Hitchcock was going to take my notion of fast cutting and 
montage, but he seemed very happy with it and that's the way it was shot." 
</P>
<P>
Like many great movie scenes, the question of who actually directed the shower 
sequence has become the stuff of legends. Hilton Green says that Hitchcock 
definitely directed the scene. Other rumors point to an unnamed German film 
crew. Many, including Saul Bass, claim that Saul Bass directed it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the set the day the scene was scheduled to be shot," says Bass. 
"Hitchcock had me set up the first shot. When it came time to film, Hitchcock 
told me, 'You know what to do, go ahead.' I swallowed hard and said 'roll 
camera.' Hitch sat back in the director's chair, nodded his head occasionally 
and encouraged me." 
</P>
<P>
"Psycho," nine days over its projected 27-day shooting schedule, wrapped 
principal photography on Feb. 1, 1960. Hitchcock expected to have a battle on 
his hands with the movie industry censors over a second of nudity in the shower 
scene, but it never materialized, and by late May, less than four weeks before 
the film's scheduled release, the director and Paramount got down to the 
business of marketing. Uppermost in Hitchcock's mind was the fear that the 
first audience to see the film would promptly give away the ending and kill the 
picture's suspense. 
</P>
<P>
To make sure the film got off to a cleanly suspenseful start, he talked the 
studio into not screening "Psycho" for critics prior to its release. He also 
instituted an admissions policy that was daring then but common afterward: "No 
one . . . but no one will be admitted to the theater after the start of each 
performance of 'Psycho.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hitchcock was not above exploiting the film's saucier elements. Prominent on 
"Psycho" posters was the image of Janet Leigh in her bra with the shirtless 
John Gavin. 
</P>
<P>
"Psycho" opened in New York's DeMille and Baronet Theaters on June 16 and was 
an immediate sensation. In California, police were called in to unsnarl traffic 
outside a drive-in theater where the film was playing. Patrons standing in a 
driving rain outside the Woods Theater in Chicago threatened to tear it down if 
they were not allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
The critics were not as impressed. "A blot on an honorable career," wrote New 
York Times film critic Bosley Crowther. By the end of the year, Crowther had 
changed his mind and listed "Psycho" among the year's top 10 films. The 
reviewer for the London Daily Express was equally unkind. "It is sad to see a 
really big man (Hitchcock) make a fool of himself by dredging this kind of 
cesspool." 
</P>
<P>
"Psycho's" early critical battering wasn't helped when two young men committed 
murders that they claimed were inspired by repeated viewings of "Psycho." 
Hitchcock's response to the killings: "These boys have killed before. I want to 
know what movie they saw those times or did they do it after drinking chocolate 
milk?" 
</P>
<P>
Bad reviews and alleged copy cat killings did not stop "Psycho" from grossing a 
reported $18 million by the end of its first year in release and both Hitchcock 
and Janet Leigh were nominated for Academy Awards. But while "Psycho" has gone 
on to become a classic, those involved in its creation were not necessarily 
better for the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I think doing the screenplay for 'Psycho' has done me more harm than good," 
says Stefano. "Through the years it has made it very difficult for me to get 
some of the other kinds of pictures that I would have liked to have gone on to. 
I never used to think there was typecasting among writers until after I did 
'Psycho' and, years later, got involved in 'The Outer Limits' television 
series. It got so bad that I would sometimes go a year or two without doing 
anything rather than do the things that were being offered to me." 
</P>
<P>
Bloch says he suffered too. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no prestige attached to it for me," the novelist says. "The industry 
just pasted the 'Psycho' label on my forehead and I've had to wear it ever 
since. Many times wearing that label was a benefit, but it also constantly 
typed me even when the work I was doing was far removed." 
</P>
<P>
Vera Miles, who reprised her role of Marian's sister in the first sequel, said 
the film had no negative impact on her career. Hilton Green has at least gotten 
more direct work from it, having worked on both sequels. 
</P>
<P>
"Psycho" helped a lot of young filmmakers who used it as their inspiration. 
UCLA professor Kuntz calls "Psycho" "the great grandfather of the slasher 
picture" but doesn't think the inspired have done the inspiration proud. 
"People who make horror films have certainly learned some lessons from 
'Psycho,' " he says. "But what has more often than not happened is that people 
who make films like 'Friday the 13th' have basically ripped off what they feel 
works on an exploitation level, namely the sex and violence, and tossed out the 
complexity and depth of character that was a high point in Hitchcock's film." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe 'Psycho' started a string of pictures that went off in the wrong 
direction," says Stefano. "Unfortunately the problem is that now people tend to 
think of 'Psycho' as a slasher movie and it is so much more than that. There 
were only two murders in the entire movie." 
</P>
<P>
But it is the memory of one of those murders, according to Saul Bass, that will 
stick in people's minds long after they've forgotten everything else about the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember thinking when we were making the movie that the shower scene was 
going to be a neat little murder. Now we know it was much more than that."

SUMMER SPLASH II; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By SYLVIE DRAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
Three playwrights who have been known to surprise us before will be launching 
the uncommonly busy theatrical summer: Irishman Brian Friel, whose 
"Aristocrats," a Chekhovian tale of landed gentry falling from grace in County 
Donegal, opens Thursday at the Mark Taper Forum; American David Mamet, whose 
comic Hollywood horror story, "Speed-the-Plow," opens June 8 at South Coast 
Repertory, and Caribbean poet-playwright Derek Walcott, whose new piece, "Viva 
Detroit!," kicks off June 9 at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
All three plays are new to Southern California, which can also look forward to 
another new play at the Taper: David Feldshuh's "Miss Evers' Boys" (July 19), a 
piece about medical prejudice in 1932 Alabama that finds resonance in the 
current AIDS crisis. And Neil Simon's farce,"Rumors," coming to the Doolittle 
July 12. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Los Angeles Theatre Center, which likes to mix it up between 
classics and contemporary work, is offering Ibsen's "The Wild Duck" beginning 
July 11. It will be staged by an iconoclast who should know his Ibsen: Stein 
Winge, artistic director of Oslo's National Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"August 29" (on Aug. 28), a piece commemorating the death of Times reporter 
Ruben Salazar in an East Los Angeles police action in 1970, will cut close to 
home. It is being developed by LATC's Latino Lab. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential notable: The L.A. Theatre Works production of "The Love of a 
Nightingale" by expatriate American Timberlake Wertenbaker. The show, to be 
staged at the Santa Monica Museum of Art starting June 15, played the Royal 
Shakespeare Company last year and is described as an expose of the violence 
that stems from silence based on the Greek myth of Philomel. 
</P>
<P>
To the south, Lloyd Richards will stage Lee Blessing's "Cobb," on the life of 
hated and celebrated ball player Ty Cobb, for the San Diego Old Globe (June 
28), which is also presenting Stephen Metcalfe's new play about male bonding, 
"White Man Dancing" (July 3), and a new "Hamlet" (Aug. 30), starring Campbell 
Scott, son of actors George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst. 
</P>
<P>
At the La Jolla Playhouse, two good bets may be Keith Reddin's surreal comedy 
about locking people in (and out) "Life During Wartime" (opening June 24) and 
Athol Fugard's newest play about his racially torn South Africa, "My Children! 
My Africa!," which opens Aug. 28, with Fugard directing. 
</P>
<P>
Off the beaten track: Look for the June 22 opening at LATC of a group of Latino 
satirists called, appropriately enough, "Culture Clash." Japan's Grand Kabuki 
will play the Orange County Performing Arts Center (June 30-July 1) and the 
Japan America Theatre (July 3-4). And "Dear Yelena Sergeevna" will open at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills on June 29. This is a production from Moscow's Mossoviet 
Theater of a politically touchy play by Ludmila Rasumovskaya that was banned 
for years in the Soviet Union. Performed in Russian (with a detailed synopsis 
in English), it was seen in Atlanta last year and is recommended.

Among the shows already running that will be around for at least part of the

The summer begins with a must-hear survey of recent American music at the Ojai 
Festival. Following that, though, major companies from Japan, Australia and the 
Soviet Union stake strong claims to our attention, amid the usual symphonic 
parade at the Hollywood Bowl and two festival gatherings of Southern California 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
The ear-stretching Americana agenda at Ojai comes courtesy of Stephen Mosko, 
this year's music director. Elliott Carter is the composer-in-residence and 
well-represented on concerts June 2 and 3, including a short but dense program 
of his chamber music by the California E.A.R. Unit. The festival begins June 1 
with a three-hour marathon enlisting Rachel Rosenthal, Joan La Barbara, 
Frederic Rzewski and the E.A.R. Unit. 
</P>
<P>
Wild things of a different sort follow downtown, when the Music Center Opera 
stages eight performances of "Where the Wild Things Are" and "Higgelty Piggelty 
Pop!" June 7-17. Maurice Sendak designed the sets and costumes for the Oliver 
Knussen operas based on his children's books. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, local dancers of a largely modern bent will be represented by 
"Generator Eight," June 7-17 at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. Seven L.A. 
companies and five soloists, often in collaboration with local composers, share 
eight premiere-laden evenings. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the same artists are also participating in the Dance Kaleidoscope 
showcase at Cal State L.A. Twenty dancers and companies explore the themes of 
People, Places and Dances on two weekends, July 20-22 and 27-29. 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Kabuki from Japan arrives at Segerstrom Hall of the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center for two performances, June 30 and July 1. Performing on 
his first American tour, the renowned Kichiemon Nakamura II plays the title 
hero in "Narukami" (The Thunder God) and the suspicious wife in the marital 
comedy "Migawari Zazen" (The Substitute Mediator). At the Japan America Theatre 
on July 3 and 4, the venerable company celebrates the Japanese American 
Cultural and Community Center 10th anniversary with a special program seen 
nowhere else on the tour: the quasi-historical drama "Kanjincho" (The 
Subscription List) and the tragic love story of "Osome Hisamatsu." 
</P>
<P>
Balletomanes should start saving gas money now, as they face a commuter future. 
The Australian Ballet at Segerstrom Hall (Aug. 7-12) goes head to head with the 
mighty Bolshoi at the Shrine Auditorium (Aug. 7-19). 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets bring artistic director Yuri Grigorovich's stagings of "Ivan the 
Terrible," "Romeo and Juliet," "Swan Lake" and a mixed bill featuring 
"Petrushka." The Aussies dance artistic director Maina Gielgud's "Giselle" and 
a mixed bill. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Bowl, with its weekend pops emphasis on fireworks, and Broadway 
and film scores, has always been fertile ground for celebrations of American 
mythology. Following the traditional Fourth of July concerts and prefatory 
Mozart programs, the season opens July 10 and runs through Sept. 15, 
highlighted by Simon Rattle's appearance at the Los Angeles Philharmonic helm 
Aug. 14 and 16. Sandwiched between Rattle's concerts is a performance by the 
American-Soviet Youth Orchestra conducted by Alexander Lazarev. On Aug. 19 that 
ensemble combines with the Philharmonic Institute Orchestra under the baton of 
Leonard Slatkin.

The big exhibition splashes in the aesthetic summer swelter will come mainly to 
the County Museum of Art. It launches the season June 17 with "A Primal 
Spirit," a timely and ambitious extravaganza devoted to the work of 10 Japanese 
sculptors. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Japan became a world economic power and started paying millions for 
Van Gogh, we've been curious about what their own artists are up to. Names 
represented in this show are strange to these shores, but anyone who knows of 
Zen sand gardens, traditional Japanese respect for nature and love of drama may 
find familiar echoes. 
</P>
<P>
Artists often work in the form of big room-filling constructions using natural 
materials such as wood and stone, minerals and metal. We are talking big here. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be surprised to see huge tree-trunks bent like pretzels, sculpture that 
has been purposely incinerated for that char-broiled look or forms that appear 
like huge volcanic rocks that are actually made from zillions of tiny ceramic 
cubes. That's the traditional Japanese love of complex ingenuity afoot. 
</P>
<P>
At very worst, "A Primal Spirit" promises boffo visual spectacle mixed with 
some philosophical serenity before closing Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Such a curtain-raiser naturally presents the age-old question of what to do for 
an encore. 
</P>
<P>
The County Museum of Art's graceful answer and summer finale will be 
"Masterpieces of Impressionism and Post Impressionism: The Annenberg 
Collection" (Aug. 16-Nov. 11). When you combine a blue-chip selection of 50 
paintings in the world's most beloved style with the first public in-depth look 
at one of the finest compendiums of art still in private hands, you have a 
win-win situation. Those who cannot resist a fascination with the lifestyles of 
the rich and famous can imagine themselves at Walter Annenberg's estate near 
Palm Springs. After golfing with Ronald Reagan and Prince Charles you stroll 
into the house for a look at the five prime Van Goghs, the Monets, Degases and 
the recognizable rest. For a moment, life is sweet. 
</P>
<P>
In between, the museum will host a patrician Old Master collection that spans 
the history of European art in 160 paintings and drawings from Titian to 
Modigliani. It's "Treasures From the Fitzwilliam Museum," a reknown repository 
in Cambridge, England, that announces itself with the Masterpiece-Theater 
subtitle, "The Increase of Learning and other Great Objects of the Noble 
Foundation." Sounds edifying. Also sounds like a great browse through works by 
artists from Rubens to Hogarth, Van Dyck to Delacroix (June 21-Sept. 9). 
</P>
<P>
A late entry will be the Museum of Contemporary Arts show of New Yorker Tim 
Rollins and his group called KOS. They are South Bronx street kids whom Rollins 
has turned into bankable artists (July 3-Sept. 9.) There will also be good 
reason to visit outposts near the ocean. The Newport Harbor Art Museum will 
offer "Committed to Print" (July 15-Sept. 23). Current artistic concerns with 
real-world matters will reflect in 144 prints by 108 artists artists in pursuit 
of such themes as nuclear power, ecology, gender and race. 
</P>
<P>
Architecture buffs will head further south for "Frank Lloyd Wright: The Realm 
of Ideas" a major traveling retrospective visiting the San Diego Museum of Art 
(July 23-Aug. 27). 
</P>
<P>
A properly timed visit can also net the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art's 
"Satellite Intelligence: Boston/San Diego New Art Exchange" (June 15-Aug. 5). 
The show will include 10 artists from each town and try to discover any 
affinities that exist between two thriving art towns that nonetheless exist in 
the shadow of the major art centers of New York and Los Angeles.

There are sunny days ahead for jazz in Southern California since all the major 
events are taking place at the same venue, the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Most promising is the 12th annual Playboy Festival, for which an unusually 
strong lineup has been assembled. 
</P>
<P>
The first day, Saturday, June 16, will feature the Miles Davis band, Chick 
Corea's acoustic group, Doc Severinsen with the "Tonight Show" band, Joe 
Williams with his special guest Jay McShann, the octogenarian blues pianist and 
singer; drummer Tony Williams and his combo; Poncho Sanchez and his salsa group 
with guest Tito Puente and the Eliane Elias Trio. 
</P>
<P>
On June 17, Chick Corea will return, this time with his electric band. Pianist 
Dorothy Donegan will make a rare appearance. Completing the bill are Lee 
Ritenour, the Gerry Mulligan Quartet; Milton Nascimento with guest Wayne 
Shorter, Hiroshima, the Lionel Hampton orchestra and another contest-winning 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The regular "Jazz at the Bowl" series will include Oscar Peterson and the Benny 
Carter Orchestra on July 18; Wynton Marsalis in a salute to Satchmo, featuring 
Clark Terry, Doc Cheatham and other trumpeters, Aug. 1; Ella Fitzgerald Aug. 
22; the bands of Count Basie, Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey, respectively led 
by Frank Foster, Larry O'Brien and Buddy Morrow, Sept. 5; and, to close out the 
season, Tony Bennett with the George Shearing Duo and singer Diane Schuur on 
Sept. 12.

In response to the eco-hype in the media:

<P>
I've heard nothing but "Earth Day, Earth Day, Earth Day," and my ears are 
becoming numb from all the shouting, and my eyes are growing weary from reading 
about it in all the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on California businesses by the Environmental Protection Agency 
concerns me; who are these guys anyway? They are crippling California's 
industries with every gnaw and tear of their ever-multiplying inhibitive laws, 
causing many businesses to relocate out of state. 
</P>
<P>
What is going to happen to our economy from all this?

I'm all for recycling, water conservation and such to a reasonable degree, but 
don't you think the EPA is getting a little too overpowering?

SMITH TRIES TO ADD PUNCH TO HEAT ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brad Smith, unshaven and wearing a wrinkled T-shirt and shorts, walked into the 
newspaper office for an interview in a daze. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago the blond, blue-eyed Culver City native had finished playing his 
sixth soccer season in Germany, where he obtained all-star status. But a snap 
decision brought him back to the United States, and earlier this week he signed 
to play with the L.A. Heat of the American Professional Soccer League West. 
</P>
<P>
The APSL West is trying to attract more spectators by rewarding teams in the 
standings with extra points based on the number of goals scored. Having 
struggled with an ineffective front line, the Heat is touting Smith, an 
all-Southern Section selection at Culver City High in 1983, as its offensive 
savior. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he gives us the ability to score more goals," General Manager Jill 
Fracisco said. "We want him to fit in with the players and put the ball in the 
net, which we desperately need." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, with a wealth of experience behind him, arrived for the interview not 
really clear what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"In Germany, the fans and the press, they make or break you. I knew a coach 
that lost back-to-back games at home and he was out like this," he said, 
snapping his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Fracisco couldn't just snap her fingers to help the Heat out of its scoring 
doldrums, so she and a coalition of the team's owners have put their hopes on 
Smith, whose sudden return to the United States might not be without some 
pitfalls. Smith reportedly got a lucrative contract by APSL standards. The Heat 
routinely refuses to say what it pays players, but, according to forward Bobby 
Bruch, who doubles as director of community affairs: "Everyone has been saying 
we needed another forward. Now that we got him, he better produce." 
</P>
<P>
Going into Saturday night's game at San Diego, the fourth-place Heat (2-2) had 
scored only seven goals, five less than the league-leading Nomads. Yet Smith 
has been so inundated by the rapid changes in his life that he has had little 
time to feel pressure. He's been living out of boxes at his mother-in-law's 
Culver City home. He arises each morning at 6 and wonders if it is lunchtime. 
His English, corrupted by a half-dozen years of speaking German, is slow, yet 
diligent. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's no place like Southern California and this is where I wanted to be 
with my family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, over an American meal of hamburgers, french fries and onion rings, the 
kid who was better known in Culver City as a football star demonstrated a keen 
knowledge about futbol. 
</P>
<P>
"Soccer is a lifestyle in Europe," he said. "Training two days a week (like 
here) is unheard of in Germany and when you train, it's all serious." 
</P>
<P>
Smith feels he can help the Heat, but said: "I'm not here to change the team. I 
need to learn the team's system. I'll score my goals and set up more than I 
score, but I really want to get to know the guys on the team." 
</P>
<P>
There are things Smith said he needed to catch up on. He returned to the United 
States only twice for short stays since going to Germany in January of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like starting over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
From his first few workouts with the Heat, he has determined that the level of 
soccer in the United States has improved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not quite the level that I saw in Germany in the past five years, but it 
is (competitive)." 
</P>
<P>
He was most surprised to learn about the APSL scoring system, which can be 
confusing. The league awards six points to each team for a victory, four points 
if a game is won by penalty kicks, two points for a loss by penalty kicks and 
one point for each goal scored in regulation up to a maximum of three. 
</P>
<P>
The system is supposed to stimulate more offense, but it has confused a lot of 
Americans, who are not accustomed to seeing teams with losing records in first 
place, based on points, as was the case earlier when San Diego topped the 
Southern Division at 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are no tie games. The league utilizes two, 10-minute 
overtime periods followed by penalty kicks to decide a match. And, to save on 
travel expenses, road games are usually played back-to-back, a practice foreign 
to Europe because the game style is more physical there. 
</P>
<P>
Internationally, ties are an integral part of the game, Smith said. And in 
Germany, soccer "is very business-like." 
</P>
<P>
"German people expect double from you, particularly if you are a foreign 
player," he said. "You have to prove yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Smith apparently did. In less than a year in Germany, his contract was 
purchased by a Third Division team from the amateur club he originally signed 
to play with. He played for three other Third Division teams, including two 
that went into postseason play. (Germany has three levels of professional 
soccer, yet a good showing by a lower division team allows it to challenge for 
a position in a higher division.) 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 Smith was voted to the Oberliga Select Team, a German all-star team, 
which represented the country against other world-class teams in international 
matches. At the time he returned to the United States, Smith was negotiating 
with a pair of Division II teams. He stood to greatly increase his salary of 
about $1,500 a game, plus bonuses, but both teams wanted him to become a German 
citizen to avoid the country's two foreigner per team rule. Smith, who has an 
American wife and a 3-year-old son who was born in Germany, made a sudden 
decision to move back to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It was either another six years in Germany or move back here," he said. "I 
wanted to settle down with my family." 
</P>
<P>
At Culver, Smith drew headlines for his accomplishments as a running back on 
the football team, not for his play on the soccer field. In his finest 
performance, he rushed for 217 yards and two touchdowns, kicked field goals of 
22 and 41 yards and added three point-after-touchdown kicks to lead the 
Centaurs to a 27-14 title-clinching victory over rival Beverly Hills in the 
final game of the 1982 season. Newspaper accounts called the game one of the 
best ever played in the Ocean League. Smith was named The Times Westside back 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But his heart was with soccer, partly because of his size. At a photo session 
held by the Times for its annual all-star team, the 5-foot-9, 170-pound Smith 
realized he didn't have a future in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing next to this guy, and we were waiting to have our photos 
taken," he said. "He was 6-foot-9, 270-pounds. I reached up, shook his hand, 
and felt really small." 
</P>
<P>
He played indoor speed soccer in Orange County after high school, where he was 
befriended by members of a German amateur team touring Southern California. 
Smith, who preferred to play outdoors, was invited to play in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid, on a trip to Europe, advised Smith that he 
might be able to get a job with an APSL team, a new professional soccer league 
that hoped to become the recognized professional league of the United States, 
as required by FIFA, the world governing body of soccer. The country must have 
a professional league in force by 1992, or risk losing its bid to host the 
World Cup in 1994. The United States Soccer Federation has yet to certify the 
APSL as its professional league, but Smith was encouraged to hear that 
professional soccer was on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Mutual friends, including former Culver City teammate Danny Pena, a defender 
with the Heat, persuaded Smith to sign with the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that playing soccer for a living has become "routine. It's like 
instinct to me." European teams play 11 months a year and the pace of each game 
is "about three to four times faster than it is here." 
</P>
<P>
The German season includes more than 40 games, plus playoffs. The Heat will 
play about half that many. "It's sad that I can't come to the United States and 
play in a full professional outdoor league like I am used to," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
But he is happy to be home, just the same.

Resplendent in academic regalia, Cal State Fullerton President Jewel Plummer 
Cobb smiled often as she shook hands with graduates during Saturday's 
commencement. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was a moment of some sadness for Cobb, who is retiring after nine years 
at the helm of the university -- a period marked by unprecedented growth in 
enrollment, prestige and construction. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb, 65, the first black woman to head a major public university in the 
western United States, will step down July 31. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a happy and sad feeling at the same time," she said Saturday, bidding 
farewell to the largest graduating class in Cal State Fullerton history. "I 
guess I haven't really started thinking about leaving yet." 
</P>
<P>
Cobb, who presided over the ceremonies on the campus green, was presented with 
a plaque in recognition of her leadership. She told students to be proud of Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a rigorous school, and I am sure you will go out with all of the 
skills you need," she said, addressing business and economics students. "Thirty 
percent of the accounting professionals in Orange County are graduates from our 
school of business and economics, and seven of our graduates are partners in 
Big Six accounting firms." 
</P>
<P>
Cobb seemed to enjoy her last commencement as president. And students put on a 
lively show. During the presentation of degrees, they tossed beach balls into 
the restless crowd. Whenever an usher confiscated one ball, another would 
mysteriously appear, punched across rows of eager parents and students. 
</P>
<P>
Two male students received their diplomas on stage with balloons stuffed 
beneath their gowns. 
</P>
<P>
But Cobb, known for her no-nonsense management style and and force of 
personality, remained unruffled as she bade farewell to the 5,700 graduating 
students.

<P>
Saturday's ceremony was a fitting tribute for Cobb, Cal State Fullerton's third 
president, who has been credited with boosting enrollment. Since she joined the 
university in 1981, enrollments have grown to nearly 25,000 students, two new 
schools have been founded (communications and engineering), there has been an 
unprecedented construction campaign and a South County branch campus in Mission 
Viejo has been established. 
</P>
<P>
Tough and determined, Cobb also won millions of dollars from the state 
Legislature for a sorely needed dormitory, plus commitments for a $9.4-million 
computer science building and a $22-million science building. 
</P>
<P>
She engineered a public-private partnership that brought a Marriott hotel to 
the campus. The hotel deal is expected to generate money to help build a sports 
complex estimated to cost more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb is also credited with bringing in more women and minorities and has been 
particularly supportive of efforts to attract women in the sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb is a third-generation scientist, the granddaughter of a slave who 
ultimately graduated from Howard University's School of Pharmacy in 1898. Her 
father was a physician in Chicago, where she was born in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
A biologist by training, she said her plans include writing and working as an 
educational consultant. She will continue to serve on a dozen corporate and 
civic boards, while splitting her time between Los Angeles and her home on Cape 
Cod.

CRIME: STEVEN WALTERS KILLED HIMSELF WHEN SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES KNOCKED ON HIS

<TEXT>
<P>
A suicide victim suspected of one woman's murder and under investigation in the 
apparent disappearances of several other women was a "mentally disordered sex 
offender" who had been committed to a mental institution before serving two 
terms in prison, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Christopher Walters, 30, who shot himself March 22 when two Orange 
County sheriff's detectives knocked on the front door of his Lakewood home, had 
his first major run-in with the law at age 16, when he was convicted of 
kidnaping. And he was incarcerated almost continually until being paroled for 
the last time about three years ago, the records show. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County detectives had wanted to question Walters about the murder a 
day earlier of a woman whose body was found behind a Laguna Hills industrial 
park. Lori Mae Calhoun, 41, of Long Beach was answering an ad to rent a room 
from Walters at the time she was abducted and strangled, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Walters was not considered a suspect at the time detectives appeared 
at his door, they said he has since become the focal point of an investigation, 
not only into Calhoun's death, but also into the apparent disappearances of 
other women. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to finding credit cards and other items belonging to Calhoun in 
Walters' possession, Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson said, detectives found 
credit cards and personal effects of several other women. Olson said the women 
-- whom he declined to name -- have not been located. He said police are 
checking to see if missing persons reports have been filed for any of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we start finding people, we're not going to know who they (credit cards 
and belongings) came from," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said detectives are also still looking into the significance of a stuffed 
animal collection found on a shelf in Walters' bedroom. Police said Walters 
apparently asked women he dated to give him the stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives said they have not ruled Walters out as 
a suspect in the strangulation death of 16-year-old Zuleima Valdez of Cypress, 
whose body was found March 19 in a Lakewood flood control channel about two 
miles from Walters' home. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Lynda Edmonds said 
last week, however, that no connection has been made so far between the Valdez 
and Calhoun cases. 
</P>
<P>
Records on file in Los Angeles County Superior Court show that Walters had a 
lengthy criminal history in the Long Beach area, where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Corpus Christi, Tex., Walters was reared in a broken home, one of 
three brothers and a sister, according to court records. Those records show 
that at age 16, while living in Long Beach, Walters served a six-month sentence 
in a juvenile facility for kidnaping. Details of the juvenile case were not 
specified in the records. 
</P>
<P>
Working as a general laborer after high school, Walters, then 18, was convicted 
of receiving stolen property in Long Beach and sentenced to serve six months in 
Los Angeles County Jail on the misdemeanor charge. 
</P>
<P>
While in custody, Walters escaped by simply walking away, court documents show. 
He was quickly brought back into custody, and another 60 days was added to his 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 9, 1979, according to his court file, Walters sexually molested an 
11-year-old girl living at the Long Beach apartment of his ex-girlfriend, 
Deborah Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Walters pleaded guilty to a felony charge on Dec. 24, 1979, under an agreement 
in which he would serve a seven-year sentence in a California state mental 
hospital rather than report to prison. Judge Robert A. Wenke of Los Angeles 
County Superior Court determined that Walters "is a mentally disordered sex 
offender, and that he would benefit by treatment in a state hospital." 
</P>
<P>
After serving 255 days in Patton State Hospital, however, hospital officials 
discharged him as "still a danger to the health and safety of others," and a 
Los Angeles County judge remanded him to state prison to serve out the 
remainder of his sentence. Records show that Walters had violated rules of the 
state hospital, but no details were given. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Walters was ordered confined within the California Youth Authority. 
But CYA officials refused to accept him, saying, "At 20 years of age, Mr. 
Walters has had experience in county jail and a state hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Paroled Jan. 12, 1983, Walters was forced to register with state officials as a 
sex offender. He told a parole officer that his only plans were to move to 
Montana, where Williams had moved. 
</P>
<P>
Walters was out of prison only a year, though, when he ran afoul of the law 
again. On the night of Jan. 28, 1984, he and a convicted prostitute stole a 
1964 Volkswagen from in front of a Long Beach residence and took it to his 
apartment to "part out," according to the court file on that case. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor notified police that Walters and the woman were up past midnight, 
dismantling the car in an open garage. When Long Beach police responded to the 
scene, they discovered a stolen van and motorcycle in the garage also, and they 
placed the two under arrest. Walters fled on foot but was quickly apprehended, 
court files said. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, whose parole was revoked because of the crime, subsequently pleaded 
guilty to possession of stolen property. In sentencing, Superior Court Judge 
Charles D. Sheldon termed Walters a poor risk for probation and ordered him to 
serve three more years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
"His prior conviction of crimes as a juvenile into adulthood are . . . numerous 
and slowly becoming of increasing seriousness," Sheldon said at Walters' 
sentencing hearing May 23, 1984. "The defendant needs to go to state prison in 
a structured environment, where he can hopefully determine that when he gets 
out this next time, he's not going to continue to commit law violations." 
</P>
<P>
Serving time at the California Men's Institute in Chino and San Quentin prison, 
Walters was again discharged June 11, 1987. He went to work as a forklift 
mechanic for a Buena Park company. About a year ago, he rented a two-bedroom 
residence in the 11700 block of East 215th Street, a quiet, tree-lined 
neighborhood in Lakewood just off the San Gabriel River Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Walters lived inconspicuously, drawing little attention from neighbors or his 
landlord, Jean Gulik, a real estate agent in southeast Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"I would see him once a month when he paid his rent," Gulik said. "He never had 
a problem with me." 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a regular guy, as far as I know," added Frank Livesy, his 
next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Livesy said Walters drove a service truck for the company and kept it parked at 
home when he was not working. He used the truck to go out on forklift-repair 
calls, Livesy said. 
</P>
<P>
Unknown to Gulik or the neighbors, Walters had taken out newspaper ads to rent 
a room out of his house. The ads specified "women only," according to Orange 
County sheriff's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before he took his own life, Walters had been rocked by the recent 
deaths of his father and two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Livesy said Walters told him one brother had committed suicide, and the other 
had been murdered. Livesy said he did not know which. 
</P>
<P>
A sister, Mary Rand of Bellflower, declined comment when reached at her home. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all still grieving over this," she said.

PROFILE JOHN GILLESPIE;

<P>
SHERIFF UNOPPOSED, EVEN BY DETRACTORS

<P>
Ventura County Sheriff John Gillespie has a toy gallows on his desk labeled 
"Executive Problem Solver." The black-humor touch provides a clue to both his 
personality and his crime-fighting philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
One moment, Gillespie cracks a smile, remembering himself as a young Claremont 
policeman assigned as a bodyguard to Jane Fonda during her frequent visits to 
Tom Hayden at anti-war demonstrations in the Claremont area. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was there when love was born," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Gillespie's face clouds over. He declares his fierce belief in the death 
penalty, booming, "For some crimes, the only thing fitting . . . is to dispose 
of that piece of garbage and do it as soon as you can." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, 50, is running unopposed for reelection June 5, entering what would 
be his seventh year as sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's colleagues say he is a mix of old values and new projects, a 
skilled administrator whose personal experience helped him to understand police 
work from the bottom up. 
</P>
<P>
Even his detractors express respect for him. 
</P>
<P>
John Hatcher, the president of the Ventura County chapter of the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People, has criticized Gillespie's 
administration over allegations of rough treatment of prisoners by guards at 
the County Jail. But Hatcher said Gillespie's office always answers those 
complaints quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher said, "Maybe sometimes in a position of being at the top, you don't 
always know what's going on beneath you." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Public Defender Kenneth Clayman has criticized Gillespie's plan 
to house drug users in a "tent city" as "a very expensive undertaking." Clayman 
has heard a few complaints about deputies using excessive force during arrests 
but said the Sheriff's Department never whitewashes such cases. 
</P>
<P>
Clayman called Gillespie a "prototype" lawman -- "He's very, very tough but 
very progressive." 
</P>
<P>
"He's clearly a 21st-Century law enforcement person," said county Chief 
Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg. "He's a very strong believer in 
education. Nine or 10 of his top 12 people have master's degrees. . . . He 
understands there are other things outside of law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
But John Gillespie might never have become a cop if he hadn't been so bored 
with school. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, he ignored a drama scholarship to the University of Wyoming and a 
baseball scholarship to Pepperdine University and instead joined the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
After serving in coastal stations in California, he emerged three years later, 
married Carol, now his wife of 30 years, and began their family of four sons. 
</P>
<P>
Then he went to work in Hollywood as a public relations man for Western Union. 
</P>
<P>
One day, the company sent the 21-year-old Gillespie to collect a facsimile 
machine from a famous director who had not used it in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the personal honor of being thrown out of Sam Goldwyn Studios by Sam 
Goldwyn himself -- I mean, physically thrown out -- and he was a pretty old man 
at the time," Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me something like a whippersnapper and then something obscene, and 
he grabbed me by the back and picked me up and threw me out." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie also worked at Capitol Records, shipping the latest singles out to 
disc jockeys with telegraphed press releases -- his idea. 
</P>
<P>
But that idea's novelty wore thin after a while, and so did the entertainment 
business, Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
"The caricature of the Hollywood agent with his feet on the table, 'I'll take 
care of ya, baby' -- it was a world of absolute phoniness, and I hated it." 
</P>
<P>
Looking for more worthwhile work, he passed the Civil Service exam and joined 
the Claremont Police Department as a desk officer and dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
The early years were grueling. Gillespie worked 48-hour weeks on the graveyard 
shift, while moonlighting at Sears loading trucks and taking day classes for 
his bachelor's degree at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The late '60s also was a chaotic time to be a policeman in Claremont, a city of 
seven colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie recalls a night when the 35-man police force was sent out to maintain 
order during an anti-war protest by 5,000 students who marched 10 abreast down 
Claremont's main street. "We had no training in these things and we were 
scared," he said. "Hell, we were no older than the students at the time." 
</P>
<P>
He eventually was promoted to lieutenant, served briefly as acting chief and 
decided he liked being in charge. 
</P>
<P>
After nine years, Gillespie moved to Ojai to take the vacant position of police 
chief and get his children out of Claremont, which he calls "the smoggiest 
place in the world." 
</P>
<P>
He stayed two years in Ojai, "a great little town, a little arty," but "one of 
those strange places that doesn't change." 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1974, Port Hueneme Police Chief Al Jalaty, a former sheriff's 
lieutenant, decided to run for Ventura County sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"John had just come into Ojai," Jalaty said. "So I wanted to help him, new man 
in town. I went up and talked to him a few times and I thought he was a pretty 
sharp person. And the longer I talked to him, the more I thought of him." 
</P>
<P>
Jalaty was elected and took Gillespie on as undersheriff. Together, they ran 
the Sheriff's Department for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest years of their administration were rough, the two say. 
</P>
<P>
The County Jail, which had been bought secondhand from Texas and reassembled 
behind the San Buenaventura City Hall, was a constant source of complaints from 
officers and inmates -- a cramped, overcrowded hole with poor ventilation. 
</P>
<P>
And the previous administration of Sheriff Bill Hill had left the department 
with a $1-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of reorganization and cutting positions, the department was still 
"$600,000 in the hole," Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
The new jail took four years to plan and build, including numerous 5 a.m. 
meetings with the architects to iron out details. 
</P>
<P>
But other changes came more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Jalaty and Gillespie began the Community-Oriented Police Enforcement program. 
COPE put sheriff's deputies in field offices in every Ventura County town, 
enabling the department to book suspects all over the county instead of only at 
the County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd spend half the day just running back and forth to the sheriff's office," 
Jalaty said. "We cut the time in half." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie also reorganized the department brass in 1976, cutting the positions 
of four chief deputies and eight captains, replacing them with five commanders 
and saving the county $300,000 a year. In 1980, he merged the sheriff's and 
marshal's departments, saving another $800,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
While Gillespie ran the department's day-to-day operations, keeping his hand in 
the streets on major drug busts and murder cases, Jalaty made the executive 
command decisions -- and the public appearances required of the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"Al Jalaty was Mr. Outside and I was Mr. Inside," Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
When Jalaty retired in 1984 because of poor health, the Board of Supervisors 
appointed Gillespie to replace him -- on April 1, "which was a very appropriate 
day," he said. Gillespie was subsequently elected sheriff in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good administrator, but he's got grease on his hands, you know what I 
mean?" Undersheriff Larry Carpenter said. "And in that sense he's a good 
adviser. You can actually sit down with him with a problem. He's innovative 
too, which surprises a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie hired a staff psychiatrist to help cut down on stress-related 
absences. 
</P>
<P>
He started a canine unit in 1986 to track suspects and missing persons and to 
provide special event security and riot control. 
</P>
<P>
He oversaw formation of the sheriff's search-and-rescue team, complete with a 
mounted division for high-country searches, and trained helicopter crews 
staffed with doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Rose Valley Work Camp, which Carpenter calls "The jewel in the 
crown." The year-old military-style camp functions as a minimum-security jail 
and vocational training school and has drawn good reviews from its own inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought some sophistication to a small department and a lot of new and 
innovative ideas," Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said. "It's probably one of 
the few departments in the state that has expertise in major frauds and 
white-collar crime," which Bradbury said other departments "kiss off" by 
"telling the victim that this is a civil matter." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie applies the same tough approach to his own employees. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have a philosophy, it is this: We are in the honesty business here, and 
if you violate any ethics or any honesty, I'll not only fire you, but I'll see 
that you're prosecuted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his spare time, Gillespie works with charities and community groups, 
including United Way, the American Cancer Society and the Boy Scouts. He is a 
voracious moviegoer and trivia buff and takes long camping trips with his wife 
in their motor home, traveling from state beach to state beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm dabbling in writing," he said. "That's what I intend to do when I retire, 
write the great American novel. I even have a working title. I'm thinking of 
calling it 'The Funny Side of the Badge.' "

Q &amp; A: FULTON'S 30 YEARS AS LISA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eileen Fulton has connived, lied and schemed her way into viewers' hearts as 
the vixenish Lisa on the long-running CBS daytime soap opera, "As the World 
Turns." This month, Fulton celebrates her 30th anniversary on the hourlong 
series, which airs weekdays at 1 p.m. on CBS. She discussed those years with 
Susan King. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years on the same series is pretty amazing. 
</P>
<P>
That's a long time, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
I've enjoyed it. I think what has kept me going is that the producers and the 
writing staff have made it possible for me to go out and do many other things. 
I didn't come to New York to be one character. I'm an actor and must play many 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
How many months do you take off a year? 
</P>
<P>
I have four months off, so I can do other shows. I have a one-woman show I am 
working on now -- a nightclub act. I love to sing. We are booking for the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
You must have seen a lot of changes in the soap opera world over the past three 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think soaps have changed that much. There have always been love 
affairs, illegitimate babies. We didn't have AIDS back then. But we have kept 
up with the times as far as what is going on in the world. The only difference 
is that now people don't mind saying they watch the show. 
</P>
<P>
May I tell you a fun story? When I was doing my nightclub act in Texas, a man 
told me, "You have almost ruined my business." I said, "What is your business?" 
He said, "I am a funeral director. No one will come to a funeral between 1:30 
and 2 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
Is your character of Lisa as evil as Alexis Carrington was on "Dynasty"? 
</P>
<P>
Lisa was a conniving, screaming witch. She wasn't just out-and-out ugly (like 
Alexis). She lied and wanted everything her way. She just bent the truth so it 
went her way. She's had six husbands, 38 lovers and was raped repeatedly from 
California to Texas and lost her mind twice. She's had two children, little Tom 
and little Chuck, now dead, and one phantom fetus. 
</P>
<P>
A phantom fetus? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it was my most unfavorite story line. I had to walk around and say, "I am 
pregnant and I don't know how it happened." I had already had three husbands 
and two children, so I thought it was kind of silly. It turned out to be an 
ovarian cyst. 
</P>
<P>
How do fans react when they see you in person? 
</P>
<P>
I used to get smacked around. 
</P>
<P>
Fans would hit you? 
</P>
<P>
At the very beginning. When I was first on the show, a very nicely dressed 
woman -- she really looked beautiful -- came up to me on the street said, 
"Aren't you Lisa?" I opened my pocketbook to get out my pen to sign an 
autograph, and she said, "I hate you," and she whacked me on the arm and pushed 
me in the gutter. Everybody looked at me like I was scum. 
</P>
<P>
And about 10 years ago, when Lisa was after Bob Hughes, letters came in again 
saying if that witch gets him, we are going to come down and finish her career 
so she'll never act again. They wrote to the producer, the directors and the 
head of CBS. I had to have police protection. 
</P>
<P>
But things are a lot different now. Lisa has changed over the years. She has 
matured and learned from her mistakes, but is as spunky as ever. Now I get love 
letters. In fact, I get letters from as many men as I do women. I get letters 
in the hundreds from women saying they were named after me. Lisa was not a 
popular name, and now it's one of the top names. And it's because of me. 
</P>
<P>
Do you remember any crazy thing that happened when the show was done live? 
</P>
<P>
I had to make cherries jubilee once. I had to say the line, "We are all 
finished," and I couldn't say it if we weren't finished. We didn't want to talk 
with our mouths full, so we had to time it. From 7:30 in the morning we were 
eating cherries jubilee. They kept putting more and more brandy on the 
cherries, and we kept slurping it up. We were smashed by the time the show went 
on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Then they put Sureflame in the thing so it would blaze up and look wonderful. 
When I took the lid off, it went "boom," and fire went up the curtain and 
things caught on fire. We didn't care. We were drunk.

THE AMERICANIZATION OF PAUL VERHOEVEN; 
</P>
<P>
THE DUTCH DIRECTOR IS NOW TOTALLY IMMERSED IN HOLLYWOOD WITH THE BIG-BUDGET 
ACTION MOVIE 'TOTAL RECALL,' STARRING ARNOLD YOU-KNOW-WHO

When Paul Verhoeven is making a movie, he's definitely a hands-on guy. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Arnold Schwarzenegger, who stars in "Total Recall," the Dutch 
director's futuristic thriller that hits the theaters Friday. Holed up in 
Mexico last summer, filming on a huge set of sound stages, Verhoeven left 
nothing to chance. 
</P>
<P>
One day Hollywood's reigning super-hero was preparing for a scene where he guns 
down a nasty 21st-Century villain, blasting his face to smithereens. "When I 
shot him in the forehead, we had the explosions rigged up," Schwarzenegger 
recalled the other day. "But Paul wanted to make sure it really looked real. He 
said, 'Let me try it. I want to see how it works.' 
</P>
<P>
"So he had our crew strap a load of explosives onto him and blast them off on 
his forehead. It was a real blast. Boom! It really knocked him around. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at Paul, a little bit amazed. But he looked very happy. He said, 'Oh, 
I really like it. This is going to be great!' " 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a year later, Verhoeven is just as obsessively involved with his film, 
on the phone in an empty theater on the Columbia Pictures lot, anxiously trying 
to juggle his hectic schedule. With Tri-Star Pictures moving "Total Recall" up 
two weeks to get a jump on its brawny action-adventure rivals (and avoid a June 
15 showdown with "Dick Tracy"), Verhoeven has been racing around, mixing his 
film in the morning and watching special effects in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Perched behind a 20-foot-long mixing board, the 51-year-old director peers at a 
blotchy black-and-white print, bereft of sound effects, music and visual 
trickery. In fact, all that's visible on screen is a wild brawl between a pair 
of fiery femmes fatales. Outfitted in 2084-style pants suits, they throw right 
hooks and flying tackles, all orchestrated with noisy grunts and groans. 
</P>
<P>
Verhoeven may get a kick out of testing explosives on his head, but he knows a 
little dynamite goes a long way. "It's so noisy," he says to his sound editors. 
"We've got to get rid of some of these grunts and groans." 
</P>
<P>
As they roll the scene again, he keeps up a steady, decisive patter: "The kick 
to the face is in. . . . The stomach punch is out. . . . The elbow in the back 
is out. . . . There! Where she gets hit in the stomach. That's one ughh! too 
many." 
</P>
<P>
His team of editors punched computer keys, relaying his instructions, as 
Verhoeven tried to explain the crucial importance of sound mixing. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to select exactly what you want the audience to hear, just as if 
you're selecting what camera shot you want," he said with a soft Dutch accent. 
"In this film we have futuristic cars, so we had to invent a new sound. It's a 
difficult choice, because you can't go too far away from what the audience is 
familiar with. So we created a car sound that is a mixture of what people would 
recognize -- and something that feels like the future." 
</P>
<P>
Verhoeven merrily nodded his head. "So it shouldn't sound exactly like a 
Lamborghini. But like a Lamborghini with something extra!" 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to understand why Verhoeven is excited about having so many effects 
at his disposal. In 1985, after 15 years as Holland's most celebrated -- and 
controversial -- filmmaker, he abandoned a comfortable art-house career for a 
shot at the Hollywood Big Time. 
</P>
<P>
The differences in scale are astounding. Shot in Mexico with four camera units 
often going simultaneously, "Total Recall" reportedly cost a whopping $65 
million. That's more than all of Verhoeven's previous films combined, even if 
you include the $15-million price tag for "RoboCop," his breakthrough 1987 
American hit. 
</P>
<P>
A candid, disarmingly modest man with a sly sense of humor, Verhoeven knows 
budgets are skyrocketing all over town. "Our movie was expensive," he said with 
a grin. "But from what I hear about some of the other movies coming out this 
summer, it's not the only one, yes?" 
</P>
<P>
"Total Recall" won't be just another summer special-effects clunker. For years, 
critics have raved -- and sometimes fulminated -- about the incandescent images 
that populate Verhoeven's movies. 
</P>
<P>
His audacious 1984 film, "The Fourth Man," is as wildly erotic and garishly 
goofy as anything Pedro Almodovar ever attempted (if only for the scene where 
we see a lovelorn man praying in church, beset by visions of his lover -- in 
red bikini underwear -- as the crucified Christ). A scathing indictment of 
Dutch bourgeois life, "Spetters" offers the exploits -- with plenty of graphic 
sex and violence -- of a trio of rebellious, motorcycle-mad kids. 
</P>
<P>
From his youthful documentaries to "RoboCop," Verhoeven has shown an abiding 
fascination with man's precarious grip on life. And no wonder. Verhoeven spent 
his childhood in wartime Holland, which was occupied by Nazi Germany and 
subjected to daily Allied bombing raids. 
</P>
<P>
His home, in The Hague, was just a mile away from the launching pads of 
Germany's deadly V-1 rockets. As a tot, Verhoeven watched the missiles blast 
off each night, zooming over the roof of his house, followed later in the 
evening by waves of American planes, swooping in to bomb German military 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember sitting with my parents at the dinner table when the bombs 
completely destroyed a building 20 yards from our house," said Verhoeven, whose 
mop of unkempt gray hair, faded work shirt and piercing gaze give him the air 
of a history professor on holiday. "It blew out all our windows and sent the 
glass shattering across the dinner table. It was just fate that nothing ever 
happened to me or my family." 
</P>
<P>
In a wartime childhood, fate offers strange twists. One day Verhoeven and his 
school chums were playing, scrambling on top of a neighborhood wall. Suddenly a 
vehicle full of German troops screeched to a halt. The soldiers leaped out, 
rifles drawn. 
</P>
<P>
"They came over and made us line up against the wall, as if we were prisoners," 
Verhoeven said softly. "They looked very serious. They cocked their guns and 
pretended to shoot us, like a firing squad. Then they just laughed and got into 
the jeep and drove away." 
</P>
<P>
Verhoeven views these events as more absurd than traumatic. "I saw horrible 
things," he said over lunch at the Columbia commissary. "You would walk out in 
the morning and see dead people on the street. I'm sure if I had lost a brother 
or had been Jewish, I would have had a different experience. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you're just a child, war is fascinating. When I saw John Boorman's 
film, 'Hope and Glory,' I was amazed, because I remembered the same things. 
When the bombs hit, we'd say, 'Great! School's out!' It was like that seeing 
the V-1. If you didn't know about the death they caused, they were the most 
exciting things you'd ever seen. It was like living in an amazing movie. That 
was my childhood -- surrounded by these incredible visual effects!" 
</P>
<P>
Verhoeven's barbed Dutch films won critical plaudits here, but in Holland he 
often found himself in disfavor. "The critics called me a decadent, perverted 
person who was not representative of Dutch culture," he said with a frown. "I 
got a really negative response on 'Spetters.' I tried to make a serious study 
of behavior, but people were outraged. They even created an anti-'Spetters' 
committee, which said the film was anti-feminist, anti-invalid and 
anti-homosexual." 
</P>
<P>
Finding it increasingly difficult to raise money for his films, Verhoeven moved 
to America. His first English-language film, "Flesh and Blood," was a flop. 
Soon afterwards, Verhoeven was offered "RoboCop" -- and turned it down. His 
wife finally persuaded him to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the brains of the family," he said with a sheepish grin. "I thought 
'RoboCop' was horrible when I first read it. I missed all the different levels 
in the script. But my wife remembered how much I liked 'Frankenstein' and she 
immediately saw that concept in the script -- the robot man seeking his own 
life -- so I changed my mind." 
</P>
<P>
The film revived old boyhood memories. "It's true -- I had a poster of Boris 
Karloff as Frankenstein's monster over my bed as a child," he recalled. "I also 
loved Edgar Rice Burroughs. I read all his Mars stories. I even got a telescope 
so I could look for Mars at night. And when I decided I wanted to be a 
comic-book illustrator, the first thing I did -- when I was still very little 
-- was write a book about Mars and space travel." 
</P>
<P>
"Total Recall" gives Verhoeven a chance to elaborate on these childhood 
reveries. Set a century into the future, it stars Schwarzenegger as a rugged 
construction worker haunted by dreams of a former life on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Having grown up in a nightmarish, war-torn world, Verhoeven identifies with 
"Total Recall's" disorienting odyssey of self-discovery. "It's not Dostoevsky," 
he said. "It's a thriller that's based on our childhood dreams and pleasures." 
</P>
<P>
The "Total Recall" script had been bouncing around Hollywood for years, but 
when Schwarzenegger convinced Carolco Pictures to acquire the rights for him, 
the project finally kicked into gear. As soon as Schwarzenegger saw "RoboCop," 
he knew he'd found his director. 
</P>
<P>
"I immediately called up (Carolco chief and "Total Recall" executive producer) 
Mario Kassar and said, 'This guy is really good,' " Schwarzenegger said. "I'd 
seen 'Soldier of Orange' and 'Turkish Delight,' but 'RoboCop' was the deciding 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul has a very provocative directing style. His movies have a lot of style 
and humor. And he knows exactly where to give scenes a light flavor to loosen 
up the intensity of the violence. I just showed a rough cut of 'Total Recall' 
to my mother, who doesn't even understand much English. But she loved it. She 
was laughing at all the right parts!" 
</P>
<P>
Schwarzenegger also stuck up for Verhoeven during production, making sure his 
director could operate without interference from nervous producers (who often 
worried about the film's abundance of violence). Verhoeven had nothing but 
kudos for his star. 
</P>
<P>
"Arnold has no ego," he said. "You can say anything to him. In fact, he sat me 
down at the very start and told me, 'I won't be offended if you talk to me in a 
direct way. Say what you feel.' I didn't have to be diplomatic and say, 
'Arnold, perhaps you could move over here and give me a different angle.' I 
could just go, 'Arnold, this is bad. You look stupid!' " 
</P>
<P>
Verhoeven acknowledged he sometimes lost his cool trying to keep the mammoth 
film on schedule. "I would get so frustrated that I would get upset and angry 
and I'm find myself yelling and screaming at people. I didn't feel I was losing 
control. But I was close to it. The movie was so complicated that I sometimes 
felt things were beyond my grasp." 
</P>
<P>
Verhoeven shrugged. "I got more input than the computer in my head could 
grasp." 
</P>
<P>
When Verhoeven would boil over, Schwarzenegger would step in. "I tried to 
remind him that problems happen on every picture -- that you can't get angry 
all the time. You have to laugh about it and move on." 
</P>
<P>
When crew members complained, Schwarzenegger played peacemaker. "I'd invite 
them into my trailer, give them a tumbler of schnapps and play them some 
Austrian music," he said. "That always got them to relax." 
</P>
<P>
Like "RoboCop," "Total Recall" is laced with gory, graphic and -- yes -- 
crowd-pleasing violence. "People always criticize violence, but as human beings 
we have genetically evolved from savage apes," said Verhoeven, calmly nibbling 
at a plate of pasta. "So we're in a quandary. Morally we realize it's wrong. 
But biologically we're still very close to it. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't promote violence by showing it. Human beings have done terrible 
cruel things to each other long before there were movies. The Germans didn't 
see any movies promoting genocide in the 1930s. But I understand why people get 
excited -- no one wants to accept that there are shadows inside all of us. 
People just prefer to say, 'The violence is in you, not in me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Verhoeven is one of the few movie directors who would see a theological link in 
this debate. "You have to remember that Christianity is a religion based on one 
of the most violent acts of murder -- the crucifixion. In fact, without the 
crucifixion I'd say the religion wouldn't have had so much impact." 
</P>
<P>
He nods his head. "In the end, drama is written for violence. It's built on 
what goes wrong. Give the human mind 50 minutes of quiet in the dark and 
everybody would be put to sleep. We need conflict and tension and violence. Or 
we want to take a nap!" 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder that Verhoeven shows little interest in returning to his native 
land. "I'm only nostalgic about Holland when I'm back there," he said, hurrying 
across the studio lot, eager to return to work. "Everything was in shades of 
gray. There was never something that was out of order, nothing to be angry 
about. 
</P>
<P>
"Here life seems more vital. There's so much more antagonism and excitement, so 
many possibilities. It makes me feel more alive. I feel more a part of the 
world here." 
</P>
<P>
Verhoeven stopped at the door to his mixing theater. "There's no better place 
for a filmmaker. Every day something happens here that makes you curious or 
outraged or fascinated. In Holland, I could only read the paper for five 
minutes before I'd be bored." 
</P>
<P>
Verhoeven spread his arms wide. "Here I can read the paper for hours!"
